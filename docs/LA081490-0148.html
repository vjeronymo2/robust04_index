			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET SCENE ;  </P> <P> SOVIET LOOKS TO THE PAST FOR CURE TO MARKET WOES;  </P> <P> IN CZARIST TIMES, COMMODITY EXCHANGES WERE THE CENTERPIECE OF THE RUSSIAN  ECONOMY. NOW, A MOSCOW BUSINESSMAN WANTS TO BRING THEM BACK TO COPE WITH THE  COLLAPSE OF THE STATE-CONTROLLED ECONOMY.  </P> <P> How many pounds of fresh meat does a new computer cost? How can Moscow's  collective farmers get videotape recorders, instead of almost worthless rubles,  for their vegetables? And where can a builder get plumbing fixtures when the  state supply agency has stopped selling them?  </P> <P> As the Soviet Union's economic breakdown accelerates, its state-managed,  centrally planned system is less and less able to meet the needs of either  producers or consumers, and the country is facing increasing economic paralysis  as products of all sorts no longer reach their intended users and the Soviet  ruble loses its value as a currency.  </P> <P> "The centralized system we have had for decades for planned production,  allocation and distribution has collapsed, simply collapsed," said Gennady M.  Poleshuk, a Soviet economist-turned-businessman. "The present situation is  extraordinary -- goods are still being produced, demand for them is still  present, but retail and wholesale outlets are virtually empty and consumer  frustration has long ago boiled up into anger."  </P> <P> The problem, simply put, is that the Soviet Union's transition from a planned  to a market economy is stalled. The old system, which had long ceased to  function effectively, is disintegrating much faster than its replacement is  developing.  </P> <P> "Markets must grow -- they cannot be planned or pre-structured," Poleshuk said.  "But they do not grow overnight, and they do need some nurturing. . . . We say  we want to develop a market economy, but where will the market come from? How  does it grow?"  </P> <P> Poleshuk's answer to that question is one of the boldest of the reforms now  under way here -- the establishment of a series of commodities exchanges,  trading marts where all sorts of goods, ranging from agricultural produce to  construction materials, from computers to consumer goods, can be bought and  sold at freely negotiated prices.  </P> <P> "We can cut through most of the theoretical debate and get to the core of the  problem by responding to the market," Poleshuk said in an interview. "The  market already exists, but it is hidden and rather savage and primitive.  </P> <P> "To cope with the collapse of the state-managed system, enterprises are already  exchanging products directly, sometimes by barter, sometimes at absolutely wild  commercial prices, sometimes for hard currency. We should move, as a step that  we can accomplish virtually today, to get this trade into the open as a basis  for a market economy."  </P> <P> Poleshuk, co-chairman of a planned Moscow Commodities Exchange and the director  of a Soviet-Yugoslav-Italian construction venture, said that perhaps as much as  15% of overall Soviet sales already take place outside state channels and that  this volume could quickly double and even treble as the government withdraws  from day-to-day management of the economy.  </P> <P> "Our plan is to use trade in three or four types of commodities to establish a  market where buyers and sellers know what the supply-and-demand situation is,  what the prices are and where they can deal," Poleshuk said. "In economic  terms, this is a very, very basic market, but we have to go back to where we  left off 70 years ago and reestablish what we had."  </P> <P> Commodities exchanges were at the center of the Russian economy as it began to  industrialize at the turn of the century; businessmen not only traded in  commodities there but raised investment funds through the sale of bonds and  shares in their enterprises.  </P> <P> More than 100 of the exchanges continued to operate under V. I. Lenin, the  founder of the Soviet state, after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But they were  closed by Josef Stalin with the establishment of centralized state planning and  management of the economy.  </P> <P> "Although no one remains who remembers exactly how they worked, we still have a  feeling of affinity for this type of economic organization," said Poleshuk, 36,  a research economist who came to Moscow three years ago with many other  reform-minded academics from Siberia. "A commodities exchange seems more  Russian, less foreign, and thus more acceptable. . . .  </P> <P> "We also expect that in its second phase it will have a department, which is  being organized by Moscow's new commercial banks, for trading in stocks, bonds  and other equities. This again is a Russian tradition -- keeping the capital  market within the commodities exchange and linking them directly."  </P> <P> The Moscow Commodities Exchange plans to open in borrowed quarters next month,  with sales of goods in four high-demand areas -- construction materials, metal  products, agricultural produce and high-tech goods, including computers and  audio-visual equipment.  </P> <P> Poleshuk projects that the turnover in the first year could be as high as 3  billion rubles, which would be the equivalent of $4.8 billion at official  exchange rates -- but about $200 million at the prevailing black market rate  for the ruble.  </P> <P> "Initially, we will be a place for buyers and sellers to meet and do business,"  Poleshuk said. "A person with, say, a shipment of wallpaper to sell will know  that on a certain day at a specified time there will be trading in building  materials, and he has a pretty good chance to find a customer and probably more  than just one customer.  </P> <P> "Our wallpaper manufacturer can then take other goods in exchange or sell for  rubles or for dollars. It all will depend on the buyer and the seller, what the  demand is like and what the supply is like. Such deals already take place in  scores of different ways and through an informal but active network, but we  want to assemble them in one place to create a critical mass that will gather  speed."  </P> <P> As volume grows, the exchange will probably develop some kind of currency, a  "commodity ruble," or accounting unit, to make it easier for meatpackers to buy  computers and for collective farmers to buy video recorders, which are now  among the most-prized possessions of a Soviet family.  </P> <P> "Three carloads of lumber might be exchanged initially for one computer or one  carload of meat," Poleshuk said, "so there is already a price exchange. We  might say 1,000 commodity rubles equals three carloads of lumber or one  computer or one carload of meat.  </P> <P> "As the deals multiply, realistic 'exchange rates' and prices will appear. We  need to go through the natural period of developing a market. This is an  economic reality, but I admit it's not Marxist."  </P> <P> Poleshuk said he expects that Soviet factories, under increasing pressure to  become profitable, will begin to sell off their large stockpiles of goods and  raw materials, often equivalent to a full year's production, in order to boost  their revenues.  </P> <P> The enterprises will also have an active, new market for additional production.  Although officially encouraged to produce more, few factories have, because  they often had no way to sell the goods outside state channels.  </P> <P> Poleshuk anticipates that cooperatively owned Soviet enterprises, which now  number in the thousands, will quickly turn to the exchange to buy materials  they cannot obtain from state agencies and to sell much more of their goods on  a wholesale basis.  </P> <P> "Enterprises are supposed to have been freed from the state bureaucracy, but in  fact they are still enmeshed in it because they have no real market where they  can buy and sell," Poleshuk said.  </P> <P> And he believes that the exchange will quickly establish market prices for many  products that currently sell for much more or much less than their real worth.  </P> <P> With the use of foreign currencies in some deals and direct foreign  participation possible, the exchange will also quickly establish the true value  of the Soviet ruble, which is pegged officially at $1.60 but is sold to  tourists at 16 cents each and can be bought on the black market for 5 or 6  cents.  </P> <P> "Freeing the prices of 10%, then 30% and then perhaps 45% of the total turnover  in the country will bring us into price reform," he said. "And price reform,  based on true costs and real demand, will be the great economic rationalizer."  </P> <P> The Moscow Commodity Exchange, a project of half a dozen diverse groups,  including the Moscow city government, the Soviet Assn. of Young Managers and  the Soviet Union of Construction and Industrial Cooperatives, is likely to be a  key participant in efforts by radical reformers to push development of a market  economy faster than the central government up to now has wanted.  </P> <P> Gavriil Popov, a leading advocate of the establishment of a market economy here  and the new mayor of Moscow, is providing the exchange with the political  patronage that will be necessary when it challenges the entrenched state  agencies that have long exercised total power over the manufacture,  distribution and sale of everything from shoelaces to steel.  </P> <P> The main problem the Moscow Commodities Exchange faces is a shortage of  experienced and talented personnel. Poleshuk said he hopes to recruit 35 to 40  people and to send most of them to exchanges in the West for training. He also  hopes to develop a brokerage system, opening his own brokerage in time.  </P> <P> "We have book knowledge of how this is all going to work, but we don't yet have  the habits and skills, the hands-on experience, that are needed to ensure its  success," he said.  </P> <P> The exchange will be financed by the 3 million rubles ($4.8 million at the  official exchange rate) invested by the founding groups, the sales of bonds to  investors and of memberships to enterprises wishing to participate, sales of  places to regular sellers and buyers, and from fees charged on the turnover and  collected from occasional participants.  </P> <P> "We expect this will be a highly profitable business," he said, "but we are  going to need a fair amount of capital to expand our activities and underwrite  the start of the stocks and bonds department."  </P> <P> Other exchanges are being organized in Leningrad, where trading will start in  the autumn in as many as 13 commodities, in the Ukrainian city of Lvov, where  the products will range from textiles and televisions to buses and loading  equipment, and in about 10 other Soviet cities.  </P> <P> Early next year, the central government plans to organize a Western-style  commodities exchange for grain sales and purchases. It will initially trade in  contracts for deliveries of wheat and barley, of which the Soviet Union is the  world's largest producer, and later of other grains.  </P> <P> "Development of commodity exchanges happened all over the world several  thousand years ago," Poleshuk said, "but we have to do it all over again in the  Soviet Union."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Market Morass: Comment and Cure  </P> <P> The CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency offered a bleak assessment of the  Soviet economy in an April, 1990, report to a Joint Economic Committee of  Congress. Some conclusions from the report:  </P> <P> " . . . Widespread breakdowns in the transportation and distribution networks  interfered with the delivery7 of all kinds of goods from producers to  consumers, causing goods to pile up in freignt cars and warehouses instead of  reaching store shelves."  </P> <P> "State enterprises . . . often found themselves scrambling to obtain whatever  supplies they could from a fledgling wholesale trade system that was not ready  for the burden."  </P> <P> "Last August a Soviet survey of state stores found that only 200 of 1,200  standard consumer goods were readily available; by the end of the year, the  number of readily available items fell to 50."  </P> <P> "Special distribution systems, notably food sales at workplaces, also helped  individuals with access to obtain scarce consumer goods. The rapid expansion of  these special channels, however, reduced the flow of goods to the general  public."  </P> <P> "Freign shipments by all carriers fell by 116 million tons last year, a 2% drop  from the previous year and one of the transport sector's worst annual  performances in decades . . . Nearly half of all the nation's railroads failed  to meet freight shipment targets."  </P></p>

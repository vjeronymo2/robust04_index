			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 19, RIA - Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said  that life would become better within six months after his advent  to power. He made this promise at the 7th conference of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which is being held on the eve  of the party's fifth congress scheduled for April 2. The LDP  leader is confident that if his party gained success at the  elections to the Duma, his manners and behaviour are quite right  and should not be changed.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called upon the LDP to get ready for  the presidential elections which, in his opinion, may take place  already this year. In his opinion, neither Shakhray, nor  Yavlinskiy, nor Sobchak will be able to harvest over 10 percent  of voices and Rutskoy, who "may get more", is also no  challenger. "Our party has real chances to be a success," said  the LDP leader.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy assured the participants in the  conference of no prospects for any split in the party or any  collective leadership. "We have undivided authority and, at the  same time, full democracy," said Zhirinovskiy.</p>

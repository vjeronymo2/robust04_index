			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Distinguished Brotherly Relations"] </F>   [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's recurrent  visits to Jordan and his meetings with his brother His Majesty  King Husayn reflect the distinguished brotherly relations and  mutual confidence between the two fraternal peoples. They also  underscore the importance of continuing coordination,  consultation, and cooperation between Jordan and the PLO.    President 'Arafat's working visit yesterday came in the wake  of important political developments regarding the various  aspects of the Palestine question. This situation necessitated  discussing these developments with the Jordanian leadership as  is customary in accordance with the firmly-established  traditions and characteristics marking the fraternal  Jordanian-Palestinian relations.    The two political leaderships and peoples are aware of the  need to intensify bilateral relations of coordination and  cooperation out of their awareness of the difficulties facing  the Palestinian action at this stage. These difficulties  require entrenching unity of the Arab fold and fostering  Jordanian-Palestinian relations in order to face the  developments of this stage.    No Arab country is more concerned with or affected by the  Palestine question than Jordan. Therefore, Jordan has always  given Palestine--land, cause, and people--constant attention and  sincere effort out of its eagerness to restore rights and lands  to their legitimate owners and rescue the shrines, headed by  holy Jerusalem, from impending dangers.    While watching the current developments of the Palestine  question and while witnessing a turning point in the efforts to  activate the first article of the Declaration of Principles, we,  along with the brothers in Palestine, look forward  optimistically to the day, which we hope is imminent, when the  occupation ends and our brothers regain their freedom and right  to self-determination.</p>

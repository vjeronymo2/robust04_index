			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa has canceled a planned visit to the United States this  weekend for bilateral "framework" trade talks with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry  official said Thursday [23 June].    The cancellation was decided because the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) submitted a no-confidence motion  earlier in the day to the House of Representatives against the  cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the official said.    If the lower house approves the motion, Hata must either  resign with his entire cabinet or dissolve the house for a  general election.    "Under the circumstances, it is not appropriate for the  foreign minister, who is a member of the cabinet, to go to the  U.S. and negotiate," the official said.    Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss macroeconomic and  sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa.    On Tuesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said  Kakizawa's visit to the U.S. has yet to be fixed because of  uncertainties in Japan's political community.    Kakizawa was to leave Japan on Friday and return to Tokyo on  Monday.    Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an  agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade  framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)  industrial nations in July.    Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the  chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is  pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress  in market- opening.    But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead  to  managed trade.</p>

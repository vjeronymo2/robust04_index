			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: East Midlands advances 23% - Electricity group opposes one-year, coal-fired power deal EAST MIDLANDS Electricity yesterday reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.3m for the six months ended September 30. At the same time East Midlands voiced opposition to a one-year, coal-fired power deal between electricity generators and the regional companies. Mr John Harris, chairman of the company, which is leading heads of agreement talks with PowerGen and National Power, said he preferred five-year contracts because they would provide more stability for the coal and electricity industries. A one-year deal would not provide assurances of falling prices in later years as would a five-year agreement. Mr Harris's comments follow suggestions by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, that a one-year deal could be concluded, although he also said any review should not prejudice the outcome of the white paper. Mr Harris also said he was opposed to postponing the liberalisation of the electricity market from 1994 if that led to higher prices for customers. Turnover for the opening half year rose to Pounds 681.5m (Pounds 658.1m). The interim dividend is stepped up to 5.72p, a 12 per cent increase on last time's 5.1p. Earnings per share emerged at 10.1p (8.2p). Losses in the supply business were reduced from Pounds 35m to Pounds 20m, in part because of the recovery of uplift charges from last year but also as a result of customers taking contracts with a smaller price difference between winter and summer. Distribution profits, made on steady volumes, were down Pounds 4m to Pounds 60m and retail, which is being restructured as a result of the joint venture with Yorkshire Electricity, lost Pounds 600,000, against a Pounds 600,000 profit in the comparable period a year earlier. Mr Harris said retailing was profitable in the second quarter, however, and that there would be a small operating profit in the full year. Six small shops are to be closed by next March leaving 65. Contracting would incur a loss this year although in line with other recs East Midlands would soon feel the benefit of changed terms and conditions of contracting employees, the numbers of which have been reduced from 800 to 600. COMMENT The beauty of electricity for investors is that it combines safety with a strong dividend flow. The market's perception of East Midlands is that it is less safe than other recs and as a result the dividend yield is among highest in the sector. The company concerns critics through its individualistic stance. Mr Harris's propensity to stand up and be counted, as demonstrated by his comments on the one-year deal yesterday, matter less than the declared aim of seeking 30 per cent of profits outside of the regulated business by the year 2000 and the possibility that it will participate, albeit in a small way, with the Union of Democratic Workers in a bid for a part of British Coal. There appears little wrong with the non-core business but until it performs outstandingly East Midlands' shares, on a prospective yield of 6.3 per cent assuming a full year dividend of 19.15p, will struggle to catch up with other recs.</p>

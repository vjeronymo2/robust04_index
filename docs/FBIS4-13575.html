			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Seize The Moment in Kashmir"] </F>   [Text] Dr. Karan Singh's call for initiating the process  of reconciliation in Kashmir merits serious consideration. The  time is propitious. The security forces have made important  gains in the recent past and the militant groups have been  pushed onto the defensive. Beginning the process of  reconciliation assumes greater importance if the Government  wants to go ahead with its plans for an early election in the  Valley. Though neither their firepower nor their ability to  strike has diminished greatly, the militants have now begun to  talk in terms of not just Kashmiri Muslims but the entire  community. This is a definite signal and the Jammu and Kashmir  Liberation Front chief, Mr. Bashir Ahmad Bhat's observations  about inducting non-Muslims into the Kashmiri struggle are a  case in point. The Hurriyat leaders are in Delhi on a prolonged  mission to test the mainstream waters.    The contours of the reconciliation will of course have to be  traced with care. It need not be the much talked about  "package" of economic goodies that is better left to a popular  Government which emerges out of the polls. But if the gains  made in the Valley have to be consolidated, the psychological  moment has to seized. The fatigue induced by the bloodshed in  the Valley is showing. The anger of the people with the Indian  political and security establishment is, no doubt unabated. But  Pakistan's misadventure at the UN Human Rights Conference at  Geneva may have opened the eyes of Kashmiris to the real nature  of Pakistan's interest in prolonging their agony. At the same  time, there are indications that the strain of living under the  gun for five long years has begun to tell. To that extent, the  policy of firmness may have paid off, but to pursue it to the  exclusion of a political and psychological initiative will be  counter-productive.    What is urgently needed is a willingness on part of the  Government to think of an amnesty for those incarcerated  militants against whom there are no specific charges. Excesses  by security forces have to be accounted for. Interaction  between the administration and the people has to be tempered  with greater sensitivity. Such generosity will send a positive  signal and create an atmosphere of goodwill which, in the  fullness of time can translate itself into conditions conducive  for a democratic exercise of people's will. Dr. Karan Singh has  also called for setting up a separate ministry for Kashmiri  affairs, apparently in reference to the multiplicity and  divergence of approaches in the Union Home Ministry. Going by  past experience, ministries such as the Mr. S.B Chavan's Home  Ministry, do not solve problems. They are the problem.</p>

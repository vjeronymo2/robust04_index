			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BOOKS: Whether a tourist chooses Orange County this summer could depend on  which guidebook he buys. . . . "Los Angeles Access" describes the county as "an  earthly paradise of temperate climate, a shoreline of alternating smooth sandy  beaches with majestic rocky promontories, green canyons, rolling hills and a  feeling of suspended time." . . . But the "Let's Go" book blasts the county as  "an immense grid" filled with "cookie-cutter copies: gas stations on every  corner, supermarkets on every block, and other necessities of life provided at  more malls, plazas, squares, centers and markets than any real city could  handle."

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'BEAUTY SHOP' TAKES ON A 'NEW ATTITUDE'  </P> <P> That bastion of female clubbiness, the beauty parlor, is the setting for a new  sitcom, "New Attitude," premiering on ABC at 9:30 tonight (Channels 7, 3, 10  and 42).  </P> <P> This is an upscale, black beauty shop run with panache by two sisters, (the  chic, sensible Sheryl Lee Ralph and the brassy, mischievous Phyllis Yvonne  Stickney).  </P> <P> Morris Day, a beautician called Lamarr, "the prince of perm," is also a  regular, albeit looking a bit wan in this henhouse where sexual innuendo and  Oprah Winfrey's diet top the conversation.  </P> <P> The pilot episode airing tonight (followed by the first of eight regularly  scheduled shows premiering Friday) is encumbered by an inane plot about a  lawsuit from a customer who claims her hair turned green after a visit to the  salon. We don't see the plaintiff, only her attorney (lame guest star Clark  Johnson), who's ogled by the chicks under the rinse.  </P> <P> The production's only hope evident here is the flavor and sass of co-stars  Ralph (who was one of the original Broadway "Dreamgirls") and the turbaned  Stickney, a Whoopi Goldberg-ish character with a meaner streak.  </P> <P> Director Oz Scott keeps the New Attitude shop's scented captives moving to the  show's upbeat musical theme: "I'm wearing a new dress and a new hat . . . I  know where I'm going and what to do." The screen, with video bravado, fills  with lascivious close-ups of wet lips. New Attitude, indeed.  </P> <P> The best title -- and certainly funnier show -- is the outrageously blunt  "Beauty Shop," the current play at the Pantages Theater, which Castle Rock  Entertainment bought, sanitized and turned into this series. Tonight's episode  has a quartet of writing credits (Jack Elinson, Maiya Williams, Tom Straw and  Ralph Farguhar).RAY LOYND  </P></p>

The proposed rule for Amendment 5 was published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57774); a final rule is expected to be effective on March 1, 1994, and published before that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of the ASMFC Winter Flounder Board, the Council will discuss and accept public comment on a proposal to limit the winter flounder component of the 500-pound (226.8 kg) groundfish possession to 100 pounds (45.3 kg). The final rule discussed above, when implemented, will allow vessels to keep up to 500 pounds (226.8 kg), combined weight, of the 10 large-mesh groundfish species while fishing with mesh smaller than the regulated minimum size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ASMFC is concerned that a 500-pound (226.8 kg) limit is an incentive to target winter flounder with small mesh that may result in the discarding of unacceptable numbers of winter flounder that are under the currently legal minimum fish size of 12 inches (30.48 cm). The ASMFC is urging the Council to take this action to protect a moderately strong 1992 year class of winter flounder, which will be susceptible to the small-mesh fishing gear before reaching the minimum legal size. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Adjustment of Closure of Area I To Gillnetting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council will also consider an adjustment to the closure of Area I to gillnetting in the Multispecies FMP under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking contained in the proposed rule published on October 27, 1993. At the request of a number of sink gillnet fishermen, the Council will discuss and take public comment on a proposal to shift the time of the closure of Area I to gillnetting. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the Multispecies FMP will open Area I to all fishing gear types except sink gillnets. Unless modified by a framework measure, gillnetting will be prohibited from February through May. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council proposed to open Area I to all gears except sink gillnets because haddock spawning has not been observed in the area in recent years. At the recommendation of the NMFS Regional Director, the Council proposed retaining the closure of Area I to gillnetting because of the potential interaction with endangered whales, which are known to feed in the area during the spring. The February through May closure period was originally set to protect aggregations of spawning haddock and does not coincide with the observed presence of the whales, which the gillnetting closure is intended to protect. The Council proposes to begin the closure of Area I in the middle of March and extend it to the middle of July. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Time/Area Closures To Reduce the Take of Harbor Porpoise in the Gulf of Maine Sink Gillnet Fishery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the request of the NMFS and the Council's Marine Mammal and Endangered Species Committee, the Council has developed proposals to reduce the take of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of implementation of the Northeast Multispecies FMP to a level not to exceed 2 percent of the porpoise population, based on the best available estimates of abundance and catch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking (50 CFR 651.40, to be published in March 1994) the Council has requested its Harbor Porpoise Review Team (HPRT) to evaluate ``reduction of take measures'' for the harbor porpoise bycatch in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery. Those measures, which include closures in the Gulf of Maine by area and time, any recommendations made by the HPRT, and public comments, will be discussed at the February 16 and 17 Council meeting in order to initiate the framework process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the February 16&hyph;17 Council meeting, the Council will determine whether the requested adjustment to the regulations for sea scallops and groundfish are necessary and will initiate a public comment period. The Council staff will analyze the proposals and announce the availability of analysis documents prior to the second Council meeting (April 6&hyph;7, 1994). The public will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal(s) prior to and at the April Council meeting. After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council will make a recommendation to the Regional Director. The Regional Director may publish the action as a final rule or as a proposed rule, as described in &sect;651.40. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard H.

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Sweet and sour flow from British Steel: Good results may be mixed with a tirade against subsidies If tradition is anything to go by, British Steel's half-year results today will be accompanied by a molten flow of rhetoric from Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, on the iniquity of subsidies to rival European Union producers. Less than a week after the partial withdrawal of the European Commission's rescue plan for the industry, Mr Moffat is likely to warn that the failure to achieve required cuts in EU overcapacity, and to tackle the subsidies issue adequately, will only store up problems for the next downturn. The company's irritation, however, contrasts strikingly with the gleaming numbers it is likely to produce today. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 130m-Pounds 150m for the half-year to the end of September, up from Pounds 27m a year ago. This would put the company on course for expected full-year profits of Pounds 400m-Pounds 425m, dwarfing last year's Pounds 80m, which included a Pounds 24m provision for an EU fine. And this from a company which had combined losses of Pounds 204m in the two previous years. British Steel has been consistently critical of subsidies in Europe because it wants a level playing field in an important market. In 1993-94, EU countries excluding the UK accounted for Pounds 1.03bn of its Pounds 4.19bn of sales. But, in the short term at least, market conditions have made the ill-fated EU rescue plan almost irrelevant. An upturn in demand that began in the UK last year and has since spread to the continent, along with supply shortages, has transformed the trading environment. In sterling terms, prices for strip products are back up to 1989 levels, and nearly there for sections and plates, says Mr Euan Fraser at James Capel. Price rises will be 'overwhelmingly the most important' factor in the results today, he says. The results will provide an important indicator of how quickly British Steel's profit and loss account is benefiting from the price rises. Contracts with big customers are fixed annually, which complicates any forecast. But Mr Tim Bennett at Albert E. Sharp, the Birmingham-based brokers, says half-year profits above Pounds 130m could make his full-year forecast of Pounds 425m - already revised upwards from Pounds 320m - look conservative. Mr Fraser believes there is scope for British Steel to raise prices further. Other positive factors are lower raw material costs and interest charges, and a much better performance from associated companies, especially Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer. In September, British Steel raised its stake in Avesta from 40 to 49.9 per cent. British Steel could easily make Pounds 650m in 1995-96 and Pounds 900m in the following year, says Mr Fraser at James Capel. He warns, however, that 'once you look that far out it is guesswork'. It is in the later 1990s, when the next dip in a historically cyclical steel market may be expected, that the failure of the EU's rescue plan could become more relevant to British Steel and its ambitions in Europe. In evidence to the House of Commons trade and industry committee earlier this month, the company said the outcome of the EU restructuring plan had brought it minimal benefits. The required shake-out of excess steel capacity in the EU, which would have taken place in the recession under free market conditions, had not occurred, it said. 'The fundamental overcapacity will still be there at the next downturn,' it added, 'putting a number of producers which have benefited from subsidies/debt forgiveness in a considerably stronger position.' In a falling market British Steel is unlikely to find it any easier to make profits in Europe than it does now. It places the blame on subsidies, and the significant level of state ownership in the industry. In only two of the last 20 years, it says, have the EU producers earned a level of operating profit adequate to ensure long-term viability - 13 per cent of turnover according to the commission (see table). This scenario explains why, in recent months, British Steel's more confident post-recession stance on investment has been mainly directed towards projects outside Europe, where profits long-term are likely to be higher. The most important was the Dollars 154m investment, announced last month, to build a plate mini-mill at the Tuscaloosa Steel subsidiary in Alabama, but expansion in the Far East is also continuing. In contrast British Steel's European investments, such as the Pounds 85m being spent on increasing its Avesta Sheffield stake, are likely to remain highly selective.</p>

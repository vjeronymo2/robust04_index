These counties are situated in the Yonbaek plain on the west  coast, one of the nation's granaries.    Comrade Kim Chong-il gave on-the-spot guidance to the plain  several times to clearly indicate the direction and ways of  improving the people's living standard and increasing  agricultural production, and this time sent many tractors and  lorries to the rural communities there so as to follow up the  achievements made in the rural technical revolution.    The tractors and lorries sent by Comrade Kim Chong-il were  conveyed to the counties with due ceremonies on March 17.    The speakers there said that the Yonbaek plain under the  wise  guidance and deep loving care of our party has turned into a  modern socialist countryside good to live and work in and a  place holding a big share in the nation's production of grain.

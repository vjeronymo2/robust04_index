			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos  strongly attacked Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's  government from the parliament's official podium. Galanos  accused the Papandreou government of impolitic actions and lack  of sensitivity toward the government and people of Cyprus.    Despite his efforts to maintain diplomatic protocol, Galanos  did not refrain from using very strong language to describe the  way the Greek government action in canceling the Cypriot  National Council meeting with the prime minister in Athens and  for recalling National Guard Commander Lieutenant General  Yeoryios Siradhakis.    "I would like to express my personal discontent with the  fact  that the Papandreou government, which raised the morale of our  people by elevating the Cyprus issue as a national priority, did  not show the necessary sensitivity toward our government and  people in these two cases, which were, at the least,  unfortunate," said Galanos in his address during the debate on  the 1994 state budgets. Galanos explained that the two  incidents to which he referred include the last minute  cancellation of the National Council's visit to Greece and the  impolitic firing of Lt. Gen. Siradhakis, especially considering  the way it was done, despite the Greek prime minister's  assurances and commitment to President Glavkos Kliridhis.  [passage omitted]</p>

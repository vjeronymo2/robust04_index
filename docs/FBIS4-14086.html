			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday [26 April] praised the nation for its  readiness to assist Bosnian Muslims and said the Islamic  Republic of Iran was the first country to extend practical  support to Bosnian Muslims.    Speaking to a group of workers gathered in front of the  Majlis to announce readiness to defend Bosnian Muslims,  Nateq-Nuri stated that Majlis deputies, in compliance with the  supreme leader's call, are also prepared to give any assistance  to the Bosnian Muslims.    He criticized the arrogant powers for their aid to the Serbs  and the United Nations for its silence toward the crimes being  committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nateq-Nuri  expressed hope that the Bosnian Muslims who are resisting with  empty hands against the armed-to-the-teeth aggressor Serbs will  be victorious and will bring disgrace to the UN and to those who  backed the aggressors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- The Japanese Government expects to  conclude by March this year outline agreements with three  republics of the former Soviet Union, excluding Russia, on  assistance in scrapping the nuclear weapons they have inherited  after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ITAR-TASS  correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign  Ministry.    In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the  Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting  talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share  each of the three republics is to receive of the $100 million  Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the  scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive  waste.    The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward  facilitating  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at  military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and  toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific  programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese  specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste  depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local  staff.    Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting  outline  agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have  recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to  the Nuclear Arms Nonproliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has  guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its  territory.</p>

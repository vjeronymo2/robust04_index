			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SE looks at Rossmont offer The Stock Exchange is making inquiries into the publication of a tender offer for shares in Rossmont, the quoted toilet maker, through the pages of two UK national newspapers. Berjaya Group (Cayman), owned by an aggressive Malaysian conglomerate of the same name, announced in the Financial Times and the Daily Telegraph that it was offering 13 1/2 p per share for up to 29.9 per cent of the company. Rossmont, floated last year, has recommended the offer. It has also agreed to issue shares to Berjaya at 13 1/2 p to make up any shortfall on the 29.9 per cent. Berjaya does not have to tell the Stock Exchange of its tender offer. Rossmont, however, is required to announce the subscription proposals. In the event, an announcement was not made until 10am. The Stock Exchange is discussing the situation with brokers Keith Bayley Rogers. Mr Howard Drummon, of Keith Bayley said Rossmont believed the Berjaya offer was in shareholders' interests, even at a discount to last night's close of 14 1/2 p. 'If the company does not come in, there may be a difficulty in maintaining this price,' Mr Drummon said.</p>

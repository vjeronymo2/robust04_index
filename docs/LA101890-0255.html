			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TV TIP SNARES EX-BUNNY CONVICT  </P> <P> The "tabloid TV" notoriety of a former Playboy bunny waitress and policewoman  convicted of murdering her former husband's ex-wife helped lead to her capture  three months after she escaped from prison.  </P> <P> Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenek, 31, was arrested at an apartment in Thunder Bay,  Ontario, on Wednesday on a tip from a California viewer of last week's episode  of "America's Most Wanted" who said she had waited on him.  </P> <P> Bembenek, who has steadfastly professed her innocence, was captured with her  fiance, Dominic Gugliatto, 34.  </P> <P> Her flight had thrilled supporters in Milwaukee -- prompting sales of T-shirts  that read, "Run, Bambi, Run" -- and was covered on several TV shows, which  played up the romantic elements of the escape.  </P> <P> Bembenek supporters say she may have been the victim of a frame-up over her  knowledge of questionable police activities.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A process authority could be a private individual, a member  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of academia, or an agency of government. Processors can find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competent process authorities through their trade associations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local Sea Grant extension offices, or State universities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedures that are used in establishing a cooking or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization process should be generally recognized and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted. Such procedures may include thermal death time, heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penetration, and inoculated pack studies, as necessary, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the minimum process necessary to destroy pathogens. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases where the cooking process or pasteurization process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized and not unique to a specific processor, articles in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> journals; Federal, State, or local regulations and guidelines; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other appropriate vehicles could provide process parameters (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52). Whatever the source, processors must retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation from the process authority that the process will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective as part of their HACCP records, in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.8(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process established by a process authority should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include values for those aspects of the process that can affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the destruction of pathogens. The most notable of these are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooking times and temperatures. Others may include the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal temperature of the cooking medium before the cooking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product size and species, and the viscosity of formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products such as soups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is already aware that the cooking processes necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create a marketable product for several types of cooked, ready- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to-eat products are many times more lethal than necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inactivate pathogens (Ref. 114). The products are the several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of crabs listed in the guidelines at proposed Appendix A,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 4.a.4. FDA has tentatively concluded that, for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, the adequacy of both the cooking process and cooking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment can be assumed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is likely that other products could be added to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list. The agency invites comments on this point. Comments should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be accompanied by data that will enable the agency to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the minimum cooking process necessary to achieve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketable product, e.g., heat penetration data and data on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of cooking processes (times and temperatures) applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that product, will produce a safe product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same general principles also apply to the design of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooking and pasteurization equipment. It is necessary that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment be designed and operated so that every unit of product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives the established minimum cooking or pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process proposed (Appendix A, section 4. a.2. and b.2.) (Ref. 85).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recommends that the equipment be evaluated for design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation by a process authority who is familiar with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamics of temperature distribution in processing equipment. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some instances, temperature distribution studies may be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing literature should be sufficient. Processors must obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and retain documentation that the equipment will provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum process as part of their HACCP records in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Container Integrity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed guidelines advise in Appendix A, section 3. c.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and d. that HACCP plans prepared in accordance with part 123,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart A will normally identify finished product container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sealing for pasteurized products and postpasteurizing cooling as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points. Contamination with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> type E  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the postpasteurization cooling step is a special food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety hazard that must be controlled for pasteurized products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two potential causes of recontamination are poor container seams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and contaminated cooling water. Consequently, the guidelines, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A, section 5, recommend controls that processors can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilize that are likely to meet the requirements of subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A, section 5.a. advises processors how to inspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finished product containers of pasteurized products for container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity to ensure a consistently reliable hermetic seal. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Appendix A, section 5.b., the guidelines advise about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing for the presence of sanitizer in cooling water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seam inspections should determine whether the seams conform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the manufacturer's guidelines. Additionally, because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations from seaming head to seaming head, from closing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machine to closing machine, and over time for any one machine or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> head, FDA recommends that processors conduct inspections for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machine and head at least every 4 hours. Visual seam inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not adequate to fully assess the integrity of the seam.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Physical testing and, in the case of double seams, seam teardown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and measurement, are necessary parts of the inspection, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presently required for low acid canned foods in part 113.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The presence of sanitizer in cooling water provides a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control for the risk of microbiologically contaminated water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being drawn into the can. A vacuum created by a collapse in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooling vat of the steam head in the container, generated during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heating step, can draw in a minute amount of cooling water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and any pathogens contained in that cooling water. Seams are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a particularly stressed condition at that time. Sanitizer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strength levels should be checked periodically because there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tendency for variation in strength to occur, particularly in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> batch-type systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

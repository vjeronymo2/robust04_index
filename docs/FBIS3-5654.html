			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the plenary sessions of both the House of  Representatives and the House of Councillors on 7 and 8 March,  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was asked about the issue of  setting numerical targets to reduce Japan's current account  surplus, which is a focal issue in trade friction between Japan  and the United States. He answered: "It is inappropriate to  set specific numerical targets."    Commenting on this at a news conference on the evening of 8  March, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said: "The  prime minister and I share the same view that setting numerical  targets is very difficult. However, it is unnecessary to assert  that it will never happen (for Japan to set numerical targets).  Mr. Hosokawa has not yet made a final decision." Takemura then  added: "Current account surplus bears more uncertain factors  than any other economic indexes. At least, Japan should not set  numerical targets as a pledge to the international community and  make a commitment to the United States."    Takemura's remark indicates that although Japan should never  commit to Washington about setting numerical targets to reduce  its current account surplus, it is possible that it will  voluntarily set targets for reducing the surplus.</p>

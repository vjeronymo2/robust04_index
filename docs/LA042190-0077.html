			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGE OF NETWORKS FOR BASEBALL COVERAGE HAS FAN APPRECIATION  </P> <P> Thumbs down to CBS' postgame show hosted by Keith Olbermann. This newly  installed drab of a half-hour is the quintessence of CBS baseball: Boooring!  Olbermann's rehash of the game just seen and his so-called humor makes for the  worst half-hour of sports on TV. Come on, CBS, give us something worth  watching.  </P> <P> JASON INSALACO, Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Singapore company gives new twist to BS A Singapore company is understood to be interested in buying the Kerman family interests in BS Group, the property and leisure group formerly known as Bristol Scotts. It is the latest twist in a long power struggle at the Bristol-based company which led to the removal of Mr Anthony Kerman as chairman in August. Mr Kerman, who remains a director, and other family members, control a quarter of the share capital. The ownership of a further 11.5 per cent is the subject of a legal dispute. BS, which incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073 in 1993, said yesterday it had been told by the Stock Exchange a 'third party has made approaches to certain shareholders as a result of which there could be a change in ownership of the Kerman family's undisputed interest'. The company said the non-Kerman members of the board, and the company's advisers, Singer &amp; Friedlander, were contacting the Kerman family 'with a view to discussing this disposal in the best interests of all the shareholders'. No response had yet been made by the Kerman family. Sir Ian Rankin, who replaced Mr Kerman as chairman, said he understood the approach had been made by a property-orientated company listed on the Singapore stock exchange. While he wished to see the Kermans' holding reduced and the share ownership expanded, he would not welcome the Singapore group taking too large a stake in case that deterred institutional investors. Sir Ian, who through a Jersey trust has an 8 per cent holding, added: 'If the Kermans were thinking of the rest of the shareholders, they would understand why we and the other directors wish for a wider shareholding.' Mr Anthony Kerman did not comment yesterday. The shares closed at 188p, up 13p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bosnia was one of the main topics discussed at the  National Assembly this afternoon. UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali was the guest of the Assembly's Foreign Affairs  Commission and of the Commission chairman, Valery Giscard  d'Estaing. Luc Lemonnier asked the UN secretary general who  would give the go-ahead should NATO army officials ask for  permission to use artillery or air strikes against Serbian guns  in Bosnia. Butrus Butrus-Ghali's answer was as follows:    [Begin Butrus-Ghali recording] It is not for the generals to  ask me for permission, it is for the secretary general's special  representative, who is responsible for three distinct  operations. The first is the military operation, the second is  the humanitarian operation -- we look after 2 million refugees  -- and the third corresponds to the negotiations which are  currently under way in Geneva, or which may take place in Bonn  over the next few days. Everything is contingent upon these  three elements.    If the secretary general's special representative asks, I  will be only too pleased to accept this request. The political  power belongs to the Security Council, which gives a mandate.  The Security Council may give a mandate to NATO, just as it may  not give any mandate. The decision lies with the Security  Council, i,e., the 15 members of the Security Council; i.e., the  five permanent members who have a right of veto. They are the  ones who will decide.

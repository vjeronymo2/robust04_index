			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pressure on Canada to make cuts Sir, We applaud you for your editorial 'Canada's debt dilemma' (October 25), which points out that Canada must run a primary budget surplus of 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product before its debt can begin to stabilise. Canada's federal and provincial debt totals 100 per cent of GDP and to keep this from increasing, a budget surplus is now required, even assuming economic growth of 4.5 per cent. What most taxpayers here fail to understand is that very large spending cuts are required now - not tax increases. In a free country, if taxes are increased, there will be a flight of capital from Canada's high tax regime. Canadians hope our prime minister and his cabinet have read and taken heed of your fine editorial - and do not increase taxes. R L and S Sillcox, RR 3, King City, Ontario, Canada LOG 1KO</p>

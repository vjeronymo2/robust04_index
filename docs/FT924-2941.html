			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Technology: Intelligent piglets survive under pressure - Andrew Baxter reports on British Gas's latest inspection system There is a classic episode in the James Bond film The Living Daylights where a defecting Soviet general is bundled into a pointy-nosed little vehicle and sent hurtling through a large-bore pipeline to the west. Much the same sort of experience can be had in real life, but only by 'intelligent pigs'. These are the machines developed over the past decade by British Gas for checking the integrity of gas transmission pipes. Intelligent pigs combine sophisticated mechanical engineering and software expertise with 'magnetic flux leakage' technology - distortions in lines of magnetic force from a huge magnet are measured to indicate any metal loss from the pipe. The pigs have given British Gas a worldwide reputation as a leader in pipeline inspection systems. Now, from the British Gas Engineering Research Station near Newcastle, comes the intelligent piglet. The bigger pigs were developed so that British Gas could inspect its 17,000km of high-pressure transmission pipelines without shutting them down. The gas pressure pushes the pig through the pipe for several hundred kilometres while it collects the data on the state of the pipeline walls. The pipeline diameter can be as large as 48 inches. The piglets, meanwhile, are aimed at the 230,000km British Gas distribution network. The machines can be used in six-inch, eight-inch and 12-inch mains pipes made of cast iron or the newer, tougher ductile iron. Together, these account for 62 per cent of the network. Distribution mains give the piglet a bumpier ride, with more bends, valves, joints and service connections, so the machine has to be extra tough, with refinements in the joints to ease it round the bends. Unlike its bigger forbears, the piglet has to be winched through up to 400 metres of pipework in one journey - there is not enough gas pressure to push it through. The winch rope is made of Kevlar - steel rope would damage the pipe as it pulls the pig round a bend. An umbilical cord at the rear end provides power for the electromagnet and sends back data for computer analysis. The first piglet has been running with North West Gas for the past year, but British Gas plans to use them more widely from next year. This will help the company work out a replacement policy for its ductile iron pipes, first introduced in the mid-1960s. But the so-called Ductile Iron Magnetic Pig can be adapted for the less uniform magnetic characteristics of cast iron. Gerald Clerehugh, group director of research and technology, sees a wide market for the product outside the gas industry, for example in welded steel pipes used in refineries. Scientists at Newcastle are continuing work on the piglet so that it can work under 'live' conditions - with the gas still turned on. Rival US and Japanese systems are being developed for distribution pipes but, according to Clerehugh, 'nobody has yet matched the intelligent pig on quality'.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE ISN'T WORKING AT SANTA ANITA NOW, BUT JIMMY KILROE'S PRESENCE STILL FELT  </P> <P> A few years ago, Frank (Jimmy) Kilroe was asked for his opinion on dosage, that  arcane analysis of bloodlines that is supposed to be an indicator of how the  Kentucky Derby will turn out.  </P> <P> "Figures lie and liars figure," Kilroe said.  </P> <P> When Leon Rasmussen, then the bloodlines columnist for the Daily Racing Form  and one of the foremost exponents of dosage, heard about Kilroe's succinct  appraisal, he was crestfallen.  </P> <P> "Did Jimmy really say that?" said Rasmussen, who appeared to be on the verge of  tears.  </P> <P> Whether popular or not, Kilroe's astute opinions always carried weight, as much  weight as the considerable poundage he piled on the top horses for five  decades, from New York to California, while working as the head of racing  departments at most of America's major race tracks. Racing is poorer now that  Kilroe, who suffered a stroke in April 1989, has retired from Santa Anita and  won't be giving those incisive, decisive opinions on a daily basis anymore.  </P> <P> Kilroe, who recently celebrated his 78th birthday, went through the  executive-suite titles during his 40 years at Santa Anita -- assistant racing  secretary, handicapper, racing secretary, director of racing, vice president,  senior vice president. But he remained the same guy who walked through Webb  Everett's door in 1950 and quickly shocked the Eastern racing Establishment,  which thought that a big race out West might still be the cowboys against the  Indians.  </P> <P> "Jimmy dealt with grooms and hotwalkers the same way he dealt with the  wealthiest of (horse) owners," said Tommy Robbins, Kilroe's successor at Santa  Anita. "No matter who they were, he made everybody feel that they had a chance  in this game."  </P> <P> The son of a New York physician who became president of the old Jamaica track,  Kilroe seemed bred and destined to spend the rest of his life at tracks back  there. When Kilroe's move to the West Coast became permanent toward the end of  the 1950s, his colleagues, the late Francis Dunne in particular, asked  repeatedly how he could forsake New York.  </P> <P> "In those days, New York was the national leader in both quality horses and  purse money," said Tommy Trotter, who was Kilroe's successor in New York.  "California was running a distant second. But Jimmy, as usual, was showing his  tremendous foresight. He had the feeling that California was on the verge of  some tremendous growth and he was very instrumental in that (racing) growth."  </P> <P> Now, Santa Anita's crowds double the average daily turnout at Belmont Park, and  California's three major tracks -- Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar --  have used a successful off-track betting system that far outdistances the New  York tracks in mutuel handle.  </P> <P> Kilroe has worked them all in the Southland, but he's most identified with  Santa Anita. "Jimmy Kilroe is the linchpin of Santa Anita's greatness," said  Lou Eilken, who worked alongside Kilroe in several racing offices.  </P> <P> The Kilroe touch in administration, as soft and effective as Bill Shoemaker's  was in the saddle, is best described by Eilken.  </P> <P> "He was the ultimate diplomat," Eilken said. "He never took a position where he  made himself vulnerable. He had the finesse of a secretary of state."  </P> <P> Known for taking the long, pragmatic view of the game -- 12 years ago, long  before virtually every track in the country was offering exactas and trifectas  by the bushel, he warned the sport about the evils of the exotic wagers --  Kilroe could act with compelling swiftness when he had to.  </P> <P> Once, during Dr. Charles Strub's regime at Santa Anita, the track faced a  crisis near the end of a racing day. In the next-to-last race, the starting  gate collapsed into the inner rail as it was being taken off the track. It  protruded onto the main track, presenting an immovable hazard for horses and  jockeys that might be going in the last race.  </P> <P> Kilroe reached for the phone and suggested to Strub that the last race, which  was to be run on dirt, be moved to the grass if the horsemen would approve.  Strub thought that was a good idea, and Kilroe ran down to the paddock and  persuaded most of the trainers to run their horses on grass. From a standing  start, without a gate, the race was run.  </P> <P> In 1978, Kilroe told racing that while the proliferation of exactas and  trifectas might be good for the bottom line, such big-payoff bets would imperil  the integrity of the sport.  </P> <P> "The trifecta is the motivation for 90% of the scandals that have hit our  sport," Kilroe said. "It's a lure for guys in search of sudden wealth. It's an  invitation to steal in a country where the pursuit of happiness has been  translated into the pursuit of the tax-free buck. Gimmick betting could even  result in the demise of the sport itself. A sport which has survived since the  days of James I may find itself at the mercy of tinhorn gamblers."  </P> <P> Racing has endured, but Kilroe was right about an exacta or a trifecta being at  the bottom of nearly every attempted betting coup.  </P> <P> Robbins first met Kilroe in the late 1960s while working in the racing office  at Del Mar during summer vacation from high school. "I was in awe of him  because of his stature," Robbins said.  </P> <P> A few years later, Kilroe hired him as an entry clerk at Santa Anita, and now  Robbins is a a track vice president.  </P> <P> "One of the things we have to do is to keep Jimmy coming out to the track,"  Robbins said. "We can still be learning from him."  </P> <P> That may not be difficult. In the past year, despite his stroke, Kilroe has  been a frequent visitor, usually grabbing a seat in a box near the finish line,  where the late Connie Ring used to sit.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Arlington International Racecourse is desperate to fill the field for its  Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. After Criminal Type, Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the  list of probable entrants dips to Opening Verse, Mi Selecto and Santangelo, and  it's doubtful that the invitational race will come up with its desired  eight-horse field. Santangelo, fourth in the Hollywood Gold Cup behind Criminal  Type, Sunday Silence and Opening Verse, has yet to win a race in the United  States after 10 starts.  </P> <P> Timeless Answer, high weight at 118 pounds in Saturday's $200,000 Bel-Air  Handicap at Hollywood Park, will be joined by seven others, including the Brian  Mayberry-trained entry of Exemplary Leader and Prospectors Gamble. Others  entered are Annual Date, Exploding Prospect, Hot Operator, Charlatan and Music  Prospector, who as a 3-year-old gets in against older horses carrying 112  pounds.  </P></p>

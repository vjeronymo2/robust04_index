			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Bundesbank chief turns on industry critics MR Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday rounded on German industrialists, rejecting claims that the central bank's monetary and interest rates policies were 'strangling' the country's economy and stifling investment. The Bundesbank was not in the business of manipulating economic cycles, he said in a radio broadcast, and put the blame for any downturn on pay negotiators and industry's decision makers. 'It is not our responsibility to compensate with our policies for mistakes made by others - over-generous pay rises, for example - or reduced investment which should be attributed to other causes.' The independent central bank has attracted growing criticism at home and abroad since it unexpectedly raised lending rates by half a point to 9.5 per cent just before Christmas. The bank president's rebuttal followed a warning on Friday from his deputy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, that German interest rates would have to stay 'relatively high' for the foreseeable future, and that industry's international competitiveness would be damaged by high wage awards. Mr Schlesinger noted yesterday that longer-term rates had fallen since December and capital market rates were at the same level as at the start of 1990. In that year Germany recorded 4.5 per cent economic growth. Meanwhile, steel industry negotiators have started their eighth round of talks on union claims for a 10.5 per cent increase this year. Employers have so far offered only a two-stage increase worth 4.54 per cent over 12 months, while unions have warned of strike action. The main banking union, offered 4.5 per cent in the face of its 10.5 per cent claim, yesterday called for nationwide warning strikes on Thursday. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, joined the public debate yesterday, declaring that all settlements must be held below 6 per cent. In an interview in Der Speigel, a news magazine, published yesterday, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, gave an unusually gloomy outlook for economic growth this year. While the lower limit of most recently revised forecasts is 1.5 per cent, he projected a rise of between 1 and 2 per cent in the government's annual economic outlook paper, to be published shortly.</p>

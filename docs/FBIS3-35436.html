Engineer Mohammad Reza Ne'matzadeh, minister of industries,  gave a press conference in which he announced the above. He  said: Of this amount, Rls482 billion is for the difference  between subsidies and banking facilities, Rls820 billion is for  semicomplete projects, and Rls110 billion is for development and  application research and study.    He added: In this ministry's organizational plan, in the  event investments are made, Rls20,000 billion are provided by  the government and the private sector, and the growth of  industry's added value is to be 6.2 percent. If the budget is  not procured and there is no government support, we will not  achieve this goal in the Second Five-Year Plan.    The minister of industries cited as the industrial sector's  main goals in the Second Five-Year Economic and Social  Development Plan the giving of roots to industrial production,  increasing the profitability of production and raising its  usability, making the desired use of existing industrial  capacities, increasing the competitiveness of the nation's  industrial production on international markets, increasing  industrial employment, raising society's standard of living and  protecting the environment.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh then discussed the importance of the  technical studies and development and application research  sectors. He said: To achieve this goal Rls150 billion will have  to be invested, and the Plan and Budget Organization has  confirmed Rls110 billion of this amount.    Continuing, the minister of industries discussed the fact  that in the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan 180  research and development units were created in production units.  He emphasized the necessity to increase these units in the  Second Five-Year Plan. He said: It is expected that this number  will triple under the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Since the  position of research in this country is quite low, it is  necessary that the government give attention to this sector.    This sector needs to have Rls600 billion credit allocated to  it from the development budget. If these credits are obtained we  will see 2 percent added value in this sector.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh cited aid in the creation of industrial  infrastructure as another of this ministry's aims. He said: To  create industrial villages, in view of the increase in the price  of foreign exchange, credit of Rls350 billion is needed.    He then discussed the proposed notes that pertain to the  deprived areas. He added: The portion of profits from companies  and economic activities that is used to invest in the priority  areas will be tax exempt.    He also added: In the annual budgets the government is  required to allocate the credits needed to procure  infrastructure resources including water, electrical power, gas,  access roads and industrial villages, in such a way that at  least 70 percent of the costs for preparing industrial villages  or industrial and mining projects located in the nation's  deprived areas and 50 percent of the costs of preparing other  industrial villages in the municipalities which are not province  centers will be paid out of the development budgets.    The minister of industries continued: To implement policies  that encourage and reinforce development and spread industries  and mines in the deprived areas, the government is required to  pay 50 percent of the annual costs of consumer electricity, as  well as the foreman's and worker shares and social insurance  premiums in the industrial and mining units located in the  nation's deprived and underprivileged areas. This money will  come from part of the revenues obtained through customs levies  and commercial profits taxes on imported goods.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh complained about the Plan and Budget  Organization's cut in the proposed budget for the Industrial  Planning Council. He said: Because industry and employment must  be created in the country and the share of the nation's  appropriate export must be increased, these changes will create  problems to some extent for the industrial sector.    He then discussed progress of hardware in the nation's  industries in the First Five-Year Plan. He said: In the Second  Five-Year Plan attention has also been given to the development  of software.    The minister of industries said: In view of the fact that  the  electronics industry is undergoing striking growth in the  country while in Iran electronics makes up only 0.2 percent of  GNP [gross national product], to support development research  and innovation and to advance this industry, an Electronics  Industries Development Support Fund will be created.    In the area of exports he also discussed matters such as the  establishment of insurance for exports, the provision of credit  facilities for exporters, the creation of a permanent exhibition  for industrial export goods, activation of the committee to  develop nonoil exports, activation of commercial representation  by opening exports in foreign countries, and other things.    In conclusion he asked researchers, writers, and translators  to contact this ministry and make use of its available  facilities if they have foreign books and articles and are  having problems getting them printed and published.</p>

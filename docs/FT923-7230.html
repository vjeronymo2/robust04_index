			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Schering offloads plating unit to Elf SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, is continuing its restructuring by selling its electro-plating division to Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-controlled energy group. The deal with Elf comes shortly after last month's DM660m (Dollars 445.9m) sale of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals subsidiaries to Witco of the US. The two disposals form part of the German group's strategy of focusing on its core businesses in pharmaceuticals and plant protection chemicals by selling other interests where it has a smaller market presence. Schering, which recently reported a fall in earnings of 4 per cent to DM179m on sales of DM3.4bn for the first half of this year, has been known to be in discussion with a number of prospective purchasers for the electro-plating business, which has annualised sales of about FFr1bn (Dollars 202m) and 1,100 employees. Elf has agreed to buy the business from Schering for an undisclosed sum. It will integrate it within its Elf-Atochem chemicals division. Elf-Atochem has significant plating interests, which make annual sales of FFr800m, chiefly through its M &amp; T Harshaw business in the US. The Schering electro-plating businesses, which are concentrated in Europe, will complement Elf-Atochem's existing interests in North America. Elf-Aquitaine, which staged a successful FFr2.08bn sale of a 2.3 per cent minority stake in its shares, has been expanding its interests across the energy and chemicals sphere. The French group sustained a slight decline in net income from FFr10.6bn in 1990 to FFr9.8bn on sales of FFr200.7bn in 1991. Morgan Stanley, the securities house, forecast a further fall in earnings per share from FFr35 in 1991 to FFr28 this year because of the sluggish economic backdrop and the weakness of refined product prices and the US dollar.</p>

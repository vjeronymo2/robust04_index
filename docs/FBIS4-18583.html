			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by And. Karakousis] </F>   [Text] The government is gearing up to issue Greek  Telecommunications Organization (OTE) shares. Following several  months of inactivity, it is now hastening the process,  apparently under the pressure of the uncertainties surrounding  the implementation of the budget. At a large meeting presided  over by Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister Andonis Livanis  with the participation of Minister of Finance Papadhopoulos,  Minister of Transportation I. Kharalambous, and other government  officials it was decided that the stock floatation bill will be  submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as soon as possible in  April. The Livanis presence at the meeting underlines the prime  minister's interest in the issue of OTE stock. The bill is being  elaborated by the Ministry of National Economy; according to  available information, it is envisioned that up to 30 percent of  OTE shares will be sold to private investors through the stock  market.    The government's goal is to secure the sale of the first  package of OTE shares until next September to enhance government  revenue in next fall's critical period, when budgetary pressures  will be at their highest. It is now clear that part of the  income from the sale of shares will be devoted to enhancing  revenue and not be used in its entirety to fulfill the needs of  the OTE's investment program, as the government initially  announced.    In general, the interest of foreign investors in the OTE  remains strong and the ministry of national economy is being  "besieged" by potential investors.</p>

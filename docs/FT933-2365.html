			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Books: Japan is no joke THE JAPANESE by Joe Joseph Viking, Pounds 15.99 275 pages CAUGHT IN A MIRROR: REFLECTIONS OF JAPAN by Lisa Martineau Macmillan, Pounds 16.99 305 pages SILENT THUNDER by Peter Tasker Orion, Pounds 14.99 287 pages WITH ITS mixture of ancient and modern, East and West, deep spiritual roots yet ruthless pursuit of hedonistic pleasures, Japan is one of the most fascinating countries to observe, but one of the most complicated to explain to a western audience. It is particularly difficult for Western newspaper editors to understand, with their desire to package the world into a few colourful paragraphs. One approach is to look at the ways in which Japan differs from the rest of the world. Clearly, there are enough of those to give Joe Joseph a whale of a time, reporting on the initiation rites of freshmen 'salarymen' as Japan's business executives are called, on the role of women - 'a woman's place is in the wrong' - on one of the world's richest men who mends his shoes with black sticky tape, on the profusion of political scandals and the new 'modern Mikado.' Long before the end the task has overwhelmed Joseph. Admittedly, he seems happy enough, poking fun and pausing long enough to mint and polish his own phrases which, sadly, have 'Look what a clever boy I am' stamped over them. He skims the surface of Japanese life. Though his subtitle is 'Strange but not strangers' he gives little indication of having got to know or understand any Japanese. Much of his material could have been culled from newspaper cuttings, especially those detailing the oddities and idiocies of Japanese life, of which there are many, but they do not make the whole story. Some of his facts are wrong - the Japanese are not second to America in defence spending, but fourth or fifth, depending on the strength of the yen. Some of his statements are crass, for example: 'Yoshiaki Tsutsumi carries on a feud with his half-brother Seiji that makes Cain and Abel look chummy.' But didn't Cain killed Abel and aren't both Tsutsumis alive and well and masters of big business empires? Joseph used to be the Tokyo correspondent of The Times, and his book is also a reflection of the declining international role of once great British newspapers. With the exception of the FT, the British press sees Japan as rich but still rather comic. News editors will leap at stories that poke fun and ignore seminal events as too boring. Lisa Martineau is aware of western ignorance about Japan and early on draws attention to it: 'As it was in the 1890s it is in the 1990s: the Japanese know much more about us than we know about them.' She does not talk down, either to her readers or the Japanese, and resists the temptation to make cheap jokes. Instead, she takes off on an exploration of Japan, beyond plate-glass Tokyo and into the depth of the countryside. Patiently, letting the Japanese speak for themselves, she draws the curtains to reveal the life and the feelings of today's Japanese. It is a highly personal journey, but carefully observed, sometimes touchingly amusing and always informative. I wish, though, that Martineau had offered more support for her claim that 'young (Japanese) people firmly expect they will have to fight a war with America.' More unfortunately, the book is marked by the absence of an index, for which the useful glossary does not make up, and by some sloppy errors. She talks of the Nankyu Braves baseball team when they were sold to Orix in 1988 and became the Orix Braves. She claims that Nanae Mori is the wife (presumably widow now) of the real estate magnate Taikichiro Mori, who died recently. For something completely different, try Tasker's novel, a romp. Tasker is a serious man, Balliol and Kleinwort Benson, and won the title of Japan's most respected research analyst last year. He has produced an unbelievable tale of the seamy side of modern Japan, full of its corrupt lines between politicians, bureaucrats and gangsters and littered with dead bodies. Its sleazy hero is a character you can warm to. He has a sharp eye for the Japanese underworld. And as for the unbelievable plot, who would have believed the true stories of Japanese corruption unearthed with the investigation of ruling party 'Godfather' Shin Kanemaru?</p>

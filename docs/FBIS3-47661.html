			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>   [Excerpts] As the U.S. imposed deadline for taking action  to open the Japanese construction market neared, and the threat  of sanctions loomed larger, the cabinet held a meeting today to  approve a construction industry action program. The program is  Tokyo's final proposal for concluding Japan-U.S. construction  talks.    The United States has made strong demands that Japan open  its  construction market, saying it would impose sanctions against  Japan unless it presented satisfactory measures for the opening  of its construction market by 20 January.    In response the government has mapped out the action  program.  [passage omitted on Hosokawa's comment on action program].    Commenting on the action program this morning at a news  conference after the cabinet meeting, Construction Minister Kozo  Igarashi said: The action program will further promote the  opening of Japan's construction market, which is what the United  States and other countries have asked. I am convinced that they  will rate the action program highly. I hope the program will  lead to a smooth settlement of Japan-U.S. construction talks.</p>

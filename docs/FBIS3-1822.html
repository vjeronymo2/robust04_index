			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By political editor Mary Binks and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The standoff between Britain and China over the  political future of Hong Kong continued yesterday as the gulf  widened between their respective accounts of why cooperation had  not been possible.    The two sides, in separate accounts of the failed 17 rounds  of negotiations, blamed each other for the impasse on  arrangements for the final elections under British rule.    Governor Chris Patten declined to retaliate to Beijing's  accusations that the British side had deliberately sabotaged the  negotiations and interfered in China's sovereignty.    Mr Patten resisted calls by legislators to issue the  unabridged version of the negotiations in order to clear up  differences between the two accounts of why the talks failed.    "Even if you were to produce all the other documentation,  you  would still have differences in interpretation and analyses ...  people can look from one document to the other and by and large,  the facts are the same in both," he said.    The 17,000-word Chinese document published five days after  Britain's White Paper on the content of the negotiations,  accused Britain of "distorting the position of the Chinese side".    Meanwhile, China's most senior official dealing with the  territory, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping,  stressed the talks had been intended to provide legislators with  a through-train enabling them to serve their terms beyond 1997.    Local Xinhua News Agency official Lee Wui-ting said the  version of the talks published by the Chinese side would allow  the Hong Kong people to determine the cause of the political  deadlock.    Speaking after a meeting of the Preliminary Working  Committee  (PWC) in Beijing yesterday, Mr Lee said the Chinese version  demonstrated that the British side had pushed Mr Patten's  constitutional reform proposals from the beginning of the talks,  hindering progress.    "The Hong Kong people can judge which side was  unco-operative," Mr Lee said.    But, in Beijing, Britain's Ambassador to China, Sir Robin  McLaren claimed the Chinese account of the negotiations was  incorrect in its interpretations.    Sir Robin also criticised the Chinese government for not  providing him with a copy of the document before it was made  public. He said Britain had extended that courtesy to China  before issuing its White Paper on the failed negotiations.    China's account of the talks was yesterday published in  Beijing's two major official newspapers, the PEOPLE's DAILY and  CHINA DAILY, in Chinese and English respectively.    Sir Robin said Britain would stand by its version, saying  the  White Paper was a more accurate assessment of the reasons for  the impasse.    U.S. President Bill Clinton yesterday made clear he fully  supported Mr Patten's proposals, after a meeting with visiting  British Prime Minister John Major.</p>

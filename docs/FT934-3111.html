			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Rover car output Rover has raised car output this year with an increase of 5.2 per cent in the first nine months and a jump of 25 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed yesterday, Kevin Done writes. The company is virtually alone among European carmakers in achieving an increase. The company has shown strong growth, albeit from a small base, in some of the main continental European markets, where it is starting to benefit from heavy investment to develop its dealer networks. Such markets include Germany, France and Italy. UK car output has also been boosted by the industry's leading presence in the production of four-wheel drive vehicles through Land Rover, part of the Rover group, and through IBC Vehicles, a 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. Demand for four-wheel drive vehicles has remained strong through the recession. Land Rover has raised output of its Discovery and Range Rover vehicles by 31 per cent year-on-year in the first nine months of the year, while IBC has increased output of the Frontera by 43 per cent.</p>

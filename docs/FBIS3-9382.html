The Social Democrat (SPD) former mayor of Bremen, Hans  Kochnick, has been named by the European Union in agreement with  the German government, SPD foreign affairs official Karsten  Voigt told AFP.    Voigt said it had been envisaged for some time to send  Kochnick to the town as its administrator, and this was set to  materialise "as peace slowly comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina".    DER SPIEGEL magazine reported a month ago that a German  civil  administrator was to be sent to Mostar, and would be assisted in  restoring public services by German police and civil servants.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday that he favoured  Germany taking a role in reconstruction efforts in former  Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Confidence factors After Maastricht, Christchurch. By the end of next week Mr John Major will at least have these distractions out of the way, but his leadership will hardly have been strengthened by his recourse to a confidence vote on the social chapter and what promises to be a crushing by-election defeat. If the equity market has remained relatively sanguine, it may be partly because Mr Major's desire to restore his credibility reinforces his need for a growth-oriented economic policy. Recent statistics, including yesterday's second quarter GDP figures, show the recovery remains in place. Presumably Mr Major's hope is that after the summer holidays, the shame of this month's reverses will have been forgotten and the economic recovery will lend fresh vigour to his leadership. The chances are that he will respond to any setbacks by cutting interest rates, a thought which should continue to underpin equities. But a sterner test looms in the form of the interim results season. While higher gilt prices leave the gilt/equity yield ratio comfortably over two, equity valuations look somewhat stretched by a market prospective multiple in excess of 14. Since worries over insider trading have made companies particularly reluctant to steer City forecasts, it is unusually difficult to anticipate the message from interim results. The chances are, though, that it could be one of mild disappointment. The UK recovery may not yet show through strongly in earnings and the downturn in continental Europe has accelerated. It would help UK companies if the current ERM unrest led to lower continental interest rates which would boost demand.</p>

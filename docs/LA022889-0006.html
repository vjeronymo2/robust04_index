			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board on Monday gave officials of the  Encina sewage treatment plant in Carlsbad until March, 1990, to correct high  levels of toxics detected in the sewage plant's effluent.  </P> <P> The board voted to issue the cease-and-desist order against the North County  plant after hearing a report that the Encina facility had exceeded its toxicity  levels in six of the seven months between June and December, 1988.  </P> <P> However, board members praised Encina officials for acting quickly by hiring an  outside consultant to find the cause of the problem. Encina officials have said  that, although the toxics exceed state limits, the effluent does not pose a  threat to public health or the environment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ruediger Moniac report: "Reserved Seat on World Security </F> Council?"]    [Text] Bonn -- The debate on the reform and enlargement of  the World Security Council, which has also been eagerly expected  in Bonn, will start today at the United Nations in New York. A  UN committee will be set up for this purpose. As desired by FRG  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of  Germany), German diplomats are supposed to do intensive work in  this body. They are instructed by the Federal Government to do  everything over the short- and medium-term to secure a permanent  seat on the Security Council, the highest UN executive body.  According to the mandate of the past 48th General Assembly, the  committee, in which all 184 UN member states can participate, is  to meet once a week until the beginning of the 49th General  Assembly in the autumn, and then it is to present a report that  "will describe first possible outlines of scenarios for an  enlargement of the council." According to diplomatic circles in  Bonn, there is every indication that the United Nations will  resolve its enlargement in 1995, its 50th anniversary. "Thus,  the train of reform for the Security Council has been started.  If Germany misses it, the next will presumably only be started  again in 50 years," a diplomat emphasized to DIE WELT.    In a draft accepted by Kinkel for the work of German  diplomats in New York, it is expected that Germany will have to  assume "more political, military, and financial burdens within  the framework of the international community in the future" --  independently of whether Germany is a permanent Security Council  member. Therefore, it is in Germany's interest "also to be able  to make decisions" in the "most exclusive club" of the most  important international organization. After the United States  and Japan, Bonn is the third largest UN contributor, with 9  percent. Among the five permanent council members, it was the  United States that applied in writing for the admission of Japan  and Germany. France and Great Britain, which complete the  quintet, in addition to the PRC and Russia, stated that they are  not prepared for a reduction of their powers if the council is  enlarged.    The work of the new UN committee primarily concentrates on  the question of how the 129 Third World countries can be  represented if the council is enlarged. Their opinion is  important because two-thirds of all UN members have to agree to  an enlargement.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Applause for a modern work - Music in London SERIOUS new works are rarely greeted with such delight as the Festival hall audience accorded this week to a new violin concerto by the British composer, Nicholas Maw. The work was premiered last month in America (where Maw more or less resides now) and heard in Britain on Thursday. It seems that he has had such a concerto vaguely in mind for many years, but was inspired to get on with it only when the young American violinist Joshua Bell (much praised in these pages since we first heard him) came upon the scene. That was a good idea. The result was a lovely piece, and the audience loved it. There are composers who break radical new ground, like (say) Harrison Birtwistle, whilst others, like Maw, are content to sow new seeds in familiar landscapes. The landscape where Maw has always found himself at home is English and specifically English-lyrical, intimate rather than epic (despite the scale of his recent orchestral Odyssey), a place for a humane personality to flourish. Barely younger than Birtwistle, he matured in the same late-1950s musical ferment, but radical novelties are never what mark his music. Instead it sings, on and on and on: Maw is notorious for underestimating the time his latest piece will take to play. Tunes spring up everywhere, sometimes reassuringly tonal and sometimes not. But not at random; most of them will be close cousins to many of the others, stretching out new leaves and altered contours in a cogent (though unforeseeable) order. Therein lies the developing sense of the music. Maw is now so much a master of that songful vein that it hardly matters which overall form he elects. The shape of the Violin Concerto is traditional as could be: a gently expository Prelude (composed last) is followed by a virtuoso Scherzo (composed first) and a confessionally intense Romanza, and then a seemingly lightweight Rondo with a racing coda. The forms, however, are mere frames for the expressive life of Maw's music, which pursues its way in a much closer focus than that, moment by singing moment. Though the solo role is generous, it requires a violinist of exactly Bell's gifts: brilliantly equipped but not distractingly showy, able to mask his art under a guise of innocent straight-speaking. The Philharmonia and their conductor Leonard Slatkin collaborated in perfect sympathy (no less than his alter-ego soloist, Maw's orchestra speaks poignantly). This work should reward repeated hearings in the friendliest way; we may hope that an international star like Bell can get it onto a CD soon. Slatkin also conducted a sensational Rite of Spring, so taut that it squeaked. He had his own devices for pointing up Stravinsky's score - here an unwritten breath-pause, there a grinding portamento: always well-taken in principle, but in practice too self-conscious for a score which can speak thunderously for itself.

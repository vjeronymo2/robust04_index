			<p>BFN     [Text] The commander of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces]  Central Command informed the Jordan Valley settlers that as of  Wednesday [4 May] morning they will not be permitted to enter  the Jericho area. If they have to travel to Jerusalem they will  have to travel on the security road adjacent to the border,  which will be used to bypass Jericho. This was said by David  Elhayani, head of the Jordan Valley settlements committee, to  our correspondent Gil Litman. He said the settlers are  extremely concerned about what is expected to take place after  the establishment of autonomy in Jericho. He added that the  settlers will launch protest actions against the establishment  of the Jericho autonomous enclave.</p>

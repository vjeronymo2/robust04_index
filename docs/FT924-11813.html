			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Bonds: CS Holding gives new lease of life to convertibles THE convertible bond market sprang to life yesterday, when CS Holding, the Swiss holding company which owns Credit Suisse and partly owns CS First Boston and Electrowat, launched a rare offering of bonds convertible into bearer shares. The Dollars 500m issue of 10-year non-callable convertible bonds, increased from Dollars 400m, was arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston. The convertible bond market has been starved this year, creating a surplus of demand, particularly from specialist convertible bond funds. The CS Holding deal provided investors with the sort of high-quality name they were looking for. Dealers said the issue, which closed at its par issue price, was meeting particularly strong demand among Swiss investors, who welcomed the chance of a dollar play on a Swiss equity investment. The size of the issue will also help boost declining liquidity in the sector. As well as suffering from a slump in new issues volume this year, the secondary market has suffered from a spate of buy-backs and early redemptions. In addition, many convertible bonds are no longer traded as such, since their equity component has lost its value due to declining stock market prices. Consequently, many older issuers are now traded purely as fixed-income instruments. Dealers said the coupon on the CS Holding deal had been squeezed slightly, but a lower indicated premium of 10 to 12 per cent provided adequate compensation. The bonds pay a coupon of 4 7/8 per cent, about a point more that the dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. The deal will be priced over today's closing price on the Zurich Stock Exchange. The structure of the deal is unusual in that the issuer cannot redeem the bonds early, which adds extra value for investors. In the dollar sector, General Electric Capital Corporation took advantage of attractive swap arbitrage at the short end of the market to launch a Dollars 200m three-year issue, despite volatile conditions in the US Treasury market. The triple-A rated bonds will be priced today at a spread of 45 basis points over the comparable US Treasury note yield. In the French bond market, Banque Nationale de Paris launched a FFr1.5bn five-year deal which was considered attractively priced at a spread of 49 basis points over the comparable yield on French government paper. The deal, arranged by BNP Capital Markets, met strong demand from investors, due to the current rally in the short end of the market. Many investors believe that rates are set to fall soon, and that the yield curve will become steeply positive. In the floating-rate note market, the World Bank launched a 'collared' floater, paying a minimum coupon of 5 per cent and a maximum of 8 1/4 per cent. Initial interest is set at 25 basis points below the six-month Libor. The deal was arranged by Kidder Peabody.</p>

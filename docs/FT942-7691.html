			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Toyota tops corporate earners Toyota Motor has emerged as Japan's number one corporate earner last year for the first time in three years, according to a report by Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company. Toyota was followed by Sanwa Bank and NTT, the telecommunications company, for the calendar year 1993. Declared earnings are based on after-tax profits adjusted to meet tax regulations. Toyota's return to the top spot came in spite of a 27 per cent fall in declared earnings for the car company last year to Y296bn (Dollars 2,819m). 'We did not have a particularly good year. But other companies suffered even more,' Toyota commented. The earnings league table compiled by Teikoku Data Bank shows that the fortunes of companies within the same industries were widely divergent last year. Sanwa Bank, for example, climbed to second position from sixth place in 1992 while Mitsubishi Bank rose to seventh place from tenth last year. Sanwa declared earnings last year of Y262bn which was 19.5 per cent up on 1992. However, three other banks - Sumitomo, Daiichi Kangyo and Tokai - which had been among the top 10 in 1992, tumbled below the tenth spot, leaving Sanwa, Mitsubishi and Fuji Bank, at ninth place. Likewise, in the car sector, Toyota may have regained its top status but Nissan, which reported a pre-tax loss of Y26.2bn last year, was not even in the running while Honda fell from 53rd to 89th place. Among notable changes in the rankings, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries emerged in fifth place, returning to the top 10 for the first time in 19 years. The shipbuilding and heavy machinery company saw a firm rise in earnings due to strong demand for its motors and ships. Nintendo, the video games maker, rose to number six from 12th place in 1992 while Matsushita, under pressure from a slump in the consumer electronics market, fell from seventh to 11th place.</p>

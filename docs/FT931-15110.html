			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Delta strengthens Swissair link DELTA Air Lines, one of the big three US carriers, and Swissair, the European airline, yesterday unveiled a new agreement on certain transatlantic routes. The agreement could come into effect by June this year, subject to appropriate government approvals. The ultimate goal, the two carriers said yesterday, was to provide 'seamless, quality customer service'. Under the deal, Swissair will reserve a block of seats, in all three travel classes, using its flight designator on a new daily non-stop service operated by Delta between Cincinnati and Zurich. Delta will operate the same system on Swissair flights operating between Atlanta and Zurich, New York (Kennedy airport) and Geneva, and New York (Kennedy) and Zurich. The two airlines, which have held small cross-shareholdings in each other's equity since 1989, also plan to share terminal facilities at the airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Geneva, New York (Kennedy) and Zurich for arriving, departing and connecting passengers. The move by Delta, which has been troubled recently by heavy losses and the difficult integration of assets acquired from the now-defunct Pan Am, and Swissair is the latest in a series of international airline alliances. These include the operational integration between KLM and Northwest Airlines, and the proposed share stake investments by American Airlines in PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, and Air Canada in the US's Continental Airlines.</p>

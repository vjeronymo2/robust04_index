			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR FORCE SEEKING NEW WORLDWIDE ROLE;  </P> <P> MILITARY: SHIFTING FROM EMPHASIS ON NUCLEAR MISSIONS AND EUROPE, THE STRATEGY  WILL FOCUS ON POSSIBLE 3RD WORLD TARGETS.  </P> <P> The Air Force, facing deep budget reductions and challenges to its mission,  plans today to unveil a report that touts its ability to strike quickly at  distant Third World targets, seen as a strong defense priority of the future.  </P> <P> The statement to be released by Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice marks a  decided shift from the Air Force's longstanding emphasis on long-range nuclear  missions and conventional warfare in Europe. The new tack stresses rapid  operations that would "reach out and touch someone" anywhere at a moment's  notice, in the words of the service's senior officer, Gen. Larry D. Welch.  </P> <P> The report, which promotes the service's "unique characteristics" for  futuristic warfare, offers a glimpse of the behind-the scenes competition  between the Air Force and the Navy for a pre-eminent military role as the end  of the Cold War sharply threatens defense budgets and the need for many  traditional operations.  </P> <P> It offers a sweeping view of how the Air Force intends to redefine itself in  the face of a scaling back that likely will trim its current force of 541,000  to as few as 460,000 by 1995. The service's new emphasis on potential threats  outside Europe attempts to counter a secretary of defense and Congress  increasingly skeptical of the service's costly programs, such as the B-2  bomber.  </P> <P> Among some outside critics, there have even been suggestions that the Air  Force, the youngest of the four military services, could be abolished, with the  Navy and the Army taking up the air-power slack.  </P> <P> The Navy, which has long promoted itself as the caretaker of the nation's most  effective arsenal for a Third World strike, has aggressively positioned itself  as the premier service to handle brush-fire wars of the future. With at least  two of its 14 carriers threatened by budget cuts, the Navy has cited its  ability to strike distant targets quickly without access to foreign bases.  </P> <P> In its new report, the Air Force makes a bid for a full share of that mission.  It also advertises some old missions, such as surveillance by satellite and  aircraft, as prime ones for watching developing nations where threats could  develop quickly.  </P> <P> Further, it notes that it can help the United States make new global friends  and influence allies by transferring aircraft that are being retired because of  budget reductions. The Air Force said that the recent shipment of older Air  Force jets to Colombia, where they will be used in that country's drug  interdiction efforts, is an example of how the service can help Washington  "influence events and protect national interests in areas where more visible  means of intervention are not viable."  </P> <P> Nowhere is the recasting more evident than in the evolving rationale for the  $62-billion B-2 Stealth bomber. The B-2 was designed as an intercontinental  bomber that would penetrate Soviet airspace. But the new Air Force report  points out that in instances such as the 1986 raid on Libya, six B-2 bombers  could do the work of the 119 aircraft and 20 ships that took part in that  operation -- and probably do it more cheaply.  </P> <P> Many lawmakers have jeered at the suggestion that the United States would use  an $825 million-per-copy plane for such missions.  </P> <P> "There are obviously differences of opinion about the political salability of  the conventional mission for the B-2," Rice conceded in an interview Thursday  with The Times.  </P> <P> "Would we have bought the B-2 just for that? Probably not," Rice added. "But  the plane will probably be more valuable in the future than it would have in  the past. We'll find as time unfolds many uses" for the aircraft.  </P></p>

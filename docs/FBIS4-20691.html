Inc., 1  Goikaigan, Ichihara City, Chiba, Japan]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   In TEPCO, as the share of nuclear power generation  increases,  adjusting capability of thermal power plants to meet the  variation in demand of electricity has become important. In  particular, medium capacity units such as the Goi Thermal Power  Station, which consists of six units, are needed to carry out  frequent start-ups and shut-downs. In order to fulfill the  requirement, the Goi No. 2 unit has been refreshed and modified  for DSS (Daily Start-up and Shut-down) operation in 1988. Since  it is necessary to clean up and improve quality of feed water to  the boiler more quickly in DSS operation than in conventional  operation, the existing auxiliary precoat filters (PCF) were  replaced with hollow fiber filters (HFF), which have been used  in TEPCO's nuclear power stations. This paper describes the  results of our four year operation of HFF as its effectiveness  has been confirmed.  <H5>  1. Background to Development </H5>   1.1 Water Processing Technology Using Filters    Filter processing technology has seen rapid progress in  recent years, with focus mainly on the manufacture of  semi-conductors and the medical sector. Although its main  objective in these fields is efficiently achieving water quality  of ultra-high purity, the scale of processing has been small  until now and the filters have generally been of the disposable  type.    Since condensate filters for use in thermal power plants are  required to produce feed water which is stable over the long  term as well as being of high purity, TEPCO has installed PCFs  and electro-magnetic filters (EMFs) until now. Meanwhile, in  nuclear power plants, the demand for high-purity water quality  has led to the development of the HFF for condensate processing,  and this is currently being operated satisfactorily.    1.2 The State of Scale Damage in Once-Through Boilers  and the Need Arising From DSS Modification    In recent years, scale damage such as that described below  has gradually become apparent in base-load once-through UP  boilers, caused for example by an increase in stop-start  operations.    (Examples of scale damage)    a. Blocked strainer at the boiler feed pump inlet    b. Reduced efficiency in the high-pressure feed water heater    c. Boiler pressure loss    d. Malfunction in superheater temperature control caused by  scale accumulation on the spray valve    Therefore, for the last few years we have been working on  research into the relative efficiency and merits of various  types of filters used for condensate purification. Moreover, in  modifying to DSS operation, it has become necessary to remove  impurities efficiently and in a short space of time. Thus, as a  step towards solving these issues, we have decided to proceed  with studies based on the hollow fiber filter, which is being  used successfully for condensate purification in TEPCO nuclear  power stations, considering the water quality in thermal power  stations and the characteristics of operating methods.  <H5>  2. The Hollow Fiber Filter </H5>   2.1 The Principles and Properties of the Hollow Fiber  Filter    As shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced], the hollow fiber  filter can filter substances down to the coloid-range size. The  fibers are hollow and macaroni-shaped, as shown in Figure 2 [not  reproduced], with microscopic slit-shaped filtration holes of  0.1 m or less in the outer surface.    The filtration principle, as shown in Figure 3 [not  reproduced], is that condensate is passed from the outside to  the inside of the hollow fibers, and non-solvent solids  (referred to below as ``clad'') are extracted onto the surface  of the hollow fibers.    The properties are as shown below.    1) Compared to conventional precoat filters, there is no  need  for an auxiliary precoating of the filter, and operation can be  simplified thanks to the simple composition of the equipment and  remote automatic control.    2) With a large number of fine-pore hollow fibers bunched  together in module fashion, a large filter area can be secured,  thus large volumes of condensate can be filtered even though the  device itself is compact in size. It is particularly effective  in cases where installation space is limited, such as in  existing plants in which operation is underway.    3) Since it can remove all clad sized 0.1 m or more,  outlet water quality of 1 ppb of clad or less can be ensured at  all times regardless of the quality of water at the inlet, and  this has a major effect on reducing the clean-up time when  starting the unit. In addition, during normal operation high  purity boiler feed water can be ensured.    2.2 The Economic Feasibility of Hollow Fibers    The hollow fiber was first developed for nuclear power  plant,  and in applying it to thermal power plant, there have been some  problems in economic feasibility caused by differences in safety  design rationale. Thus there was some doubt initially as to  whether it would be feasible in terms of cost.    However, given the requirement for rigorous water quality  conditions, if the hollow fiber filter is adopted after the  modification of No. 2 unit to DSS it is forecast that the costs  would be recovered in 4-5 years, with the effects and merits  calculated as shown in Table 1. Therefore we decided to proceed  with the development of HFF for thermal power plants.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The Development and Deployment of Hollow Fiber Filters </H5> for Thermal Power Plants    3.1 Development for Use in Thermal Power Plants    Because of differences in the conditions of nuclear power  plants and water quality control, development was carried out  with a mini-module to confirm points that needed particular care  when designing hollow fiber filters for thermal power plants.    3.1.1 Agreement Between Filter Hole Bore and Filtration  Speed    From condensate analysis results of Goi Thermal Power  Station  Unit No. 6 and test results of the HFF mini-module, it was  confirmed that the undissolved matter was mainly composed of  magnetite (Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/]), which has a peak of 5  m as shown in Figure 4 [not reproduced], and that if this is  permeated through filtration holes of 0.1 m or less at a  filtration speed of about 0.1 m/h, there will be no blockage and  all undissolved matter including magnetite can be removed while  still retaining an extremely small slow rise in differential  pressure.    As well as the above, we considered the effect of oil  contained in the condensate directly after periodical  inspections and at other times, and confirmed that, as this was  an artificial undissolved substance that only occurred in  microscopic amounts when a new hollow fiber filter was  installed, it could be effectively managed by covering the outer  surface of the hollow fiber filter in advance with a film  membrane.    3.1.2 Improving the Alkali Resistance of Module  Material    Since the condensate has a pH of 9.0-9.6 and thus a weak  alkalinity, we checked the alkali resistance of the hollow  fibers (polyethylene resin) and module structure elements known  as the potting and coupling sections.    As a result, we confirmed that the polyethylene resin does  not degenerate even under alkaline conditions, while for the  module structure elements we decided to use a high polymer  material whose strength is not affected by an alkaline  environment.    3.2 Application to Thermal Power Plants    Condensate filters for nuclear power plants are designed for  30 percent efficiency for purification operation, but in view of  the horizontal development across to thermal power plants, we  applied it with a 50 percent efficiency design for the rated  flow of condensate in the Goi Unit No. 2, the main objective  being to clear the water quality for DSS or WES operation,  considering the demands of the role of load regulation.    3.2.1 Condensate Purifiers    The PCF in the No. 2 unit is composed of three parallel  auxiliary precoat filters, and has a capacity to process a total  condensate rated flow of about 700 t/h.    This device is located between the condensate pump and  condensate demineralizer, and purifies the condensate in the  sequence shown in Figure 5 [not reproduced].    3.2.2 The Hollow Fiber Filter Device    The HFF has been installed in place of one of the existing  PCFs. One of these devices has the capacity to process 50  percent (350 t/h) of the rated condensate flow. Its composition  and specifications are as shown in Figure 6 [not reproduced] and  Table 2.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Operating Conditions and Evaluation </H5>   Continuous operation in the No. 2 unit was started on March  29th 1988. In Table 2 we show the figures for approximately four  years of operation since then, as well as evaluations.    Meanwhile, Table 3 shows a comparison of the methods of  operating condensate purifiers accompanying the change to HFF  equipment.       Table 3.

With the existing  PCF, if the inlet impurity concentration is high the outlet  concentration is also high and a long time has been required  until the economizer inlet water quality standard has been  satisfied. But with HFF we confirmed that high-concentration  impurities during start-up can be removed in a short time, as  shown in Figure 7 [not reproduced], and thus that the HFF makes  a great contribution to both DSS and WES operation in thermal  power units.    As a result, a target time of 150 minutes was achieved  between ignition and full load when during DSS of unit No. 2.    4.2 Restoring Pressure Differential by Reverse  Condensing    As a result of approximately 4 years of operation with  reverse condensing whenever processed water amounted to 800,000  m[.sup]3[/] or pressure differential rose 0.3  kg/cm[.sup]2[/] above the initial value, we are now operating  with a normal 0.8 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] change in pressure  differential, as shown in Figure 8 [not reproduced].    With a reverse condensor cycle (800,000 m[.sup]3[/]/cycle)  in which an HFF clad trapping load of 10 g/cm[.sup]2[/] is  assumed, after about three years of operation the rise in  pressure differential per reverse condensor cycle has now  flattened out at a low 0.1 kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. From this we can  hypothesize that we may extend the cycle to 1-1.5 million  m[.sup]3[/]/cycle in future.    4.3 Verification of the Filter Design Capacity    The iron concentration at the HFF outlet is stable at 1 ppb,  regardless of the operating condition of the unit or the inlet  concentration. Moreover, the total iron removal rate from  start-up to full load is a high 98 percent, as shown in Figure 9  [not reproduced]. From these facts we confirmed that we were  correct to design for a maximum condensate flow of 1/2 (350 t/h).    4.4 Simplification of Operation and Maintenance    4.4.1 Operability    While with PCF approximately 50 on-site reverse condensor  cycles are needed per year, with HFF it is possible to carry out  around three per year, all by remote control from a central  control room.    4.4.2 Reverse Condensing Time    While a single cycle of reverse condensing and precoating  took 240 minutes with PCF, with HFF we have been able to aim for  a reverse condensing time of 40 minutes, or a reduction of about  3 hours.    4.5 Lightening the Load on the Demineralizer and  Suppressing Clad Leakage to the Boiler Feed Water System    The vast reduction in impurities flowing in to the  demineralizer means that the phenomenon of impurity coating on  the resin is diminished. Thus it is now possible not only to  prevent resin contamination but also to suppress effluence into  the system by clad which is trapped in the mineralizer each time  the condensate flow fluctuates.    4.6 Estimating Filter Life    The maximum pressure loss tolerated by the No. 2 unit HFF is  2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] from capacity of the condensate pump. As  the speed of rise in pressure differential caused by the  permanent blockage of filters through operation over one year is  evaluated to be 2-3 times that of the initial year, estimated  filter life is 7-8 years.    Meanwhile, as concerns filter life determined by reduction  of  HFF material strength, we are also beginning to understand the  trends of changes in filter strength as a result of filter  analysis and other minute checks carried out in each periodic  inspection, and we are checking its soundness. In recent  evaluations, our initial estimation of life has been shown to be  correct, even considering the deterioration with age of  materials.  <H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>   When we modified the No. 2 unit to DSS operation we took the  opportunity to install the HFF in this instance in a thermal  power plant, which differs from a nuclear power plant in the  nature of its impurities, after repeatedly conducting adequate  lab tests in advance to ascertain whether the hollow fiber  filter manifested the filter efficiency for which it was  designed.    From operating figures over about four years, it was  confirmed that it had adequate purifying efficiency not only  during normal operation but also in DSS and WES start-ups, that  it was excellent in its reverse condensing properties, and that  it would be sufficiently effective to have a reverse condensing  cycle every 800,000 m[.sup]3[/].    Furthermore, in fiscal 1992, we reexamined the design of  components such as the diameter of filters, to reduce costs. As  a result, it was confirmed that the total area of filters can be  halved by doubling linear velocity, and accordingly, cost of  modules can also be halved, as shown in Table 4.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. Comparison of Present and Improved Modules                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Present condition        |Proposed improvement     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Av. linear velocity      |0.1 m/h                  |0.2 m/h                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Modules cost             |1                        |1/2                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Av. pore size            |0.1 m               |0.2 m               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No. of modules           |230                      |115                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Reverse condensing       |3 times a year           |10 times a year          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Permeation capacity      |Half (350 t/h) of rated  |Same as on the left      |  |                         |condensate flow (700 t/h)|                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Meanwhile, since the condensate from a once-through boiler  contains only around 0.5 percent ion impurities, and 99.5  percent clad, we have assumed that conventional demineralizers  fulfill a function only as basic ion exchangers in the event of  seawater leaks. We have confirmed that for the role of clad  processing, which takes up the majority of this, it is important  that the condensate should be processed principally by HFF. This  leads us to consider that the design concepts of secondary water  processing for thermal power will change from now on through the  adoption of the HFF as the condensate processing technology of  the future.</p>

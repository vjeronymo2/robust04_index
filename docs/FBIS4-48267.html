			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rik de Gendt: "Former Dictator Bagaza Back in </F> Burundian Politics"]    [Excerpt] Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who ruled Burundi with an  iron hand from 1976 to 1987, announced the founding meeting of a  new political party. There are fears that PARENA (Party for  National Reconstruction) [Parti pour la Reconstruction  Nationale] will become a sanctuary for all extremist and  discontented Tutsis. The party aims to get involved in the  fight to succeed President Cyprien Ntaryamira, who died in a  plane crash, and that could well turn out to be dynamite.  Moreover, he will take an anti-Belgian stance. [passage omitted]</p>

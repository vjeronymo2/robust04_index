			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807 3189) and Lu </F> Gang (0712 0474): "National Conference on Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade Opens: Foreign Economic Relations and Trade  System To Undergo Significant Reforms"]    [Text] A conference on national foreign economic relations  and trade opened 7 December in Beijing with some 400 attendees,  all of them persons in charge of departments (committees,  bureaus), special foreign trade companies, and industrial and  commercial enterprises of provinces, cities, autonomous regions,  and cities separately listed in plans across the country, and  organs and units directly affiliated with the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]. The  conference's central agenda was: Guided by the spirit of the  14th CPC Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central  Committee and outlined by the national economic work conference,  study and arrange for next year's various tasks concerning  speeding up reforms and development and promoting the sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of China's foreign trade.    The conference was chaired by MOFTEC Vice Minister Zheng  Silin, who is also party group deputy secretary. Wu Yi, MOFTEC  minister and party group secretary, delivered a report, entitled  "Conscientiously Implement the Spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th Central Committee and Speed Up the  Development of China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade."    Having reviewed the heartening progress in China's foreign  economic relations and trade, Wu Yi pointed out: The guiding  thought for next year's foreign economic relations and trade is  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the deepening of the spirit of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee. Efforts  will be powered by a deepening of reforms in the foreign  economic and trade sector and will center on expanding exports.  We will actively earn foreign exchanges, raise economic  efficiency, seize opportunities, meet challenges, explore  actively, struggle arduously, work hard to complete next year's  foreign economic tasks in excess of planned quotas, and  contribute our share of effort toward reforms, opening up, and  modernization.    -- Further deepen reform in the foreign economic and trade  sector. Beginning next year, state foreign trade and export  enterprises will pursue a unified foreign currency settlement  system and install a unified and managed renminbi floating  exchange rate system based on market demand and supply. These  enterprises will not be required to submit noncompensatory and  compensatory foreign-exchange earnings.    In deepening reforms in the foreign economic and trade  sector, we must, one, perfect the macroregulatory and control  mechanism for exports; two, further deregulate in an orderly  fashion import and export operations; three, deepen reforms in  foreign economic and trade enterprises and reorganize  state-owned foreign economic and trade enterprises modelling on  modern corporate systems; four, maintain the unity of foreign  economic and trade policies throughout the country and increase  transparency; and five, strengthen coordinated macromanagement,  maintain good order in foreign trade, and strengthen the  functions of commercial chambers.    -- Peruse our jobs vigorously to ensure the completion of  next year's foreign trading and export and import tasks. On the  basis of a conscientious summing up of this year's experience,  beginning early next year, we will take expanding exports as the  central task. All types of foreign trade enterprises have a  responsibility to earn foreign exchange for the country. They  must increase their contributions toward increasing the state's  exports and foreign exchange earnings, correctly handle the  relations between specializing in one trade and diversified  operations and between exporting to earn foreign exchange and  economic efficiency, and give top priority to export expansion.  Meanwhile, they must also guarantee the export of key materials  to meet the needs of national economic development. Leading  foreign trade departments at all levels should make it their job  to provide detailed and sophisticated guidance for various types  of foreign economic and trade enterprises and offer quality  services and wholeheartedly solve problems for enterprises in  expanding their exports.    -- Sum up experience, perfect policies, and actively and  effectively utilize foreign capital.    -- Further promote foreign aid and the development of  foreign  economic cooperation; continue to implement new foreign aid  policies, adjust the foreign-aid structure, and reform its  methods; continue to probe for a variety of aid methods in which  aid, mutual benefits, and cooperation are combined; vigorously  pursue direct cooperation between our country's enterprises and  their counterparts in aided countries, open overseas solely  invested or joint-venture enterprises through foreign aid;  further perfect foreign-aid management; and standardize and  manage foreign aid work scientifically.    Further convert the internal mechanisms of firms engaged in  international economic and technological cooperation, perfect  the macromanagement mechanism for contract projects and labor  cooperation, work hard to raise levels of design and consultancy  for overseas contracted construction projects and labor  cooperation, diversify contract labor markets, and integrate  foreign economic cooperation with investment, trade, and other  related areas in moving toward a "great economic and trade  pattern."    -- Uphold principles and handle properly multilateral and  bilateral trade ties.    -- Develop economic and trade cooperation with Taiwan, Hong  Kong, and Macao. Under the general policy of "peaceful  unification and one country, two systems," we will vigorously  promote economic exchanges and trade between the mainland and  the Taiwan region, focusing on attracting large and medium-scale  Taiwan-funded projects and increasing exports to Taiwan in order  to further expand cross- Strait economic cooperation and trade.  While maintaining Hong Kong's and Macao's prosperity and  stability and achieving a smooth transition as the goal, we will  work hard to consolidate and develop economic and trade ties  with the Hong Kong and Macao region, continue to maintain  supplies to Hong Kong and Macao, fully exploit Hong Kong's  unique status and advantages as a financial, trade, transport,  and information center and put these advantages at the service  of expanding the mainland's opening up and modernization.    -- Continue to unwaveringly implement market diversification  and the strategy of achieving good quality. Regions and  foreign-trade enterprises must heighten their understanding,  draw up plans, and adopt effective measures. While  consolidating and developing existing markets, they must  vigorously open new ones and improve the setup of foreign  economic and trade markets. Strong and big enterprises with  goodwill must make stronger effort at opening new markets.  Pursuing the strategy of achieving good quality next year will  focus on cracking down on fake and inferior products. The  problem of quality will be understood as one that reflects  national character and affects our country's image of reform and  opening up. To achieve good quality, ultimately we rely on:  One, science and technology; two, policies; and three,  management. We must cooperate fully with scientific and  technological, production, commercial inspection, and customs  departments and genuinely strengthen quality control and  supervision in a vigorous attempt to achieve a notable  improvement in the quality of our country's exports.    -- Continue to push hard for setting up a foreign economic  and trade legal system. The "foreign trade law" has been  adopted in principle by a routine State Council executive  meeting and is going to be reviewed by the National people's  Congress Standing Committee. The "anti-dumping ordinance,"  "anti-subsidy ordinance," and "protective measures ordinances"  will be submitted to the State Council for review and approval.  Next year, efforts will focus on formulating ancillary rules  and regulations for the "foreign trade law" and specific details  for implementing the three above ordinances, revising or  drafting laws and rules and regulations on the use of foreign  capital in line with the adjustment and perfection of foreign  capital policies, genuinely tightening inspection and  supervision of the unified implementation of foreign economic  and trade policies, and further increasing transparency.  Meanwhile, we must firmly stop and correct such wrong tendencies  as not observing the law, lax enforcement of the law, and  levying fines instead of lawfully required punishments and must  conscientiously review the complaint-response method concerning  antidumping work by boosting investigations and studies,  formulating relevant rules and regulations as quickly as  possible, and setting up standardized procedures for  investigations and complaint response.    -- On the Central Committee's and State Council's unified  planning and revolving around the central tasks in the foreign  economic and trade sector, we will vigorously strengthen the  clean government effort and party style.    -- Do a good job in government organ reforms and strengthen  the construction of foreign economic and trade cadre contingents.    Lastly, Wu Yi said: The most important of all the important  tasks for next year is to deepen reforms in the foreign economic  and trade sector, make good use of state policies, increase  exports and foreign exchange earnings to new levels, and pay  particular attention to ensuring a rise in the growth of exports  and foreign exchange earnings in general trade.</p>

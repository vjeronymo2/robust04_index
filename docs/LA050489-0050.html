			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOGGER ATTACKED IN CENTRAL PARK AWAKES, SPEAKS  </P> <P> A jogger who was beaten and raped in Central Park has emerged from her two-week  coma, spoken to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running, doctors  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I think we have some pretty good news," said Robert S. Kurtz, assistant chief  of surgery at Metropolitan Hospital.  </P> <P> Kurtz and Kent Duffy, chief of neurosurgery, said the 28-year-old woman began  responding Tuesday and had spoken in a whisper to relatives and staff members,  raised two fingers when asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed  with yes, no and her name.  </P> <P> When a nurse told the patient Tuesday that she would like to resume jogging,  the patient replied, "Me, too," Kurtz said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Kurtz said, the woman's brother "walked into her room and said,  'Can you say hello?' And she said hello. There's definite recognition" of her  relatives.  </P> <P> The woman, an investment banker, was on her regular jog through Central Park  the night of April 19 when a gang of youths attacked her. Six teen-agers have  been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault.  </P> <P> By the time she was found, hours later, she had lost three-fourths of her blood  and her temperature had fallen to 80 degrees, officials said.  </P> <P> "She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days or three days,"  Kurtz said. "We would still say . . . she is in a delirium. People in this  stage will fluctuate."  </P> <P> When hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded, "three or four people  started clapping. I was one of them," Kurtz said.  </P></p>

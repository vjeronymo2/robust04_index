			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Economic outlook brightens Evidence emerged yesterday that France and Germany, Europe's two biggest economies, are emerging from recession more strongly than expected. In France the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies predicted growth of 0.7 per cent in the first half, up from December's forecast of 0.5 per cent. The revision is because of unexpected strength in household spending and exports. And in Germany, Mr Tyll Necker, head of the BDI industry federation, detected the first signs of recovery, saying industry was receivinga small boost from increasing export orders. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minster (left), was buoyant: 'Everything is going in the right direction. All our forecasts are being confirmed and, day after day. statistics prove the government's scenario is realistic,' he said. However, Insee expects unemployment to rise to 12.7 per cent. Mr Necker admitted inland consumer and investment demand remained weak, a view endorsed by the Federation of German Retail Traders who said retail sales in western Germany would fall up to 4 per cent this year.</p>

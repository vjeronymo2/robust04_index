			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 DIOCESES IN CONTRAST ON LATINO OUTREACH;  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS: SAN DIEGO HAS BEEN MORE MUTED THAN LOS ANGELES, BUT A NEW FOCUS IS  EXPECTED AFTER A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic bishops often vary in their approaches to issues, but on the  question of immigration the contrasts between church leaders in San Diego and  Los Angeles have been vivid.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony has reached out extensively to the  Spanish-speaking immigrant community, even holding a huge Mass in their honor  at Dodger Stadium in 1986. Mahony, who speaks fluent Spanish, has been at the  national forefront of immigrant issues, openly criticizing U.S. immigration  policies.  </P> <P> San Diego does not have nearly the Spanish-speaking population of Los Angeles,  but it is estimated that Latinos constitute one-quarter to one-half of all  Catholics in the area. Moreover, the region has become perhaps the world's  busiest migratory corridor, traversed by hundreds of thousands of legal and  illegal immigrants annually -- the great majority of them Spanish-speaking and  Roman Catholic.  </P> <P> But, in contrast to Mahony, Bishop Leo T. Maher, spiritual leader of the church  in San Diego for two decades, has not pronounced a direct church mandate on the  issue of immigration. Instead, he has largely remained in the background.  </P> <P> "There has not been from Bishop Maher a very overt effort on behalf of the  immigrants," said Ozvaldo Venzor, an Encinitas Catholic who heads a group  called Friends of the Undocumented.  </P> <P> For his part, Maher said he is thoroughly committed to the migrant issue, but  he noted that the church faces financial limits. He denied that he has been  unresponsive.  </P> <P> "I think we've done a super job," Maher said. "We're trying to do it parish by  parish; that's where the action is. . . . We're doing the best we can. I don't  think there's anything else we can do right now. . . . If you want to satisfy  everybody, you have to be Christ himself."  </P> <P> The diocese's focus could be different after July 1 when Bishop Robert H. Brom  is scheduled to succeed Maher, who will reach the retirement age of 75.  </P> <P> Brom has already signaled some changes. For example, at ceremonies marking his  appointment last summer, the former bishop of Duluth, Minn., spoke partly in  Spanish and stressed the importance of Latinos. He also appears less interested  in pomp and ceremony than Maher; he has been living in an apartment, eschewing  a diocese-purchased, half-million-dollar home. Brom is in Mexico studying  Spanish. Maher has limited command of the language.  </P> <P> In San Diego, observers said Maher's ambivalent approach to the immigration  issue has meant that the church's vast resources have often been channeled in  other directions -- the much-publicized St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center  for the homeless being a notable example -- and not directed to migrants. And,  with the exception of several activist parishes, lay people and clerics alike  have generally felt little urgency to become engaged with the immigrant  community.  </P> <P> If local priests and parishioners want to get involved in migrant-assistance  issues -- conducting Masses, food giveaways and other activities in the fields  -- the bishop has not gotten in the way. But he has not been "front and center  on immigration," in the words of one Carlsbad Catholic who has been active on  behalf of migrants.  </P> <P> A number of parishes -- notably St. Patrick's in Carlsbad, Mission San Luis Rey  in Oceanside and Our Lady of Mt. Carmel in Rancho Penasquitos -- have been  quite active in assisting the thousands of homeless migrant workers who live in  northern San Diego County. But "it's pretty much on a parish-by-parish basis,"  said Father Douglas Regin, pastor of St. Francis Church in Vista who served for  nine years as executive director of Catholic Community Services, the church's  social service arm. "I would say that the bishop does not have an extensive  outreach program for migrant workers."  </P> <P> Even Maher's detractors credit Catholic Community Services with considerable  success during its 1987-88 sign-up of about 27,000 amnesty-seeking undocumented  immigrants, a number that accounts for more than one-quarter of all  legalization applicants in San Diego and Imperial counties. That program,  however, is almost exclusively funded by grants and fees and not by diocesan  money.  </P> <P> Regarding the plight of migrant field hands in North County, the bishop noted  that last April 28 he issued a statement bemoaning their "deplorable"  conditions and urging Catholics to help.  </P> <P> But Venzor and others said that Maher's commentary, which came after both the  U.S. Council of Bishops and the Vatican expressed concern about migrant workers  worldwide, was long overdue, considering the massive scope of the problem  within the diocese and the growing tensions in some areas. The issue of  migrants has become so visible to the church hierarchy, in fact, that Pope John  Paul II is considering visiting Tijuana during his scheduled trip to Mexico  next year.  </P></p>

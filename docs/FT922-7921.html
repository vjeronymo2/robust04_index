			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / CIS totters as five leaders stay away from Tashkent summit A BARE majority of presidents of the Commonwealth of Independent States are expected at today's CIS summit in Tashkent - an attendance which may foreshadow its disintegration. Five of the 11 heads of state have found compelling reasons to stay away and are sending low level delegations. Moldova is attending to allow Mr Valery Muravsky, its prime minister, to present to foreign correspondents the Moldovan case on the conflict in the self-declared republic of TransDnestr. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh leader, warned that the practice of 'mutual threats' between member states had led to a 'dead end' and many leaders preferred 'autarchy' to co-operation. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, was expected to arrive yesterday afternoon and the remaining five presidents who have said they will turn up  -from Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - represent states which are most dependent on Russian resources and/or military protection. The most important absentee will be President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, considered by most of his fellow CIS leaders to be the main cause of its deterioration. Since the last summit in Kiev on March 20, even those states which claim to be most enthusiastic about the continued existence of the CIS have taken further steps away from common policies. Russia has announced formation of its own armed forces and, according to Mr Yeltsin, is to produce a specifically Russian defence doctrine within the month. Only yesterday, Interfax news agency reported Kazakhstan was preparing to introduce its own currency on a limited basis, parallel with the rouble. President Ayaz Mutalibov yesterday declared a state of emergency in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku, as thousands of demonstrators protested against his return to power. He was re-elected by the Azeri parliament, which deposed him just two months ago. His first act was to cancel June elections, which the opposition Popular Front was expected to win. Political turmoil in Azerbaijan has been fuelled by the Azeri setbacks in fighting with Armenians in and around the disputed enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.</p>

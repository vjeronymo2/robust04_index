			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Geza Lajos Nagy: "Public Opinion Survey of the </F> Hungarian Gallup Institute: What Will the Next Four Years  Bring? -- The Voters of the Socialist Party Are Most Optimistic"]    [Text] On 28 and 29 May, the Hungarian Gallup Institute  carried out a survey of a representative sample of 1,500 people  of the adult population on people's expectations regarding the  coming four years. At the time of the survey, the victory by  the Hungarian Socialist Party in the first round of elections  was known, and it seemed very likely that, as a governmental  party, the Socialists would have a determining role in the  country's life. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the  replies show what performance people are expecting of the new  government.    The outgoing government "was found wanting" because everyday  living conditions and the circumstances determining the narrower  and wider scope of life were unfavorable. The country will  judge the performance of the government that is being formed and  the parties that are setting it up in four years' time. As for  the present, all in all, it can be said that the new government  is facing serious burdens regarding the population's  expectations. Whether it is the macroeconomic conditions,  personal living conditions, or issues affecting the political  sphere, the majority or people expect as a minimum that the  situation will not deteriorate. However, as is shown by a  detailed analysis of the data, it is a -- realistic or  unrealistic -- desire of many people for conditions better than  the current conditions to emerge.    On the subject of the country's economic situation in the  next four years, the population's living standards, the  unemployment rate, the level of inflation, the number of poor  and rich people, and the financial situation of their own  family, some one-tenth of people (7-10 percent) cannot choose  between the positive and negative alternatives offered. Almost  twice as many or even more people (17-27 percent) cannot or will  not express their views on the expected changes of the country's  foreign political relations, the political structure, and the  freedom of the press in this brief period.    If we only look at people who have an opinion and are  willing  to express it, we can establish that half (49 percent) of them  believe that the country's economic situation "will improve" in  the coming four years. More than one-tenth (14 percent) have an  opposite view -- "it will deteriorate" -- and more than  one-third (37 percent) believe that the country's economic  situation "will remain similar to the current situation." It  has to be mentioned here that the surveyed people did not select  the two extreme points of the five- point scale of values -- "it  will improve significantly," and "it will deteriorate  significantly." This also applies to the further questions  that, at the same time, indicate that the expectations, whether  positive or negative, are moderate. Therefore, the public  attitude is characterized neither by overt optimism nor by dark  pessimism.    The overall picture is less favorable when people talk about  the expected living standards of the population. The proportion  of those who expect the living standards "to remain similar to  the current one" (41 percent) is almost the same as of those who  expect improvement (39 percent). One-fifth (20 percent) expect  a deterioration of living conditions. Therefore, 10 percent  fewer people expect the improvement of living standards than the  development of the economy, and 6 percent more people mention  their deterioration than economic decline.    As for the financial situation of the families, the  proportion of those expecting improvement is even smaller (34  percent) than the proportion of those who expect a positive  change in the population's living standards. Half (50 percent)  of those who replied do not believe in either a positive or a  negative change, and 16 percent believe that the coming four  years will bring a negative change in the family's financial  situation.    Therefore, the further away we get from the macro-sphere and  the closer to people's everyday living conditions, the more  reserved the expectations become. This is also supported by  people's views on the expected level of inflation. According to  a relative majority (42 percent), inflation will be higher than  the current level in the coming four years, and similar  proportions (28 percent) hope that the level of inflation will  "decrease" or that it will "remain similar to the current level."    Expectations as regards the economy and unemployment are  closely related to each other in people's way of thinking. A  relative majority (45 percent) of people believe that the number  of unemployed people will decrease in the next four years;  according to 23 percent, the situation will be the opposite of  this; and according to 32 percent, the number of unemployed will  not change. Three times as many (64 percent) of those who  believe in economic improvement also believe in the reduction of  unemployment, than those (20 percent) who believe in further  deterioration of the economy. Conversely, more than half (55  percent) of the latter, and 10 percent of the former believe  that the number of the unemployed will exceed the current level  in the next four years.    Although these are cutting issues that directly or  indirectly  affect the everyday conditions, people's views are less  determined by their social situation than by their party  affiliations. The calculations clearly show this. As an  example, let us take the expectations regarding the financial  situation of families and inflation. In both cases, positive  expectations are more influenced by the fact whether someone had  voted for the MSZP or the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] than  by the fact that the person is at the top or bottom -- as  unemployed -- of the social hierarchy. This "logic" is valid in  all cases. The voters of the Socialists and -- although more  moderately -- of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] expect a  better performance in the next four years than the supporters of  the Smallholders, Christian Democrats, or the Hungarian  Democrats.    The Gallup survey also touched upon the future size of the  two opposite ends of society, namely the poor and the rich. The  same proportions of people (46 and 47 percent) believe that, in  the next four years, there will be more poor and more rich  people in the country than currently. However, while  one-quarter (26 percent) trust that the number of the poor will  decrease and 28 percent believe it likely that the current  proportions will remain, 12 percent expect the number of rich  people to decrease and 41 percent believe that their number will  not change.    Based on the replies given to the two questions, the Gallup  prepared an indicator that shows how people see the "movement"  of these two social groups in the future. Accordingly, the  replies can be placed in three groups. The majority (51  percent) expect the same kind of movement in the two groups,  namely either both groups will increase, both will decrease, or  neither will change. According to the second group (30 percent),  the number of rich people will increase more than that of the  poor, and according to the third group (19 percent), the number  of the poor will increase more than that of the rich. Regarding  the proportions of the latter two groups among the voters of  parliamentary parties, it can be established that three times as  many MSZP voters and twice as many SZDSZ voters expect the  population to become richer than to become poorer (MSZP: rich  44, poor 13 percent; SZDSZ: 28 and 13 percent respectively).  As for the voters of the other parties, the proportions of  those who expect one or the other group to increase are nearly  the same. The voters of the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] are an exception to this: More (22 percent) of them  expect the number of poor people to increase than that of the  rich (16 percent).    The public opinion survey only touched on the sphere of  politics. With the help of a question -- that has been asked  many times in the past years -- it examined where people place  Hungary in the dimension of dictatorship and democracy, where  they think it stood at the end of the 1980's, and where it will  be in four years' time. A nine-point scale was used where a 1  meant that the country's political setup is "dictatorial" and a  9 meant "democratic."    Comparing the results of the survey six months ago --  October  1993 -- with the end of May results, no change can be seen as  regards the future. In October 1993, the average for "now" was  5.65, and in May 1994 it was 5.61. Both values indicate that  the country's "current" political system is considered to be  more democratic than dictatorial. As for the near future,  people expected further expansion of democracy at both surveys  (October 6.95, May 6.73).    The voters of two parties -- the MSZP and the MDF -- are  worth mentioning whether we are looking at views on the present  or the future. As opposed to the stability of views typical of  the other parties, the voters of these two parties have a more  positive view of the "present" situation than they did six  months ago. However, as regards the future, the views of these  two groups change in the opposite direction. The expectations  of the MDF supporters have become less favorable -- 7.45 in  October and 6.36 in May -- and that of the MSZP supporters have  become more favorable -- it increased from 6.66 to 7.36. Let us  also note that the Socialist supporters are the only group whose  expectations for the future changed in a positive direction.    People have a less favorable view of the past -- the  political system of the 1980's -- now (4.23) than six months ago  (4.78). This applies to all voters, including the Socialists,  regardless of the party affiliation. However, it also has to be  seen that the views of the Socialist supporters on the 1980's  was better both in October (5.45) and in May (4.80), than among  the voters of other parties.    The general tendency that the Socialist voters expect more  and better in the next four years is also manifest in their  views on the freedom of the press. According to 41 percent of  the replies, the freedom of the press will increase in the next  four years, half (52 percent) do not expect any change, and 7  percent expect it to be reduced. Six out of 10 MSZP voters (59  percent) and four out of 10 SZDSZ or Fidesz voters (44 and 43  percent) expect a positive change in this area. In the other  camp, two to three people out of 10 hold this view: 17 percent  of MDF voters, 20 percent of Independent Smallholders Party  [FKGP] voters, and 29 percent of Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP] voters.    During the election campaign, the question of how Hungary's  foreign relations with the Western and neighboring countries  will change was raised many times. The results of the survey  show that an absolute or relative majority of people also expect  improvement in this area. According to 45 percent of them, the  country's Western relations will improve in the next four years,  12 percent believe that they will deteriorate, and four out of  10 people (43 percent) believe that they will not change. As  for relations with the neighboring countries, even more people  expect positive changes. The view of the absolute majority (54  percent) is that Hungary's relations with the neighboring  countries will improve, and 7 percent have an opposite view.  According to the rest of the people (39 percent), no change  will take place.    Whichever aspect we look at, significantly more Socialist  supporters expect positive changes and a better governmental  performance than the voters of any other party. This is  particularly true for our relations with the neighboring  countries. Almost three-quarters (72 percent) of the MSZP voters  expect our relations with our neighbors to improve in the next  four years compared to now. Some 38 percent of the MDF voters  expect the same.</p>

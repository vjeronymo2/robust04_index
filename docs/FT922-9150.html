			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines ahead of employment data Wall Street A LETHARGIC day on Wall Street saw US equities edge lower in quiet trading ahead of today's release of employment figures for April, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 6.04 to 3,363.37 amid slim New York SE volume of 169m shares. Losing issues narrowly led those advancing by 822 to 812. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.93 to 415.86 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slipped 2.20 to 587.16. The market shrugged off the release of jobless claims for the week ended April 25, which rose 11,000 to 415,000, and turned its attention to today's unveiling of employment data for April. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions are often based partly on the employment numbers, and there has been widespread speculation that the Fed may ease if the numbers are weaker than expected. After two days of solid advances, the transportation sector lost ground, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average finishing off 12.71 at 1,394.99. AMR, parent of American Airlines, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 68 5/8 , UAL, parent of United Airlines, relinquished Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 125 and USAir edged down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 14 5/8 . The release of same-store sales for April by a number of big US retailers spurred active trading in the sector. Sears was one of the most heavily traded board issues, falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 on the back of a 2.1 per cent dip in comparable domestic store sales for the four weeks to May 2. Trading was also heavy in Gap Inc, which climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 after reporting a 13 per cent improvement in comparable store sales for April. Federal Express dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 40 3/4 . The company is cutting prices for large-volume customers in a move aimed at improving its competitiveness. In over-the-counter trading, FHP International added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 15 1/4 after the health maintenance organisation services company posted third-quarter earnings of 45 cents a share, against 36 cents a year ago. Ben &amp; Jerry 'A' shares jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after the ice cream maker announced first-quarter net earnings of 40 cents a share, compared with 19 cents a year earlier. Canada GAINS IN oil and gas shares countered losses in communication issues, keeping the broad market in Toronto looking unchanged on the day. The composite index was up just 1.6 at the finish at 3,362.9, while falls exceeded rises by 273 to 249. Light trading volume of 21.7m shares was well below Wednesday's 30.5m. GW Utilities and Gulf Canada Resources said they will jointly try to sell their controlling interest in Home Oil. The two had been attempting to sell their interests in Home separately. GW held at CDollars 7 1/4 , Gulf Canada lost CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 8 1/8 and Home Oil was CDollars  1/4 firmer at CDollars 16 3/8 . Magna International 'A' climbed CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 32 7/8 , after gaining CDollars  3/4 the previous day. Market sources said the rise is due to a recommendation by a Wertheim Schroder analyst.</p>

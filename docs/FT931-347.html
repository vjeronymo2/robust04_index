			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EBRD in Russian gas study THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development is organising an Dollars 8m study for the rehabilitation of Russia's gas pipeline network to cut back on waste equivalent to Belgium's annual gas consumption. Dr Mark Tomlinson, responsible for energy policy, said the study on combatting leakages and low pressure accounting for the loss of 15 per cent of Russia's gas output would be followed by the awarding of contracts to fix the problems. EBRD's board has already approved five loans in the oil and gas sector amounting to a total of Ecus352.8m (Dollars 419m), and is mobilising an additional Ecus647.8m in western private sector funds. But the money has yet to be disbursed. Guarantees have yet to be worked out with the Russian authorities. In addition there has been the problem of the the World Bank's 'negative pledge' requirement not allowing Russia to pledge resources as collateral to any institution except itself. Saying rapid action was necessary to support Russian reformers, Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD's president, told a news conference in Moscow that he hoped the negative pledge question would be sorted out with the World Bank in the next few weeks. Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president, said there were also outstanding problems over Russia's legal and tax regimes which needed to be sorted out to attract foreign investment. He said that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for economics and finance, was talking to western oil companies in Moscow in order to try and remove those obstacles to reviving the sector. The five loans include a project with Conoco in Russia's constituent Komi republic, and another with the US oil company Anderson and Japan's Itochu.</p>

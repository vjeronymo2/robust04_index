			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Kenyan economic outlook seems bleak KENYA'S economy grew by a meagre 0.4 per cent in 1992, its worst performance since independence 30 years ago, according to official figures. Inflation rose to 27.2 per cent from 19.6 per cent in 1991, and the country is now over Dollars 500m in arrears to its foreign creditors. The outlook for this year is bleak too. The rains have failed, and the government will have to import food it can barely afford to avert famine. The balance of payments crisis is expected to deepen. Since November 1991, Kenya's donors have withheld about Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) of aid intended to shore up the country's external accounts because of alleged corruption and mismanagement. Donors insist President Daniel arap Moi's government establishes a track record of economic reform before another donors' meeting at the end of the year. Meanwhile the balance of payments deficit,after allowing for debt arrears, is expected by private sector economists to reach Dollars 1bn. Mounting arrears on Kenya's Dollars 7bn foreign debt may force the government to seek a rescheduling agreement with the Paris Club of creditor nations. Kenya prides itself in being one of the few African countries which has not renegotiated its foreign obligations. The accumulation of problems has led the government cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. After a very public row in March, in which Mr Moi reintroduced foreign exchange controls and lambasted the Fund and the Bank for imposing 'suicidal' policies, the president recanted. Import licences have been scrapped, the Kenya shilling has been devalued and the foreign exchange market freed again. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, has promised to streamline the financial sector, which is weighed down by insolvent banks with dubious ties to leading politicians in the ruling Kanu party. The central bank's efforts to prop up these 'political banks', as they are known in Kenya, were responsible for the runaway money supply and rise in inflation last year. Mr Mudavadi has promised to close the financial loopholes that allowed these banks to operate, and conduct an external audit of the worst offenders. The audit has yet to take place. Economists outside government doubt whether Mr Mudavadi will be able to deliver on his promises. 'Closing down insolvent banks strikes at the nerve centre of corruption in the ruling Kanu party,' says Mr Robert Shaw, an economic adviser to the opposition Ford-Kenya party. 'Mudavadi has good intentions but he is surrounded by a very powerful mafia.' The World Bank has, however, released Dollars 85m in withheld funds, and will shortly disburse another Dollars 85m tied to export promotion. Mr Shaw and Mr Peter Anyang, a Ford-Kenya member of parliament, yesterday cast doubt on the government's economic figures. They believe the economy contracted by between 1 and 4 per cent last year, and inflation was closer to 40 per cent than 27 per cent.</p>

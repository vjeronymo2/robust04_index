			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd holds dividend despite loss Triplex Lloyd, the Midlands engineering group supplying the power and automotive sectors, is maintaining its dividend in spite of a 1993-94 pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.92m. The loss, foreshadowed in a trading statement last April, compared with a profit of Pounds 7.08m. It was struck after a net Pounds 7.6m of operating losses and exceptional costs involved in disposing of the group's unprofitable building products division. But even before exceptional items, there was a decline in the operating profit on continuing activities from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 7.1m, while turnover rose to Pounds 148.8m (Pounds 133.3m). The decline reflected losses from engineering, where there have been changes in senior management. It followed a decline in the power division's operating margins, associated largely with the bedding down of new equipment and subsequent lateness in starting work on new orders. The effects of this will last into the present half. But by the end of the year, the group order book stood at Pounds 53m, compared with Pounds 44.2m in March 1993. This foretaste of a return to what Mr Colin Cooke, the chairman, called 'healthy profitability' led Triplex Lloyd to dip into reserves and hold the final dividend at 4.5p, maintaining total payments for the year at 7p. 'The UK economy is at last providing some growth and the worst of the recession in Europe appears to be over. We remain confident that our capital investment programme will bring substantial benefit to shareholders,' Mr Cooke said. COMMENT The group has had a year of looking for silver linings in the financial clouds. The disposal of building products checked one haemorrhage and had the effect of lowering future tax charges, which will do wonders for the earnings per share. The engineering division now looks uncomfortable in the group and is not receiving the high levels of investment going to the power and automotive sides, from which will come the strongest revenue stream. By in the second half there should be an uninterrupted flow, leading to 1994-95 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m and producing earnings per share of over 8p. The shares, pushed down and left aside last April at a lower level than last year's rights, but steadier yesterday at 138p, are on a prospective multiple of 17.25. Until promise turns to profit, that looks about right.</p>

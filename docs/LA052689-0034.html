			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BREWERS FINALLY CATCH UP TO STEWART AND BEAT A'S, 4-1  </P> <P> Dave Stewart has been tough on the rest of the American League during his  career, but until Thursday he'd been downright unbeatable against the Milwaukee  Brewers.  </P> <P> Stewart carried a 9-0 record into the game at Milwaukee, the only American  League team never to defeat the Oakland Athletics' two-time 20-game winner.  </P> <P> "When a guy beats you that many times, you're certainly aware of it," Robin  Yount said after driving in the go-ahead run in a 4-1 victory over Stewart and  the A's.  </P> <P> Stewart allowed nine hits, including five doubles, in 7 1/3 innings as his  record fell to 8-2.  </P> <P> Milwaukee starter Bryan Clutterbuck (2-1) allowed a first-inning homer to Dave  Parker but gave up just three more hits before his shoulder stiffened after six  innings. After the game, Clutterbuck said he was OK. Dan Plesac got the final  four outs for his ninth save.  </P> <P> Not only was Milwaukee's victory its first over Stewart, but the Brewers took a  series from the Athletics for the first time since July, 1987.  </P> <P> Milwaukee scored a run against Stewart in the third inning and added another in  the fifth, when Yount doubled home Bill Spiers. The Brewers picked up two more  runs in the eighth on consecutive doubles by Rob Deer, Glenn Braggs and Terry  Francona.  </P> <P> Boston 10, Seattle 0 -- Mike Smithson pitched his first shutout since 1986 and  Mike Greenwell had four hits and four RBIs as the Red Sox completed a  three-game sweep at Boston.  </P> <P> Smithson (2-3) allowed only two runners to reach third base. He gave up eight  hits, struck out six and walked two in his fifth career shutout and first  complete game in four starts this season.  </P> <P> Greenwell singled in a run in the first inning and hit a three-run double in  the second as the Red Sox capitalized on two Seattle errors for five unearned  runs off Mike Dunne (1-3). Greenwell also singled in the sixth and seventh for  his fifth career four-hit game.  </P> <P> Detroit 9, Cleveland 5 -- The Tigers had a season-high nine extra-base hits at  Detroit, including six doubles, to beat the Indians for the third consecutive  time.  </P> <P> Frank Tanana (4-4) pitched the first six innings for Detroit, giving up four  runs and nine hits while striking out seven. Frank Williams took over and  pitched into the ninth, with Guillermo Hernandez getting the last out.  </P> <P> Lou Whitaker hit his 11th homer for the Tigers.  </P></p>

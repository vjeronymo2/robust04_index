			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Altan Oymen: "To Be `Relieved' by a Letter" </F> -- punctuation as published]    [Text] Yes, Turkey's economy is shaky... As we pointed out  yesterday, hope has been vested in the measures the Turkish  Government has to take after 28 March, measures that the  opposition parties should support... It is only then that we  can feel relieved.    However, judging by the reports that were disseminated by  government sources yesterday, we do not have to wait until then.  A new development has taken place and we may begin to relax  immediately.    What was that "development?" Clinton has reportedly sent a  letter to Tansu Ciller. It was a lengthy letter, the text of  which was leaked to one of the newspapers in one way or  another... It contained several promises. It said: "(...) We  eagerly expect to work with you and with your government in the  next few days and weeks."    Well, there is nothing to worry about... The United States  is supporting us... Our economic problems and other difficulties  will be resolved...    Yes, that was the atmosphere that was created by the  government circles and, of course, by the newspaper that  published the letter.    Yes, that was the "atmosphere" that was created. However,  not even children would believe that that "atmosphere" will  improve the situation. A letter from the United States,  greetings from Ronald Reagan, a telephone call from George Bush,  and an encouraging gesture by Clinton...    Rejoicing and congratulating oneself over such developments  is an ailment which has obsessed several of our leading  politicians for many years. That approach has several  drawbacks. It neither promotes their prestige nor adds to the  dignity of their country. Usually, that approach ends in  disappointment. The outcome of the hope we had to "put one in  and take five out" during the Gulf crisis must be recalled at  this point. The telephone calls we received [from the United  States] inspired that hope in Turkey at the time.    Meanwhile, it must be pointed out that the greetings,  telephone calls, and letters are not limited to compliments and  promises. Requests are conveyed in them as well. Naturally, no  head of state will agree to give something to his counterpart  just because he finds his colleague's eyes and conversation  sympathetic. State interests are the determining factor in the  relations between statesmen or stateswomen. And, what is  exchanged cannot be defined as giving or taking. The matter is  known as a "give and take" process.    That matter becomes obvious when the translated version of  Clinton's letter is read, regardless of the strange way it has  been translated into Turkish. For example, the letter contained  a promise for "technical aid" for the realization of Eximbank's  credit of $5 billion for Turkey's imports... Yes, Clinton made  that promise. However, he later said: "I hope that you will  consider the possibility of easing the difficult conditions that  prevent the Patriarchate from becoming a functional institution."    The letter also contained a promise for U.S. support for  Turkey's effort to secure $2.7 billion from the World Bank in  the form of a credit. However, that was followed by a request  for Turkey to "work" more closely with Rauf Denktas on the  Cyprus problem and for "consideration of the political and human  rights aspect of the Kurdish problem."    Several of those requests may be related to matters on which  Turkey already wishes to adopt a decision in accordance with its  own will.    However, let us consider the side that should be blamed for  the inclusion of those matters in that letter... Furthermore,  let us consider the self-exaltation for "having received such a  letter..." Is there any aspect of that development that would  make a serious state feel "relieved?"</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Heavy selling in the derivatives market saw the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index record exceptionally high turnover and drag the underlying market down yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers had expected the previous day's strong performance to continue after March opened at 3,543 and early demand by locals soon had the contract moving ahead. However, the release of disappointing German monetary figures brought a turnaround in March after the first hour, and an announcement shortly afterwards that there would be no press meeting following the Bundesbank Council meeting triggered the day's strong selling. Confirmation that there would be no German interest rate reduction only served to increase the general profit-taking by market participants and was in part responsible for pulling the underlying cash market lower. The March future traded at a discount to cash for most of the session and finished the day at 3,494, down 36 from its previous close and around 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash which now stands at zero. Volume was again heavy, reaching 20,757 lots by the official close. Turnover in the traded options fell to 41,397 contracts from Wednesday's total of 54,902. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was steady at 17,935, but the Euro FT-SE option was well down, seeing a mere 1,018 lots dealt. Hanson was the busiest stock option at 2,287 contracts, followed by Lonrho at 2,258.</p>

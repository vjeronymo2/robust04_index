			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Heseltine is challenged over Nadir LABOUR yesterday called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to 'clear the air' over his approach to another minister about the prosecution of fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, urged Mr Heseltine to restart proceedings to 'ban' Mr Nadir, founder of the Polly Peck business empire, as a UK company director. There was no longer any purpose postponing these pending a trial, Mr Cook said, and continued delay would only 'deepen the doubts about Asil Nadir's relationship with this government'. Mr Nadir, who faces 13 charges of theft and false accounting involving about Pounds 34m, fled the UK a month ago. Mr Cook also called on Mr Heseltine to reveal who it was who had persuaded him to 'take up' Mr Nadir's case. The Department of Trade and Industry said Mr Heseltine recalled somebody approaching him about concerns over the way the Serious Fraud Office was handling the case, and he had passed those on to Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general. To the best of his recollection, Mr Heseltine had never met Mr Nadir. Mr Heseltine is the third minister - after Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister and a close political ally of Mr Heseltine, and Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary - to have been embroiled in the row over Mr Nadir. Mr Mates has admitted having meetings on the subject with the attorney-general. Mr Cook said yesterday: 'It is bad enough that a junior minister like Michael Mates should have taken up cudgels for Asil Nadir. It is breathtaking that the very cabinet minister with responsibility for company laws should put in a word for a man charged with comprehensively breaking them. Michael Heseltine's job at trade is to make sure company law protects the innocent, not to make representations to protect a private individual charged with defrauding the public.' Contacted in Cyprus last night, Mr Nadir refused to comment. he He hoped everything 'would be clearer by the end of the month'.</p>

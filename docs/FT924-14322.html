			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Man in the News: Knocking on Chinese walls - Chris Patten As John Major and Norman Lamont return home from this week's bruising Conservative party conference they might spare a thought for Hong Kong, where their former party chairman has emerged in good shape from a similarly testing week. On Wednesday, Mr Chris Patten, who in April lost his parliamentary seat and shortly after was appointed the colony's 28th and last British governor, presented a blueprint for Hong Kong's political development over the five remaining years of UK rule. His plans to increase local participation in politics drew a predictably sharp response from China, but in Hong Kong they were well received. Polls show his personal approval rating at nearly 70 per cent and approval for his measures nearer to 80 per cent. Most astonishing of all, an estimated 10m people in neighbouring Guangdong province on mainland China watched Mr Patten's first public meeting, broadcast live on television in English and Cantonese on Thursday evening. What they, and the people of Hong Kong saw, was the governor explaining why his proposals for greater democracy were necessary for Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity. Of equal importance, they saw him take questions from ordinary people about his plans for increased spending on health, education and the environment. The governor answered candidly and with humour. Speaking in his office at Government House yesterday and flanked by photographs of R A B Butler and Edward Boyle - two leading British Conservative education secretaries - Mr Patten was in reflective mood. He appeared conscious of the historical significance of his task, clear in his aims and alert to the risks of failure. 'I'm aware that a lot of people are going to see a good deal of our colonial history through the prism of how we manage things in Hong Kong,' he said. 'So I'd like in 1997 to have been thought to have done that job honourably and honestly.' When Mr Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July he brought a tradition of Westminster democracy unknown to the people of Hong Kong. His penchant for chatting to people on the streets - engaging in, as he says, 'a little retail therapy' - has paid handsome dividends. But there is a political point to this open and accessible style of leadership. Together with answering questions in the legislative council, the colony's foremost law-making institution, which he hopes will be a permanent feature of his governorship, this openness is his way of demonstrating that accountability can produce better government. This accountability acts, he hopes, as a counterweight to the legitimacy he lacks as an unelected political leader. 'I believe that the people of Hong Kong have to be consulted about their future political developments, not just diplomats in London and Peking,' he says. Despite full backing from London for his plans, Mr Patten faces a daunting task in trying to win China's acquiescence. He must convince Beijing that his proposals are in its interests. He has therefore challenged China to make alternative proposals capable of winning the support of Hong Kong's people. At the same time Mr Patten will remind China that whatever plans he finally agrees have to win the support of the legislature. But what if Mr Patten fails, as some political commentators in the colony predict, to convince China that his course of action is best for Beijing and Hong Kong? Mr Patten's response borders on a call for 'unilateral action' - possibly pressing ahead with the blueprint without China's approval. 'We may have to agree to differ,' he says. 'I remain solidly of the view that we can demonstrate in Hong Kong, between now and 1997, that our governing institutions work effectively, and I don't think people change things that work effectively. I remain very confident about that. 'The notion that preventing people moving modestly forward towards their political aspirations is the right way of promoting political stability, whereas trying in a reasonable way to accommodate those modest ambitions does the reverse is, in my judgment, and I would have thought the judgment of history, preposterous.' Mr Patten is equally robust in his defence of the rule of law. It is almost more important than anything else in the colony, he says, mindful of the deep-seated fear among the people of Hong Kong that come 1997 corruption could engulf the colony as it has in China. 'It's the rule of law and a pretty competent and clean government which have been part of the mix (of Hong Kong society) that has produced this economic miracle. I've got no doubt about that. The stability, the certainty, the security which the law provides is absolutely key.' Mr Patten's plans for Hong Kong have been described by local commentators as 'bold' and 'forthright'. Yet these adjectives could soon give way to 'over-optimistic' and 'foolhardy' if China wages a campaign to undermine and discredit the Patten blueprint. The stakes are high. He is wise enough to recognise this, and brave enough to speak candidly of the consequences. He has a clear idea - based on his own ambitious definition of success - of what constitutes failure. It is 'above all, being thought not to have recognised our moral as well as political responsibility for the way of life of the people of Hong Kong. 'But it would also be failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong Kong is mature, sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable of doing a lot more to look after its own affairs. 'I would have failed if I hadn't been able to persuade China that politics in a free society is no threat; I'd have failed if I wasn't able to convince the people of Hong Kong to have the same sort of resilience and self-confidence in the modestly democratic conduct of their own affairs which they show every day in every financial and commercial market in the world. 'That would be failure. But, I may well fail.'</p>

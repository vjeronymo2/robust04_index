			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: "How Long Will the World </F> Remain a Spectator Vis-a-Vis the Palestinian People?"]    [Text] How long will the world community silently watch the  Palestinian people being exterminated, not only in the streets  and the refugee camps but also inside the mosques in an  unprecedented brutal way?    Where are the international human rights organizations whose  task is to protect people everywhere?    When will the world act to protect the Palestinians inside  the occupied territories?    What is the fate of the Middle East peace process?    Many questions rise in the minds of observers and political  analysts everywhere in the wake of the ugly massacre perpetrated  by a Jewish settler inside the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on the  West Bank at dawn yesterday. The massacre has dismayed Muslims  everywhere and reminded them of the burning of the al-Aqsa  Mosque. It has dismayed the whole world with them. Peace loving  forces in Israel have strongly condemned the act.    We believe that this massacre is not part of the daily,  mutual Palestinian Israeli violence and killings but a  premeditated crime with serious implications, not merely because  of its hideousness, the method in which it was carried out at  this particular time, and the number of martyrs and wounded who  fell in it, but because it raises numerous doubts about the  Israeli authorities' ability to provide security for the  Palestinian people, whose land is under occupation. At the same  time, the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been  stumbling for months as a result of Israeli security claims.    Egypt strongly condemns this criminal action and urges the  world community to act promptly to protect the Palestinian  people as Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa demanded yesterday.    We also believe that this hideous massacre raises several  important points. First, any discussion of security  requirements in the framework of the current Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations must focus primarily on providing security not for  the Israelis, as the Israeli delegation is demanding, but for  the Palestinians. The danger threatens only the unarmed  Palestinians who demand to live free on their national soil like  all other nations. Thus Israel's security pretext totally  collapses.    Second, keeping the settlements inside the Palestinian  territories is an issue that comes forcefully to the fore in the  negotiations and requires a decisive solution. Peace will not  come as long as the settlements stay and as long as their  residents carry weapons with permission from the authorities and  fire indiscriminately and with impunity on civilian women,  children, and old people, perpetrating ugly massacres against  them as happened at dawn yesterday while worshipers were praying  in the Ibrahimi Mosque.    Third, this terrible crime has proven the need to expedite  the peace moves, particularly on the Palestinian-Israeli track,  on the grounds that the Palestinian issue is at the core of the  Middle East conflict. The Declaration of Principles, the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and the Cairo Agreement must be  implemented so that the Israeli Government can demonstrate its  sincere intentions to establish a just peace that will serve the  good of all the nations in the Arab region. We believe that it  is now Israel's responsibility to carry this out because the PLO  has shown the utmost flexibility for the sake of peace.    Fourth, any Israeli delay or procrastination is bound to  encourage extremists on both sides to carry out lethal strikes  with the aim of burying the peace. Delay will open the door  wide for mutual violence. On the same note, the Jewish settlers  and the Israeli forces must be banned from opening fire in such  an insane manner on an unarmed population whose land was  occupied by force.    Fifth, this criminal incident lays a great and direct  responsibility on the shoulders of the two peace sponsors,  particularly U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Europe, whose  peace is intimately linked with the Middle East's security and  peace. Their reactions must not be limited to denunciations and  expressions of sorrow. The Palestinian people, and all the  world's free peoples, are waiting for a positive reaction. Nor  is Sarajevo's incident far from the mind.    Any delay on the part of the Israeli Government to adopt  deterrent measures against the perpetrators of the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, any failure to halt the Jewish settlers'  criminal actions, and a slow reaction by the world community to  protect the Palestinians will have serious negative  repercussions, not only for the peace process but for the  security of the Israeli people themselves. It is time the  Israelis learned that a just peace is the only way to ensure  their security and protection.</p>

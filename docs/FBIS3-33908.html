Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS  Executive Committee abroad, said in a statement to AL-HAYAH: "We  cannot say whether what has happened (Zeroual's appointment) is  positive or negative. We are not interested in individuals but  in the policy to be pursued by Zeroual. We will be able to  judge when the features of this policy become clear."    He pointed out that the statement he issued the day before  yesterday, in which he attacked the Algerian authorities, was  not aimed against the new president, Zeroual. But it "expresses  our fixed position rejecting all attempts by putschists to  prolong the life of their regime, which has become bankrupt at  all levels. We in the FIS are waiting until Zeroual's policy  becomes clear so that we can pass judgment." However, he  reiterated the FIS' position of refusing to recognize the  regime's legitimacy. He said: "We do not forget that the  present regime, like the previous one, is a military regime that  lacks constitutional and popular legitimacy."    Asked whether he had found in Zeroual's speech any positive  indications of a desire for reconciliation, he said: "Zeroual's  speech -- as we heard it -- included both the reconciliation  aspect and the terrorist aspect, so I reiterate that his policy  is still unclear."    Kebir does not expect recent changes to affect the military  activities of elements of the armed Islamic movement supporting  FIS, which are now called the Islamic Salvation Army, "until  after the new president's policy becomes clear." On the effect  of recent contacts between the Algerian authorities and the  detained FIS leaders on the other FIS leaders, especially those  present abroad, he said: "We stressed in the past that the  legitimate and historic FIS leadership is represented in Shayk  Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, and it pleases us to see that  contacts are conducted with them to extricate the country from  the crisis. But these contacts should be based on good  foundations that restore the Algerian people's dignity and their  right to live under the Islamic state they have chosen." He  said that detained FIS leaders who have been contacted stressed  to representatives of the authorities that "we are part of the  leadership but not all the leadership. We must be allowed to  meet with the other brothers concerned. Then we will be able to  take the right legitimate position." He pointed out that the  contacts made were merely discussions, not a dialogue as the  detained leaders were reported to have said.    In a statement issued last Sunday Kebir condemned in FIS'  name the assassination of Shayk Mohamed Bouslimani, describing  it as "part of a campaign designed to drive a wedge between  Islamists." Official Algerian reports said yesterday that the  "Armed Islamic Group" (Ja'far al-Afghani's group) had claimed  responsibility for the assassination of Bouslimani, who is close  to Hamas [Islamic Society Movement]. And that the assassination  order was issued by al-Afghani himself. However, Shayk Rabeh  Kebir told AL-HAYAH: "Our information indicates that it was the  authorities' organs which abducted Shayk Bouslimani and  committed the crime. The so-called Free Algerian Youth  Organization claimed responsibility for the operation. This  organization is known to be a branch of the intelligence  service."</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: City flashes red as Amber Day succumbs to Green - Cheap, cheerful and profitable. Jane Fuller files a report from the bottom of the market RUNNING A chain of discount stores in a recession sounds like a licence to print money. Amber Day, headed by Mr Philip Green, a 'love him or hate him' type of businessman, seems to have borne out this theory. Last year it more than trebled pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m thanks to the What Everyone Wants discount chain. WEW contributed an impressive Pounds 13.1m operating profit on Pounds 81m sales. Mr Green had bought the Glasgow-based concern in June 1990 from Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld - since departed because of a disagreement. This year, with debt virtually wiped out by a rights issue and the loss-making menswear business discarded, Amber Day is forecast to add another Pounds 5m to pre-tax profits. And yet the performance of the share price over the past couple of months has been dismal. After climbing to a peak of 129p in November, the price sunk as low as 71p last week. A recovery in the past few days has taken it to 86p, just above last June's rights issue level of 83p. The company has been the subject of two bear raids, one after Mr Green's statement at the annual meeting that like-for-like sales were down a bit, the other after a rather more personalised whispering campaign. Supporters of the stock insist that the group is telling a plausible success story, fuelled by growth in the discount sector. The background is amply described by County NatWest in its recent report on discount retailing. It presents the bustling UK high street of the 1980s as an aberration. 'Trading up was a pervasive trend, with retailers becoming design- and marketing-led rather than buying- and price-led.' This left an increasing gap at the bottom of the market and it contrasted with other countries, particularly the US, 'where price continued to be a potent weapon and a multiplicity of new discount formats emerged'. WEW, which has been going for about 20 years, has exploited that basement gap through its concentration on low costs, buying power and high sales volume. Going round WEW shops, which have the bargain-appeal of a street market but are laid out like a department store, it is easy to see why customers come: two thirds of the items are priced at less than Pounds 10. But how can an operating margin of 16 per cent be delivered at this level? The low-cost element of the formula revolves around the sites and the staff. Mr Graham Coles, finance director, says shop rents have accounted for less than 2 per cent of sales - as with Kwik Save and Marks and Spencer - compared with up to 13 per cent at some high-street boutiques. WEW shops are edge-of-centre and a third are either freehold or long lease. The large floorspace reduces the average rent per sq ft and the amount of selling space is maximised. Staffing numbers are kept flexible through the use of part-timers. At the recently opened store in Coventry, for instance, the weekly wage bill before Christmas was Pounds 5,200; in January it was cut to Pounds 2,200. On the buying side, Mr Green has long been combing the Far East for cheap goods. 'I've been going there since 1975 and I understand everything from buying the fabric to putting the zippers in. I have a lot of knowledge of what the intrinsic cost is.' Importing directly from the manufacturer, buying in bulk and having the cash to close a deal quickly all play their part. Once the goods arrive in the shops, the emphasis is on shifting them. 'The stock room is a dirty word in this business,' says one area manager. But although sales volume is an obvious ingredient, the emphasis since Mr Green took over has switched to the bottom line. Indeed last year's sales of Pounds 81m were only Pounds 6m ahead of the 1989-90 figure, even though the number of shops went up from 36 to 44 (now 51). Profit, on the other hand, roughly doubled. Mr Green says: 'When I bought it, the gross margin was 27 per cent, stock loss (mainly theft) was 7 per cent, and mark-downs 10 per cent. I won't say what the gross margin is now, but it's obviously better. We've halved the stock loss and mark-downs are only 4 per cent.' So why the continued scepticism, manifesting itself not only in the vulnerability to bear raids, but also in a lack of coverage by some of the main retail analysts? Part of the answer lies in Amber Day's history, or lack of it. In 1987, a consortium including Mr Irvine Sellar, whose property company Ford Sellar Morris recently failed, injected Pounds 2m into Amber Day Holdings, a loss-making clothes maker and importer. The following year, Mr Green came in with the backing of Mr Tony Berry, fellow Tottenham Hotspur fan and then still head of Blue Arrow. Mr Green invested proceeds from the sale of his Jean Jeannie business and Blue Arrow took a 10 per cent stake - promptly sold after Mr Berry's resignation in 1989. One of the first moves was to buy the Review menswear shops from Mr Sellar's company for Pounds 5.5m. Review and Woodhouse, another acquisition, fell into losses of Pounds 300,000 last year (after a couple of years of profits) and were sold in December for Pounds 750,000. One analyst remarked icily that the sliding performance of these shops suggested that Mr Green was 'not such a brilliant retailer'. Amber Day also had a tilt at Moss Bros in 1989, but was brushed off rather sniffily. After that thwarting, Mr Green's set his sights on WEW. A 5-for-8 rights issue at 45p per share raised just over Pounds 13m towards the Pounds 46.7m purchase - twice the market value of Amber Day. Not surprisingly, a 1-for-3 rights issue was launched last June to raise Pounds 24.4m to cut debt. The effect is that in less than two years, Amber Day has mounted a big money-raising exercise in order to relaunch itself as What Everyone Wants. Hence the truncated track record. To try to improve the group's credibility, Mr Green has changed auditors - from Stoy Hayward to Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte; changed brokers - from Laing &amp; Cruickshank to Smith New Court - and appointed a finance director. But he remains chairman and chief executive, an out-of-fashion combination that has helped fuel a fear he might be the next Gerald Ratner. For the future, questions revolve partly around the sustainability of profits growth in discount retailing. Competition has intensified from more upmarket high-street retailers, which keep putting on sales, and from several regional discount chains. As for margins, with price as the main competitive weapon, the potential pressure is clear. Others suspect that the bigger WEW gets, the less easy it will be for it to make use of 'opportunity buys' - ends of lines, cancelled orders, fire-sale batches from receivers. Mr Green argues that that type of deal only provides a few per cent of group sales these days. The final question goes back to the recession. When the UK comes out of it, will some of WEW's customers trade up again? Mr Green says: 'Why will people pay more just because someone tells them the recession is over?' As these imponderables swirl around, some scepticism is bound to persist about the company. It is worth remembering that because of the extra shares in issue, it must raise pre-tax profits by 26 per cent this year just to keep earnings in line with last year's 7.05p. This excludes an extraordinary charge that will be taken for the menswear business disposal. One thing is certain, however. Mr Green is the just the sort of man who would love to prove the sceptics wrong.</p>

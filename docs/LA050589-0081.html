			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EL SEGUNDO DRAFTS CURBS ON SMOKING  </P> <P> Smoking will be banned in city-owned buildings and public areas of banks,  restaurants and other establishments under a new law drafted by El Segundo  officials.  </P> <P> Council members are expected to adopt the nonsmoking ordinance when they meet  May 16. The law would go into effect 30 days later.  </P> <P> The proposed regulations follow those advocated by Americans for Non-Smokers  Rights, a nonprofit organization that lobbied council members to draft the  ordinance.  </P> <P> Besides prohibiting smoking in city buildings and public areas, the ordinance  will require restaurants with more than 40 seats to create nonsmoking areas.  Those with fewer than 40 seats will be required to post a sign telling  customers whether smoking is allowed.  </P> <P> Also, employers must maintain nonsmoking areas in lounges and cafeterias and  establish smoke-free areas for non-smokers "to the maximum extent possible."  Employers will not be forced to create smoke-free areas if it requires them to  incur any expenses.  </P></p>

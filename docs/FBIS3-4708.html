			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pak Chong-mun] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu looked relieved and  confident as he was giving his first exclusive interview to  HANGYORE SINMUN.    This was because North Korea finally consented to the start  of International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear inspections after  delaying it during the ongoing negotiations with the United  States. North Korea had accepted inspections on 15 February.  Han Sung-chu was appointed foreign minister when the Kim  Yong-sam regime was inaugurated February 1993 and has been  entangled in the North Korean nuclear issue ever since. He  could not help but be nervous whenever some progress was made in  the North Korean-U.S. negotiations on nuclear inspections.    While watching the North Korean-U.S. working-level contact  in  New York, Minister Han worried that something may go wrong  because North Korea has persistently refused to accept  North-South exchange of special envoys as a precondition for the  third stage of North Korean-U.S. talks. When it was pointed out  the letter of agreement between North Korea and the United  States, which was released on 25 February in New York, does not  say the North-South exchange of special envoys is a precondition  for the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks, Minister Han flatly  said: "We can say the U.S. position that no third stage of  North Korean-U.S. talks can be held without an exchange of  special envoys was implemented."    This means that even though North Korea opposed the  inclusion  of the special envoy issue in the letter of agreement to save  face, it accepted this condition in actuality.    Asked why he thought so, he said: "The United States  immediately notified us of the results of the discussions at the  New York contact. In doing so, it asked us whether we consented  to such a letter of agreement. After confirming the U.S. will  for the special envoy issue, we expressed our approval on the  letter of agreement."    Probably conscious of the domestic criticism that the United  States took the initiative in the negotiations on the nuclear  issue and that the ROK was detached from the negotiations  between the United States and North Korea, Minister Han  stressed: "I can say our government has taken the initiative in  improving the situation. An example of this is that we have  persistently pursued to resolve the issue through dialogue."  Minister Han recently (from 9 to 19 February) visited the  United States, where it was strongly demanded that sanctions be  imposed on North Korea, and reconfirmed the ROK- U.S. basic  position that the nuclear issue must be resolved through  dialogue. Some people say this has affirmatively affected the  negotiations between the United States and North Korea and led  North Korea to accept nuclear inspections.    It is not clear, however, whether the minister's policy of  resolving issues through dialogue led North Korea to accept  nuclear inspections or whether North Korea accepted nu?lear  inspections because it had no other choice.    North Korea accepted nuclear inspections while he was  discussing the North Korean nuclear issue with U.S. leaders. As  a result, his U.S. visit proved to be productive. In this  sense, he was lucky.    When Minister Han returned home from the United States, some  people alleged that he leaned toward the North. Maybe conscious  of the allegation, he cautiously talked about the improvement of  North Korean-U.S. relations. He said: "One can think of  several interim stages in North Korean-U.S. relations between  the present status and the establishment of full diplomatic  relations. Such stages may include lifting the virtual economic  embargo imposed on North Korea, allowing businessmen to visit  North Korea, and opening liaison offices." He stressed that  when the nuclear issue is resolved, the improvement of relations  between North Korea and the United States and between North  Korea and Japan is not unfavorable to the ROK.    He pointed out that North Korea must be cautious of its  fixed idea of the zero sum game in reunification diplomacy.    Minister Han had said that we must face the fact that  matters  that concern North Korea, will also be matters that will concern  us. His view stems from the common principle that consideration  must be guaranteed if one is to convince the other side. This  takes root in the work of Harvard University Professor Thomas  (Schilling) entitled, "Strategy in Disputes," which he was  deeply impressed with during his school days. Professor  (Schilling)'s book developed the theory on methods for  contemporary and international politics, such as the theories of  games.    When asked if he had a hard-line view or moderate view in  connection with the issues on North Korea, Minister Han said  that he does not want to be classified as a hard-liner or  soft-liner, but emphasized: "I believe that I am a realist."    It seems clear that when we examine his remarks on North  Korean issues and on how he handles his work, he is a "realist."  When the nuclear negotiations were in a difficult situation,  Minister Han minutely adjusted the priorities in his remarks,  and considering his status within the government and the  president's position, he refrained from making unreasonable  acts. We cannot say that he has complete command over the  career officials within the Foreign Ministry, but it also does  not mean that he is being dragged around by the officials.    When asked about the current reunification policy and the  status of the National Unification Board, Minister Han refrained  from making any remark by saying that it is not his field of  work. He just said: "The Korean commonwealth reunification  formula was announced in 1989. However, it seems that this  formula does not sufficiently reflect the important changes that  took place in the international environment since then."    After teaching at New York University until the late  seventies, Minister Han returned to the ROK to teach at Koryo  University. Since then he has taken part in the government's  foreign policies by becoming a member of the diplomatic policy  advisory committee of the Foreign Ministry and a member of the  ROK-Japan 21st Century Committee. He also accumulated a  considerable international reputation as a guest columnist of  NEWSWEEK. He is recognized as the minister among all former  foreign ministers who has the best command of English. This is  attributed to the fact that he lived in the United States for a  long period of time. Prominent press and publications in the  United States sometime show unprecedented friendliness by  publishing special reports on him.    The interview now changed to the subject of trade and  pending  economic issues, such as the issue of opening the rice market,  NAFTA, and the issue of Russia repaying economic cooperation  funds. In particular, the issue of opening the rice market and  taking part in NAFTA are issues that remain a challenge to him.    He said: "I believe that it will be inevitable to hold  negotiations again on agricultural products because the  countries participating in the Uruguay Round did not attach  conditions when submitting the letter of content in the  agricultural product field." He is saying that it is agonizing,  but we cannot but keep the promise on opening our agricultural  products, such as opening the rice market.    There are pros and cons between the government and academic  circles on our participation in NAFTA, which officially went  into effect early this year. However, Minister Han presented a  considerably clear countermeasure. Considering the pace of  progress in our efforts to achieve internationalization,  Minister Han thinks that the issue of joining NAFTA must be  examined in the long-term, and that at the moment we must  promote cooperation with NAFTA member countries--the United  States, Canada, and Mexico. He said: "In July, the U.S.  Administration is planning to submit to Congress a report on  methods to operate NAFTA, including ways to establish relations  with nonmember countries. After taking this into consideration,  we must establish countermeasures regarding this matter. Rather  than becoming an official member of NAFTA, we must try to  utilize various forms, such as becoming an associate member or  establish special cooperative relations."    In connection with Russia's proposal to repay economic  cooperation funds by providing up-to-date weapons and carry out  joint venture projects, Minister Han showed a prudent attitude  by saying: "Since this is an issue directly related to economic  cooperation and security, the government's overall view will be  provided after discussing this matter with related ministries."    Minister Han has been criticized that he concentrates too  much on diplomatic policy issues to the detriment of internal  reform issues. This is because internal reform to resolutely  improve irrational diplomatic manpower structures and revise the  network of diplomatic establishments abroad are still at a  standstill. Many diplomats observing him hope that rather than  seeking a simply realistic attitude, he will join in the ranks  of carrying out reform.</p>

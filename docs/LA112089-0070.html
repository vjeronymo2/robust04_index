			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST PREVIEW;  </P> <P> MORRISON HAPPY, EVEN THOUGH HE RETURNS AT THE BOTTOM  </P> <P> Oct. 15 was a happy day for Stan Morrison, which besides being his birthday is  the day college basketball teams are allowed to begin practicing.  </P> <P> "When I blew the whistle for the first time Oct. 15, I really got chills and  goosebumps like the first time when I was a high school coach," Morrison said.  "Only people who have been in coaching and then out of it can understand it."  </P> <P> Morrison, who had once been a successful coach at Pacific, spent the past three  years at UC Santa Barbara, working as the athletic director after he resigned  at USC. He left coaching behind in 1986.  </P> <P> But he yearned to get back on the court, and now he has, taking over at San  Jose State for Bill Berry, who was fired after a season in which 10 players  walked out in a dispute with Berry. The Spartans finished with a 5-23 record,  1-17 in the Big West Conference.  </P> <P> The talent on his team this season might be more similar to a high school team  than Morrison would like. He has two returning starters in guards Tom Desiano  and Dwain Daniels, but both were reserves before the walkout.  </P> <P> Four players who walked out talked with Morrison about returning. Morrison  considered it for about 10 days, but he decided not to allow it.  </P> <P> "A lot of coaches were waiting to see if I would give license to that method of  solving problems," he said.  </P> <P> He won't, but he said he is helping the players transfer.  </P> <P> Morrison calls Ken Young, a 6-7 forward who sat out last season to concentrate  on academics, "easily our best player."  </P> <P> Terry Cannon, a freshman from Crenshaw High School, is likely to start at point  guard.  </P> <P> Elsewhere on Morrison's roster, talent is somewhat lacking. Numbers, however,  are not. Morrison is carrying 19 players and says the bench will be two rows  deep at home games.  </P> <P> Along with the new faces, the Spartans have a new arena on campus, the  4,600-seat, $36-million Recreation and Events Center.  </P> <P> But it will take some time before Morrison can reconstruct the program.  </P> <P> "It's easily the most inexperienced team I've ever been around," Morrison said.  "It's also one of the most enjoyable. There are no egos -- there are no reasons  to have egos."  </P> <P> A look at the rest of the conference:  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 16-13, 10-8  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie)  </P> <P> Cedric Ceballos has been regarded as one of the country's best little-known  players so often by now that he may cease to qualify for the honor.  </P> <P> A 6-foot-7, extremely athletic forward, Ceballos led the conference in scoring  last season with a 21-point average and was second in rebounding, averaging  nine.  </P> <P> Three other starters -- sophomore point guard Wayne Williams, senior shooting  guard Mark Hill and senior center John Sykes also return to a team that last  season was picked to finish ninth in the conference, but surprised almost  everyone -- including Nevada Las Vegas, upsetting the Rebels. Their performance  under acting Coach John Sneed helped hand Sneed a three-year contract at  season's end.  </P> <P> CAL STATE LONG BEACH  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 13-15, 10-8  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie)  </P> <P> This is the mystery team of the conference, although the talented newcomers are  no secret to the coaches who competed for them. Nine of 14 players will be  playing for Long Beach for the first time, and five didn't play anywhere last  year, some of them coming off redshirt years because of injuries, transfers or  academics. The standouts inside are Kevin Cutler, a 6-7, 220-pound junior  forward who sat out last season when he became academically ineligible after  transferring from a community college, and Frankie Edwards, a sophomore out of  Millikan High who was ineligible last season under Proposition 48.  </P> <P> Tyrone Mitchell, a senior guard, is the only returning player who will start.  Troy Joseph, Kenny Jarvis and Lucious Harris are also battling for starting  spotd.  </P> <P> "People are talking about Long Beach State and our improvement," Coach Joe  Harrington said. "The truth is, we will be improved and I'm excited about this  year. We ought to be improved. We spent three years recruiting our butts off to  improve and we ought to get there."  </P> <P> FRESNO STATE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 15-14, 9-9  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Seventh  </P> <P> Coach Ron Adams began his preseason comments to the media with a greeting:  "It's good to be here," he said. There was an extra note of sincerity.  </P> <P> Adams' teams won only nine games in each of his first two seasons, and he was  considered on shaky ground until his team pulled out a winning record last  season.  </P> <P> Wilbert Hooker, a guard who averaged 11 points a game as a freshman, is back,  as are senior point guard Bijou Baly and part-time starting forward Pat  Riddlesprigger, a sophomore. The performance of new players will be critical,  particularly swingman Tod Bernard, a sophomore who was academically ineligible  last season, and junior forward Chris Henderson, a transfer from DePaul who  should become eligible in December.  </P> <P> NEVADA LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 29-8, 16-2  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: First  </P> <P> Even Jerry Tarkanian, usually loathe to admit his team's excellence, concedes  that this team is special.  </P> <P> Assuming center David Butler and forward Moses Scurry can regain their academic  eligibility by December as expected, the only key player lost from the team  that upset Arizona in making it to the final eight of the NCAA tournament last  season is forward George Ackles, out with a broken wrist. And added to the mix  is forward Larry Johnson, the 6-foot-7 Odessa (Tex.) College transfer who has,  for the time being, relegated forward Stacey Augmon, the Big West player of the  year last season, to second billing on the team.  </P> <P> "This team has better talent than our Final Four team," Tarkanian said,  referring to the Rebels' 1987 team. "But our Final Four team had perfect  chemistry."  </P> <P> The Rebels, with Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt in the backcourt, are the  preseason No. 1 team by the Associated Press.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we should be No. 1," Tarkanian said. "I think that after Dec.  17 (when Butler and Scurry should become eligible), we are right there with the  best teams, like Syracuse, Georgetown and LSU."  </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 21-11, 12-6  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Second  </P> <P> The Aggies are still smarting over being left out of the NCAA tournament last  season despite finishing second to UNLV and winning 21 games. A nonconference  schedule that was perceived to be weak probably was the reason.  </P> <P> This season, with very little experience, the Aggies shouldn't be expected to  contend.  </P> <P> Senior forwards James Anderson and Keith Hill are the only starters back. Guard  William Benjamin should also contribute. Otherwise, Coach Neil McCarthy is  counting on starters to emerge from among a group of community college  transfers -- guard Randy Brown, forwards Michael New and Rick Fluckey, center  Jason Trask and swingman Reggie Jordan.  </P> <P> PACIFIC  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 7-21, 3-15  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Ninth  </P> <P> The Tigers made progress last season in Coach Bob Thomason's first year, but  still are just a notch ahead of San Jose State in the conference.  </P> <P> "We should be a much improved team this season, but we need to develop our team  confidence and you can only do that by winning games," Thomason said.  </P> <P> Pacific has five starters back, but newcomers may replace some of them. Key  players are junior center Don Lyttle, sophomore guard Dell Demps and community  college transfer Anthony Woods, a point guard. Rich Ressa, another community  college transfer, is likely to start at small forward.  </P> <P> UC IRVINE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 12-17, 8-10  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Eighth  </P> <P> As always, Coach Bill Mulligan gets to the point. "Our biggest problem last  year was that we averaged 82 points per game and our opponents averaged 86,  plus shot 51% from the floor," he said. "We are going to have to straighten  that out."  </P> <P> Mulligan abandoned the Anteaters' impersonation of Loyola Marymount last  season, and says that this year Irvine will try to become better defensively.  </P> <P> Mulligan says Ricky Butler, the 6-7, 255-pound center, is much improved, and  that Irvine will go to him more. Other returning starters are senior guard Rod  Palmer and junior forward Jeff Herdman, who led the nation in three-point  percentage last year before a late slump.  </P> <P> Mulligan says he is committed this year to playing shooting guard Justin  Anderson, instead of pulling him when he starts cold. Rob Doktorczyk, a senior  forward, is the likely other starter, with senior Mike Labat as sixth man.  </P> <P> UC SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 21-9, 11-7  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Third  </P> <P> Guard Carrick DeHart is finally a senior after starting 87 of 89 games his  first three seasons, and forward Eric McArthur, who led the conference in  rebounding and blocked shots although he is just 6-6, is also back. Paul  Johnson and Mike Elliott are the other likely starters in the backcourt, with  Gary Gray joining McArthur inside.  </P> <P> The Gauchos lost inside player Mike Doyle, who shared the scoring lead with  DeHart with a 16-point average, when he decided to leave school last spring.  Coach Jerry Pimm's preseason concern has been finding a point guard. DeHart may  move over to the position, and Elliott is another of five candidates.  </P> <P> UTAH STATE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Records: 12-16, 10-8  </P> <P> 1988-89 Conference Finish: Fourth (tie)  </P> <P> The Aggies were the last conference team other than UNLV to play in the NCAA  tournament, making it in 1988 after winning the Big West tournament. After a  disappointing season last year, Coach Kohn Smith is starting over.  </P> <P> There is only one senior on the roster, and 70% of last season's scoring is  gone, including Reid Newey, who was second in the conference. Kendal  Youngblood, a guard who was the Big West freshman of the year last season, is  the top returner. Also back: forward Darrel White, the only senior. Guard  Albert Chappell, who had become a freshman starter late in the season before  injuring his knee, returned to practice only last week.  </P></p>

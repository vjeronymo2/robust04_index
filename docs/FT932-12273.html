			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Home Secretary Clarke says government considering security measures request MR Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said yesterday that the government was considering the request from the City of London for extra money to improve security measures in the wake of the Bishopsgate bomb. A similar request from Warrington is also being considered. His comments came after he attended an hour-long meeting in Downing Street with Mr John Major; Sir Francis McWilliams, the lord mayor of London; Mr Paul Condon, the Metropolitan police commissioner; and Mr Owen Kelly, the City of London police commissioner. Downing Street said that the prime minister was in 'listening mode' and that the object of the meeting was to learn the policing lessons from the events leading up to the bomb, and its aftermath. The security and intelligence aspects are being discussed separately between Mr Major, Mr Clarke and Mrs Stella Rimington, the head of the security service. Six of the nine individuals arrested on Monday in connection with the City bomb have been released, with the three remaining held without charge in undisclosed police stations, Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday.</p>

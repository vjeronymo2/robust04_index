			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is indicated that recently Panhandle and Anadarko Gathering Company (AGC) concluded negotiations concerning the sale to AGC of Panhandle's Hugoton System. Field Services states that the sale of the Hugoton System to AGC includes a portion of the Elkhart Compressor Station in Kansas. It is stated that Panhandle proposes to sell a part of the Elkhart Station facilities to AGC and the remainder would be transferred to Field Services with Field Services operating its portion of the Elkhart Station facilities in conjunction with the other gathering facilities it is acquiring from Panhandle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also stated that, as currently configured, the Elkhart Station is located in Morton County, Kansas immediately downstream of gathering facilities which are the subject of the Panhandle and Field Services' filings in Docket Nos. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000 and CP94&hyph;152&hyph;000, respectively. Field Services indicates that the Elkhart Station is divided by a county road, but the two portions are currently integrated. It is also stated that, as a result of the sale of the Panhandle Hugoton System to AGC, Panhandle proposes to split the Elkhart Station between AGC and Field Services. It is indicated that Panhandle would transfer the portion south of the county road, consisting of four 1,028 horsepower two-stage skid-mounted compressors and six 1,100 horsepower single-stage block-mounted compressors, to Field Services. Field Services states that these facilities compress the gas gathered on the Elkhart Gathering System for delivery into the 24-inch line to be transferred to AGC. Field Services states that the portion of the facilities located north of the county road, consisting of one 3,162 horsepower four-stage compressor, would be transferred to AGC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Services states that, subsequent to the transfer of facilities by Panhandle, significant modifications would be undertaken to separate completely the operation of the South Elkhart Station from the North Elkhart Station so that the two would be operated independently and would no longer be integrated. It is also indicated that, upon the transfer of the Panhandle Hugoton Gathering System to AGC and the transfer of the remaining gathering to Field Services, the South Elkhart Station would not be contiguous with any other facilities owned or operated by Panhandle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Services argues that, as a matter of law, the facilities to be transferred to Field Services are within the gathering and production exemption of Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act because; and that, after the reconfiguration of facilities, the sole function of the South Elkhart Station would be to boost the pressure of the gas produced behind the station from a suction pressure of 50 psig to a pressure high enough (450 psig) so that the gas can be delivered into the 24-inch discharge line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 18, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

Generally, this line should be used when the applicant (except local governments) has a current indirect cost rate agreement approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local and State governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements. When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be charged again as direct costs to the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justification: Enclose a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total_Line 6k.

Enter the estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Do not add or subtract this amount from the total project amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justification: Describe the nature, source, and anticipated use of program income in the Program Narrative Statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section C_Non-Federal Resources. This section summarizes the amounts of non-Federal resources that will be applied to the grant. Enter this information on line 12 entitled Totals. In-kind contributions are defined in 45 CFR 74.51 and 45 CFR 92.3, as property or services which benefit a grant-supported project or program and which are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, the subgrantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant or subgrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Justification: Describe third party in-kind contributions, if included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section D_Forecasted Cash Needs. Not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section E_Budget Estimate of Federal Funds Needed For Balance of the Project. This section should only be completed if the total project period exceeds 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Totals_Line 20. For projects that will have more than one budget period, enter the estimated required  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> funds for the second budget period (months 13 through 24) under column (b) First. If a third budget period will be necessary, enter the Federal funds needed for months 25 through 36 under (c) Second. Columns (d) and (e) are not applicable in most instances, since ACF funding is almost always limited to a three-year maximum project period. Columns (d) and (e) would be used in the case of a 60 month project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section F_Other Budget Information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct Charges_Line 21.

If the total project period exceeds 12 months, you must enter your proposed non-Federal share of the project budget for each of the remaining years of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Project Summary Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Clearly mark this separate page with the applicant name as shown in item 5 of the SF 424, the priority area number as shown at the top of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SF 424, and the title of the project as shown in item 11 of the SF 424. The summary description should not exceed 300 words. These 300 words become part of the computer database on each project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Care should be taken to produce a summary description which accurately and concisely reflects the proposal. It should describe the objectives of the project, the approaches to be used and the outcomes expected. The description should also include a list of major products that will result from the proposed project, such as software packages, materials, management procedures, data collection instruments, training packages, or videos (please note that audiovisuals should be closed captioned). The project summary description, together with the information on the SF 424, will constitute the project abstract. It is the major source of information about the proposed project and is usually the first part of the application that the reviewers read in evaluating the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the bottom of the page, following the summary description, type up to 10 key words which best describe the proposed project, the service(s) involved and the target population(s) to be covered. These key words will be used for computerized information retrieval for specific types of funded projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Program Narrative Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The narrative should provide information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria (see Section C, Part III), using the following headings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The dynamics of price indices for consumer goods and  services  in January were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding  date):                       01/18      01/25      01/31      Average       +                                                   daily price                                                   increase                                                    January       December   Consumer        105.8      103.4      102.4      0.68          0.42  goods and  services   including:   foodstuffs      104.3      103.8      102.4      0.68          0.42   nonfood items   103.2      102.2      102.3      0.40          0.39    for-fee         126.3      107.6      103.2      2.38          0.52  services for  the  population      According to current data, prices in the consumer market  increased in January overall by 21.4 percent, including those  for foodstuffs--by 21.1 percent, nonfood items--by 12.5 percent,  and for-fee services--by 73.8 percent.  <H5>  Food </H5>   Prices for basic food products rose last week by 2.8 percent  in organized trade and by 0.7 percent in nonorganized trade.    Price changes from 25 to 31 January by main categories of  foodstuffs are shown below:                            As % of the preceding observation date, including:                        Total           in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All foodstuffs       102.4           102.8               100.7   including:   Meat and meat        102.1           103.0               99.8  products   Fish and fish        102.4           102.5               96.3  products   Milk and milk        104.8           105.0               103.1  products   Eggs                 103.0           103.2               100.6   Sugar                100.3           100.3               100.6   Bread and bakery     104.0           104.0               -  products   Cereals and pasta    102.8           102.9               100.9  products   Vodka                100.7           100.6               103.6   Potatoes and         102.3           102.6               102.1  vegetables      In organized trade over the past week the fast pace of price  rises continued with respect to milk and milk products and bread  and bakery products.    The greatest increase in prices over January was registered  with respect to milk and milk products and bread and bakery  products--by 34-35 percent, as well as eggs--by 23 percent.  Prices for potatoes and vegetables rose by 22 percent, meat and  meat products, cereals, and pasta products--by about 15 percent.  Sugar prices remained practically unchanged.    In nonorganized trade, unlike organized trade, prices over  the last week of January changed insignificantly (up 0.7  percent). Milk, sour cream, and vegetable prices went up by 2-3  percent, and prices for meat and meat products remained  unchanged. Prices for vegetables and potatoes increased over  January by 28.4 percent, for milk and milk products--by 33  percent. Meat prices rose by 11.1 percent.    The cost of the monthly basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose  over the week by 2.7 percent and amounted as of 1 February to  37,500 rubles [R]. Magadan remains the most expensive city,  Ulyanovsk, the least expensive. The price differential between  them measured a factor of 4.2, having shrunk over the week by  about 15 percent because of the rise in prices for basic  foodstuffs in Ulyanovsk. Moscow is 35th on the list of 132  monitored cities in terms of the cost of the basket (R41,000).  <H5>  Nonfood items </H5>   Over the past week prices for light industry products  increased by 1.9-2.4 percent, for household and cultural  goods--by 2.8 percent, and for fuel sold to the population--by  1.3 percent.

Apartment rents, the cost of keeping a  child in preschool facilities, and health care services  increased by a factor of 1.5. Prices for consumer services  increased at a lesser rate (by 20-30 percent).  <H5>  Dynamics of Producer Prices for Industrial Goods </H5>   The level of wholesale prices charged by producers for  industrial goods rose in January 1994 as compared to December  1993 by 19 percent (in January 1993--by 32 percent). As compared  to January 1993, wholesale prices increased 8.2-fold.    The most significant price increases in January 1994  occurred  in power engineering, fuel, and chemical industries. In sectors  producing consumer goods prices in January rose at a somewhat  slower rate than in sectors producing producer goods.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |January 1994 as % of                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |December 1993            |January 1993             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry total           |119                      |8.2 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |power engineering        |122                      |14.2 times               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |fuel industry            |124                      |6.7 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |ferrous metallurgy       |108                      |9.6 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |nonferrous metallurgy    |113                      |5.5 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |chemical industry        |124                      |9.1 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |petrochemical industry   |115                      |6.8 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |machine building         |121                      |8.2 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |timber, woodworking, and |120                      |8.7 times                |  |pulp and paper industry  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |construction materials i-|120                      |11.8 times               |  |ndustry                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |light industry           |112                      |6.0 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |food processing industry |115                      |7.9 times                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In the fuel industry prices for the main  categories of energy resources rose in January on average by 24  percent, which was more than twice the average monthly rate of  increase in this industry in the fourth quarter of 1993.    Average prices for coal and oil in Russia increased over the  month by 20 percent and amounted, respectively, to R12,000 and  R39,000 per tonne; for gas they increased by a factor of 1.5  (R2,600 per thousand cubic meters). Oil refining enterprises  raised prices for their products on average by 26 percent. The  wholesale price of gasoline at the end of January was R129,000,  diesel fuel--R119,000, and fuel oil--R41,000 per tonne.    Because of rising coal and gas prices, electric power rates  in January went up by 22 percent as compared to prices in effect  in the fourth quarter of 1993 and amounted by the end of January  on average for all categories of consumers to R20.2 per kw-hour.  The greatest rate increases took place with respect to electric  power supplied to electricity-powered transport, municipal  services, and other nonindustrial consumers. In some regions  power rates per kw-hour increased more significantly (by a  factor of 1.4-1.5). Among them are Perm, Orel, and Tula Oblasts,  Chuvash Republic, and some others.    In the chemical industry prices, after slowing  down somewhat in the forth quarter of 1993 (to a level of 13  percent a month on average), took off again in January,  increasing by almost one-quarter, and with respect to some  categories of products (nitrogen, phosphate, and combination  fertilizer, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, synthetic dyes,  detergents, and some others)--by more than half.    In machine building the greatest price increases  were registered at enterprises in railroad, chemical, petroleum,  road construction, and municipal services machine building, and  in the electrotechnical industry, where prices in January rose  on average by 122-128 percent as compared to 115-199 percent a  month in the fourth quarter of 1993.    Because of diminished demand for domestically produced goods  and increased competition from imported goods, prices for light  industry goods and household and cultural goods rose at a slower  rate than in the past. The average rate of prices increases in  light industry dropped in 1993 from 45 percent in  January to 8 percent in December; in January 1994 these prices  rose by 12 percent, including by 5 percent in leather, fur, and  footwear industry; by 8 percent in the garment industry; and by  10 percent in knitwear industry. Prices for household and  cultural goods in January increased on average by 10 percent,  and for furniture--by 18 percent.    In the food processing industry in January prices  for butter and oil, cheese-making, and dairy industry products  increased by more than one-quarter; in the bread-baking  industry--by 18 percent, and in the meat-processing industry--by  14 percent. Fish industry enterprise raised prices for their  output in January by 20 percent as compared to December.  <H5>  Results of Industry Operations </H5>   In January of this year Russian industry produced more than  R15 trillion worth of output in current prices. The physical  volume of production fell by 23.1 percent as compared to January  1993. As compared to the level of December 1993 the total output  fell by 17.2 percent, and the average daily output--by 11  percent.    Production in the fuel and power generation industries and  nonferrous metallurgy declined by 5-9 percent as compared to  January 1993. In most processing industries the scale of decline  was considerably greater. In the light and food processing  industries production declined by 19-28 percent. In the sectors  producing producer goods the scale of decline ranged from 23  percent in ferrous metallurgy to 28-35 percent in the  construction materials, chemical and petrochemical, timber,  woodworking, and pulp and paper industries, and 52 percent in  machine building.

The income of the population in the  top 10 percent bracket exceeded almost by a factor of 11 the  income of the same share of the lowest-income population, while  at the end of 1992 this value was measured by the factor of 7.5  to eight. The index of income concentration (the Gini  coefficient) increased in January 1994 to 0.352; at the end of  1993 it measured at 0.346, and in 1992--0.327.

The average per capita value of the subsistence minimum  (according to the methodology of the Russian Ministry of Labor  approved in November 1992)--in January 1994 prices--was  calculated to be R51,400, including R58,000 for a work-eligible  person, R36,200 for a pensioner, and R51,300 for a child. The  cost of the consumer food basket (19 products) amounts to 68  percent of the minimum subsistence value.    The income of a considerable part of the population does not  cover even the cost of the consumer food basket factored in the  calculation of the subsistence minimum, as may be seen from the  following data.

As compared to 1992,  this investment decreased by almost one-quarter.    The 1993 targets for putting into operation capacities for  processing and storing agricultural output were met only to a  small extent, as may be seen from the following data.

In 1993 construction of 355 facilities was envisaged with  federal budget financing in accordance with targeted federal  programs for development of the baby food industry, "Sugar,"  "Bread for Russia," "Vegetable Oil," and "Fish;" 122 of them  were supposed to be put into operation in 1993. Actually, only  nine facilities were put in operation over January-December of  last year. Construction of 46 facilities has not yet began.    Of the enterprises that were supposed to be put into  operation in 1993 but were not, 10 were in the program for  development of the baby food industry, 11 in the "Sugar"  program, two in "Vegetable Oil" program, 57 in "Fish" program,  and 34--in "Bread for Russia."    Among those not put into operation were capacities at dairy  combines in Novocheboksarsk in Chuvash Republic, Krasnodar, and  St. Petersburg; at the sugar factories Bolshevik in Belgorod  Oblast and Meleuz in the Republic of Bashkortostan; at oil  extraction plants in Millerovo in Rostov Oblast and Georgiyevsk  in Stavropol Kray; at the fish combine in Ivanovo and  fish-breeding farm Zheleznogorskiy in Kursk Oblast; an elevator  in Dimitrovograd in Ulyanovsk Oblast; a cereal production  department at a bread-baking combine in Tolyatti in Samara  Oblast, and others.  <H5>  Construction of Nursing Homes </H5>   As of 1 January 1993, 5,500 persons in the Russian  Federation  were on waiting lists for placement in a nursing home for the  elderly and disabled. Over 1993 enterprises and organizations of  all forms of ownership put into operation such facilities for  3,400 accommodations (including boarding homes for labor  veterans), which comprises 113 percent of the 1992 level.    Of 87 facilities envisaged to be put into operation over  January-December, only 48 were completed.    A dismal situation with respect to construction of nursing  homes is developing on the territory of the Northern Economic  Region, where 1,389 persons are on waiting lists for placement.  Of the five territories in this region, only the Komi Republic  put into operation a 240-bed nursing home.    Construction of these facilities frequently exceeds the  normative time frame. The opening date for a 170-bed nursing  home for elderly and disabled in Yoshkar-Ola in Mari El Republic  and a 110-bed home in Vladimir in Irkutsk Oblast has already  been postponed for two years. The sleeping quarters in the  120-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled at Mukhinskaya  station in Amur Oblast have been under construction since 1990.    Among those not ready to open in 1993 were a 100-bed nursing  home for the elderly in Verkhoshizhemye settlement in Kirov  Oblast, a boarding home for retarded children for 300  accommodations in Shemordan settlement in the Republic of  Tatarstan, and a 315-bed nursing home for elderly and disabled  in Tolyatti in Samara Oblast.  <H5>  Capital Repairs of the Housing Stock </H5>   Eleven percent of the state-owned housing stock in the  Russian Federation is currently in need of immediate repairs.  Because of the shortage of financing, repairs are done annually  on no more than 1.5 percent of the housing stock.    In 1993, R842 billion was spent on housing repairs. The cost  of repairs on one square meter of living area amounted on  average to R37,000, including R60,000 in municipal property  buildings, and R19,000 in buildings assigned to organizations  and enterprises.

At the same time, in the Republics of Komi and  Dagestan, Krasnoyarsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, Kirov, Saratov, Amur,  and Kamchatka Oblasts, and Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast the  volume of repair work decreased over this period by 40-50  percent.    Despite existing five-year targets, not a single kilometer  of  the gas distribution system was built at economic entities in  Irkutsk and Sakhalin Oblasts and Komi Republic or withdrawal  branches in gas pipelines on the territories of Russia's 17  constituent republics, krays, and oblasts, including Komi and  Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, Kemerovo, Kirov, and Tambov Oblasts,  and Altay Kray.

cost of this selection is used to compare the level of  prices for foodstuffs in different cities. The selection  consists of 19 basic foodstuffs and is calculated on the basis  of consumption norms needed for a male of work-eligible age.  This selection (consumption volumes are indicated on a per-year  basis) includes: rye bread (92 kg), wheat bread (86.7 kg),  millet (18.1 kg), vermicelli (7.3 kg), sugar (24.8 kg),  vegetable oil (10 kg), butter (3.6 kg), beef (42.0 kg), boiled  sausage (2.2 kg), salami (1.1 kg), milk (184.3 kg), sour cream  (4.2 kg), hard cheese (2.0 kg), eggs (183), potatoes (146 kg),  fresh cabbage (29.8 kg), onion (10.2 kg), apples (11 kg), and  cigarettes (96 packs).    This listing was chosen by virtue of the relative stability  seen in availability of these products for sale, enabling a  well-founded analysis to be made of the cost dynamics of product  selection.    Only those cities were taken into consideration where not  more than three items from the listing were absent during the  given or preceding price registration.    The value of the selection of basic foodstuffs shown is on a  per-week basis.</p>

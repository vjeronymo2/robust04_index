Unlike the Chu group's approach of using super high pressure,  this is research applying super high pressure to superconductor  fabrication. It should be called research to discover new  high-temperature superconductors, not just fabrication of new  high-temperature superconductors.    The two research projects are from the group of Professor  Mikio Takano of Kyoto University's Chemical Research Institute,  inorganic materials chemical research sector III (solid state  chemistry), and the group of Professor Jun Akimitsu of Aoyama  Gakuin University's Department of Science and Engineering,  Physics curriculum. Although the two come from different  disciplines (chemistry and physics), they are both attacking the  problem of finding high-temperature superconductors with super  high pressure.  <H5>  Super High Pressure Realizes the Dream of Infinitely Layered </H5> Material    The Takano group achieved two very interesting results in  1992 and 1993, which are drawing a great deal of attention.    In 1992, this group succeeded in fabricating an infinitely  layered Sr(Ca)CuO[.sub]2[/] with only alkaline earth  varieties and copper. In 1993, the group fabricated SrCuO.  Neither are substances with exceptionally high critical  temperature (Tc), but exceptionally high Tc was possible with  super high pressure. Before explaining about infinitely layered  materials, we should touch upon the relationship of Tc and the  crystalline structure of materials in high temperature  superconductors.    Superconductors discovered thus far have been copper oxides.  For these materials to become superconductive, the existence of  CuO[.sub]2[/] planes is essential. It was after 1988 that it  came to be realized, albeit slowly, that the number of  CuO[.sub]2[/] planes in crystal structure might be related to  Tc rise. As the planes increased one by one, Tc rose. So the  question was asked, what would happen if the number of  CuO[.sub]2[/] planes was increased, or if CuO[.sub]2[/]  planes were layered in unlimited number?    Many groups took up the challenge, but did not succeed. The  solution was the Takano group's super high pressure fabrication  method. The high temperature superconductor fabricated by  applying 60,000 atmospheres was an infinite-layer material of  only alkaline varieties and copper with extremely simple  structure, but a Tc of 110 K was achieved in the group's  experiments.    The 1993 research built on those results, and produced a  compound with a simple structure of only SrCuO. This substance  does not become superconductive if fabricated under normal  pressure, but if fabricated in an environment of 60,000  atmospheres, it becomes a high temperature superconductor.  Figure 1 shows the structure with normal pressure fabrication  and with high pressure fabrication. The CuO[.sub]2[/] planes,  which play a critical role in superconductivity, show up  remarkably in the case of high pressure fabrication. It is  thought that the infinite-layer material discovered by the  Takano group in 1992 is in the same family as this material.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Mr. Takano characterizes his research position thusly: "In  some ways, we are isolated from information here, unlike in  Tokyo, but this gives us the resolve to do independent research."    High temperature superconductivity was discovered at the end  of 1986, when Mr. Takano was doing research on perovskite  oxides, and he was researching super high pressure as part of  that. He was shocked when the high temperature superconductor  appeared because his perovskite research was focused mainly on  iron, not copper. The sudden appearance of high temperature  superconductivity was too alluring.    "One chemist handles only a few compounds in his research  life. Of these, no substance could be more interesting than  this," thought Takano, and resolved to take on high temperature  superconductivity. However, he thought that "With only three of  us in the group, we will have to use methods that no others are  trying if we are going to achieve remarkable results," and he  decided to put his experience with "pressure" to use as the  starting point of his attack on superconductivity.    However, a co-researcher transferred out of a university  that  had super high pressure equipment, and the group lost access to  such equipment. Therefore, they made arrangements with Kobe  Steel, which was using the equipment to manufacture diamonds,  and began the pursuit of creating superconductive material with  high pressure. Because they used the high pressure equipment  only when it was not being used for diamond production, it took  a month between the time that they sent sample powder to Kobe  Steel and got back the material fabricated under high pressure.  Despite this, Takano's group achieved the above-mentioned result  of infinite layers.    As time passed, Kobe Steel's equipment was increasingly  dedicated to its primary task of diamond production, until  finally, there was no time to fit in Takano's research. At the  end of 1992, the group's own equipment worth &yen;30 million was  installed in the chemical research laboratory.    The 10-ton equipment has been installed in a brick building  that was an ammunition storehouse for the former imperial army.  The core of this huge equipment is barely the size of a thumb.  As shown in Figure 2, superconductors are fabricated in a gold  capsule 3mm in diameter and 3mm in length.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Only 50 mg can be produced at a time. This is adequate for  samples, but the expense -- &yen;4,000-&yen;5,000 -- is a  problem. Furthermore, it takes four hours to make one sample, so  a whole day's work produces only four samples. The research is  costly in time and money. On top of that, since the use of super  high pressure for superconductor fabrication has just started,  "Everything is based on intuition." What should the group's  goals be? "To be honest, you cannot get away from the  CuO[.sub]2[/] plane. We would like to overcome that somehow."    It appears that, after all, the group's goal is to find a  non-copper-base high temperature superconductor made of  something else besides copper oxide.  <H5>  Material Search Wizard </H5>   Mr. Akimitsu's goal also is to find a non-copper-base high  temperature superconductor. The Akimitsu group is large -- 10  members. Even when we visited his lab, we saw students napping  between the equipment, and instruments were going non-stop.  Although many superconductivity labs tend to lose vitality, this  one was overflowing with enthusiasm.    Mr. Akimitsu's quest for superconductors is well-recognized  and he has discovered more new superconductors than one can  count on two hands. While any researcher would feel blessed to  discover one new superconductor in a lifetime, the Akimitsu  group has produced one high temperature superconductor after  another. He truly is a wizard in finding materials.    The materials include a neodymium-base material discovered  in  1988. This is a very well-known crude type superconductor that  subsequently was developed into an electron doping type  superconductor by a Tokyo University group.    More recently, there is the CO[.sub]3[/] base family of  materials. This is a large family of over 10 in all, including a  group called C1212-base materials that are fabricated under  super high pressure. This group is seen to be the most promising  in the CO[.sub]3[/]-base family. Joint research is being  conducted on the C1212 group with Professor Nobuo Mori of Tokyo  University's Institute for Solid State Physics, which has super  high pressure equipment. Interesting data already seems to have  been produced, and an announcement by Mr. Akimitsu is probably  not far off.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Why is Mr. Akimitsu, a physicist, searching for materials?  "The creation of a new material means the birth of a new law of  physics. As a physics specialist, that is my goal."    Even Mr. Akimitsu says that the appearance of copper oxide  superconductors was a shock, but his wealth of research  experience has helped greatly in his subsequent quest.    At one time, Mr. Akimitsu said, with regard to the quest for  high temperature superconductors, that they were "substances  created by God." Recently, however, he says that predictions can  be made on copper oxide-base materials to some extent. The quest  for copper oxide-base superconductors has entered the mature  stage, although, to be sure, 10 times the number of announced  successes have been fabricated and then discarded.    "The quest for materials is a contest of ideas, but ideas  are  not enough. A new material is found only when ideas are  multiplied by luck and tenacity."    That is the way Mr. Akimitsu lightly dismissed the art of  the  material quest, but there is no doubt that some very awesome  effort lies behind it. "For every new material, there is a new  law of physics." This philosophy is what directs his students  toward the difficult task of material hunting and their research  achievements are the energy that drive the hunt. Mr. Akimitsu  also is turning in the ambitious direction of the quest for  non-copper base superconductors.    "I think that discovering whether superconductivity is  possible without copper will be the big game. We have to work  hard to win it."    There is great interest in what short of material will  emerge, but when asked if he has any ideas, Mr. Akimitsu says,  "No comment." Today, when Japanese superconductivity research  has waned, the way to rejuvenate it is fabrication of  non-copper-base superconductors.    This will be a liberation from the strong fetters of copper  oxides as well, and it will be when Mr. Akimitsu's goal, the  birth of a new law of physics, will be realized.</p>

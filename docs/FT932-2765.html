			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Observer: The City's dressing down Hands up all those who turned up at the Lord Mayor's Guildhall dinner this week minus their white tie. Is the outbreak of black ties amongst the bankers and merchants yet another sorry sign of the way standards are slipping in the Square Mile? To a degree, Celestria Noel, social editor of Harpers &amp; Queen, sympathises with confused guests, especially those who came from out of town. The invite specified evening dress and decorations. Not a word about white ties. 'You can wear decorations with black tie. They should have stipulated white tie,' Noel opines. As the author of Jennifer's diary a well-studied arbiter of good form, Noel is infinitely more concerned by the faux pas of the 'children of the sixties' now inhabiting positions of power than unsophisticated foreign bankers. 'People wear what they like these days,' sighs Noel. Buckingham Palace, it seems, is about the only place left where people dare not wear the wrong coloured bow.</p>

The  Los Angeles Superior Court suit contends that California Broadcasting Group  agreed in August to provide a "clean, static and noise-free radio broadcast  signal" over which Korean Community Broadcasting could broadcast at 10,000  kilowatts.  </P> <P> The suit said California Broadcasting Group agreed to boost the frequency to  20,000 kilowatts by February. Korean Community Broadcasting paid $310,000 for  the contract, hired employees and incurred overhead costs exceeding $50,000 a  month, the suit said.

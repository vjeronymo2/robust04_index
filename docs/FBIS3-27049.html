			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech delivered by Ye Liansong, governor of </F> Hebei Province, at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Fourth  Hebei Provincial CPC Committee on 23 December: "Strengthen  Reform, Open Wider to the Outside World, Accelerate Development,  and Build a Strong Province"]    [Text]1. Current Provincial Economic Situation    Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee  and the State Council, the provincial party committee and  government have led the people throughout the province to  conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the  14th party congress since the beginning of this year and, aiming  at the general objective of building an economically strong  province, have seized the opportunity to deepen reform, open  wider to the outside world, accelerate development, and  comprehensively implement the "outlines of Hebei's economic  development," thus achieving notable results in economic  construction, reform, opening up, and other undertakings.  Following last year's rapid development, the economy has  continued developing rapidly, and the general situation has been  good. This year's gross domestic product is expected to exceed  140 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent, which is one of the  largest annual increases registered since reform and opening up  started. A fairly good harvest has been won in agricultural  production despite catastrophic disasters, with grain output  expected at 47.6 billion jin, up 8.9 percent from the preceding  year. In industrial production, we have achieved simultaneous  increase in growth rate and efficiency and attained the target  of increasing the increased value of industry, profits and  taxes, and the value of fixed assets and raising Hebei's ranking  in the country in the overall index of industrial economic  efficiency. The annual entire industrial output value is  expected to exceed 200 billion yuan, up 25 percent from the  preceding year. Rapid growth has continued in fixed asset  investment, with the annual social investment in fixed assets  expected at 45 billion yuan, up 34 percent. Township  enterprises have registered substantial growth in both  production and efficiency. Their annual output value is  expected at 170 billion yuan, up 70 percent. The endeavor of  opening to the outside world has made a new headway. The number  of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises newly  registered this year is expected at 1,700, and the registered  foreign capital $2.26 billion, up 75.9 and 77.2 percent,  respectively. The annual volume of exports may reach $1.95  billion, up 9.6 percent. Revenues have grown steadily, with the  annual amount expected to rise by 35.9 percent to reach 13.5  billion yuan, thus a basic balance between revenues and  expenditures can be achieved. The monetary situation has  notably improved, and the shortage of funds has been initially  eased. The economic structural reform has entered a new stage,  and achievements in transforming the enterprise operating  mechanism have been won for the present stage.    Judging from the general situation, the province has scored  great achievements in economic construction, reform, and opening  up in 1993. Compared with other provinces, however, Hebei's  ranking in the country has not changed, and its gap from  advanced provinces has widened.    A specific analysis of the province's economic operation  showed that we have the following problems and gaps. 1)  Agricultural development has been sluggish, peasants' income has  not increased, and cotton production has declined by a large  margin. 2) Structural adjustment has proceeded slowly, our  products are of a low standing and have a small share in the  market, and the small proportion of finely processed products  with high additional value has yet to be notably changed. The  state sector of the economy still accounts for a small  proportion. 3) The extent of reform is not large enough, and  the endeavor of opening up has proceeded slowly. In opening to  the outside world, we still fail to develop foreign capital  utilization, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations  simultaneously. 4) The steps to achieve scientific and  technological progress are small, and only a small number of  scientific and technological achievements has been transformed.  2. The Guiding Ideology and Major Objective of 1994  Economic Work.    The year 1994 is a year for continuously maintaining a rapid  economic increase on the basis of achieving a rapid economic  development in our province for two successive years, a major  year for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, and a crucial year for successfully  fulfilling the Eighth Five-Year Plan and for doubling the GNP  ahead of schedule in the whole province's national economy. In  accordance with the guidelines of the national economic work  conference and our province's actual situation, the guiding  ideology of next year's economic work is to take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as the guidance, conscientiously implement the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee, and accelerate the pace of building the  socialist market economic structure in line with the overall  idea of strengthening reform, expanding reform, accelerating  development, raising efficiency, and promoting a sustained,  speedy, and sound national economy in the whole province.    In line with the aforementioned guiding ideology, the major  objectives of next year's economic development are: The GNP  should increase more than 11 percent over this year, of which,  the increased value of primary industry should increase 4  percent, and that of the secondary and tertiary industries more  than 14 percent. In line with the demand of the objective of  building an economically strong province, we should strive to  fulfill this objective in a better manner in the course of  implementation and doing practical work in an effort to  accelerate the pace of accelerating the building of an  economically strong province. At present, we are facing a  hard-won good opportunity for reform and opening up. First, next  year the state will issue a series of major reform measures to  instill vitality into national economic development. Second,  through strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and  control, the short supply of essential production factors, such  as funds, should be alleviated. Third, during the next few  years, the production capacity of major products and the  supporting capacity of infrastructure facilities should be  enhanced to a further extent. Fourth, areas around the Bohai  Bay should become new hot spots for foreign investment. Fifth,  further emancipating minds, seizing opportunity, and  accelerating development should become the common understanding  of the broad masses of cadres at the higher and lower levels  across the province. Meanwhile, we should also recognize that  many problems and difficulties will exist in next year's  economic development, and the "bottleneck" restrictions, such as  the shortage of power, transport facilities, and water  resources, will remain serious, funds will remain tight, and  industrial raw materials, cotton, in particular, will be in  short supply. Judging from the overall situation, comparing the  favorable factors with the unfavorable factors, the former have  accounted for a major part.  <H3>  3. We Should Persist in Advancing This Work in an All-Around  Manner and Making Breakthroughts in Major Points in an Effort to  Accelerate the Pace of Reform in the Whole Province. </H3>   Many reform measures will be issued next year, however, the  central aspect is enterprise reform and promotion of the modern  enterprise system. 1) We should continue to deeply implement  the "enterprise law," "regulation," and the "implementation  method," and completely implement all rights and  responsibilities of enterprises in places where needed. 2) We  should continue to improve all sorts of operational forms, and  actively popularize the experiences in changing mechanism and  promoting development of different enterprises, including Handan  Iron and Steel Company, Tangshan Haomen Group, and Yinggeleilan  Company of Xuanhua Iron and Steel Company. 3) We should  carefully grasp the experimental work of establishing the modern  enterprise system. In addition to conscientiously organizing  experiments in some state designated units, the provincial  authorities will also conduct such experiments in 100  enterprises. 4) We should actively promote reform of the  property rights system, and improve property rights relations.  Next year we should transform and reorganize 300 enterprises  with the experiment of shareholding system, and strive to make  the figure reach 400. 5) We should actively promote some  property management forms, such as state-owned people-run or  public-owned people-run forms, rental operation, operation on a  commission basis, auction or transfer of property, in some small  state-owned enterprises or money-losing medium-sized  enterprises. 6) We should continue to decontrol the development  of non-state economic sector and cultivate the new economic  growing point.    According to the unified arrangements of the central  authorities, we should firmly make good preparations for  coordinating the implementation of reform measures in an effort  to ensure the smooth implementation of the central reform  measures.    On the reform of the financial and tax system. The State  Council decided that from 1 January next year, all provinces,  autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with provincial  status in state planning should carry out the tax distribution  system. According to the basic principles as defined by the  central authorities and on the basis of the distribution pattern  as defined in the current financial system, the province should  also gradually merge the financial management system with the  tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of  power with the city and prefectural authorities.    On the reform of the financial system. We should firmly  attend to this work which is conducive to Hebei's economic  development. First, we should strive to increase the setup of  various financial organs and widen the channels for collecting  and circulating capital. Second, we should try every possible  means to organize savings deposits and stabilize the resources  of credits. Third, we should intensify enterprise management  and enhance the returns on use of capital and enterprises'  ability in repaying loans. Simultaneously, the departments  concerned should strengthen the selection of projects and  enhance the work of making reports on the selected projects in  an effort to make increasingly more projects be listed in the  state plan and to gain the support by the policy-lending banks.    On the reform of the investment and capital circulation  system. We should firmly arrange, by classifying the categories  and in the order of importance, the basic investment projects,  competitive investment projects, and public welfare investment  projects. As for the basic projects, that should be invested  jointly by the governments and enterprises, we should strive to  gain the support by the state development banks. As for the  competitive projects, we should enable enterprises to actively  establish contacts with banks to gain the support by the  financial departments. As for the public welfare projects that  should be invested by the governments, we should have the funds  covered in the plans and the budgets. It is necessary to  strengthen the provincial construction and investment company's  functions for making investment and circulating capital, to  strengthen the provincial international credit and investment  company's functions for circulating capital at home and abroad,  and to bring their functions for collecting funds for  construction undertakings.    On the reform of the foreign trade system. The reform of the  foreign trade system is conducive to expanding the scale of  export. At the time of quickening the reform of the managerial  mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises, we should firmly grasp  this favorable opportunity, adopt effective measures, positively  organize the supply of goods, and expand the foreign exchange  earning capability.    Facing the 1994 situation with more new reform measures,  heavy tasks, and great difficulties, the party committees and  governments at various levels, all departments, and all trades  and professions should concentrate more attention on reform and  promote economic development and social progress with reform.  We should appropriately handle the relationship between reform,  development, and social stability. We should positively,  steadily, and orderly guide reform and lose no opportunities to  make breakthroughs in key areas.  <H3>  4. We Should Unswervingly Carry Out the Strategy of  Developing the Export-Oriented Economy and Further Quicken the  Pace of Opening to Both Domestic and Foreign Areas. </H3>   Although our province made rather bigger strides for opening  to the outside world in the past two years, we still far lag  behind the coastal provinces. Therefore, we must enhance the  sense of urgency, the sense of crisis, and the sense of  responsibility; have greater determination, bigger daring, and  more vitality; and lose no opportunities to firmly grasp the  opening of the province to the outside world.    First, we should further emancipate our mind to understand  anew Hebei's work of opening to the outside world. Without great  emancipation of the mind, there will be no great opening to the  outside world, nor great development in the economy of the  entire province. An analysis of the current mind-set of the  cadres at all levels in the province shows that they are  "superficial, complacent, sluggish, and lazy." Being  superficial means that they have merely a superficial  understanding of opening to the outside world and implementing  the strategy of "promoting the entire economy through the  export-oriented economy," regarding that opening to the outside  world means introducing some funds from abroad, establishing  some joint ventures, and exporting more and thus is the work of  foreign economic relations and trade departments. Being  complacent means that they are complacent with small progress  and small wealth, feel satisfied with the current conditions,  and lack the spirit of making progress and the courage and  insight of achieving great improvement, great breakthrough, and  great development. Being sluggish means that they are slow and  insensitive in understanding things and taking actions, thus  missing the opportunity, widening the gap, and stopping  development due to their wait-and-see attitude. Being lazy  means that they lack the spirit of doing practical work and  pioneering new work and have not totally overcome their practice  of giving empty talk and doing superficial work. To quicken the  pace of opening to the outside world, we should first surmount  these four ideological obstacles.    Second, we should implement the strategy of promoting the  entire economy through the export-oriented economy to bring  about a rapid economic development. Aiming at the general  objective of rejuvenating Hebei's economy and building an  economically strong province, and while speeding up the opening  up and development of the coastal areas of Bohai Sea, which are  on the forefront of opening up, we should make active efforts to  create favorable conditions for implementing the strategy of  promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  entire economy through the great development of the  export-oriented economy.    Third, we should simultaneously pay attention to and  accelerate the development of foreign trade, foreign capital  utilization, and foreign economic relations. Guided by the  world market, led by foreign trade, and focusing on foreign  capital utilization, we should persistently pay attention to  foreign trade, foreign capital utilization, and foreign economic  relations simultaneously. In exports, we should implement the  strategy of winning through good quality and diversifying the  market; take the road of industrialization, conglomeration, and  internationalization; embrace the concept of large-scale foreign  trade; pool the efforts of foreign trade companies, integrated  industrial and foreign trade companies, three types of  foreign-funded enterprises, and enterprises with the autonomy in  export and export to expand export and improve economic  efficiency; and strive to reach the national average in foreign  trade growth. Foreign capital should be used simultaneously in  large, medium-sized, and small projects, in primary, secondary,  and tertiary industries, in cities, prefectures, and counties,  and in the various sectors of the economy; and foreign capital  should also come from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots  and Overseas Chinese. Foreign capital should be used in more  areas and, in particular, key aspects. We should strive to  expand the scale of foreign capital utilization and upgrade its  level. We should achieve a significant breakthrough in foreign  economic and technological cooperation next year.    Fourth, we should continue exerting great efforts to achieve  success in developing the coastal cities and counties of Bohai  Sea and the cities and counties around Beijing and Tianjin. The  focus of next year is to comprehensively implement the strategy  of promoting the entire economy through the export-oriented  economy in these cities and counties, expedite their opening up,  facilitate their lateral cooperation at home by introducing  investment from abroad, bring in more investment from abroad by  developing lateral cooperation at home, and turn these cities  and counties into hot spots of investment    Fifth, we should improve the methods for inviting investment  to boost the enthusiasm of all cities and prefectures,  departments, and enterprises. Cities and Prefectures,  departments, trades, and enterprises should gradually become the  major participators in the activities to invite investment from  abroad.  <H3>  5. In Order To Accelerate Economic Development, We Must Give  Priority to Grasping Several Tasks. </H3>   A. The rural areas should give consideration to the overall  situation of becoming well-off, strive to increase the income of  peasants and herdsmen, and give priority to grasping four tasks  well:    a. On the premise of guaranteeing a stable increase in grain  production and a big upward trend in cotton production, we  should actively optimize the agricultural structure with the  market as our guidance. We should conscientiously implement the  state policy on raising the grain and cotton purchasing prices  next year, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses  of peasants in developing grain and cotton production. It is  necessary to ensure that the annual total grain output will  reach 230-235 kg or more. In next year' cotton production, we  should work hard to bring about an upswing, increase the cotton  growing acreage by a large margin, raise the per-unit area  yield, and guarantee the total output. In the readjustment of  agricultural structure, we should actively develop "high-yield,  fine-quality, and highly-efficient" farming, and do a good job  in organizing the implementation of the "seven- character  project,"and the "double-thousand field project."    b. We should realistically grasp well the building of a  rural  socialized service system. On the basis of developing  competitive products and pillar industries, we should combine  foreign trade with industry and agriculture and marketing with  supply and production, build service system at all levels, and  organize the efforts of thousands of households. We should give  priority to supporting and developing serial services, including  the processing, transport and marketing of farm and sideline  products.    c. We should actively promote the development of township  enterprises. Next year township enterprises should regard  accelerating development as the main melody, and strive to make  their development rate attain or surpass the national average  level. Particularly, counties and cities along "Bohai Bay,  Beijing and Tianjin Municipality, and railways" should make  their development rate and economic efficiency remarkably higher  than the provincial average. It is necessary to actively promote  the development of shareholding cooperative system, increase  input in township enterprises through various channels, and  establish a batch of large-scale enterprise groups that produce  good products and high efficiency.    d. We should carry out rural family planning work in a  down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to realistically  strengthen leadership over family planning work, resolutely  implement the demands of making party and government top leaders  grasp this work personally and assume full responsibility, and  strictly implement the system of negating all achievements if  one's family planning work is poor. Particularly, leaders of  counties and cities where the family planning work is backward  and problems are numerous should exert greater efforts to grasp  this work and to rapidly end the passive situation.    B. We should optimize the industrial structure, and deeply  carry out the activity on "increasing the increased value of  industrial enterprises, the profits and taxes of industrial  eterprises exercising independent accounting, and local  technological transformation investment, reducing the deficits  of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises, and making the  comprehensive index of industrial economic efficiency rise by 1  percentage point." Next year the provincial industrial front  should extensively and deeply carry out this activity with  increasing production, ending deficits, and increasing  efficiency as the main content. This means to increase the  total increased value of industry by 14 to 17 prcent, of which,  the increased value of the industrial enterprises at and above  the township level exercising independent accounting should  increase 12-15 percent; to increase the profits and taxes of  industrial enterprises at and above the township level  exercising independent accounting by 10 percent, and that of  large and medium-sized industrial enterprises 10 percent; to  increase technological transformation investment in local  state-run enterprises by 25-35 percent; to reduce the deficits  of large and medium-sized industrial enterprises by 15 percent;  and to raise the comprehensive index of economic efficiency of  industrial enterprises excercising independent accounting by one  percentage point.    We should persist in taking the market as a guidance, and  exert strenuous efforts to readjust the structure. In heavy  industry, we should realistically solve the issue of  "highly-efficient heavy industry," and in light industry, we  should continue to implement the strategy of developing  brand-name products, and accelerate the pace of readjustment to  develop high and new technology and brand- name products with  large-scale efficiency and foreign markets. We should  accelerate the pace of technological transformation of  enterprises. Begining next year to before 1997, we should  completely transform our province's budgetary industrial  enterprises once in a planned manner and group by group. We  should actively carry out "grafting" and transformation on the  provincial industrial front through various forms. We should  organize the enforcement of the "dragon-tiger" plan in the  province as a whole. In line with the development of new  products and the renewal of out-dated products, we should  accelerate the enforcement of the plan of "establishing a large  number of enterprises in six fields" in 1994. 1) The first group  of enterprises are in charge of introducing outside advanced  technologies and assimilating them so as to turn out new  products. 2) The second group of enterprises are in charge of  manufacturing and developing a large number of high-and-new tech  products. 3) The third group of enterprises are in charge of  popularizing the superior products turned out by a large number  of pillar industries. 4) The fourth group of enterprises are in  charge of increasing the output of products that can earn or  save foreign exchanges. 5) The fifth group of enterprises are in  charge of putting into production the products turned out by a  large number of new emerging industries. 6) The sixth group of  enterprises are in charge of eliminating a large number of  out-dated products and renewing a large number of new products  with flaws.    We should rapidly whip on the province's industrial front an  upsurge of learning from the influential enterprises, grasping  powerful projects, creating products with strong competitive  capability, and contending for being first grade. All  enterprises should grasp the expansion of markets by regarding  the expansion as an important task and foster an operation  mechanism that can rapidly respond to the feedback of market  information, exert flexible reaction, and is strong to meet  changes.    A good job should be done in realistically grasping the  industrial production at present so as to ensure a good trend of  maintaining a rapid growth in the first quarter of 1994.  Efforts should be made to ensure the supplies of raw or  auxiliary materials needed by production. In particular, we  should adopt every possible way and means to obtain the supplies  of cotton and ensure the sufficient production conditions of  electric power and transportation means. A good job should be  done in carrying out connection among various links cropping up  in the productive process. We should ensure the rapid growth of  production the first quarter of 1994 to gain initiative for the  annual production next year.    C. We should regard as an emphasis the work of accelerating  the fostering of market systems and vigorously promote the  development of tertiary industry. We should also regard market  construction as a breakthrough for developing the tertiary  industry. In building markets in 1994, we should uphold the  principle of attaching simultaneous importance on both  development and upgrading. The work emphasis should be placed  on developing the markets of essential factors of various  production. In particular, we must take a larger step in  building the markets of finance, labor forces, talented  personnel, technologies, information, and of trading  enterprises' property rights. We should vigorously develop the  intermediary organizations of markets and accelerate the  development of self-discipline organizations of markets,  including the offices of registration, accountants, auditors,  and lawyers; as well as the institutions of notary and  arbitration, chambers of commerce, and associations of various  industries and trades.    D. We should increase in a rational way the scale of  investments made in fixed assets and reinforce the reserve  strength in developing the economy. The key to whether we can  win over the state investments lies on the characters of our  projects. We must make full use of the province's strong points  of infrastructures in energy resources, communications, the  industries of important raw materials, and water conservancy  works; as well as the strong points of more projects for basic  industries; so as to enable more projects in the province to be  oriented into the state overall construction plan. We should  also optimize the investment structure to ensure the  construction of key projects. Meanwhile, a good job should be  done in continuously conducting the work prior to the  construction of projects so as to ensure "the ceaseless  formulation of projects and the ceaseless supply of  investments". Among the projects that have been newly put into  construction, we should emphatically do a good job in grasping  the construction of Shenmu-Huanghua railway and Huanghua Harbor.  We should actively create conditions for the two large projects  of diverting south water to the north and of building the middle  canal of diverting the Chang Jiang's water, which have strategic  significance on the economy of Hebei Province and the country,  so as to ensure the two transcentury projects to be started  within the given date. Except for successfully grasping the  aforementioned key projects that conform with the state  industrial policies, the province as well as various cities and  prefectures should continue to sieve their projects so that we  can build a large number of projects that can exert good  economic results; are greatly needed by markets; cost less  investments; can be completely built in a short period; can  withdraw funds rapidly; are with high additional value; and can  exert high benefits. In readjusting the structure of  investments in 1994, we should adequately increase the  proportion made in urban housing construction. In line with the  state arrangements, we should earnestly implement the new  methods of conducting reform in the urban housing systems and  popularize the housing experience gained by the higher  educational institutions of our province.    E. We should greatly develop science, technology, and  education and realistically channel economic construction to the  track of relying on scientific and technological progress and  improving the quality of laborers. In developing science,  technology, and education, we should focus on the following  work. We should step up establishment and improvement of  enterprises' scientific and technological development institutes  to continuously improve their ability and level in high-tech  development; and all the 741 large and medium-sized enterprises  in the province should create favorable conditions for  establishing scientific and technological development  institutes, and all these institutes should develop the new  products and new technology oriented to adjusting the structure  and improving efficiency. We should encourage development of  non-governmental scientific research institutes,  non-governmental scientific and technological enterprises, the  scientific and technological enterprises owned by the state but  run by the people, and the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises engaged mainly in scientific and technological  development. We should achieve success in establishing a number  of high- and new-tech industrial development zones and high- and  new-tech industrial parks. We should cultivate and build a  number of permanent technology markets, speed up transformation  of scientific and technological achievements, and promote the  close coordination of science and technology with the economy.    We should persistently put education in a strategic position  for development on a priority basis and exert great efforts to  train the personnel in various specialties who meet the needs of  the socialist market economy system. We should further  accelerate reform of the educational system to continuously  improve the quality of instruction. We should greatly intensify  elementary education, greatly develop vocational, technical, and  adult education, stabilize the enrollment of colleges and  universities, and put more efforts into the strong and highly  competitive projects to create achievements and first-rate  personnel.  <H5>  6. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Economic Work </H5>   Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction will  enter a stage of new development next year. We are faced with a  new situation in which the planned economy is being changed into  the market economy. To comply with this new situation, we  should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study well  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and  strive to master the new knowledge and new skills to manage the  market economy. We should take the overall situation into  consideration to ensure the smooth implementation of government  orders. Comrades in charge of leadership work should keep the  overall national and provincial situation in reform and  development in view when considering the work of their own  localities and departments and take the initiative in serving  the overall situation. They should conduct intensive  investigation and study and realistically change their work  styles. Leading cadres at all levels should often go to the  reality of life to conduct investigations and study, pay  attention to studying new conditions, address new problems, and  carry out the work of their own localities and departments in a  creative manner. They should have the courage to try out the  new moves whose worth they are certain and to blaze new trails.  We should use typical examples as a guide and promote the  entire work while achieving breakthroughs in key areas to  accelerate Hebei's reform, opening up, and economic construction.    We should attend to two tasks simultaneously and be  competent  in both. While attending to economic development, we must never  slacken efforts in building the socialist material civilization  and in improving socialist democracy and legal system. We  should intensify efforts to improve public security  comprehensively and strive to eliminate the various factors  leading to instability in society. We should continue the  in-depth anticorruption struggle, eliminate the various ugly  phenomena, and ensure the smooth accomplishment of the tasks of  reform and development.</p>

A representative office will not be opened in Skopje for the  time being, but Macedonia will be diplomatically served by the  Czech Republic from Belgrade, Zieleniec said.    He said the Czech Republic was recognising the state with  its  present borders, and as the former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia, the title it uses for UN membership. The changes  which had taken place concerning the international recognition  of Macedonia at the end of last year and the beginning of 1994  were also a favourable sign for relations between Greece and  Macedonia, Zieleniec added.    Macedonia declared its independence in November 1991, but  for  two years broad international recognition of the state was  prevented by Greece. Greece objected to the name of Macedonia  because it saw its use as amounting to a territorial claim on  the northern Greek province of the same name. Last April,  Macedonia was accepted into the UN with the compromise name of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    On Wednesday [2 February] the Czech Government approved the  recognition of Macedonia, which has been recognised by 20  countries so far.</p>

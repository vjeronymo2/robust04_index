			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses in limited technical recovery Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, did his bit for bourses yesterday, saying that he saw room for a rebound, writes Our Markets Staff. At Wednesday's close, the Paris CAC 40 index was at a low for the year, and down by 20 per cent from its 1994 high, and Mr Alphandery could see no repeat now of the October 1987 stock market crash. PARIS bounced a little after Wednesday's 1994 low but it put in less of a recovery, with the CAC 40 index just 9.66 higher at 1,843.38, than it did from a similar position on Tuesday. Turnover fell to FFr2.64bn as a demonstration against the Renault privatisation disrupted trading on the Matif and Monep exchanges. Significant moves tended to be downwards. Saint Gobain fell FFr6 to FFr612 as its chairman, Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, was questioned again by a judge looking into corruption allegations. Bouygues, the construction group whose consortium won France's third mobile telephone licence this week, fell FFr18 to FFr569 on plans for a rights issue. M6-Metropole Television, introduced to the market last Thursday, dipped FFr3 to FFr307 after fund managers filled their requirements. Chargeurs, the textile company, came back FFr29 to FFr1,284 after it said that its stake in BSkyB would not be materially altered by the flotation of the British satellite broadcaster. However, Damart, the thermal clothing supplier, rose FFr290 to FFr6,040 after results which, lacking comparisons due to a change in the year-end, indicated a 7.1 per cent rise in turnover 'at constant structure' for the year to June. FRANKFURT registered a new 1994 closing low on the official session at 1,961.03, down 7.69. But the real measure of the day was in the post bourse where the Ibis-indicated Dax hit bottom at 1,930.55 on Wednesday, and closed yesterday 18.92 higher at 1,965.41. In that period Volkswagen rose DM9 to DM434.30, and foreign interest was noted. However, turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.4bn and the index reaction looked strictly technical. West German industrial orders fell 2.2 per cent in August from July and were up 6.4 per cent from a year ago. Economists said that the slowdown was not a danger sign for the economy. Mr Reinhard Fischer, a partner in Research Vision, was less sanguine in one sense, saying that, of the building blocks of the economy, neither consumption nor investment in new equipment were pointing to a robust recovery yet. Exports were looking good, he acknowledged, but the weakness of the dollar put a question mark over profitability in that area. He did say that this different quality of growth could allow the Bundesbank some leeway to reduce interest rates further after the German general election. ZURICH finished slightly firmer on futures-related short-covering after weaker futures put the market under pressure. The SMI index closed 4.4 higher at 2,484.8, up from an intraday low of 2,473. Activity focused on insurers, with Swiss Re up SFr23 to SFr688 on foreign demand in the wake of its announcement of a new corporate strategy and the sale of its direct insurance businesses. Second-line insurers benefited from takeover speculation, with Baloise moving up SFr120 to SFr2,595 and Elvia adding SFr70 at SFr3,620. Among cylicals, Motor-Columbus jumped SFr170 to SFr1,850 on speculation that a decision by UBS to sell its stake of more than 50 per cent was imminent. Holderbank finished SFr3 firmer at SFr953, off a high of SFr970, after Bank Julius Baer raised its 1994 earnings estimate to SFr63.7 per share from SFr60 and its 1995 estimate to SFr86.3 a share from SFr75. MILAN saw a technical rebound after Wednesday's 2.4 per cent fall, and the Comit index picked up 5.03 to 646.97, bringing a five-day slide to a halt. However, worries about the continuing row between the government and anti-corruption magistrates continued to act as a disincentive, particularly to foreign investors. Benetton picked up L86 to L19,343 after the 13.1 per cent fall of the previous four sessions, following last week's disappointing results. Merrill Lynch reiterated its positive recommendation on the stock, encouraging investors to exploit the current price weakness and buy. It said that Benetton remained the only larger apparel retailer with a real global presence and the company was successfully diversifying and upgrading its product mix. Its price policy had enabled the company aggressively to increase market share and there was further room to reduce costs. AMSTERDAM saw thin, volatile trade which took the AEX index 0.65 higher to 390.78. VNU dropped Fl 5.10 to Fl 173.50 amid concerns that a new commercial television station, to be launched in the Netherlands, might put pressure on the market share of VNU's television affiliates. Elsevier erased Wednesday's sharp losses in heavy trade, as investors reversed their negative reaction to the purchase of a US data bank. Elsevier rose 90 cents or 5.6 per cent to Fl 17, having fallen 3.5 per cent on Wednesday as dealers expressed doubts over the Dollars 1.5bn it had paid Mead Corp's Lexis-Nexis operation. WARSAW's recovery stalled, with the Wig index virtually unchanged at 9,902.4, but the newly listed construction company ESPEBEPE surged 125 per cent from its issue price to 340,000 zlotys on its first day on the main market. However, the new issue boosted the company's share capital 10-fold and it was criticised for advertising, in these circumstances, based on its historical average price/earnings ratio.

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> EDWARDS SEES HIGH SCORE THIS WEEK  </P> <P> And now, a word from our guest analyst for Saturday's San Diego State-Miami  game: Brigham Young Coach LaVell Edwards.  </P> <P> Who better? BYU defeated then-No. 1 Miami on Sept. 8, 28-21, and SDSU on Sept.  22, 62-34. The Cougars (10-1) won the Western Athletic Conference and will play  Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29.  </P> <P> So, without further ado . . .  </P> <P> "It surely has the appearance of a high-scoring game," Edwards said Wednesday.  "I think San Diego State has as good an offense as we've faced all year.  (Quarterback Dan) McGwire has had an outstanding year, and they have a great  corps of receivers.  </P> <P> "The key for San Diego State is to move the football and get points on the  board. But Miami is a very good offensive football team as well."  </P> <P> Will Miami's defense be able to stop SDSU?  </P> <P> "I think the whole key, obviously, is pass protection," Edwards said. "If San  Diego State can contain Miami's rush, they're going to complete passes and move  the ball. When we played (Miami), I don't think their (defensive) front was in  the same category as last year's group."  </P> <P> And now the topper: What about SDSU's maligned defense? What should we expect  from it?  </P> <P> "A lot depends on how hard they play," Edwards said. "They can't afford to lose  confidence if something (bad) happens.  </P> <P> "Miami is going to move the football. They do it against everybody. What the  (SDSU) defense is going to have to do is come up with plays -- interceptions,  and force punts."  </P> <P> And the winner . . . Edwards didn't have a comment.  </P> <P> SDSU Coach Al Luginbill had a few good words and a few bad ones regarding  Miami.  </P> <P> "This is the part of their program I thoroughly respect: I think they play  games between the lines as well as anybody in college football," Luginbill  said. "I do not want to be like them (regarding) their antics."  </P> <P> Luginbill was referring to Miami's penchant for impromptu dances after plays --  particularly by the wide receivers.  </P> <P> "It's unbelievable," he said. "It's a joke."  </P> <P> Several NFL scouts checked out SDSU's practice Wednesday. One of the NFL's  representatives was Bill Tobin, vice president of player personnel for the  Chicago Bears.  </P> <P> Although Tobin -- like most scouts -- wouldn't discuss players in detail, he  had this to say about McGwire: "I sure do like his size. There's no question  about that. He's well-proportioned."  </P> <P> Tobin planned to view films of McGwire and other SDSU seniors today. He figures  SDSU is about the 50th school he has visited this fall.  </P> <P> Wednesday's practice was just the beginning of a long afternoon/night for  McGwire. After practice, he was interviewed by a crew from ESPN, two local  television crews and a couple of reporters before joining Luginbill for a trip  to a Mission Valley restaurant to appear on a radio show. . . . Luginbill said  he thinks BYU quarterback Ty Detmer should win the Heisman Trophy. "Running  away," Luginbill said. "It will be embarrassing if anybody else gets it." . . .  Tight end Ray Rowe -- SDSU's other Rowe -- is having quite a year, having  caught 16 passes for 243 yards. Last year, SDSU's entire group of tight ends  caught 16 passes. "That's what we practiced, including the tight end in our  offense," Rowe said. "It started off pretty good at the beginning of the  season, slowed down a little in the middle of the season, but it came back.  It's been better than I figured it was going to be. In (fall camp), we weren't  getting too many balls in practice. It was like, 'Uh-oh, it's going to be the  same old stuff again.' " SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

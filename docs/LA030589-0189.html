			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BOOK TRADE: THE YEAR OF THE YOUNG READER  </P> <P> There is a cheerful spirit to the posters, buttons and bookmarks springing up  in libraries, schools and bookstores around the country. But the purpose behind  these displays, and the workshops, read-ins and author appearances that  accompany them is far from frivolous. This is the Year of the Young Reader, a  campaign launched jointly by the Center for the Book and the Children's  Literature Center in the Library of Congress, and supported resoundingly by  book publishers, booksellers, educators and librarians. The effort is intended,  said John Cole at the Center for the Book in Washington, "to focus attention on  the importance of getting young people familiar with books and reading at the  earliest age."  </P> <P> "Libraries, public schools, private schools, day care centers, bookstores --  anybody that has anything to do with children or reading can pick up the ball  and run with it," Janie Coats, of the Children's Literature Center, said.  </P> <P> Inspired by the successful 1987 Year of the Reader program, the young reader  project seizes also on a growing awareness of the literacy problems faced by  many young Americans. A high school diploma is no guarantee of reading skills,  since in some areas, nearly half a graduating class may be borderline  illiterate. One study cited by the Library of Congress found that fewer than  half of the 17-year-olds surveyed could comfortably read a newspaper. Cutbacks  in library funding that have forced some libraries to reduce hours or days of  operation as well as after-school projects have caused additional alarm. Many  educators worry that though young people can read, they simply choose not to.  </P> <P> "Everybody assumes that kids today are learning to read," said Betty Takeuchi,  a co-founder of the Southern California Project for the Year of the Young  Reader, "and they're not."  </P> <P> Many of the YYR activities are promotional: public service announcements  featuring actor LeVar Burton acting as "host/spokesperson," for example. There  are "camera-ready" logos with the slogan, "Give Us Books, Give Us Wings." And  the Library of Congress has issued kid-size, four-color "Readin' and Rollin' "  T-shirts.  </P> <P> Public and private sectors are working together, however, to ensure that the  campaign has substance as well as pizazz. "There's really good stuff happening  all over the country," Cole said. In Florida, for example, newborn babies in  Dade County leave the hospital with YYR book packs that include a read-along  guide, an audiotape for the baby and tiny "Love Me, Read to Me" T-shirts for  the budding bibliophile.  </P> <P> In Southern California, two dozen authors and illustrators of children's books  will gather at a school in San Gabriel in May as one of at least 10 major  public events planned in conjunction with the Year of the Young Reader.  Takeuchi, the owner of the San Marino Toy and Book Co. and president of the  Assn. of Booksellers for Children, said another element of the YYR campaign in  Southern California would feature members of the Dodgers appearing in spot  television announcements to describe their favorite reading material as  children.  </P> <P> With many of the principals on the Southern California committee coming from  the educational management community, Takeuchi said other projects would focus  on reading skills for homeless children, pregnant teen-agers and gang members.  </P> <P> In San Francisco, a daylong multimedia extravaganza to kick off the YYR effort  there nearly overwhelmed its organizers with its success. Only 200 people had  been expected. For lack of space, YYR committee members reluctantly had to cut  off admission tickets at 500.  </P> <P> In Takeuchi's view, one of the long-term benefits of the project has been the  linking of so many aspects of the children's book community. "We've brought  together all these different groups," she said. "Usually we don't all work  together like this."  </P> <P> She said the enthusiasm had grown so high that participants have already agreed  that the Year of the Young Reader will not be a one-shot event. "This will be a  model year," Takeuchi said. "This will continue." Some kind of a public  document, a "manifesto," as Takeuchi called it, will be issued at the end of  the year, she said, outlining how the lessons from this Year of the Young  Reader can be extended.  </P> <P> "Every year can be the Year of the Young Reader," Takeuchi said.  </P> <P> Here in New York, meanwhile, Scholastic Books would no doubt be thrilled to  extend the YYR program indefinitely, provided it can continue to issue the same  YYR bookmark. Scholastic art director Carol Gildar said the publisher nearly  ran into serious problems when it invited employees to bring their kids in to  pose for an illustration of happy little kids, happily reading. Gildar's one  stipulation was that the kids had to be able to sit up.  </P> <P> But hey, even publishing parents can turn into stage moms when there is the  possibility of stardom for their precious little ones. More than one  beach-ball-phased kid, too young to do anything but lie on the floor and look  unhappy about it, was brought in while an anxious mom stood nearby and insisted  that the child knew how to sit up. Thankfully, nine sitting-up babies managed  to finish the shoot without spitting up. Only one child is shown eating a book.  This, presumably, is the ultimate solution to illiteracy.  </P> <P> SATANIC BOMBINGS. On Feb. 28, at 4:30 a.m., Cody's Books, Berkeley, was  firebombed. Damage was minimal, according to owner Andy Ross. A second bomb was  discovered and defused during cleanup after the first. A Waldenbooks outlet in  Berkeley was also bombed on the same day, as was the New York City weekly  newspaper Riverdale Press, which had published an editorial endorsing Salman  Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses." Ross speculated that the bombings were  connected with earlier attacks on the book. "I can't imagine any other reason  why people would be lobbing bombs through bookstores," Ross said.  </P> <P> JERUSALEM PRIZE. Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato is the winner of this year's  Jerusalem Prize, to be presented at the Jerusalem International Book Fair, next  Sunday through March 18. In 1973, Sabato, a novelist, who holds a Ph.D. in  physics, was chosen to head his country's committee investigating the  whereabouts of the "missing persons," or desapercidos. He is the 14th winner of  the prize created in conjunction with the Jerusalem Book Fair, which this year  expected the participation of 1,000 publishers from 40 countries.  </P></p>

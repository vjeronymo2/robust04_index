Among the changes, the most important is to take the  economic  issue as a matter of national security and place it at the  center of U.S. foreign activities.    With the cold war over, the military threat posed to the  U.S.  by the former Soviet Union no longer exists and the strategy of  global confrontation with the Soviets pursued by the U.S.  Government in the past 40 years has lost its real significance.    On the other hand, the U.S. is declining in its economic  power with an enormous amount of resources put into the nuclear  arms race, serious economic and social problems and a high  unemployment rate in three consecutive years.    Since taking office in January, President Clinton has taken  economic recovery as the first priority of his administration  and made efforts to push forward an "economic diplomacy" with  the aim of expanding overseas markets, increasing exports of  U.S. goods and services, cutting deficits in U.S. foreign trade  and creating more jobs for Americans.    As part of the efforts, the Clinton government made a three-  pronged assault in the last few months to ensure success in  three major aspects of vital interests to his country.    First, through extensive and arduous lobbying, it won  congressional approval of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) to pave the way for the creation of the  world's largest free trade bloc with Canada and Mexico.    Second, after bitter bargaining, the United States reached a  compromise with the European Community in the seven-year-long  Uruguay-Round multilateral trade talks by the final deadline of  December 15.    If these two achievements still bear the trademark of the  previous government, the move to develop relations with Asian  countries is mainly a Clinton initiative.    The sustainable economic growth in Asia, especially East  Asia, since the 1980s has made the region the most prosperous  part of the world. The vast market in Asia and its potentials  have no doubt a strong appeal to the rest of the world,  including the United States.    Therefore, Clinton has changed a practice usually adopted by  his predecessors soon after he entered the White House -- he  went to East Asia for his first overseas visit. The President  and his senior administration officials have not only repeatedly  stressed the importance of Asia-Pacific to the United States,  but have also frequently visited this region.    In congressional hearings on foreign policies, the  administration's polices on Asia-Pacific have also taken a very  large proportion.    At the fifth ministerial conference of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) held in Seattle in November 1993,  Clinton took advantage of his position as the host and called an  informal meeting of APEC leaders to discuss cooperation and  development of the region.    Proceeding from reality, the U.S. Administration has also  adjusted its policies on China. During the Seattle conference,  Clinton held a formal meeting with Chinese President Jiang  Zemin, thus making a new, good start in Sino-U.S. relations.    All this shows that the U.S. Administration has changed its  traditional "Eurocentric" policy and begun to attach importance  to developing relations with Asia in its foreign policies.    As the sole superpower today, the United States, while  valuing "economic diplomacy," has of course not forgotten its  "status of leadership" over world affairs.    In this regard, the Clinton administration, unlike its  predecessors, has stressed even more seriously the linkage of  U.S. foreign relations with the so-called issues of "democracy"  and "human rights" of other nations. It forces other nations to  act according to the American concept of values and constantly  threatens rejectors with economic or trade sanctions.    Furthermore, the Clinton administration has maintained that  the United States and other nations adopt allied actions to  interfere with regional conflicts and other "inhuman practices"  under the name of the United Nations and other international  organizations.    This foreign security strategy of the Clinton  administration's has been dubbed by the U.S. media as  "collective interventionism" or "new interventionism."    Whether it is "economic diplomacy" or "new interventionism,"  the fundamental purpose of Clinton's adjustment of foreign  policies is to maintain the U.S. status as "the superpower" and  to build a new world order in the interest of the United States.    However, time brings great changes to the world -- many  Western countries no longer act upon whatever the United States  says and the voice of opposition to foreign interference from  vast numbers of developing nations is becoming increasingly  louder.    The United States has sustained a series of setbacks in its  military operations in Somalia; its once hardline positions on  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti also aroused strong reaction  domestically, sparking off a heated debate on future American  foreign policies.    It has been noticed that the Clinton administration has  begun  to adopt more realistic attitudes on Somali and other regional  conflicts. But, judging from the overall situation, it is  noticeable that the overhaul of U.S. foreign policies has not  yet finished as the foreign policy of the Clinton administration  is still taking its shape.</p>

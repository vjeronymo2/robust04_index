			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Bifu tells George to 'fight harder' The management of the Bank of England has been urged by the Bifu banking union to fight harder for new business. The union says it is concerned that the Bank lost an important bulk clearing contract in one of the few banking areas where it is still prepared to compete. The bank's tender for the clearing house automated payment system was lost to the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Jim Lowe, assistant secretary for the union's Bank of England section, said: 'There are a number of other areas where the Bank has contracts up for renewal and we are concerned about it keeping that work. 'We are also concerned that the Bank is not actively seeking new business. Our interest is in maintaining jobs and careers.' The Bank of England said yesterday that it was only prepared to tender on a limited range of business. It said: 'Bulk clearing is one of the areas where we do try to compete as competitively as we can.' The Bank has said, however, that it does not intend to pursue new areas of business in direct comp-etition with the clearing banks outside its core area of bulk clearing. The bank has not competed with clearing banks in most traditional domestic and commercial banking services for more than 100 years, although it still allows about 200 individuals to maintain private accounts and retains a small number of company accounts.</p>

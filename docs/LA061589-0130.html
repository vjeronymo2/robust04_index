			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANDERSON EXCELLED IN DUAL ROLE FOR BUENA  </P> <P> Although the postseason awards have been rolling in nonstop, baseball season is  hardly over for Matt Anderson of Buena High.  </P> <P> Anderson, who pitched 51 innings for the Channel League-champion Bulldogs,  expects to throw at least another 50 innings before his season ends.  </P> <P> Anderson, who was drafted and signed by the Baltimore Orioles last week, has  been assigned to pitch for the Bluefield Orioles, in Bluefield, W. Va.  </P> <P> The rookie team is composed primarily of recently drafted high school and  junior college graduates and competes in the Appalachian League. The season  begins next week and runs through late August.  </P> <P> Anderson will make his first trip away from home Sunday when he flies to  Bluefield.  </P> <P> "I can't wait. I'm really excited," Anderson said. "I need to get out and get a  chance to grow up.  </P> <P> "The Orioles promised that I would move right into their rookie team's starting  rotation."  </P> <P> The left-hander posted a 7-1 record and 1.49 earned-run average while leading  the Bulldogs to the Southern Section 4-A Division quarterfinals where they lost  to Hart, 10-7. Anderson, troubled by a sore elbow, allowed five runs in two  innings.  </P> <P> Anderson was also among Ventura County leaders in batting average (.465),  doubles (7), triples (3), home runs (7) and runs batted in (31).  </P> <P> He signed a letter of intent with Cal State Northridge and was prepared to  continue his career at the college level. Matt's older brother Mark played at  Northridge and in 1984 helped the Matadors win a Division II national  championship.  </P> <P> Matt planned to follow in Mark's footsteps until Baltimore made him the first  pick of the fifth round June 5.  </P> <P> Matt's father, Bud Anderson, wanted him to earn a college degree before  pursuing a professional career. Bud's baseball career ended after four season  in the Boston Red Sox minor league system.  </P> <P> "I took a pessimistic attitude that I would never sign with Orioles," Anderson  said. "I didn't think the Orioles would offer me enough money where I would be  willing to give up my scholarship."  </P> <P> The Orioles, however, made a favorable impression last Wednesday by offering a  signing bonus, a trust fund toward a college education and a chance to pitch  immediately.  </P> <P> "It seemed like the right thing to do," Anderson said.  </P> <P> Anderson would not disclose the amount of his signing bonus, but it is believed  to be in the $50,000 range. Anderson did say that he received $20,000 to be put  in a trust fund toward a college education after he leaves baseball.  </P> <P> "We think he's good enough to go all the way and play in the majors," Bud  Anderson said.  </P> <P> Apparently, the Orioles believe so, too.  </P></p>

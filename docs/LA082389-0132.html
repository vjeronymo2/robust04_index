			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : GENE BURKERT JOINS PONCHO SANCHEZ GROUP; CONGA DRUMMER JUST BACK  FROM EUROPE  </P> <P> Congero/bandleader Poncho Sanchez, who recently returned from his debut tour of  Europe, has a new saxophonist. Gene Burkert, 25, who has been heard in Los  Angeles with his own quartet and George Stone's Diajobu, has joined the busy  Latin/jazz ensemble, replacing Kenny Goldberg, who was with Sanchez's band for  three years.  </P> <P> Though the decision to change reed players was made by Sanchez -- who fronts  one of the few bands in jazz that both works steadily and maintains a fixed  personnel roster -- both he and Goldberg agree the parting was amicable.  </P> <P> "I like Kenny's playing and writing," Sanchez said Monday from New York, where  his octet was playing the Village Gate nightclub, "but it just wasn't working  out. It was time for a change."  </P> <P> "It had been a good three years," Goldberg said, "but I want to pursue further  musical challenges. I'm already involved in some new writing projects."  Goldberg -- who plays Saturday with John Pisano and Velas at the Made in Brazil  Festival at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium -- contributed several  compositions to Sanchez's book.  </P> <P> For his part, Burkert is thrilled. "I'm working full-time and that will allow  me a lot more time to work on musical things," he said from New York, where he  is traveling with Sanchez. "I was teaching preschool part-time for the City of  Beverly Hills before I joined Poncho and I found it difficult to come home  after that and practice. I could say that my life is a little more relaxed now,  though the band keeps me pretty busy."  </P> <P> Burkert was recommended to Sanchez by reedman Gary Foster, with whom Burkert  has studied for three years. Foster has known the conga drummer since Sanchez  was a member of Cal Tjader's band a decade ago and plays a cameo alto spot on  Sanchez's latest LP, "La Familia" (Concord/Picante). "Gary said Gene was one of  his best students, and he fit in right from the start," said Sanchez, who plays  at Sausalito South in Manhattan Beach next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sanchez said his first European trek, which included the Pori Jazz Festival in  Pori, Finland, and the Grande Parades du Jazz in Nice, France, was rigorous.  "We took 14 plane flights in 16 days, and some of those were followed by four-  and five-hour bus rides."  </P> <P> But rewarding. "It was good. Everybody wants us back. People are finally  starting to get hip to us, so I don't think we better break up the band just  yet," he quipped.  </P> <P> One of the tour's highlights was when trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Arturo  Sandoval, the Cuban ace brassman, sat in with Sanchez's band at Sardinia,  Italy. "That was a gas," Sanchez exclaimed. "We do some of Dizzy's tunes like  'Manteca' and 'A Night in Tunisia.' Dizzy told me, 'Hey, we should do this more  often.' "  </P> <P> Upon his return to the Southland, Sanchez -- who recently purchased a new home  in Norwalk -- made a guest appearance on a Sandoval date produced by the  drummer's manager, Frank Marrone. "That was great," Sanchez said of the session  that spotlighted the multifaceted Sandoval, who was a founding member of  Irakere and who stills resides in Havana. "That guy's got chops."  </P> <P> **** Alan Broadbent's "Away From You" (Trend) is modern mainstream trio music  with definite shelf life. The pianist, bassist Putter Smith and drummer Frank  Gibson Jr. vigorously investigate the nine numbers, storming into "Pent-Up  House" and dancing spritely through "Daahoud" and "Sonny's Step." "Footprints"  is serenity in motion, and the title track, a bittersweet ballad, exposes  Broadbent's finest asset: his never-cloying lyricism.  </P> <P> ****"Twilight Is Upon Us." Windham Hill Jazz. This new album by pianist Billy  Childs is a kind of primer on how to compose and play contemporary jazz without  losing any of the values of the past. Echoes and reverberations of Herbie  Hancock, Wynton Kelly, Horace Silver and Bill Evans drift through almost every  piece, despite the cutting edge qualities of the rhythms, harmonies and  structures. Childs' piano playing, improving by leaps and bounds, is beginning  to cohere into one of the unique voices in contemporary music. A recording that  sets the pace for the coming jazz of the '90s.

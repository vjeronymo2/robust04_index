These contemporary family gathering spaces offer comfort and  relaxation with style. Much is demanded of a family room today.  </P> <P> It may accommodate sophisticated television, video and stereo systems, provide  room for family play, quiet reading, evening work and entertaining, sport a  bright and airy look and give quick access to the kitchen and deck.  </P> <P> But not all family rooms measure up to their owners' needs. Some, with shag  carpeting in worn traffic patterns along with worn furniture, dark paneled  walls, lighting that brightens only the center of room, games and books  cluttered here, there and everywhere, a TV hogging a corner, many family rooms  leave their owners wanting.  </P> <P> Remodeling is an option but not the only one. Here are some quick fixes that  will give your family room new life without emptying your wallet:  </P> <P> Paint: The quickest and best sprucer-upper is paint, even for dark wood  paneling. "Painted wood is one of the hottest looks going," says Denise  Caringer, Executive Furnishings and Design Editor for Better Homes and Gardens  magazine.  </P> <P> Fabrics: Add new, bright colors with throw pillows for a minimum of expense.  Reupholster a tired piece of furniture or re-cover with slipcovers. "Often the  family room has been the catch-all for furniture that has outlived other rooms.  If you can't afford new furniture, the next best thing is to use stylish but  hard-wearing fabrics to make it seem like new. Today's fabrics are wonderful,"  Caringer says.  </P> <P> Carpet: Try an area rug over that tired carpet. "Pick a pattern or color that  complements the old, but draws attention to the new area," Caringer recommends.  "Then reshuffle the furniture for a really quick fix. People generally arrange  furniture in ballroom style -- against the walls with the middle of the floor  open. Put down an area rug and arrange a furniture grouping in the center of  the room. Remember to use a focal point, such as a fireplace or television  center."  </P> <P> Impact: Rather than lots of small-scale furnishings and accessories, update  your look with a few bold elements. Hang an oversized poster rather than a  grouping of small art pieces. Top a coffee table with a huge bowl instead of  tiny knickknacks. Bring in a fat new sofa or lounge chair.  </P> <P> Doors and windows: Replace sliding glass doors with French doors for an airy,  more sophisticated look. Brighten the room with lighter window treatments such  as vertical blinds that can block out the sun and provide some insulation. Or  stash the heavy draperies in favor of a bright fabric swag for a soft but open  look.  </P> <P> Lighting: Come out of the dark with better task lighting. "Clever lighting  schemes don't have to be expensive," Caringer says. Install recessed lighting  or track lights. Direct clip-on lights toward artwork and place up-lights in  plants. Task lighting will brighten the dark corners and make the room more  cheerful for minimum expense. Plus, light makes a room seem larger," Caringer  says .  </P> <P> Clutter: Make up your mind to part with some clutter, often the most difficult  but most important decision in sprucing up a room. "That doesn't mean tossing  Dad's favorite chair, but it does mean a simple paring down. Decide what you  like and then have a garage sale or store the other pieces for awhile to see  how you like living with less," Caringer says.  </P> <P> Personality: No matter what, surround yourself with objects that mean something  to you. Personal style, thank heavens, is in.  </P> <P> Whatever changes you make, use comfort as your guide, for today's family room  is the center for family leisure and time together.  </P></p>

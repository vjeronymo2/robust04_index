			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(fr, ska)": "Gross Domestic Product Rose by 3.5 </F> Percent in the First Quarter"]    [Text] Prague--Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus yesterday told  reporters that, according to the year-on-year figures released  by the Czech Statistical Office [CSU], the gross domestic  product [GDP] in actual prices rose by 3.5 percent in the first  quarter of 1994. The prime minister described this figure as a  breakthrough. According to him, the other macroeconomic  indicators are just as positive.    This result, which defines the CSU's original estimate  (growth of 0.5 to 2.0 percent) considerably more precisely,  comes from the processing of more complete data, CSU Deputy  Chairman Ivan Sujan told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. However,  the current figures are also preliminary and may be further  revised in an upward direction, he emphasized. The reason for  this, according to him, is mainly the unfinished processing of  the documents containing the customs statistics for exports.    Roughly half the increase can be ascribed to the  extraordinary decline in GDP in the first quarter of 1993, with  which the first quarter of 1994 is being compared. As a  consequence of the anticipation of the new taxation system and  the breakup of the federation, retail sales and construction  work rose exceptionally in the last quarter of 1992 and, on the  other hand, inevitably fell in the first quarter of 1993. The  other half of the increase in the first quarter of 1994,  however, obviously signals the expected economic recovery and an  actual GDP increase at a, for the moment, "filtered"  year-on-year rate of 1.5 to 2.0 percent, said the CSU deputy  chairman.    All of the elements of aggregate demand contributed to the  increase. Households' consumption increased in actual prices by  8 percent and investment by 6.8 percent. The reduced base from  the first quarter of 1993 also manifests itself here, however.  The increase in domestic demand amounted to 9.2 percent; in  foreign demand, the decline in exports (caused chiefly by  another reduction in exports to the Slovak Republic) was more  than compensated for by the significant increase in the export  of services. Aggregate demand rose by 8 percent. Nevertheless,  in the Czech Republic, there is still a not quite satisfied  "hunger for imports," brought about by their restriction under  central planning. A substantial part of the increase in  aggregate demand is therefore swallowed up by this increase in  imports, and only the smaller portion is left for the GDP  increase, says I. Sujan. However, this phenomenon is, according  to him, temporary and signals the possibility of a substantial  acceleration in the increase in the GDP in coming years.    The share of industry in the formation of the GDP is  gradually conforming to the share normal for market economies;  it amounted to 42.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994. In  1993, given a decline in industrial output of roughly 5 percent,  the GDP, in essence, stagnated. During the first quarter of  1994, the decline in industrial output came to a virtual halt,  and, therefore, it is no surprise that the rate of the increase  in the GDP is roughly four points higher, says Sujan. Apart  from the changes in industry, the rise in the output of  services, construction, and trade has also played a role in GDP  activity.    The GDP, like the majority of economic indicators, is also  influenced by regular seasonal fluctuations. After their  influence has been filtered out, the GDP, in the first quarter  of 1994, compared with the average for 1993, is 2.3 percent  higher and, compared with the average for 1992, is 2 percent  higher. The seasonally adjusted GDP in the first quarter of  1994 is, however, still roughly 18 percent lower than the  average for 1990. The CSU wonders, however, whether there  really has been such a major decline between these years. That  is to say, it is necessary to take into consideration the real  effect of the so-called gray economy, which official statistics  cannot ascertain at the moment. According to some estimates, it  generates 10-15 percent of the GDP, and its output since 1990  has increased by up to 50 percent. This would mean an increase  in the established GDP level of 5 to 7.5 points. Another  problem is that the price increases during transformation are  not reflected in simple price increases alone but partly in an  improvement in the quality and range of goods. The influence of  the statistically unascertained part of this activity may be of  the same extent as the gray economy. This would mean, according  to Sujan, that the decline in the overall real product since  1990 was, in fact, much less and was in the range of 3 to 8  percent.   <H5>    The GDP (in billions of korunas [Kc] and in actual </H5> prices)    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |First Quarter                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indicator                |1993                     |1994                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Household consumption    |46.3                     |50.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Government consumption   |20.9                     |21.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Formation of fixed capit-|16.1                     |17.2                     |  |al                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Formation of inventories |3.8                      |6.6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total domestic demand    |87.1                     |95.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exports of goods, servic-|56.9                     |60.4                     |  |es                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total aggregate demand   |144.0                    |155.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Imports of goods, servic-|50.8                     |59.0                     |  |es                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |GDP                      |93.2                     |96.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Year-on-Year Changes                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indicator                |Kc                       |Percent                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Households' consumption  |+ 3.7                    |+ 8.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Government consumption   |+ 0.4                    |+ 1.9                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Formation of fixed capit-|+ 1.1                    |+ 6.8                    |  |al                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Formation of inventories |+ 2.8                    |Not given                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total domestic demand    |+ 8.0                    |+ 9.2                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exports of goods, servic-|+ 3.5                    |+ 6.2                    |  |es                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total aggregate demand   |+ 11.5                   |+ 8.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Imports of goods, servic-|+ 8.2                    |+ 16.1                   |  |es                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |GDP                      |+ 3.3                    |+ 3.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

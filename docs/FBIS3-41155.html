			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 19 January on  pages 14 and 15 carries a 900-word article by Liz Mineo on the  serious crisis affecting San Martin Department due to the  reduction of drug trafficking activities in Huallaga in the last  few months.    Peasants are learning a hard lesson because they cannot sell  drugs due to the shortage of flights and low prices; therefore,  they have discovered that "coca is no longer the remedy for all  their ills." A peasant in the Tres Unidos settlement, 250 km  from Tarapoto, said: "When I was growing corn or yucca I could  eat them if I did not sell them. But if I don't sell coca I  cannot eat it."    The great majority of peasants in Huallaga abandoned  agricultural production to grow coca and make cocaine base,  which was more profitable and easier to sell. During the  1991-1992 agricultural season in San Martin Department, peasants  planted 16,524 hectares of corn, which was about half the area  planted the year before.    Coffee production was affected most, dropping from 3,149  hectares in the 1990-1991 harvest to 143 hectares the year  after. The same thing happened with beans, dropping from 3,945  hectares in 1990-1991 to 1,388 hectares the next season. Even  banana production dropped considerably. A Juanjui peasant said:  "In the jungle we were eating bananas grown in the coastal  region. We were all going crazy growing coca."    Although coca fever has not ended, police were able to  reduce  drug trafficking activities in Huallaga, thus reducing drug  prices considerably. Tingo de Ponaza Mayor Enrique Reategui  said: "Peasants now are more willing to grow other products  because coca growing has become risky and not very profitable."    During the 1992-1993 agricultural season, peasants planted  34,443 hectares of rice; two years ago it was only 22,723  hectares. During the same season, peasants planted 18,753  hectares of corn, which was 13.5 percent higher than the year  before. Cotton production also increased considerably, going  from only 53 hectares in 1991-1992 to 1,173 hectares. One  Taraporo peasant said: "We will continue growing coca but we  are back growing corn, bananas, and yucca to have something to  eat when we are not able to sell coca."    Some people believe the increased rice and corn cultivation  is a demonstration of agricultural reactivation in San Martin.  One of the most optimistic is Gonzalo Villavicencio, president  of the San Martin Regional Government, who said: "Agriculture  is in full reactivation because there is greater support by the  government and a trend by peasants to get on the legal path."    Many peasants have abandoned coca growing, but many more are  willing to begin poppy growing because it is more profitable  than traditional crops, the article concludes.</p>

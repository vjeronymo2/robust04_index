From turnover of Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 1.92m) operating profit was Pounds 517,000 (Pounds 263,000).

Inco, the principal shareholder, continued to give assistance. On the financial side it had made available a facility of up to Dollars 450,000 (Pounds 300,000) to continue operations. Royal Bank of Canada agreed to defer payments of principal and interest during the reorganisation.</p>

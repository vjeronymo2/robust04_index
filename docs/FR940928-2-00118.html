			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This change alters the assumptions of the safety analysis for the Small-Break Loss of Coolant Accident, the Steam Generator Tube Rupture and the Loss of Normal Feedwater due to their dependence on the AFW system to start and supply AFW flow for heat removal. To support this change the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has performed an analysis of the Small-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident using the NOTRUMP code assuming ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. This analysis resulted in a Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) of 1053 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F from an initial power level of 100%. All other acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 were [also] met. This large margin to the 2200 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F PCT limit supports ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, WPSC has analyzed the Loss of Normal Feedwater and the Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident assuming delays in the initiation of auxiliary feedwater. The Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident with a ten minute delay in the initiation of Auxiliary Feedwater does not result in any adverse condition in the core. It does not result in water relief from the pressurizer safety valves, nor does it result in uncovering the tube sheets of the steam generators. Also, at all times the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) remained greater than 1.30. The Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident with no Auxiliary Feedwater flow was also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that neither steam generator empties of liquid and at least 20 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F of reactor coolant system subcooling is maintained throughout the transient. Also, there is no increase in the radiological dose to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, these changes will not adversely effect the health and safety of the public or involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 --> Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Administrative Changes to Section TS 3.4 ``Steam and Power Conversion System''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore, no significant hazards exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(i) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e.(i) states that changes which are purely administrative in nature; i.e., to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correct an error, or a change in nomenclature, are not likely to involve a significant hazard.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> University of Wisconsin Library Learning Center, 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bradley D.

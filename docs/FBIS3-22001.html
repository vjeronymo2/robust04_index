			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Roman Lejtman] </F>   [Text] U.S. Vice President Al Gore's blitz visit helped to  confirm that Alberto Lestelle [programming and coordination  secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and the antinarcotics  struggle], Hugo Anzorreguy [National Intelligence Center, CNI,  secretary], and [Interior Minister] Carlos Ruckauf will be  travelling to Washington to meet with Robert Gelbard, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for international narcotics  matters. The Argentine officials will assist the Clinton  administration in drafting the agenda for the so-called Summit  of the Americas, to be held in Miami at the end of this year,  which is to be attended by the presidents of the Americas to  discuss issues pertaining to narcotrafficking, corruption, and  terrorism, among others. The Argentine proposal, which is still  being drafted, suggests an overall modification of penal  regulations to prevent drug cartels from continuing to take  advantage of legal gaps.    According to a communique issued last night by Lestelle's  office, "at the suggestion of President Menem the antinarcotics  struggle will be included on the agenda of the Summit of the  Americas."    Menem wants to arrive in Miami with his homework done. He  will therefore be launching an offensive at the legislative  level to promulgate a series of laws based on measures that have  been suggested by the United States. Menem believes that for  the time being, no new scandals involving the government with  ill-gotten money will show up. In view of this he has decided  to take advantage of this situation to push for passage four  laws that he personally put on hold when the scandals broke  involving the suitcases belonging to [Menem's sister-in-law]  Amira [Yoma] and Monzer Al Kassar's citizenship.    During his visit to Mar del Plata, where he attended the  ordinary meeting of the Inter-American Commission for the  Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD), Gelbard gave his blessings to the  four draft bills that Lestelle uncovered when he learned that  Amira would be acquitted before the end of 1994. Three years  after learning about Yoma's bizarre activities, Lestelle is  supporting the following initiatives:    -- Repentant: It authorizes magistrates to reduce the  sentences of those drug traffickers who agree to cooperate with  the courts. The implementation of this legal figure resulted in  the dismantling of the gang to which Amira Yoma reportedly  belonged. The government is not worried about Mario Caserta,  the only one arrested under the Narcogate deal, because it is  expected that Menem's former friend will be released before the  approval of the repentant law.    -- Informer: It lifts the penalty of those involved who  supply information on the operations of drug cartels. It is one  grade lower than repentant.    -- Undercover Agent: It allows security force members to  infiltrate drug cartels under the control of the courts.    -- Cargoes Under Court Surveillance: It authorizes the  continuation of drug operations to detain those responsible in  the country where the drug is received.    Referring to the issues he discussed with Gore during an  impromptu news conference, Menem said: "We discussed the  scourges of narcotrafficking and terrorism, and the urgent need  to undertake joint efforts to combat them." The president did  not explain to the journalists what these "joint efforts" would  be, but he did give an indication of the U.S. Government's  aspirations, which go beyond the bills the Argentine Government  has promised to promote in Congress.    -- "Is there any possibility that the Armed Forces would  participate in the counternarcotics struggle?" a journalist  asked.    -- "Not for the time being," answered Menem.    -- "Why not for the time being?"    -- "Because that is the way it is: Not for the time being.  A politician cannot make predictions. A politician talks about  facts. I am talking about a fact: Not for the time being."</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: A surrealist cast of symbols - Sculpture Phillip King, the lately retired Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art, is now 58. He read Modern Languages at Cambridge before turning to sculpture, which he studied under Anthony Caro at St Martin's in the late 1950s, followed by a brief stint, around 1960, as an assistant to Henry Moore. Late vocation or not, his critical success was almost immediate. He was a particular star of Bryan Robertson's seminal New Generation show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1965; a trustee of the Tate by 1967; CBE by 1974; ARA by 1977; and subject of a full retrospective at the Hayward Gallery by 1981. All the while there has been a constant stream of shows at home and abroad, regular solo shows of current work with the old Rowan Gallery, and significant contributions to group exhibitions. In short, King is a substantial and influential figure in his generation, an artist with a truly international reputation. Or is he? Any artist, in shifting the course of art in his turn, though by only a little, only adds to its impetus and the capacity of those who follow to shift it further in their turn. Our much vaunted British Sculpture, in received opinion our one consistent and truly significant contribution to the world's art in the 20th century, is carried on by other, younger hands. If King's reputation has lain somewhat in the shadows since the apparent zenith some 10 years ago or more, the show at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, along with Tim Hilton's timely and invaluable monograph, affords us the proper occasion to bring it once more, quite literally, out into the light of day. King's work is, of course, no stranger to the open air, but with such public monuments as the 'Clarion' at Fulham Broadway, and the 'Diamond Sculpture' beside the road at Street in Somerset, it is more familiar in an urban of industrial than a rural context. Also, his early use of bright, unnatural colour and apparently insubstantial materials, and the long, inevitable practice of showing even the most monumental of the works inside the gallery, have conspired in the common belief that the true place for his sculpture is indoors. Only to the comparative few of his public, familiar with the sculpture garden of his long-time dealer, Alex Gregory-Hood at Loxley in Warwickshire, will this splendidly bucolic display in the park at Bretton Hall come as no surprise. Even to them, with so many definitive pieces on show, the urge to modify both expectation and judgment is irresistible. For what emerges is not just that these things look so much at home on the grassy slopes beneath the trees, but rather that brightly coloured or drab and natural, they display a remarkable consistency both in their imaginative preoccupation and formal development. The differences are clear enough: the hints at figurative reference in the earliest; the overt figuration in the latest works; and, in between, works in which formal and material considerations are over-riding. Yet, whichever it is, what brings it so to sit happily with the oeuvre at large is an unmistakable sense, not just of space occupied and articulated, but of a place established and enclosed. Given the open nature of so many of the structures in the purely formal sense, this may seem a somewhat contradictory thing to say but, even so, it holds good. Stonehenge may be open now to all the winds that blow, but its sense of enclosure and, more than that, of being enclosed to some purpose, is undeniable. And by how much is the same true of ruins of all kinds, whether of castles or cottages, temples, tombs, sacred graves? If King does not make the point himself, the works make it for him in a remarkable combination of sculptures, set out more or less across the slope and half-way down the hill toward the lake. On either side sit two works of 1977, 'Open Place' and 'Sure Place', each a low slanting structure, deceptively tumbled, of slabs of slate set into a steel framework. In between are two bright and open structures, arched and sprung, not so much higher and with the same scope across the ground. They could hardly be more different, and yet so very much the same: the dome, the canopy, the tent, the tomb. So back it is to those earliest things, to 'Genghis Khan' of 1963, dark blue against the green and what might be a great swirling cape or tent surmounted by an imperious set of heraldic antlers. On to the most recent things, to the clouds and the arcades and tumbled elements, redolent of Giacometti and de Chirico, Picasso and Miro: and again, King sets out the same contained space, though now a stage, as it were, on which to put his discrete surrealist cast of symbols - the hand, the ball, the moon. Those latest, openly surrealist works may seem something of an arbitrary break in the natural development, romantic as ever but a conscious rejection of the abstract and the formal. Shown as they are, however, in the pavilion in the upper garden alongside a group of the earliest things, colourful pyramids and cones fraught with a latent surrealism, they seem less so, less certainly than they did new and alone a year or two ago. Who knows where they may tend? But an artist in mid-career is the master of is own direction, and the professor, Emeritus now, has yet to collect his bus pass. Already the work comes together, all of a piece. There is plenty of time. Phillip King - Sculpture 1960-1991, Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Bretton Hall, Wakefield until August 31.

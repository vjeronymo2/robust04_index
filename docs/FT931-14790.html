			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Italy moves to promote share ownership: Tax breaks for investors among pre-privatisation measures approved by cabinet ITALY'S cabinet yesterday approved wide-ranging measures to boost popular share ownership ahead of its ambitious privatisation programme. The steps, originally expected last month, include tax breaks for investors in newly-quoted companies and the chance to swap holdings in government bonds for privatised shares. The keenly-expected draft law, which has still to be approved by parliament, yesterday pushed share prices upwards. The Comit share index closed up 10.44 at 478.62, after a strong week in which shares have climbed on the back of strong foreign and domestic buying. Among the most important measures was a 27 per cent tax break to investors on purchases of up to L7.5m (Pounds 3,560) a year in shares of newly floated companies - if the stock is held for at least three years. The measure amounts to a L2m annual tax reduction to investors buying their full entitlement of shares. Ministers also opened the door for investors to exchange government bonds for shares in newly-privatised companies controlled by the treasury. The bonds, likely to be immediately retired, would directly reduce the outstanding stock of state debt. The bonds would have to have a minimum five years' maturity. Other steps approved include independent funding for Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, which would now 'charge' for its services through some form of levy on share trading. The cabinet also gave the go-ahead to the concept of the 'golden share' to guarantee a state role in some newly-privatised concerns. Investors would also be able to choose how their dividends are taxed. The current highly complex system includes a flat-rate 10 per cent withholding tax and the inclusion of dividend receipts in annual income tax returns. Investors would be able to opt for a 30 per cent tax at source.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the </F> republic of Srpska, by Momir Brkic in Belgrade "shortly before"  the news program -- recorded]    [Text] [Brkic] Good evening, Mr. President.    [Karadzic] Good evening.    [Brkic] Could you summarize for the listeners of Belgrade  Radio the events concerning peace negotiations on the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and express your expectations for 1994.    [Karadzic] First, I want to congratulate this official,  international new year to all citizens of the Serbian lands,  particularly the fighters on the defense lines of the Serbian  lands, although I think that there will be opportunities to  congratulate them on our own traditional Serbian Orthodox New  Year. I want to congratulate them and thank them on behalf of  all those whom they have saved and on behalf of the sacred and  great aim that they are accomplishing by risking their youth and  their lives. I also want other citizens to see the  centuries-old aim of the Serbian people being realized next  year, namely common life in a common state.    1993 has certainly been a year of great tests for the Serbs,  because the world has found itself out of balance and to some  extent off track, as all things in physics and nature fall off  track when they are out of balance. The interests of major  powers are simply congealed and, unfortunately, the Serbian  people and their state have again found themselves on the path  of big powers, above all on the path of German interests in  Europe.    This year was marked by the brutal and unscrupulous  realization of the big powers' aims, the total lack of  international law, the absence of any scruples, and great  dangers for the Serbian people with unprecedented threats. I  think that the past year was also a year for Russia's gradual  recovery. This was also a year in which many Orthodox countries  realized what was going on and extended either more or less  support to the Serbian people and Serbia.    Certain changes and improvements for our benefit also  happened in Europe, because there are conflicting interests in  Europe itself. The brutal policy of Germany has opened the eyes  of, above all, the British, who have realized what is going on.  Unfortunately, this policy has even more firmly tied the French  to Germany. This was a year in which we withstood pressure  exerted on us because of the Vance-Owen plan, which we rejected,  a year in which President Clinton assumed his post, a year in  which he had to bear the burden left behind by the previous  administration, the burden of anti- Serbian views and attitudes.  We also witnessed the United States slightly distancing itself  from the crisis in Yugoslavia this year.    In brief, this was a year that will be remembered by the  Serbian people for unprecedented pressure, which they withstood,  as well as unprecedented dignity and resistance of the Serbian  people.    Next year, we expect relations in the European Union and the  world as a whole to further differentiate themselves. We expect  uniformity to be restored to some extent. We expect the United  States to concentrate on Asia and we expect many European  countries, even some from the European Union, to try to oppose  German domination. We expect Russia to become stronger and  declare its interests in the Balkans, which also affects the  Serbs, and we expect Greece to invest a great deal of effort in  the first half of next year on settling the Yugoslav crisis --  particularly the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Brkic] Mr. President, at the end of our conversation, I  would like to thank you on behalf of the First Program of  Belgrade Radio on the exceptional cooperation during 1993,  cooperation that enabled our listeners to always be timely  informed on what was happening in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the international scene, and at the negotiations. You  personally made a great contribution.    Finally, we hope that peace will be established in this  region and that you appear on our programs more as a poet than a  politician, because, as Branko Miljkovic said, he who does not  listen to a poem will have to listen to a storm.    [Karadzic] Thank you very much. I must say that you deserve  more thanks than we do. Radio and Television of Serbia and,  thus, Belgrade and Novi Sad Radios have been closely following  us and our struggle since 1990. They saw that this struggle was  just and did not spare any efforts to help us. We are brothers  and perhaps words of gratitude from each side are superfluous.  I believe that this is what makes us a nation, one being. It  is good that gratitude exists on both sides.    [Brkic] Thank you and good luck.</p>

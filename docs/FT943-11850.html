The official view is that they are safe, but the fear is that they are leaking radioactive contamination that could destroy the world. According to True Stories (Channel 4 at 9.30) this is exactly what is happening. Only now are the stories of the disasters which have befallen the Soviet fleet of nuclear submarines coming to light. They are believed to have claimed the lives of more than 200 men, hence the title, The Widow Makers. A bogeywoman who ended her career a much loved superstar features in Martina  -Farewell to a Champion (BBC 1 at 10). The life of the tennis ace Martina Navratilova is traced from childhood in Prague to emotional exit from Wimbledon this summer as beaten finalist. The Proms get a TV screening tonight (BBC 2 at 7.30), thanks to the appearance of the dynamic Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.

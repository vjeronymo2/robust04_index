			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Well, so much for the critics," NBC News president Michael Gartner scoffs in a  staff memo noting the ratings success of "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," which  critics roasted because of its news re-creations. "The viewers viewed -- in big  numbers," the news chief crows in his communique. He said "YTT" won its time  slot with a 12 rating and 23% audience share and held "its audience throughout  the hour" for its debut last Wednesday at 10 p.m. He also noted that the debut  of ABC's far more publicized "PrimeTime Live" last Thursday "had lesser numbers  and was third in its time period." Two more editions of "YTT" will air on Aug.  23 and Sept. 13, after which NBC will decide if the program will go as a  series. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

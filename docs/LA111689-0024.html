			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> CLUES TO CHANDLER'S TROUBLED LIFE  </P> <P> Dashiell Hammett in "The Maltese Falcon" gave the world Sam Spade and the  private detective as a literary sub-genre. Then a curious and troubled figure  named Raymond Chandler, in a short but blazing series of novels, extended the  form and became the principal poet of all the knights in frayed trench coats  walking alone down mean streets.  </P> <P> The Chandler centenary was widely celebrated in 1988 and one of the events was  a profile done for Melvyn Bragg's "The South Bank Show" on London Weekend  Television. Produced and directed by David Thomas, edited and hosted by Bragg,  "Raymond Chandler" gets its first U.S. showings tonight on Bravo cable at 5 and  10. It will be shown again at the same hours on Nov. 24 and Nov. 29.  </P> <P> There is evidently no footage on Chandler and only a handful of stills and  family album pictures. To compensate, Thomas uses actor Robert Stephens to play  Chandler and to read from his letters and essays. With his horn-rim glasses and  center-parted hair, Stephens bears a close resemblance.  </P> <P> Although born in Chicago, Chandler did most of his growing up in England after  his father deserted the family and his mother returned to live with relatives  in South London. He attended Dulwich College, to which Bragg's camera pays a  charming visit. One of the dorms is called Marlowe and it seems inevitable that  that's where Philip Marlowe got his name.  </P> <P> Ironically, Chandler always felt more a displaced Englishman than a native  American, although his command of the American vernacular was superb. In his  early days in London, he wrote standard poetry and sharp-tongued reviews but  could not make a living at either and ended up as a quite successful oil  executive in Los Angeles until drinking cost him his job.  </P> <P> Adrift in middle age, he started writing for Black Mask and other pulp  magazines and found what he should have been doing all along.  </P> <P> Interviews with his principal biographer Frank McShane, literary historian  Matthew Broccoli, producer John Houseman, Robert Mitchum (who twice played  Marlowe) and San Diego columnist Neil Morgan, an acquaintance during Chandler's  last days in La Jolla, confirm what a troubled life he led.  </P> <P> His wife, 17 years older than he, was an invalid for years. He never conquered  his problems with alcohol and, after little more than a dozen years of  brilliant productivity, Chandler seemed a burnt-out case. His last novel,  "Playback," was not successful, and an uncompleted manuscript, "The Poodle  Springs Story," lately completed as an homage by Robert B. Parker, had few  traces of Chandler's earlier energy and bite.  </P> <P> Yet "The Big Sleep," "Farewell My Lovely," "The High Window," "The Lady in the  Lake" and "The Long Goodbye" may well be the most influential (e.g., imitated)  body of work in American crime fiction. An impressive list of actors --  Humphrey Bogart, Mitchum, Dick Powell, Robert Montgomery, George Montgomery,  Elliott Gould -- have played Marlowe. And the books as well as the films have  introduced generations to Los Angeles of the '30s and '40s.  </P> <P> Even now there are streets in Hollywood where the ghost of Marlowe seems to  reside, although you look in vain for the drive-ins Marlowe used to pass on  Ventura Boulevard, "offering food that would poison a toad."  </P> <P> It is a melancholy documentary but inescapable for anyone who cares about crime  fiction and its ongoing debt to Chandler.  </P></p>

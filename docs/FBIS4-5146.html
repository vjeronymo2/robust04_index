			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening speech by Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the Supreme </F> People's Assembly (SPA), delivered at the opening of the seventh  session of the ninth SPA held at Mansudae Assembly Hall on the  morning of 6 April -- recorded]    [Text] Comrade Deputies: Today we are holding the seventh  session of the ninth SPA at a time when all the people are  upholding the party's call and the militant tasks presented by  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year's address  and the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Central Committee of  the Workers Party of Korea in vigorously waging a struggle to  effect a new revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and  to smash [chitpusida] the anti-republic maneuvers of  imperialists and reactionaries who are making more malicious  efforts than ever before.    Overflowing with invincible faith and optimism, our people,  who are single-heartedly united around the party and the leader  [suryong], powerfully displayed the superiority and invincible  might of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style  and firmly defended the socialist cause without any vacillation  during acute confrontation with the enemies by effecting an  upsurge in the construction and revolution, after the conclusion  of the sixth session of the ninth SPA. [applause]    Our people, under the wise leadership of the party and the  leader [suryong], vigorously waged the three revolutions --  ideological, technological, and cultural -- in every domain of  socialist construction, holding aloft the revolutionary,  socialist banner of the chuche idea. In so doing, our people  brilliantly adorned the last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan  by strengthening the country's political, economic, military  power all the more, and triumphantly advancing the chuche  socialist cause.    Observing the 30th anniversary of the publication of the  great agricultural thesis, our people have proudly summed up the  brilliant achievements and results scored in socialist  agricultural construction, and are powerfully waging the  struggle for the ultimate solution of the socialist agricultural  problem, holding aloft the respected and beloved leader's  [suryong] historic letter to the national agricultural meeting.    Our party designated the next three years as a period for  adjustment based on scientific analysis of the present status of  the situation today and our country's socialist economic  construction, to set forth a revolutionary economic strategy in  thoroughly implementing agriculture-first, light industry-first,  and trade-first policy; to give priority to the leading sectors  of people's economy; and to further develop the metal industry.    The economic strategy put forward by our party is a most  just economic strategy of our style for renovating the nation's  economic structure in compliance with the practical demands of  changed international circumstances [pyonhwadoen kukjejok  hwangyong] and our national economy and for effecting a change  in direction [panghyang chonhwan] in foreign trade. [applause]    Today we are faced with the grave and honorable tasks of  more  satisfactorily resolving the problems pertaining to the people's  living by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary  economic strategy in accordance with the demand of socialism and  of promptly upgrading [chukhyo seuda] the nation's overall  economy.    Our people must fulfill tasks of the adjustment period of  socialist economic construction amid fierce confrontation with  the enemy.    By cherishing rock-firm faith that as long as there is the  wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] who is  leading the Korean revolution along the single road of victory  with ironclad will and refined leadership, we will win victory  without fail, our people today are vigorously accelerating the  general march to carry out the works of the adjustment period of  socialist economic construction.    Held during this historic time, the current SPA session will  discuss issues with great significance in effecting a new great  revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and in  consolidating and developing the systems of the state and  society. Thus, it will greatly contribute to glorifying the  socialist cause. [applause]    Six hundred and fifteen of the 653 SPA deputies are in  attendance at the seventh session of the ninth SPA. Therefore,  the session can be convened in accordance with Article 93 of the  DPRK Socialist Constitution.    I firmly believe that with the active participation of all  comrades deputies, the current SPA will satisfactorily discuss  and decide agenda items put forward at the session. I now  declare the seventh session of the ninth SPA open. [applause]</p>

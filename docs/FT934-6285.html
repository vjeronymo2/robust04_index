			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Sterling extends gains Currency markets had a quiet session as traders squared their books ahead of today's Thanksgiving holiday in the US, and European operators sat back to wait for next Tuesday's UK Budget and Thursday's Bundesbank meeting, writes Conner Middelmann. Sterling extended Tuesday's climb against the D-Mark by another pfennig, but ran out of steam just below key resistance at DM2.54 and edged back on moderate volume, closing at DM2.5325, after a previous DM2.5275. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4880, up from Dollars 1.4855. The pound's rise follows Tuesday's  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base rates. While many market participants are calling for another  1/2 point reduction in coming months, the currency is widely expected to remain underpinned as the UK economy continues its gradual recovery and continental European central banks ease their interest rates more sharply than the UK. 'Many feel we are close to the trough for UK interest rates and the market is confident on lower European rates,' said Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS. 'The resulting interest rate differential will favour the pound.' In the sterling money market, the Bank of England announced an early shortage of some Pounds 750m, later revised to Pounds 650m. The Bank did not operate in the money market throughout the day but provided late assistance of Pounds 255m in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the Bank of England set a weekly rollover rate for its special money market facility at 5 13/16 per cent. Last week the weekly rollover rate was established at 5 23/32 per cent. The Italian lira recovered against the D-Mark after hitting a record low of L1,005 on Tuesday. It slid sharply following Sunday's elections which prompted worries over the country's political outlook and its government's ability to pass the 1994 budget. The lira rose to an intraday high of L986.25 per D-Mark and finished at L988.5, against L994.5 on Tuesday. 'The market has taken a more sanguine view that the 1994 budget will be passed,' said a London currency dealer, who reported heavy institutional lira-buying against D-Marks. 'Towards the L1,000 level there is significant support from medium-term investors, who feel that, once the political concerns have passed after the elections, the lira will appreciate on the back of fundamental factors,' he said. The French franc firmed slightly against the D-Mark, boosted largely by technical buying after the D-Mark breached psychologically important support at FFr3.4700. It closed at FFr3.468, after FFr3.471 on Tuesday. However, the Bank of France is not expected to take advantage of its currency's strength to make rate cuts independently of the Bundesbank. Instead, it should continue to use franc strength to rebuild its currency reserves. The first set of Germany's long-awaited November inflation numbers had little market impact. The consumer price index in the western German state of Hesse rose 0.3 per cent from October but the year-on-year rate slowed to 3.8 per cent. Economists are forecasting a year-on-year rate of around 3.7 per cent. Two more preliminary inflation reports are due to be released today by the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, and Baden-Wuerttemberg, the second-largest state. Bavaria's data are expected on Friday. The Bundesbank's allocation of DM82bn of 14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed 6.25 per cent bore few surprises and left the rate for German overnight money trading little changed around 6.45 per cent. The central bank added DM12.2bn in liquidity to replace the Paragraph 17 funds it had injected on Monday and rolled over on Tuesday. Market operators are now looking to next week's round of repos and Thursday's central bank council meeting - the penultimate before the end of the year. In spite of Monday's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers, many market participants are still speculating on another 50 basis-point cut in Germany's official discount and Lombard rates at one of the two meetings set for December 2 and 16. The Canadian dollar came under pressure over fresh concern regarding the country's federal deficit after a Finance Ministry offical confirmed newspaper reports stating that the 1993/94 federal budget deficit will top CDollars 40bn and could rise as high as CDollars 45bn. Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, is to provide new projections of the 1993/94 deficit in Montreal next Monday. The Bank of Canada was rumoured to have intervened to support the Canadian dollar against the US dollar as it weakened past CDollars 1.3300. It closed at CDollars 1.3295, down from CDollars 1.3270 on Tuesday. The currency showed little reaction to news that the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's Corp lowered its credit rating for the province of Ontario to double A minus from double A, a move that had been widely discounted. The US dollar traded erratically in thin volume, rising briefly after the release of strong US durable goods numbers but falling back on position-squaring ahead of the holiday, which many are expected to turn into a four-day weekend. The currency ended at DM1.7025, up from Tuesday's DM1.7010, and at Y108.15, down from Y108.50. It closed in New York at DM1.7023 and Y108.14.  --------------------------------- POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------- Nov 24        Close    Prev. close  --------------------------------- Pound spot   1.4885         1.4855 1 mth        1.4855         1.4823 3 mth        1.4811         1.4780 1 yr         1.4670         1.4636  ---------------------------------</p>

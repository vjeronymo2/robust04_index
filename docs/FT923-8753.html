			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Fernandez Ordonez dies after long illness Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the former foreign minister who helped guide Spain's integration into the European Community, died yesterday after a long illness, AP reports from Madrid. He was 62. Mr Fernandez Ordonez had asked to be relieved from his post as foreign minister in June. He had suffered from cancer of the liver and gall bladder problems and was also operated on for an intestinal ailment in 1989. Formerly known as the untiring workhorse of the Socialist government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, Mr Fernandez Ordonez took over at the Foreign Ministry in 1985, three years after the Socialists took office. One of the most popular and respected figures in the Gonzalez government, he was replaced on June 26 by Mr Javier Solana. News reports said Mr Gonzalez interrupted his summer holidays on Thursday to visit Mr Fernandez Ordonez early yesterday. A tax lawyer by training, Mr Fernandez Ordonez was outspoken in his advocacy of EC unity - and Spain's controversial efforts to rise to the challenge.</p>

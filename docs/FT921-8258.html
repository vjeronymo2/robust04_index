			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber agreement at risk, claims EIU THE INTERNATIONAL rubber agreement has been put at risk by the failure to agree a cut in price support levels, the Economist Intelligence Unit says, writes David Blackwell. One of the strengths of the agreement, which operates through a buffer stock, has been that it confines itself to price stabilisation and does not try to give long-term support to prices - a commitment which has brought about the collapse of most international commodity agreements to date, the EIU says in its latest World Commodity Forecasts. Producers are understandably dismayed at the low level of prices, which have fallen 'almost to the 170.6 cents a kilo of the 1985 disaster year in current terms and well below it in real value'. But if the buffer stock is taken up to the maximum level of 550,000 tonnes while there is still no upturn in demand in sight, the agreement and the buffer stock could be threatened, together with a more serious collapse of natural rubber prices.</p>

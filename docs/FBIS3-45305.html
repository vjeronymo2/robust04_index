			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193) and Jiang Jun </F> (1203 6511); Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1618  GMT on 17 January transmits a service message correcting the  following item; differences between the two versions are noted  below]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (XINHUA) -- Representatives of the  Chinese and U.S. Governments concluded and reached agreement on  the fourth round of negotiations on bilateral textile trade  talks.    Shi Guangsheng, Chinese vice minister of foreign trade and  economic relations, and Ambassador Jennifer Hillman, U.S. Trade  Representative Office chief negotiator for textile talks, signed  a memorandum of understanding on a bilateral textile trade  agreement on behalf of their respective governments.    Shi Guangsheng told reporters at the conclusion of the  negotiations that [corrected version reads: ...According to a  briefing.... (rewording)], both China and the United States made  concessions during the latest round of negotiations. The U.S.  side has agreed not to insist on reductions of between 25 and 35  percent in import quotas of Chinese textiles; it has also  withdrawn articles of arbitrary deduction regarding illegal  transshipment of textiles. The Chinese side also made  substantial concessions during the talks. China has agreed to  accept a quota reduction of no more than three times the amount  of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally  transshipped by Chinese traders. Furthermore, China also agreed  to major adjustments of some categories of the textile quota  proposed by the U.S. side.    The third Chinese-U.S. textile agreement expired on 31  December 1993. To negotiate and sign the fourth agreement,  China and the United States conducted three rounds of talks  without success from September to December last year.    Shi Guangsheng said [corrected version reads: ...It is  understood.... (rewording)] that during the fourth round of  talks, both sides took into consideration the overall interests  of bilateral trade and economic ties, and adhered to the  principle of equality, consultation and mutual understanding,  and accommodation, thereby reaching agreement on textile  arrangements -- an issue of great concern for both sides. The  signing of the new agreement will be conducive to the healthy  development of textile trade as well as other economic and trade  ties between the two countries.    Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation,  witnessed the signing ceremony and met with the U.S. delegation  led by Ambassador Hillman. She said: China attaches great  importance to developing cooperation with the United States in  economic, trade, and other areas. The United States has  capital, technology, and equipment, which are conducive to  China's modernization drive, while China has a huge market and  abundant source of labor. The two countries are economically  complementary.    Wu Yi said: Various problems, difficulties, and  contradictions may arise in the course of cooperation between  the two sides. However, it has been proved by years of practice  that the best way to address these problems is through dialogue  and consultation on an equal footing. Any attempt to exert  pressure by one side on the other will be futile and can only  lead to a trade war, which we do not want to see happen.    Wu Yi said: China and the United States share an identical  view and common interests in cracking down on illegal  transshipment of textiles. It is hoped that both sides will  further cooperate and take measures to ensure a smooth  implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the  bilateral textile agreement.    Hillman said the Sino-U.S. negotiations were productive,  cooperative, and mutually satisfactory. She added that China is  the largest exporter of textiles to the United States, and the  just concluded agreement is "extremely important" for developing  economic and trade relations between the two countries.</p>

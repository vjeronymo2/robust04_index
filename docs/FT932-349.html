			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Northern Elect lifts dividend by 15.6% NORTHERN Electric set a new high in dividend increases for the regional electricity companies yesterday by raising its pay-out by 15.6 per cent, though it balanced this by announcing a Pounds 10 rebate for its domestic customers. The rise at the Newcastle-based utility came on the back of a 13.4 per cent growth in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 98.2m to Pounds 111.4m, for the year ended March 31. Mr David Morris, chairman, said: 'Our excellent results reflect the success of our post-flotation business strategy, demonstrating consistency and performance.' He said the dividend increase to 21.45p (18.55p), with a final of 15.15p, was 'consistent with our underlying financial performance.' The increase in profits, which fed through to a rise of 16.3 per cent to 69.3p (59.6p) in earnings per share, reflected the resilience of the north-east, according to Mr Morris. The electricity distribution business, particularly to domestic and commercial customers, contributed an operating profit of Pounds 102.9m (Pounds 90.8m). The Pounds 10 rebate will bring the total price reductions given to domestic customers to close on 7 per cent this year. Sales volume in the supply business rose by 16 per cent, but operating profit remained low at Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 4.1m) because of the tight margins. But Northern aims to develop this side of the business as it opens the way to the unregulated market for large customers where much future growth will come. Northern already supplies 400 large customers outside its home market. Its other unregulated businesses traded at an overall profit during the period, though appliance retailing suffered from a difficult market and only made a small return, not including restructuring costs. Profits were also helped by further cost reductions of 3 per cent, including a 9 per cent reduction in staff numbers. Gearing was reduced to 9 per cent. COMMENT The dividend increase sent a flurry of excitement through the sector, helping Northern's shares to gain 6p to 514p. The strength of the underlying result, for example on cost reductions, also helped dispel Northern's image as one of the less well-managed RECs. If there is a worry, it is Northern's active pursuit of the high risk supply market where small mistakes can be extremely costly. But management took some trouble to say that it was strongly hedged against unwelcome price movements. Dividend cover is strong at over three times. BZW has Northern on a prospective yield of 6 per cent, assuming a dividend increase of 14.5 per cent next year, which is close to the sector average.</p>

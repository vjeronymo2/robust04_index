			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lulu Yu] </F>   [Text] Less than a tenth of Hong Kong toy makers have  obtained export licences from China despite a new regulation  which requires them to do so by July 1. Chinese officials have  indicated that companies which fail to produce the required  licence will not be allowed to export toys from China. The  majority of the 3,000-odd toy factories in Guangdong, where most  of the country's toys are made, are owned by Hong Kong  businessmen.    Dennis Woo of Hong Kong's Merchandise Testing Laboratories  (China) said when he met with a Chinese official in charge of  enforcing the regulation last week, that he was told only 200  companies had obtained licences.    Wen Hongsheng, the deputy chief of the Guangdong  Import-Export Commodity Inspection Bureau in Guangzhou, told Woo  the government was serious about enforcing the regulation, which  required toy factories to have their products and management  system screened before an Export Toy Quality Licence was issued.  The regulation was issued by the State Import and Export  Commodity Inspection Bureau in mid-1992 to take effect this July.    Wen reportedly said the government would initially be  "flexible" in enforcing the regulation. This was taken to mean  that customs officers were likely to allow companies which had  made credible efforts to obtain a licence to export their goods  even if they had not met the deadline to get a permit. Those  which have not made an application will almost certainly have  their goods held back.    Warren Kwok, the secretary-general of the Hong Kong Toys  Council, said yesterday he was aware many companies had not  applied although the council issued circulars briefing its 200  members. Kwok said the requirement was cumbersome, unnecessary,  and could hurt the toy export business. "The toys for export to  Europe and the United States are subject to very stringent  requirements in those countries. There have been very few  complaints from the importers so we don't see why the exporting  country should start imposing restrictions on their own  products."    To obtain a licence, a company needs to have its toys tested  for safety and quality. It will also have to pass a management  system audit conducted by Chinese officials</p>

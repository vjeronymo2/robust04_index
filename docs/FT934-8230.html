			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Sinn Fein leaves door ajar for further peace moves EFFORTS to get Northern Ireland peace talks under way inched forward yesterday as Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, signalled that it would not reject outright the offer of a seat at the negotiating table in return for an end to IRA violence. But Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams declined to shed further light on his claim on Monday night that Sinn Fein had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the British government. Mr Adams' claim was yesterday emphatically denied by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, as Ulster unionist MPs and Tory right-wingers warned the government to tread carefully. The offer by Mr John Major on Monday night was the first explicit move by the British prime minister to negotiate with the IRA's political wing. Sir Patrick said: 'No officials have been talking to Sinn Fein on behalf of the British government. We have always made it perfectly clear that there is going to be no negotiating with anybody who perpetrates or justifies the use of violence. That has been our policy and we stick to it.' The government has said the only contacts made with Sinn Fein have been those permitted at local and constituency level. Sinn Fein said privately last night that Mr Adams would not 'have said what he said' if he could not prove it. There were reports in the province last night that Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official, was involved in the contacts Mr Adams claimed took place. Mr Adams said yesterday: 'Mr Major has acknowledged the opportunity which exists. The onus remains on John Major to deal honestly and directly with the core issues.' He did not spell out what concessions the IRA was looking for, but added that Sinn Fein remained 'firmly committed' to what he called the 'Irish peace initiative'. The impression of intense behind-the-scenes activity to get talks started was reinforced when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, hinted that his government might have had indirect talks with Sinn Fein. Responding to questions in the Dail (parliament), he said: 'No week passes that I do not have people from both communities . . . keeping me informed as to their views of the shift in opinion from various sectors.' Northern Ireland's unionist politicians have been united in their hostility to Mr Major's speech, however. The Reverend Martin Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said his party's support for Mr Major would be called into question if there was any sign that he was failing to govern Northern Ireland 'purposefully'. But he added: 'If the IRA are prepared to put down their arms, then that may create a new situation . . . I accept that is the harsh reality of politics.' The Democratic Unionist Party, led by the Reverend Ian Paisley, was more critical. 'The strength of feeling in this province is for the defeat of IRA/Sinn Fein, not that a way should be made for them to get to the negotiating table,' he said.</p>

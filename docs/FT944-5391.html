			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (12): Make sure everything's on the record - Know your adviser Despite the widespread concern over the quality of financial advice offered by insurance companies and independent advisers, the regulators' rules on pre-sale client interviews are very vague. According to the Personal Investments Authority, the new regulator for financial services, independent advisers and company representatives 'must record the personal financial information necessary to make a recommendation' and ensure that the suitability of the product is assessed 'in the light of the information provided'. In the absence of clear ground-rules, it is important to know what details an adviser needs in order to select the right products for you. IFA Promotions, a trade organisation sponsored by 15,000 independent financial advisers and 45 insurance companies, publishes a detailed 'fact find' questionnaire which covers three important areas: What are your financial goals? For example, are you seeking advice on family-protection insurances, retirement planning, investing for income or capital growth, or tax planning? What is your attitude to risk? Do you have any professional or business experience of investments? Do you have strong views on where your money is invested? What are your current financial commitments - for example mortgages, overdrafts, other loans, credit-card balance and hire-purchase liabilities? You will also be asked detailed questions about your family and personal financial circumstances. Joanne Hindle, chief executive officer at IFAP, said: 'Some investors may regard this as an invasion of privacy, but it is important to remember that the suitability of the adviser's recommendations can only be as accurate as the information on which he based his decision.' Getting good financial advice is a two-way process, so don't let your adviser do all the talking. Ideally, you should interview several firms before appointing your adviser, and ask the following questions: How long has the firm been trading? New firms should be investigated thoroughly. What areas of specialist advice does the firm offer? Does it appear to have the resources to cover these in depth? What are the qualifications of the staff, and how senior is the adviser you will deal with? How many clients does it have? Can you get any references? What research resources does it have? Advisers must have access to a comprehensive database that can rank investment and insurance products according to performance, product flexibility and charges. If the adviser is fee-based, how much will the advice cost per hour/case? If commission-based, how much will the adviser receive? Will non-commission products (eg, National Savings) still be recommended? You should also check with the Securities and Investments Board central register that the firm is authorised and registered with the appropriate regulator. Further information: For a list of fee-based advisers in your area, phone the Money Management Register on 0117-9 769444, and give your home and work address. IFA Promotions offers a free factsheet, 'Look at how your IFA is Paid', a list of key questions to ask, and the names of three advisers near your home or work address (phone 01483 461 461).

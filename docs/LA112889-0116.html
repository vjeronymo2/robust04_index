			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> PARKING LOT YIELDS A BOUNTY OF ARRESTS  </P> <P> A single parking lot proved to be a bonanza over the holiday weekend for  Cypress police officers.  </P> <P> On Thanksgiving Day at a local motel, officers say they recovered two stolen  pickup trucks, a stolen car and stolen refrigerator. They arrested four men on  stolen property or drug charges and almost caught a robbery suspect on a stolen  motorcycle there but had to settle for catching him later.  </P> <P> Most of this action occurred in the parking lot of the Country Club Inn on  Lincoln Avenue, where officers went Friday to investigate the burglary of a  refrigerator from one of the rooms. Officer Danny Forniss found a pickup truck  that was stolen and arrested its driver, Matthew Blaine Smith, 18, of Long  Beach. Smith was held on suspicion of having stolen property and carrying a  concealed, loaded pistol.  </P> <P> Scanning the lot, Forniss then found another stolen pickup and arrested its  driver, Evan Fredrick Lightner, 25, of Long Beach, who had been staying at the  motel. He was held on suspicion of possession of stolen property and a  possession of methamphetamines.  </P> <P> All the while, officers became suspicious of a man loitering near the parking  lot. A license check of the black motorcycle he was riding showed that it, too,  was stolen. The man got away on the motorcycle, however, before officers could  stop him.  </P> <P> Later that day, Sgt. Gordon Re arrested two men after finding another stolen  car and then found the stolen refrigerator in one of their rooms. Kenneth  Berry, 22, of Garden Grove was held in connection with the stolen car and Kevin  O'Keefe, 21, of Fountain Valley was held on suspicion of having  methamphetamines and the stolen refrigerator.  </P> <P> But it wasn't over yet.  </P> <P> On Friday, a man riding a black motorcycle robbed the Taco Bell restaurant at  5619 Ball Road of several hundred dollars. About half an hour later, Officer  Jeff Kepley found the black motorcycle that had been ridden away from the  parking lot the day before. He waited an hour for its rider to return and  arrested him.  </P> <P> Officer Dave Birozy noted that the man fit the description of the Taco Bell  robber. Witnesses subsequently identified the man, Michael Scott Smith, 18, of  Long Beach, and all the stolen money was recovered, police said.  </P></p>

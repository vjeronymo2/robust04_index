			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'STALIN': SETTING STAGE FOR THIS WEEK'S SUMMIT  </P> <P> This week's Bush-Gorbachev summit will unite two of the best TV smilers in the  business.  </P> <P> President Bush has proved that he is better even than Ronald Reagan at  finessing the camera and massaging the media on a personal level, inevitably  managing to dodge tough questions and dart from danger through an inky cloud of  bright little quips. If he continues this way, Bush will go down in history as  the laughing-gas President.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, too, has demonstrated his prowess with  the Western press, again and again wearing his telegenic charm on a beaming  face that can make you melt.  </P> <P> The show -- which also brings together First Ladies Barbara Bush and Raisa  Gorbachev -- starts Wednesday in Washington after TV coverage of the Soviet  entourage's scheduled late-afternoon arrival at Andrews Air Force Base. A  chummy little group.  </P> <P> Behind the smiles, though, is history.  </P> <P> What better way to approach this summit than to dig for some roots. You find  them -- gnarled and ugly -- in the three-part PBS documentary "Stalin,"  premiering at 9 tonight on Channels 28 and 15 (and at 10 p.m. on Channel 24).  </P> <P> Scholars will have to judge whether fresh insights are contained in these  fascinating one-hour programs from Britain's Thames Television. Probably not.  Nevertheless, they comprise a simply terrific TV survey, essential for knowing  the underpinnings of today's Soviet Union and the sources of the economic ruin  that summoned Gorbachev to center stage.  </P> <P> Through remarkable old footage and chats with Stalin's daughter and other  relatives and associates of past Soviet leaders, executive producer Phillip  Whitehead and his co-filmmakers Jonathan Lewis and Tony Cash weave a memorable  narrative that vividly shows how some epic figures, through luck and sheer  force of personality, become the living exclamation points of their time.  </P> <P> For better or -- in the case of the beastly Stalin -- for worse.  </P> <P> The opening hour relives the swift rise of Stalin and other revolutionaries  from the rubble of the fallen Czarist monarchy. We watch him ruthlessly  undermine his political rivals by manipulating the political machine after  Lenin's death in 1924. As a politician, his brilliance was unquestionable, but  it was brilliance in the cause of evil.  </P> <P> The concluding hour is essentially the post-World War II Stalin. On the one  hand, he is the leader of a nation that suffered horribly while resisting the  Nazi onslaught with almost inhuman courage. On the other, he is still the same  sociopath, one whose murderous ways will be aborted only through his own death  in 1953.  </P> <P> It is next Monday's middle hour that is most seductive. You're seeing a  disaster, and you're instinctively attracted to it as you would be to a  building collapsing in flames. Here in full force is Stalin's revolution of  terror. We see forced collectivization, the destruction of the peasant class  accompanied by lethal famine, the perpetuation of a system that stifles  innovation and decays from within.  </P> <P> Suddenly it's 1936. Narrator: "The truth was, the system wasn't working."  </P> <P> Nor, in a rational sense, was its champion. One of his former comrades recalls  seeing in Stalin "the angry, inhuman eyes of a predator."  </P> <P> Given Stalin's grisly record, it was no wonder that after World War II Nazi war  criminals would scoff at having Soviets sit in judgment of them at the  Nuremberg trials. The Soviet Union had its own holocaust under Stalin, for no  one there, young or old, high or low, was beyond the grip of his terror.  </P> <P> If body counts are the measure of evil, then clearly the pathological Stalin  out-Hitlered Hitler: He turned the forests into killing fields, instigated mass  purges whose victims were often chosen arbitrarily. He had ordinary citizens  locked away in prisons and camps, where they languished for lifetimes without  being told their alleged crimes.  </P> <P> They were tortured and left to grow old and wither before their time. One of  Stalin's victims recalls being in a room with other relatively young prisoners  where there was also a mirror. She looked into the mirror, but could not find  herself. "All of a sudden I saw my mother, her eyes and her gray hair, and I  realized it was me."  </P> <P> The terrible irony of this is that amid the chaos and uncertainty of  Gorbachevism there are still some Soviets who yearn for a return to Stalinism.  You see them interviewed from time to time on television, and they get their  say in this documentary. What does it all mean?  </P> <P> Observes Soviet writer Lev Kopelev: "Stalinism is still alive in all kinds of  ways, in our psychology, in our habits and, until such time as Stalinism is  annihilated . . . by rational re-education of the people . . . there is no  guarantee of the existence of the human race."  </P> <P> The frown preceding the smiles.  </P></p>

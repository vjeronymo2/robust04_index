			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / ICL stays in EC research project ICL, the UK-based computer group, 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu of Japan, is to work with Bull of France and Siemens-Nixdorf Informations Systems of Germany on the next stage of an European Community-funded research and development project called Sesame. In the aftermath of its acquisition in 1990 ICL was excluded by its European partners from three other semiconductor research projects under the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative programme. The EC said yesterday ICL would participate in the three-year second stage of project Sesame (Secure European System for Applications in a Multivendor Environment). The three partners completed the first stage of Sesame last year.</p>

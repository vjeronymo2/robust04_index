In legislators' opinion, this is "an illegal order  inflicting  material damage on Ukraine".    The difficult economic situation in the CIS countries has  brought about a situation when some enterprises and  organisations went bankrupt and did not pay for delivered goods  or paid with great delays.    Former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma forbid to ship goods  to former Soviet republics without preliminary payment or  without guarantees by a foreign bank which could vouch for  payments in time.    But, six months later, Zvyahilskyy signed a decision  permitting the Kiev Elektronmash, Kharkov bicycle factories and  other leading engineering enterprises to deliver goods to the  CIS countries without the confirmation of preliminary payments.</p>

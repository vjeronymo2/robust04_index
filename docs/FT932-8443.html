			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank of England's executive directors receive no pay increase ALL SIX of the Bank of England's executive directors received no pay increase this year as part of an effort by the Bank to take a lead in combating price and wage pressures, Peter Marsh writes. The six include Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, and Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor who takes over the top job on July 1. The others are Mr Tony Coleby, Professor Mervyn King, Mr Brian Quinn and Mr Andrew Crockett. In the three years until January last year the directors' salaries increased relatively fast to take into account pay increases in the private sector. Under the new initiative their pay for the year ending next February is the same as their 1992-93 salaries. Earlier this week the Bank announced that Mr George had agreed a five-year wage freeze from the start of his new job, pegging his pay at about Pounds 210,000. The new salary takes into account his move to the top job, and is the same as that paid to Mr Leigh-Pemberton last year.</p>

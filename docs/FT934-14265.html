The 69,000 sq ft superstore is to be built by the company's north-west regional office. The site at Wilderspool Causeway, previously occupied by Greenhall Whitley Brewery, is of historic interest, and archaeological concerns will have to be considered, particularly when excavating foundations and external pavings.

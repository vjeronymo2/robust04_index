			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Psion's Pounds 3m meets forecasts Psion, manufacturer of hand-held computers and data communications products, saw pre-tax profits and sales match market expectations in 1993 helped by strong demand for the latest version of its palmtop computer and manufacturing efficiencies. Profits before tax more than doubled to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 1.42m) on turnover up 17 per cent to Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 35.1m). Earnings per share rose from 4.33p to 9.14p and a final dividend of 1.8p (1.5p) is recommended, making a total for the year of 2.8p (2.5p). Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said he was opposed to paying larger dividends when the company was in a growth phase and would be absorbing cash. He said there was no need for the company to raise fresh money in the immediate future but it had every intention of growing with its markets and would eventually need extra funding, 'but only on the back of growth and success'. The company's four distinct product lines - the Series 3 palmtop computers, HC industrial hand-held computers, data communications devices and the original Organiser electronic notebook were all profitable. Psion is the world's leading supplier of palmtop computers by volume - it is now producing some 20,000 a month. Mr Potter said the company had been surprised by demand for the new Series 3a: 'Notwithstanding record production volumes, demand could not be fulfilled and the supply of product was on allocation . . . it was only during the first quarter of 1994 that higher volumes of component supplies have allowed an increase in output.' Net operating cash flow was Pounds 5.73m compared with Pounds 3.2m in 1992 and working capital was reduced. The group has surplus cash and negligible net gear-ing. COMMENT Psion has had some harsh lessons about markets and management over the past three years but has recovered well. It now has a portfolio of products each of which is a leader in a growth area. Its datacommunications products, including credit card sized modems, look particularly exciting. More than 50 per cent of the group's hardware sales are now made outside the UK. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 5m look likely this year giving earnings of 15.2p on an undemanding prospective p/e of 14.9. It is a market sector rich in quicksands but Psion seems to have found firm footholds at last.</p>

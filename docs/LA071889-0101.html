			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW A PAPER'S EXPLICIT RAPE POLICY AFFECTS A TOWN  </P> <P> As a rookie reporter in the 1950s, Al Ford learned it was his job to name  everyone who stood up to testify at a criminal trial. That included rape  victims.  </P> <P> Then, in the late '60s, feminists argued that rape is a particularly personal  crime that ought to be treated with special sensitivity by the press. Virtually  all newspapers reversed their former policy and began to withhold the names of  women who had been raped.  </P> <P> But the gusts of social change seemed to bypass Ford, who still identifies  sexual assault victims.  </P> <P> "I've been yelled at, threatened, accused of having no compassion," said Ford,  a short, dapper grandfather of seven whose unconventional reporting policy sets  the standard at the Shelton-Mason County Journal (circulation, 8,782). The  Journal is one of not more than 10 newspapers in the country, and perhaps the  only one in the West, which make a point of naming rape victims.  </P> <P> More proponents of the policy are coming forth in the wake of a June 21 Supreme  Court ruling concerning a Florida newspaper that inadvertently revealed a rape  victim's name. The court held that the small, weekly paper in Jacksonville  could not be punished for publishing the victim's name because the information  was lawfully obtained. While the court did not declare unconstitutional Florida  and South Carolina statutes prohibiting publication of rape victims' names, the  ruling did say that, for now, it is up to journalists to decide the  to-name-or-not-to-name question.  </P> <P> An article in the June issue of FineLine, a newsletter on journalism ethics,  was weighted in favor of naming victims. Six of eight news executives  interviewed came down firmly on the side of identifying victims.  </P> <P> And in a recent New York Times opinion piece, Geneva Overholser, editor of the  Des Moines Register, said, even though her newspaper does not identify sexual  assault victims, she believes in the concept of naming victims because "Rape is  an American shame. Our society needs to see that and attend to it, not hide it  or hush it up."  </P> <P> Identifying rape victims will help lift the stigma surrounding sexual assault,  proponents say. To impose anonymity on rape victims "singles out rape as  something different and distinct and more awful" than other crimes whose  victims are routinely named in the media, said Gilbert Geis, a UC Irvine  professor emeritus who has studied the reporting of rape. "And maybe it is  worse. But crimes like having your child kidnaped are pretty awful, too."  </P> <P> Those who defend rape victims' right to privacy say making the crime public  compounds the suffering of a victimized woman or a man.  </P> <P> "One of the main issues survivors have is taking back their power," said Jennie  Balise of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. "And here you  have an editor making a decision about an intimate event in a woman's life.  He's yet another outside authority figure who's going to make a decision for  her."  </P> <P> A 16-year-old high school student who was identified as a rape victim by the  Shelton paper felt that was the case.  </P> <P> "I was raped once and then again," she said at a televised town meeting. "I was  raped by the Mason County Journal."  </P> <P> Shelton, a rainy lumber industry town at the base of the Olympic Peninsula,  offers an example of what happens when a newspaper publishes the names of rape  victims.  </P> <P> A town of its size (population 7,500) normally has a rape trial only once every  few years. There were two reported in 1988, five in 1987 -- about average for a  town of its size. But when there is a trial, almost everyone knows about it  because the Shelton Journal routinely gives front-page coverage to the  proceedings.  </P> <P> Along with naming the victim, whether she or he is a child or an adult, the  paper provides an extensive, explicit synopsis of testimony. In the case of a  16-year-old high school student, the Journal printed: "She (the victim) said he  (the defendant) told her he would not hurt her if she just let him do it. She  said he grabbed the bottom of her jeans and tried to pull them off while she  tried to hold them up."  </P> <P> Because Shelton is so small, readers are likely to know both the victim and the  perpetrator, said Shannon Duffey, director of Recovery, a Shelton program that  assists victims of sexual and domestic abuse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Triggers Debate  </P> <P> If the rapist doesn't fit the community's perception of a criminal, some people  refuse to believe the victim, Duffey said. Often there's a public debate about  whether the victim was raped.  </P> <P> And the victims suffer even more personal traumas.  </P> <P> Former friends shun them. Anonymous callers harass them at night. Strangers  suddenly ask them on dates.  </P> <P> "People think the victims are now more sexual," Duffey said. "People come on to  them more, treat them more as someone who wanted it versus someone who was  assaulted."  </P> <P> One victim said she was so upset by the thought of her neighbors reading about  the rape in the newspaper that she had to leave her own trial when the paper  came out. After publication, the woman said her 8-year-old daughter's friends  told her about the rape at school.  </P> <P> The teen-ager mentioned earlier left school and got a tutor rather than face a  classroom full of peers who knew about the assault. She once told a television  reporter: "I didn't want to see anybody, talk to anybody. . . . I felt like  everybody was out there looking at me, watching me." (This victim no longer  wants to talk about her experience. Some of the other victims named in the  newspaper in recent years also wish to remain anonymous.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Leave Town  </P> <P> Rather than endure the stares and suspicion of their neighbors, many victims  named in the Shelton paper move out of town. "It gets very difficult to live in  this community" after your name has been published, said Pride Mutoli, a board  member of the Mason County Council on Child Abuse and Neglect.  </P> <P> Families of rape victims complain that they, too, suffer. "I just didn't like  everyone talking about it -- it put me in a hard spot," the brother of one rape  victim said. "Once in awhile, I heard people say, 'This guy (the accused) is a  nice guy; he couldn't have done anything like that. The girl is just upset.' "  </P> <P> The situation contributes to a feeling that nothing is confidential in Shelton,  Mutoli said: "There's a climate of distrust in town. Everyone worries about who  they talk to. There's a great deal of ill feeling and a lot of it is directed  at the family who runs the newspaper."  </P> <P> In the past, local residents have picketed, petitioned and begged that the  paper reconsider the policy.  </P> <P> Henry Gay, 62, is the publisher of the Shelton-Mason Co. Journal. His son  Charles Gay -- townspeople call him Charlie -- is the managing editor. The  family bought the 103-year-old newspaper in 1965. Reporter Al Ford was already  working there at the time. The three men found their views on reporting sex  crimes were compatible. It was unfair, they thought, to report one party of a  trial and not the other so they agreed to name any victim who testified as a  witness in Superior Court.  </P> <P> The publisher said this policy is the only way to ensure that the accused is  granted the "presumption of innocence."  </P> <P> "Not one of our critics seems concerned about the defendant in a rape case,"  the elder Gay wrote in an editorial. "They assume he is guilty."  </P> <P> A few committee members do support the policy. Rita McArthur, a retired Shelton  schoolteacher, said she believes the policy will help end the stigma of rape.  "For so long, rape victims have been made to feel as if they were the guilty  party. I think this is a pioneering project in many ways," she said of the  practice of naming rape victims. "It may bring a slow change but I think the  change will come."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Rapes Reported  </P> <P> But Henry Gay's policy has not resulted in a more enlightened response to rape  in the community, but in fewer rapes reported and more rapists on the loose,  say those who work with victims in Shelton.  </P> <P> "There are a number of people out there who have been raped and whose children  have been abused who will not report it because of the newspaper," said Mutoli  of the child abuse council.  </P> <P> For instance, when a sexual assault victim calls for help at any of the  agencies in town, "one of their biggest concerns is that it's going to be in  the paper," Duffey said. 'I have to tell them, 'Yes, it probably will be.' "  </P> <P> Shelton Police Lt. Al Johnson agreed the threat of public exposure can affect a  victim's willingness to report a crime. "Any time someone has to go public with  that type of offense they have to do a lot of soul searching and sometimes they  choose not to report."  </P> <P> Mutoli added: 'We feel it actually encourages bad guys to live here. They feel  safe because none of the victims want to hassle with the newspaper."  </P> <P> But Henry Gay said it's unfair to single out his paper's policy as the reason  women in Shelton are reluctant to report rapes. They don't report them in  communities where newspapers protect the identity of rape victims, he said.  </P> <P> "We feel very bad when a rape victim says she has been raped a second time by  the newspaper," said his son Charlie Gay in an editorial, "but we feel she is a  victim of society's stigma, not our trial coverage."  </P> <P> In fact, his father believes that they should print the names to encourage  society to stop stigmatizing the crime of rape. "I think I feel as deeply for  those victims as anyone," Henry Gay said. "But I'm not changing our policy  because I think in the long run it would cause more pain for all of the (future  victims)."  </P></p>

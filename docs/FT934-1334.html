			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Fresh row in councils project Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, is expected to provoke further conflict with the Department of the Environment when final proposals for restructuring councils in Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset are announced today. Sir John is expected to reverse a provisional plan announced earlier this year to split Gloucestershire into all-purpose unitary authorities, in favour of a plan to keep the status quo of two-tier district and county councils. Since his first proposals were announced, however, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has announced new guidance for the commission which makes clear that the government does not expect the status quo to be maintained. The department prefers unitary authorities. Polls conducted for the commission by MORI show 62 per cent of residents in Somerset and South Avon favour some form of unitary councils in principle, while 59 per cent are in favour in Gloucestershire and North Avon. In Gloucestershire, however, the status quo option is favoured by 42 per cent, while the single most popular unitary option, which would split the county into five authorities, is favoured by 16 per cent. The commission is required to heed local preferences.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- In its national convention, the Liberal  Party [PL] on 10 April nominated Deputy Flavio Rocha (Rio Grande  do Norte State) as its presidential candidate. Rocha has thus  become the first candidate to be officially nominated by his  party to seek President Franco's office. Rocha, who is unknown  to the public, will use the eight-minute television time  allotted daily to his party to exclusively defend his proposal  for a single tax.    Rocha's immediate objective is to preserve an alliance with  little-known groups that will guarantee him a reasonable share  of TV time. Rocha is hoping to get a significant number of  votes during the first round so that in the run-off he can exact  a commitment for his single tax proposal from one of the two  candidates.    Drawing on his family fortune built on profits from the  Riachuelo chain of stores, Rocha already has visited nearly 100  Brazilian cities on board his private jet. In just the past 45  days, the PL candidate's flying time stood at more than 200  hours and he plans to visit a minimum of 500 cities.    At 36, Rocha is serving his second term as a federal deputy  and will be the youngest presidential candidate in Brazilian  history. In the February PL primaries, he defeated retired  Brigadier Ivan Frota, who obtained only 19 percent of the votes.</p>

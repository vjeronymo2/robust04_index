			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BOOTLEG' HOUSING STORY DRAWS FIRE, CLAIMS OF 'BIAS'  </P> <P> I am disappointed in The Times' article, "County to Rule on 'Bootleg' Housing  Gripe" (Nov. 8). Sympathy seems to be with the law abusers rather than with the  victims of the abuse.  </P> <P> This is evidenced by the tone of the article, as well as by the two  photographs.  </P> <P> The so-called "gripe" against Altadena bootleggers Guillermo Villareal and his  wife, Margaret, is the legitimate complaint of citizens who genuinely care  about their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Citizens who are willing to invest themselves, their time, money, and energy --  not to mention their reputations -- to battle infractions of legal codes and  regulations should be affirmed, not labeled pests.  </P> <P> The so-called "gripe" is not an issue of the "haves" versus the "have nots."  Rather, it is the complaint of hard-working citizens who live in a community  where bootlegging practices are depriving them of their rights and diminishing  the quality of their lives.  </P> <P> Finally, why doesn't The Times give equal photographic coverage to the real  victims of bootlegging and lax county zoning enforcement? (They have babies,  too.)  </P> <P> NANCY RITNIMIT  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

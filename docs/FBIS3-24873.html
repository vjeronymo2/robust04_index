Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and other government  officials went to Luanda's international 4 February Airport to  bid farewell to the Mozambican head of state, who was  accompanied by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.  President Joaquim Chissano, who had arrived in Luanda on 1  February after visits to Switzerland and Portugal, held talks  with a team led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and met  with the Angolan Government's economic team led by Prime  Minister Marcolino Moco. Before leaving Luanda, the Mozambican  head of state held a news conference at the airport and said he  was a witness to the great openness shown by President Jose  Eduardo dos Santos and the Angolan Government with a view to  achieving peace and solidifying democracy.    [Chissano] "We have been very [words indistinct] the stance  adopted by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos concerning the  search for solutions to the extremely complex Angolan issue. We  were very surprised by the degree of openness shown by the  Angolan Government and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,  particularly if you take into account the destruction that has  ravaged Angola, the killing of people, and the current state of  the economy because of the war. It is enough to say that many  Angolan cities have lost all their industrial assets and that  the areas that are perhaps most central to this country's  development have been occupied, destroyed, and their production  has been completely blocked. Any attempt to try and reverse  this situation will indeed require much courage. We have seen  that courage in the Angolan Government. It is full of  initiative and imagination, to the extent that we feel our  problems are minor by comparison and we feel quite encouraged to  look for solutions to our problems."    President Joaquim Chissano described as groundless rumors  going around that Mozambique's multiparty elections might be  postponed.    [Chissano] "More often than not such rumors are created by  people who make their own assessments and predictions. They  speculate. However, neither the Mozambican Government nor our  country's political parties have put forward any such  suggestions yet. We believe everything is going well and we  believe it will be possible to hold elections by October of this  year, as scheduled.    [Unidentified correspondent] "However, President Chissano,  the government appears to have had some problems concerning the  troop confinement process.    [Chissano] "Those who want to exaggerate problems and make  the whole process unworkable will probably say so. What I know  is that there are times when the implementation of the accord  goes faster and there are others when it goes slower. One  cannot adjudge the whole process because of what happened over  one or two days. The troop confinement process can and will be  implemented in good time. The delay you were talking about has  to do with the government forces. I know that we can confine  all troops before the scheduled deadline and that is what we are  going to do."    The Mozambican head of state said that the Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party's victory in the October  elections is already a certainty.    [Chissano] "There is no argument that Frelimo will win. What  appears to be a greater source of debate at this stage is how  the other parties will fare in the elections, how may seats they  will get in the Assembly and whether they come second, third,  fourth, and so on. Frelimo's victory seems to me to be a  certainty, even to the opposition. Nonetheless, I must tell you  that my party's belief is that we must work hard. If we fail to  do so, things could change over the next few months and, as you  know, several factors play a hand in elections but, were  elections to be held today, tomorrow, or a month from now,  Frelimo's victory would be....[pauses] Well, we would be faced  with a new problem: we would not know how to accommodate the  other parties."</p>

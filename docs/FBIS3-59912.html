			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Vinogradov report: "Moscow Agrees To Lease Baykonur </F> From Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin's delegation has flown to  Almaty, where it is to hold talks on the whole range of economic  relations with Kazakhstan. One of the main issues will be the  fate of Baykonur.    Under the May 1992 agreement signed by Boris Yeltsin and  Nursultan Nazarbayev, the cosmodrome is a troop formation of the  Russian military space forces. While it is in joint use, 94  percent of the cost of maintaining it is borne by Russia, which  effectively remains its master. All launches of "Proton"  rockets and commercial launches are carried out from Baykonur,  as at present they cannot be carried out from Russia's  "Plesetsk" cosmodrome. To construct a new facility capable of  replacing Baykonur would take Russia at least seven years, plus  enormous sums that the Moscow treasury currently does not have.    Kazakhstan is unable either to service or to operate  Baykonur, but nevertheless it would like to gain the status of a  space power and is presenting new conditions to Russia. It  established its own aerospace agency and put forward the idea of  setting up on the basis of Baykonur an international company  with the involvement of Ukraine and other countries. Moscow  turned this down and stated that it is prepared to lease  Baykonur from Kazakhstan.    Before leaving for Almaty, Viktor Chernomyrdin received a  letter from his Kazakhstan counterpart, Sergey Tereshchenko,  saying that Kazakhstan agrees in principle to this option, but  is asking for an excessive sum from Russia -- several billion  dollars a year for the right to use Baykonur. We were told at  the Russian Space Agency that in this instance Kazakhstan's  appetites exceed not only Russia's capabilities but all headings  of the Baykonur budget. And this is despite the fact that the  space research carried out at Baykonur has never yielded revenue.    The problem of Baykonur is closely linked with the problem  of  the status of the Russian Army on Kazakhstan's territory. At  present the Russian servicemen at the cosmodrome, and also at  other facilities, incidentally, have the status of foreigners.  There is no treaty on military cooperation between Moscow and  Almaty. It is quite possible that the leasing of Baykonur would  set a precedent whereby all other Russian military facilities in  nearby foreign countries would be regarded as bases for which  payment should be made.    At present Kazakhstan merely keeps an eye on order at  Baykonur and sees to it that nothing goes missing from this  large facility. It has introduced customs controls, posted  military guards, expropriated a number of Russian Army buildings  and offices, and carried out a careful inventory of all property.</p>

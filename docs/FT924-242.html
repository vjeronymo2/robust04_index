			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes lower in thin trading JAPANESE stocks succumbed to Monday blues and closed just off the day's lows in very thin trading, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 368.42 or 2.10 per cent lower at 17,188.62, after a high of 17,538.88 and a low of 17,162.74. Decliners led gainers by 812 to 131, with 154 unchanged. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 91.81 to 17,557.04, and decliners led advancers by 586 to 337 with 213 unchanged. On Thursday, the index lost 41.82 to 17,648.85. Yesterday, the broader first section Topix index was down 19.98 or 1.5 per cent to 1,321.84 while the second section index fell 5.45 to 1,727.78. About 100m shares were traded, which brokers said was the lowest daily volume since May 31, 1982, after 180m on Friday and 200m on Thursday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that total traded turnover in 1992 up to December 25 was about a quarter of that recorded in 1991, and for the whole of 1992 looks set to be the lowest in 17 years. Selling by investment trusts and dealers squeezed prices, while most investors shunned the market in the absence of fresh incentives and ahead of the New Year holiday. Yesterday was the first trading day for January delivery and some participants had hoped for a year-end technical rebound. NTT fell Y5,000 to Y575,000 on continued profit-taking after its recent sharp gains as an asset re-evaluation stock and a top candidate for a new weighted average. Semi-conductor related issues were also down on profit-taking after last week's jump. Canon fell Y10 to Y1,380, Kokusai Electric Y20 to Y1,680 and Nikon Y20 to Y705. Roundup TRADING was mostly quiet in the region ahead of the New Year holidays. TAIWAN plunged 3.7 per cent to a 23-month low on fears of political instability after the December 19 parliamentary elections. The weighted index closed 128.33 down at 3,327.67, the lowest close since January 16, 1991 during the Gulf crisis, in turnover of TDollars 10bn. Last Thursday, the weighted index ended 7.85 higher at 3,456.00 in low turnover of TDollars 8.1bn. HONG KONG rose on year-end window-dressing but trading was lacklustre as many players remained on holiday. The Hang Seng index finished at 5,531.65, up 89.64, in turnover of HKDollars 2.27bn. On Thursday, overseas buying lifted the Hang Seng by 124.02 or 2.3 per cent to 5,442.01 in half-day turnover of HKDollars 1.47bn. Yesterday, expectations of a lift on the mortgage ceiling boosted the property sector. Cheung Kong rose 70 cents to HKDollars 19.40, Sun Hung Kai Properties was up 60 cents to HKDollars 28.30 and Henderson Land jumped 90 cents to HKDollars 14.90. SEOUL fell on the last trading day of 1992 as afternoon profit-taking eroded early gains. The composite index fell 6.97 to 680.96 after adding 4.93 to 675.36 last Thursday. MANILA edged higher on firm investor sentiment after Christmas passed without violations of a ceasefire agreement between the government and army rebels. The composite index closed 6.44 higher at 1,241.01 after a rise of 10.90 to 1,234.57 on Christmas Eve. Also on Christmas Eve, AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index jumped 11.4 to 1,536.2 in turnover of ADollars 305.6m. Western Mining went against the trend with a fall of 6 cents to ADollars 4.36 after it said that first-half profits were likely to be 'substantially lower' than the same period a year ago if low nickel prices persisted. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE 40 index added 7.1 to 1,542.25.</p>

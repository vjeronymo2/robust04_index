			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: A Mongolian fairy story - Cinema URGA (PG) Curzon Mayfair FOR THE BOYS (15) Odeon West End DEATH IN BRUNSWICK (15) Metro, Cannons Tottenham Ct Rd and Chelsea THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE (18) Cannons West End DOUBLE IMPACT (18) Plaza, Odeon Marble Arch What do nine men and women living in luxury on an Italian island know about life in inner Mongolia? Yet last year's Venice Film Festival jury, after several hours of cosseted deliberation at the Lido's Excelsior Hotel, gave the Golden Lion for best film to Urga, a French-Soviet movie about a Russian road-builder's friendship with a Mongolian peasant. Cinema - this is a long-established Andrews Theory - can make us believe anything. Consider this praised film by Nikita Mikhalkov of Oblomov and Dark Eyes. How do we know that the picturesque story of Sergei and Gombo, who meet when Sergei's truck drives into a lake and he finds help and hospitality with the tent-dwelling Gombo and his family, intersects with ethnographic truth at any point? We are all the more gullible because the film is so mischievously enthralling. The horror of the outsider at the Easterners' methods of food preparation. (These include using a knife to give a live sheep a slow puncture while he and we watch.) The peasant daughter's improbable virtuosity with an accordion. The city-reared wife's demand that the tent be stocked with condoms and a TV. The drunken uncle Bagartou. And Gombo's own expertise with the titular 'urga', a hunting device comprising a long pole with an adjustable noose. How do we know that the word 'urga' and its definition have not stolen in from a Call My Bluff programme? (No doubt the use and practice of an urga is called urganomics.) In short, are the details of this film true or false and which of us will journey to Mongolia to find out? I am not being merely frivolous. Ever since cinema opened up the world to us as no art form has done before, we have been caught on the hook of the proverb 'seeing is believing.' Our senses cannot lie; we see remote civilisations recorded by the camera; ergo, we must believe it is all true. Yet deep down the appeal of Urga lies not in our certainty of its authenticity but in our uncertainty. How much is it having us on? After the National Geographical prelude on the plains, Sergei and Gombo travel to town where a series of shaggy-dog episodes occupy the movie's second half. Gombo shops, has a ride at a funfair and visits a doleful priest at a shrine. ('You have problems?' says the priest; 'so do I'). Sergei gets drunk, sings sentimental Russian songs in a dance-hall and is arrested. A Chopin-playing friend in a dinner jacket comes to bail him out. Finally we are back on the plains, where the resting Gombo's precious TV sits on a grassy slope gazing out at a grassy infinity. This is not ethnography, it is surrealism with scenery. Urga's great virtue, amid the waving seas of green and the bucolic or bustling horizons, is its virtual silence. No pat wisdoms are dispensed by Mikhalkov about inter-ethnic accord; no laboured exposition is offered about contrary lifestyles. Instead the film has a puffball tragicomic fragility. The fairy-tale encounter, and its pollen-blown continuation in the town, outlines a world where loving brotherhood lies in tolerant mutual incomprehension. Enough that we as human beings share the basic needs: food, sex, survival. The rest is a vast human comedy, infinitely varied and infinitely elusive according to our different backgrounds. ***** Watching For The Boys is like being dragged gagged and silent through a hundred Hollywood story conferences. This 2 1/2 -hour vaudeville with tears stars Bette Midler and James Caan as two troupers who keep going off to entertain the troops. Second World War, Korea, Vietnam: we suffer with them through it all. And yet we still have enough energy at the end of the film to walk out of the cinema, hail a cab and collapse whimpering onto its back seat. Directed by Mark Rydell of The Rose, this new Midler vehicle wears the sign 'customised by committee'. Three screenwriters co-penned it, five producers co-produced it and the strain of trying to fit so many episodes and emotions inside one piece of bodywork tells from the start. We first meet our heroine in old age. At least we assume that is her condition. Wearing heavily wattled make-up and no eyebrows, Midler resembles a Munchkin who has been in a road accident. Happily we soon flashback to the glory years, where we try to work out why James Caan is the toast of the American variety scene when he neither sings well nor tells good jokes. Midler, joining him as a callow youngster, gooses up the act, but still not enough to stop us puzzling over phrases like 'the new Burns and Allen' or 'bigger than Hope and Crosby.' But then this film started falling from a great height without a parachute early on. What begins as breezy inanity develops into free-fall idiocy. When the couple visit Vietnam to see Midler's darling son, what would you expect but that the Vietcong attack in mid-cabaret and Junior is soon a shrapnel-perforated statistic on the muddy ground? Cue Pieta position and Oscar-pleading grief from Midler. Is a film like this cynical or innocent? Mistaken question. In Hollywood the two conditions are synonymous. While making a play for the box-office by packing in every saleable theme and feeling, stars and studios can still believe they are offering genuine dramatic goods. The enthusiasm has to be respected. One admires Caan and Midler's commitment even while one wishes they could be committed. And whenever it is allowed to put down its handkerchief, For The Boys can be quite funny. No movie is dismissable that contains the following chat-up exchange. Man in bar: 'What would I have to give you for a little kiss?' Girl: 'Chloroform.' ***** The Australian film Death In Brunswick is a wonderful flyblown black comedy. Everything about fortyish Carl (Sam Neill) spells loser: from his house in suburban Melbourne with its yellow water and exploding gas-heater to his new job as a short order cook in a sleazy nightclub. Then there is mother, a sort of genteel live-in stick insect. She chain-smokes, chain-nags and chain-listens to Mahler on her son's gramophone. And she is appalled when Carl arrives home one night covered in filth after burying the immigrant kitchen hand he has accidentally killed with a fork . . . This fastidiously helpless, very funny film is a first feature from John Ruane. Ruane seized an unpublished novel by Boyd Oxlade and co-adapted it with the author, drafting in Sam Neill to give a performance we never thought him capable of. Playing an over-the-hill leather boy, Neill has quiet desperation written all through him, using the wrinkles in his brow as letters. His last bid for youth is a fling with the nightclub's 19-year-old Greek immigrant bar-girl (Zoe Carides). His latest bid for self-destruction is the fracas with the kitchen hand, which yields the film's funniest scene. Carl and his gravedigger chum Dave must dispose of the cadaver, making room for it in a grave where they must do things to the mouldering corpse already resident that Carl would not do even to - well, to his own mother. (He has sleeping pills saved up for her.) This comedy of frayed nerves and strained tethers reaches the end of its own rope earlier than it should. There is a time limit on the laughs you can extract from a life going threadbare. But for at least an hour its rueful rhythms are a joy and for actor Sam Neill life has clearly begun at forty. ***** Life has a hard time beginning at all in The Pleasure Principle and Double Impact. The first is an Alfie-style sex comedy written and directed by first-time film-maker David Cohen and funded by his local bank. Peter Firth dashes about between the sheets and Haydn Gwynne, Lynsey Baxter and Lysette Anthony are the girls trying to keep up his interest. Routine plot, flattered by good performances. Double Impact is two hours of Hong Kong chop socky featuring martial arts star Jean-Claude Van Damme. It should never have escaped from the video market, although it creates some picturesque mayhem now that it has. Sheldon Lettich directs.</p>

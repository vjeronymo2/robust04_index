			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santiago seeks regional finance role - Chile has its advantages but obstacles remain Chile boasts Latin America's most advanced capital market. The country's high savings rate, the development of its private pension funds and more than a decade of uninterrupted economic growth have combined to bring this about. Nowhere else in Latin America can companies raise 10- or even 20-year finance. The country's leading financial institutions and its two stock exchanges want to use this head start over their neighbours to develop a financial centre servicing the rest of South America. To promote the idea, they formed a capital markets institute six months ago. 'We have been advocating the idea of transforming Santiago into a financial centre,' said Mr Hernan Somerville, the head of Chile's banking association. But for the likes of Mr Somerville, the government has been moving too slowly on the issue and at least two important obstacles are blocking the idea. The first is the rule which demands that foreign investments remain in the country for at least a year, inhibiting financial market trading. The second is the country's capital gains tax. Government officials say lifting the one-year rule would not be difficult. The finance minister, Mr Eduardo Aninat, said this month in London that 'at an opportune moment, we could consider amending it by law . . . but that doesn't mean in the short term'. For now, the government is concerned not to encourage inflows of volatile hot money which make managing money supply difficult and raise the exchange rate to uncompetitive levels. Mr Aninat said, however, that 'the capital gains tax is more complex', although the issue was under study. The government is worried that relaxing the tax might lead to a redefinition of a lot of income as capital gains in order to evade tax. Mr Somerville says banks are being hindered from developing a regional role because they cannot lend money outside the country, except for trade. 'We should also be able to lend money outside Chile to Chilean companies,' many of which are expanding into other countries in the region, he says. From the government's point of view, developing the financial services sector would - like increasing manufacturing capacity - be one way of developing an economy which, in spite of its success, is still over-dependent on production of raw materials. Still, while some financial experts believe Santiago has advantages in certain areas, for example in custodial services, there is widespread scepticism that turning the city into financial centre is a serious project. Chile may have the expertise, and a deregulated telephone system that allows for relatively cheap communication, but it is geographically remote and the economy small. Sceptics wonder whether there is a critical mass of local business to encourage the establishment of a regional financial centre. Mr Somerville argues: 'Look at Luxembourg', adding that 'we offer political stability, economic stability, a broad consensus over policy - and we have a reputation for integrity.' Mr Pablo Yrarrazavil , chairman of the Santiago Stock Exchange, points out that for an 'emerging market' the country already has a highly-developed financial system. With a gross domestic product of about Dollars 46bn, Chile's stock market capitalisation is Dollars 60bn, banking assets total Dollars 35bn, the assets of pension funds are approaching Dollars 20bn and insurance company assets Dollars 5bn. Nonetheless, Mr Yrarrazavil acknowledges that he has a problem - currently most Chilean companies prefer to raise share capital in New York and not on his exchange. Chilean financial business is migrating to the US, where investors are willing to pay more than in the Chilean market, partly because of the one-year rule. But Chilean financiers are not only worried about New York. They are also concerned not so much about the development of finance in Sao Paulo if the Brazilian anti-inflation plan succeeds, but that Argentina is making big advances in financial sophistication. Promoting Santiago as a financial centre has, for some of its proponents, a defensive motive and a desire to avoid a drain of Chilean talent and Chilean financial companies to Argentina. 'Chileans love Buenos Aires. Many would like to live there, and if it developed as a financial centre, they would move,' said one financier.</p>

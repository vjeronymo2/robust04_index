			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Pressure on US and EU grows for tariff cuts deal Pressure mounted yesterday on the US and the European Union to agree a detailed package of tariff cuts in manufactured goods and farm products next week, as representatives of the 116 nations engaged in the Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalisation met in Geneva. A meeting of all trade negotiators, held just 19 days ahead of the December 15 deadline for completing the seven-year negotiations, was repeatedly told that a top-level EU-US meeting in Brussels next Wednesday 'must reach a substantive result'. The Brussels meeting follows two days of talks in Washington this week between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart. These were described as constructive, but produced no specific agreement. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, complained yesterday: 'Constructive meetings are no substitute for concrete results.' He wants a clear outcome from the US and the EU by Wednesday so Gatt can complete by the end of the week a market access package embracing all 116 countries. 'We cannot afford further delay without jeopardising the round,' he said. At the Geneva meeting, successive ambassadors complained of the difficulties being created by the US-EU delay, and by a handful of last-minute changes called for by the US in sensitive areas like anti-dumping policy, financial services, and internationally-even-handed tax treatment. 'The world is waiting for a market access package from the US and the EU in Brussels next week,' said Mr Don Kenyon, Australia's Gatt ambassador. Mr Tran van Thinh, his EU counterpart, acknowledged the need for the US and EU to settle differences. He said that in spite of the difficulties faced by the community in terms of decision making, it was making every effort to reach a market access agreement by next week: 'The US and the EU do indeed shoulder a heavy responsibility for conclusion of the Uruguay Round.' Delegates were digesting a list of proposed US changes to a text disciplining the use of anti-dumping laws, with most signalling strong opposition to the changes. Mr John Schmidt, the chief US Gatt negotiator, insisted that the US 'had approached this issue in a spirit of restraint' but noted that it was a matter of enormous importance in the US. Mr Sutherland called for all negotiations to be effectively completed by December 13, allowing translators to prepare texts of a prospective Uruguay Round agreement for approval at a meeting of all negotiators on December 15.</p>

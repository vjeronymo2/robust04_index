			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Setback to Rogers' media group bid Rogers Communications' CDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 2.1bn) bid for Maclean Hunter, the Canadian publishing and cable-TV group, is mired in uncertainty after several surprise developments. These events, including the 7 per cent cut in US cable-TV rates imposed by the Federal Communications Commission this week, have cast doubt both on Rogers' willingness to stick with its CDollars 17-per-share offer, and on MH's ability to find a better alternative. The uncertainty is reflected in a steep fall in MH's share price over the past two days. The Toronto-based publishing and cable-TV group was trading at CDollars 15.50 yesterday morning, well below Rogers' offer of CDollars 17 per share. The offer is open until March 15. Mr Ted Rogers, Rogers' chief executive, was reported yesterday to have said his offer may be 'too generous'. Analysts said the cut in US cable rates, as well as the subsequent collapse of merger talks between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc, had significantly lowered the value of MH's extensive US cable franchises. Rogers plans to dispose of these assets if its bid for MH succeeds. It will also distribute a portion of proceeds above CDollars 1.5bn to MH shareholders. However, it has the right to rescind its offer if any material change occurs in MH's business. MH has separately been seeking a buyer for the US cable assets as part of a promise to maximise shareholder value. It has so far spurned Rogers' overtures. However, its efforts to put more money into shareholders' pockets suffered a setback this week when Canada's finance minister closed a tax loophole which might have allowed MH to distribute proceeds from the sale of assets to its shareholders tax-free. Outsiders are sharply divided on the likely outcome of the battle. A Toronto portfolio manager said yesterday this week's developments had markedly reduced MH's value. 'The reality is that the world has changed,' he said.</p>

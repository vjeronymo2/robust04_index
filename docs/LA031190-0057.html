			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE MOVING UP BUT NOT MOVING OUT;  </P> <P> DEMOGRAPHICS: MIDDLE-CLASS LATINOS MAKE UP A MINI-COMMUNITY IN MISSION HILLS,  MAINTAINING TIES WITH NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODS OF THEIR PASTS.  </P> <P> Irene Tovar still recalls the unpaved streets that turned into muddy rivers  during rainstorms and the modest wood-frame house, where her family lived  without water, gas or electricity.  </P> <P> Despite these memories of poverty, Tovar, now 50, even more vividly remembers  the richness of her early youth: a close-knit family and Latino community amid  the dusty streets of small-town Pacoima. As Tovar prospered, and she thought  about buying a home, she faced a quandary: Did "moving up" have to mean moving  away from her roots?  </P> <P> "I love Pacoima, and I'm proud of being raised there," said Tovar, a community  activist. "But there wasn't any housing there I wanted."  </P> <P> Like many other upwardly mobile Latinos in the Valley, Tovar found her solution  in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> In the last 10 years, Mission Hills -- nestled among San Fernando, Pacoima and  Granada Hills -- has become a bridge for Latinos moving out of traditional  barrios and into the ranks of the suburban middle class.  </P> <P> "It's a natural for the people in Pacoima and San Fernando to move to Mission  Hills because it's still close to our home base," Tovar said.  </P> <P> The median household income in Mission Hills is $41,000 -- about $8,000 more  than the median for the Southern California region. And more than a quarter of  Mission Hills' 17,000 residents are Latino, according to Times' surveys. That  makes it one of the largest concentrations of Latinos in the San Fernando  Valley living in an area with a moderately high per-capita income.  </P> <P> Mission Hills joins other upscale Latino enclaves peppered throughout Southern  California in communities such as Hacienda Heights and La Puente. And they are  on the rise in Azusa, Monrovia and Arcadia, Latino activist Bert Corona said.  </P> <P> The tidy streets of Mission Hills look like any other suburban community in the  San Fernando Valley. Five minutes from the housing projects of Pacoima sit the  cozy '50s tract homes and spacious, spotless supermarkets of Mission Hills.  </P> <P> And that is precisely the draw, say many Latinos who live there. The community  is removed from the problems that plague the barrio, such as crime and crowded  schools.  </P> <P> "Mission Hills is like a step up," said Elizabeth Sanchez, who was born in  Pacoima and has lived in Mission Hills four years.  </P> <P> But it is also accessible to the Spanish-language churches and specialty shops  catering to a Latino clientele on the other side of the Golden State Freeway.  It allows upwardly mobile Latinos to maintain a cultural lifeline to the  heritage they left behind, to keep a foot in both worlds.  </P> <P> "It's still close to home, and the things that are familiar," said James  Acevedo, a Mission Hills-based political consultant.  </P> <P> Socorro Montano, who runs a Latino market and deli with her husband,  Bernardino, in Mission Hills, agreed.  </P> <P> "They're staying close by and at the same time getting out of the ghetto," she  said. "A lot of people don't want to let go of their roots."  </P> <P> Although many in the Latino community in Mission Hills say they are aware of  the recent growth within their ranks, the larger community is only now becoming  aware of its new residents.  </P> <P> Some Latino residents surmise that this lag in awareness occurs because they do  not meet many of the Anglo stereotypes of Latinos. Many speak unaccented  English; some even have an "American" accent when they speak Spanish. In  addition, most of the mom and pop shops that cater to the Latino population are  still on the other side of the freeway in San Fernando and Pacoima.  </P> <P> "You don't have these traditionally Hispanic physical manifestations, so people  say, 'There are no Latinos in Mission Hills,' " Corona said.  </P> <P> Acevedo made the same observation from a different perspective:  </P> <P> "We fit into the system," he said.  </P> <P> Although Latino enrollment this year at the 645-student San Jose Street School  is 6% higher than last year -- nearly 59% of the total enrollment -- Principal  Barbara Fuller said most of the Latino children are "certainly as anglicized as  the rest."  </P> <P> Sanchez was born in Pacoima and lived there until she was 5, when her family  moved to Newhall. Her husband, Mario, a machinist in Burbank, was born in  Mexico and came to California in 1975.  </P> <P> She now lives in Mission Hills and is an assistant manager at Security Pacific  Bank. Sanchez said she often is mistaken for an Armenian or Middle Easterner  because of the way she looks and her unaccented English.  </P> <P> Sanchez and her husband began their search for a home in San Fernando because  they wanted to be close to the traditional Latino churches and shops of the  northeast Valley. But the neighborhoods they liked were out of their price  range. So, they focused their hunt on Mission Hills, where home prices run from  $190,000 to $260,000.  </P> <P> "I have close ties to where my family started," she said. "I want my children  to be around our heritage."  </P> <P> The four-bedroom house they eventually found -- on a quiet cul-de-sac in the  shadow of the Simi Valley Freeway -- looked like the perfect place to start a  family. Four years later, they have two children: Olivia, 2, and Diego, 8  months.  </P> <P> The family attends Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando. And, when the  children are old enough for school, they will go to one of the Catholic schools  in San Fernando or Pacoima, Elizabeth Sanchez said.  </P> <P> "We're just looking for a better place to live," Mario Sanchez said.  </P> <P> The phenomenon of Latino mini-communities is a result of the "pull of the  extended family," Corona explained.  </P> <P> "There is a growing body of Latinos in the rising middle class that still like  to buy where their compadres have bought," Corona said, explaining that, after  one person buys a home in an area, many friends and family members follow.  </P> <P> That suburbanization of Latinos has led some to claim that their culture is  being watered down -- that white bread is replacing tortillas.  </P> <P> But Montano and others say Latinos moving away from the barrio is part of a  natural social progression. Many of those moving out of the barrios now were  born in the United States and are eager to cash in on the dreams that brought  their parents north a generation ago.  </P> <P> "You want a better life," Montano said. "You left your country, what for? A  better life."  </P> <P> The pattern has venerable roots in American culture: many immigrant groups have  made the same trek from ethnic ghettos to mainstream suburbs, said Jose  Hernandez, a professor of urban studies at Cal State Northridge. But, because  of California's Mexican legacy, many Latinos are reluctant to shed their  heritage as completely as other immigrants.  </P> <P> "Mexicans identify with the history of California," he said. "The culture is  very pronounced. It's hard to get away from it."  </P> <P> It is a culture that emphasizes the family and community involvement, he said,  adding that that may be a reason many Latinos tend to congregate in particular  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "Latinos are very much searching for a community," he said. "That's part of our  culture. Being able to talk across the fence with your neighbor -- that's very  important."  </P> <P> Acevedo agreed but said that a place like Mission Hills allows Latinos to  maintain their roots while branching out into the mainstream.  </P> <P> "When you first settle in a country, you gravitate toward your own ethnic  group, but once you become somewhat familiar with your environment, you're not  afraid to venture from that support base," Acevedo said. "But you retain your  roots. We can always go back to the barrio."  </P> <P> Tovar does just that several times a week.  </P> <P> Her home in the northeast corner of Mission Hills is less than a mile from the  San Fernando line, and she regularly crosses the boundary to buy handmade  tortillas at Tresierras Market.  </P> <P> "I don't know of a place in Mission Hills where I can get good tortillas," she  said. "Any time I want to get something that is so-called Mexican, I will go to  San Fernando or Pacoima."  </P> <P> But, as the Latino population in Mission Hills grows, that practice may change.  Shops that cater to the new residents are beginning to pop up.  </P> <P> Montano said 70% of her customers at her shop on Sepulveda Boulevard are from  the Mission Hills "side of the tracks." The number has grown significantly  since she moved her market and delicatessen there 13 years ago.  </P> <P> Non-Latino businesses also have cashed in on making themselves accessible to  the growing Latino market.  </P> <P> Phil Stanchfield, general manager of Hamer Toyota, said about 35% of his  clientele is Latino, and he employs several Spanish-speaking salespeople.  </P> <P> Michael Medina, who grew up in Arleta, always thought Mission Hills had a nice  ring to it. "Just the name Mission Hills gives me a little more pride," said  Medina, 42, who owns a residential carpet-cleaning service.  </P> <P> Medina moved to Mission Hills in 1973 after a stint in the military. Now, as he  watches the police helicopters hover almost nightly over the northeastern edge  of the valley, he knows he made the right choice.  </P> <P> He said he feels safer knowing that his five children will not inadvertently  imply a gang association when they tell other youths where they live -- a risk  they might face if they lived in other neighborhoods.  </P> <P> It is what everybody wants, he said: a place to feel safe and raise a family.  </P> <P> "Not just Hispanics, but blacks and whites want to move into a neighborhood  like this."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, al Tayr [April] 3, JAMAHIRYAH NEWS AGENCY  -- The American radio broadcast a commentary quoting the  American chief of staff who represents the American  Administration's viewpoint. The commentary referred to remarks  by the American President.    JANA's editor for international affairs commented on this  saying that "opinion and remarks expressed in this commentrary  reflect the colonial viewpoint of the USA towards other peoples  especially peoples who are endeavouring to build and assert  themselves and take their decisions freely. This is a  narrow-minded viewpoint leading the USA to mock international  law and consider independent states as if they were her colonies  or companies which she controls their resources. When American  officials talk about changing other regimes, they should not  forget that the American regime is the one which deserves to be  change for it is founded on injustice, exploitation, persecusion  of minorities including [words indistinct], racial  discrimination and aggression.    The remarks made by American officials against China, the  Great Jamahiryah, India, North Korea, Iran and Cuba and other  peoples who are genuinely independent contain a scent of  aggression. The peoples against whom America declared her  hostility and uncovered her plans towards them, should get ready  in anticipation of the aggression which the American radio  remarks said it was being planned.    America [words indistinct] from the political stances she  has  been follwing that she is against all values and principles of  freedom. She endeavours to distort civilisation and fuel wars.  America commits daily tens of inhuman crimes against mankind  civilisation. She threatens international peace. The peoples  of the world continue to remember the crimes of America in  Vietnam, Korea, Angola, Mozambic, South Africa, her strategic  alliance with the Israelis against the Arabs, her instigation of  conflicts in South America, her support for dictatorial regimes  in South America, her promotion of drugs in the world and her  acts of political assassination like that against the late  president of Chile Salvador Allende.    All free peoples and active forces are required today to see  the true nature of America who uses a colossal arsenal for the  realisation of her designs and exerting pressure on other  peoples through intimidation, terrorism and bribery so as to  abandon humanitarian values and surrender to american domination.</p>

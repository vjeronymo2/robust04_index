			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: US backs Russian project to link equity clearing centres A US-funded project for Russian equities will soon link clearing centres in Moscow and St Petersburg. The link-up may be followed by the creation of a Nasdaq-style trading system, banking sources said, Reuter reports from Moscow. Chase Manhattan Bank of the US is acting as an adviser to the project, undertaken by consultants Deloitte and Touche for Russia's privatisation committee, said the bankers. The US computer company SunGard Data Systems is providing the software for the project, which is funded by USAID (the US Agency for International Development). Under the plan, two clearing centres for share trading have been set up in Moscow and Yekaterinburg. A third is being considered for Novosibirsk. The Moscow centre is already in operation, with about 10 Russian banks and brokerages as members. Settlement, so far on a manual basis, is trading day plus five days. The Moscow clearing centre is handling settlements in the shares of newly-privatised Russian enterprises, ranging from the big Kosmos Hotel to the Krasny Oktyabr sweet factory. It will be computerised by September. Separately, the consultants KPMG Peat Marwick are involved in the creation of another share-clearing centre in St Petersburg, which bankers say will be linked to Moscow electronically by December. 'Eventually, all these regional clearing centres will be linked to each other,' one banker said. This will be followed by the creation of a US Nasdaq-style share-trading system in Russia, banking sources added. 'The intention at the end of the day is to develop share trading in Russia on an inter-regional basis,' a consultant with Deloitte said.</p>

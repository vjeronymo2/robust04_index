Slovak Television reported today that the ethnic Hungarians  "no longer seek to create a province," and the 100-member  representative body, which was to have put resolutions of  tomorrow's meeting into practice, is also unlikely to be  elected. According to television reports, the reason is the  Slovak Interior Ministry's refusal to register the  representative body.    Discussion of a self-administrative province stretching  across southern Slovakia is also being abandoned and proposals  appear instead providing for the creation of three areas -- the  Danube, Palocz, and Mezibodrozi regions -- where more than 80  percent of the almost 600,000-strong Hungarian minority reside.    According to the television reports, these concessions may  be  linked to the fact that the Komarno Appeal has been opposed not  only by Slovaks but also by Hungarians and that it has not met  with favorable response abroad either.    However, representatives of the Matica Slovenska (Slovak  cultural and historical organization) allege that the reason may  be a tactical temporary lessening of the well-thought out  demands which will further escalate. It is necessary to wait  for an answer till tomorrow, the report concluded.</p>

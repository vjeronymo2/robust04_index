			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY KRAFT ITEM A WASTE OF SPACE, TIME  </P> <P> I am very disappointed that you think I would be interested in what Randy Kraft  does while on Death Row (Newswatch, Oct. 16).  </P> <P> Why you would take up valuable space to report on something so insignificant  boggles my mind when there are so many worthwhile subjects that need publicity  and are not getting it.  </P> <P> For example, how about reporting on the needs of the handicapped, the fact that  baby food and diapers are needed at the Tustin Air Station, or the items  requested by our servicemen serving our country in Saudi Arabia. I want to know  about these things -- not about a killer playing bridge. What good does it do  society to know it?  </P> <P> SALLY SPIRO, Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Greg Torode] </F>   [Text] The crew of a ship seized by armed boarders in Hong  Kong waters are now trapped aboard while the vessel sits  anchored outside a Chinese naval base in Zhuhai. The [Hong  Kong] Government and the agents of the Tequila have had no  official word on the fate of the Indonesian and Filipino crew  members since the Taiwan-bound ship was taken while at anchor in  the Tathong Channel a fortnight ago. And China is refusing to  say where it is holding another ship seized just as it left Hong  Kong waters last week on its way to South Korea.    The Post found the Tequila lying in restricted waters off  Zhuhai this week, kept about 500 metres off shore from naval,  Customs and Coast Guard gunboats. Local craft were prevented  from approaching. One armed Customs vessel held on its stern two  small unmarked jet boats, similar to descriptions of those used  to intercept the Tequila. Zhuhai Port authorities said the  565-tonne vessel was under constant land and radar surveillance.  Crew could be seen wandering about the decks of the ship,  cleared of its cargo of 46 second-hand cars manifested in Hong  Kong for Keelung.    Senior government sources said a series of requests by Hong  Kong's Political Adviser's Office to counterparts in XINHUA (the  New China News Agency) had gone unanswered, but Public Security  Bureau officials had unofficially confirmed the ship's  detention. They had, however, denied the Honduran-registered  vessel was taken in Hong Kong, despite Marine Department radar  print-outs proving the opposite. XINHUA has not responded to  requests for further clarification, and it is understood a  formal protest could be lodged next week.    "We are very concerned," one official close to the case  said.  "China seems uninterested in talking to us yet it does appear  that (Chinese) officials were involved in Hong Kong waters, and  we are giving them the chance to clarify the matter before  lodging a protest."    Leung Kam-hung, managing director of agents Fitter Marine,  said yesterday he was working with Zhuhai contacts but still had  no word on exactly why the ship was taken, or by whom. He said  he had no idea what was happening to his 14 crew members and  added that no receipts had been issued by the Chinese for the  cargo. "We just have no idea what is going on, no information  at all," Mr Leung said.    Meanwhile, agents for the 3,566-tonne Shun Ping, seized off  Waglan Island last Sunday [27 March], were yesterday summoned to  Guangzhou with all documents relating to the ship. A spokesman  for Dong Woo agencies -- a prominent Hong Kong firm -- said the  company did not know with whom it would be dealing, where the  ship was or why it was being held.    "All that we are being told is that the crew are safe and  that it was seized on leaving Hong Kong because it was not  flying its flag of registration, Panama," he said. "This is  clearly nonsense, but it shows what we are up against."</p>

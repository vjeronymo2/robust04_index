			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Eaton to take over at Chrysler: Iacocca's successor to come from General Motors Europe THE long-running search for a new head of Chrysler, the third biggest US carmaker, ended yesterday when Mr Robert Eaton, the president of General Motors Europe, was named to succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as Chrysler's chairman and chief executive. Mr Eaton, 52, takes over when Mr Iacocca steps down on December 31, but will take office immediately as Chrysler's vice-chairman and chief operating officer. The naming of Mr Eaton followed a weekend of activity at the company. Mr Eaton flew to New York, where he met Mr Iacocca and a group of Chrysler directors for a meeting that lasted until midnight on Saturday. Mr Iacocca said yesterday the board had considered a dozen candidates over the past six months. The man seen as the main victim of Mr Eaton's appointment is Mr Robert Lutz, the former head of Ford Europe who joined Chrysler in 1986. Mr Lutz said yesterday he would continue as Chrysler president, reporting to a revived Office of the Chairman that will consist of Mr Iacocca and Mr Eaton. Mr Lutz, whose strengths lie in inspiring distinctively designed and engineered cars, was perceived by many as heir apparent. His position seemed to be strengthened last month after the abrupt departure of another candidate for the top job, Mr Robert Miller, the vice-chairman who helped Mr Iacocca to bring Chrysler back from the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago. Mr Eaton will face significant managerial and financial challenges. Chrysler, in common with other US carmakers, is suffering from weak US consumer demand, and strong competition from Japanese and European car imports. One of the key issues for Mr Eaton is whether to seek a merger or joint development venture with a non-US vehicles company. In 1990 Chrysler broke off alliance talks with Fiat of Italy. Chrysler, with around 90 per cent of its revenues in the US, has the smallest overseas presence of the Big Three of Detroit. Mr Lutz is said to have angered Mr Iacocca last summer when he was quoted in a Detroit newspaper comparing Chrysler to a 'dying woman who wasn't getting any marriage proposals'. Mr Iacocca said yesterday that Chrysler had enough products to compete without needing a merger for at least five years. After the news, Chrysler's shares edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 17.

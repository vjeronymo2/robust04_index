			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Leyland Trucks at Pounds 8m and plans to lift output Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, the truck maker rescued last year by a management buy-out following the collapse of the Daf group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.4m for the 11 months to end-April. The company, formed in June 1993 with backing from Barclays Development Capital, had turnover of Pounds 148.6m. Earlier this year LDV, the Birmingham-based van manufacturer which was rescued by a separate management buy-out from the Daf receivership, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on turnover of Pounds 79.6m in its first trading period from April to December. Leyland produced 6,800 trucks over the 11 month period and is planning to raise output to 8,000 vehicles in the current financial year. The company has increased its production rate by about 20 per cent, from 30 to 36 trucks a day, since it was formed last June. The break-even level for production had been reduced to about 5,500 trucks a year. Leyland has established three main business areas: the production of its 45 series light trucks for sale through the European dealer network of Daf Trucks, the Dutch company formed after the collapse of the former Daf group; the production of military trucks, currently for the Ministry of Defence; and the production and sale of trucks in world markets outside Europe. The company expects to sell 7,000 trucks through the Daf network this year and forecasts that the total will rise sharply in 1995 and 1996. It has established trading agreements in Africa and east Asia and has secured orders from 22 countries worth some Pounds 11m. Mr John Gilchrist, chief executive, said that 'sales volumes are increasing in all our major markets, although the proportion of our income from the UK military will diminish at the end of the current contract'.</p>

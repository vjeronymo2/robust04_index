In the past five years, the province's grain production  basically increased at a slow speed. After 1988 when the  province produced over 20 billion kg of grain, the province's  grain output has remained at around 22.5 billion kg for the past  two years. According to the development plan of the provincial  government, the grain output of the province should reach 27.5  billion kg by 2000. This task is extremely arduous. The cotton  production situation is even more serious. To this end, the  provincial party committee and the provincial government defined  that in 1994, the province should strive to turn out 23.5  billion kg while ensuring the production of 23 billion kg of  grain, and strive to turn out 500 million kg while ensuring the  production of 400 million kg of cotton. The ideas for guiding  the province's agricultural work are to realize the target of  becoming fairly well-off, to take the overall situation into  consideration, to focus on steadily increasing grain and cotton  production and increasing the income of the peasants, to deepen  reform, to expand the scale of opening up, to make structural  readjustment, to perfect systems, to make a breakthrough in  science and technology, to vigorously develop high-yield,  good-quality, and highly efficient agriculture, and to  accelerate the realization of agricultural modernization. Under  the guidance of these ideas, this year, we should win a tough  battle in grain and cotton production. We should adopt forceful  measures to bring about an upswing in cotton production. From  this year, the provincial government begins carrying out  mandatory planned management of cotton production and  distribution and also to sign letters of responsibility with  various prefectural and city governments so as to ensure the  fulfillment of the cotton production task. The general  requirements for this year's grain production are to stabilize  the grain and cotton sown areas, to optimize the grain and  cotton structure, to improve the quality, and [words  indistinct]. The province's grain sown areas should surpass 100  million mu and must not fluctuate by a big margin. We should  adopt different techniques to sow wheat on different wheat  fields and try every possible means to ensure the scientific  management of wheat field. In regard to corn production, we  should vigorously carry out the key measures to change the  growing forms and change the quality and to increase the input  and the density in an effort to set a new record in corn  production.</p>

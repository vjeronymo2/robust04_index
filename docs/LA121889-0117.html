			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH TRAILING REAGAN IN FIRST-YEAR TV COVERAGE  </P> <P> President Bush has gotten significantly less television coverage than his  predecessor during his first year in office and that coverage is increasingly  negative, according to a media-monitoring group.  </P> <P> Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan  research group that monitors television news coverage, said an analysis of the  Bush coverage, from his inauguration through Dec. 1, indicates that Bush has  received about a third as much television exposure as Ronald Reagan did in the  same period of his presidency. The amount of coverage is declining almost  weekly and getting significantly more negative, according to Lichter.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Bush retains high public approval ratings. The latest Washington  Post poll, taken Nov. 30-Dec. 4, found the President's job-approval rate was  62%. While that is considered strong, it is 10 points lower than his rating a  month earlier.  </P> <P> Lichter said the lack of correlation between positive media coverage and high  poll ratings is strong evidence that the public's perception of how a President  is doing relates only in part to his media image. "A President's image is not  just a result of his media portrayal. It results from a general level of  satisfaction with the public," he said. If the economy is generally strong and  "communism is crumbling across the world," Lichter speculated, the public feels  satisfied with presidential performance even if the news media are criticizing  it.  </P> <P> According to Lichter's assessment of about 1,800 reports on Bush and his  Administration, the President has been the subject of 574 stories, contrasted  to 1,782 for Reagan in the same period. Unlike Reagan's team, which consciously  aimed at a daily television message, Bush's media aides appear to make no such  effort.  </P> <P> Lichter found Bush generally had better report cards on TV for foreign policy  and defense expertise than for domestic issues and that by far the heaviest  coverage he has received has been in the foreign policy area, particularly  relations with the Soviets.  </P> <P> The study also confirmed that the Bush family dog, Millie, has been a media  godsend. Millie, the study found, has been mentioned in more television stories  than three Cabinet secretaries, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos,  Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward  J. Derwinski.  </P></p>

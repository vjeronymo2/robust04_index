			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is paying more  attention to the post-evaluation and supervision of state  investment activities, as the country's construction scale  becomes larger day by day.    Addressing a high-level seminar on the post-evaluation of  project performance, sponsored by the World Bank, Minister of  Finance Jin Renqing [name and title as received] said that it is  imperative to set up a post-evaluation system that supervises  and controls state investment activities and increase investment  returns and quality.    Statistics show that the country's total investment will  reach 1500 billion yuan this year and about 800 billion will  come from the government.    Jin explained that post-evaluation means investigation of  social and economic activities carried out at present or in the  past. Post-evaluation can give evidence of whether the  investment activity is reasonable and effective or not and put  forward suggestions and basis for future decision making.    Jin said that as one of the important methods for  macro-economic control, the post-evaluation system has been  widely adopted in the world in recent years.    In the year 1988, China began trial post-evaluations of  major  state construction projects. Up till now it has conducted  qualitative analysis of 33 projects, nine of which use foreign  investment.    However, as Jin put it, China's post-evaluation lacks  authority, fairness and transparency due to the fact that it is  handled separately by state finance, planning, banking, and  auditing departments.    Jin Renqing pointed out that it is a very complicated task  to  establish a post-evaluation system best suited to China's  national conditions.    He said that the new system should be rational and operable,  and in setting up such system, both the long- and short-term  interests should be taken into account.    "It needs time," Jin concluded.    Officials from the Finance Ministry disclosed that so far  two  methods for setting up the system have been raised with the help  of the World Bank.    One is to establish a unified and independent state post-  evaluation organ to coordinate supervision over the performances  of investment projects nationwide.    The other is to let the international engineering consulting  company, the state auditing administration and other departments  concerned carry out post-evaluation under the leadership of the  State Planning Commission.    At today's seminar, the second method received much support  from participants.    But Jin Renqing assured participants that after the  post-evaluation method has been adopted throughout the country,  China will certainly organize a state post-evaluation department.    Information from the state Finance Ministry revealed that a  basic construction finance office has been set up in the finance  ministry, which will conduct financial management and investment  benefits analysis on state major construction projects and  external debts.    The World Bank has promised to provide 400,000 U.S. dollars  to help China invite world-famous consultants to carry out  special-subject investigations on setting up a post-evaluation  system in the country.</p>

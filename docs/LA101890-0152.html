			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARL LEWIS UNDERGOES KNEE SURGERY, EXPECTED TO MISS INDOOR TRACK SEASON  </P> <P> Carl Lewis underwent arthroscopic surgery Tuesday in Houston to remove damaged  cartilage from his right knee, according to his manager, Joe Douglas of the  Santa Monica Track Club.  </P> <P> Douglas said the knee bothered Lewis for the entire track season, particularly  after the Goodwill Games in July.  </P> <P> "Carl didn't complain, but some people noticed that he didn't have any power in  his first 30 meters," Douglas said. "He couldn't burst out of the blocks  because it was painful.  </P> <P> "Once he was running at full stride, it was OK. He was still the fastest in the  last 70 meters, but he was usually much farther behind than he normally would  have been."  </P> <P> Douglas said Lewis expects to resume working out within four weeks, although he  does not plan to compete in the indoor season.  </P> <P> Lewis, 29, was beaten several times at 100 meters this year. But he continued a  winning streak in the long jump that began in 1981. RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

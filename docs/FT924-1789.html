			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury cuts loss to Pounds 4.7m Mr Peter Levy, chairman of Shaftesbury, the property company, said despite difficult market conditions substantial progress had been in reducing borrowings and generating sufficient rental income to cover outgoings. In the year to September 30 losses before provisions were cut from Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.54m. After provisions against cost of developing properties of Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 8.79m) the pre-tax loss was Pounds 4.69m (Pounds 12.8m). Losses per share were 16.3p (52.2p). Following a valuation of investment properties the deficit of Pounds 3.52m had been charged to revaluation reserve. Net assets over the year fell to 87p (117p). Mr Levy said that borrowings had been cut by sales during the year and since the year end. Rental income now covered all outgoings, he said.</p>

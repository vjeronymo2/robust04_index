			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks mixed as data fail to lift bonds Wall Street US stocks were mixed yesterday as a batch of weaker than expected economic data failed to lift bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.23 better at 3,758.37, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 0.83 at 456.50. Declines on the New York SE outpaced advances by 1,193 to 950 after modest volume of 216m shares. The American SE composite slipped 0.49 to 440.45 but the Nasdaq composite improved 2.05 to 735.19. After the extended holiday weekend, the trading week opened with a barrage of economic news, which mostly pointed to a moderating economic trend. The Conference Board, an industry trade group, said its May index of consumer confidence slipped after advancing in the previous two months. The Commerce Department announced that personal income in April was up 0.4 per cent, a little less than expected, while personal spending dipped 0.1 per cent, against expectations of no change. New home sales in April showed a 6.8 per cent decline. None of these indicators of slower growth - a favourable development for fixed-rate investments - could generate any enthusiasm among bond traders. The US Treasury market was showing moderate losses near the end of the day, as the market watched commodity and gold prices rise and European bonds extend their losses. A report showing Chicago's purchasing managers paying higher prices last month was another negative factor. The data may have provided a preview of today's critical National Association of Purchasing Management survey. There is also concern in the financial markets over May employment data, due out on Friday. A strong reading on non-farm payrolls could trigger a big sell-off in bonds. Stocks are sure to follow. Blue chips were down 15 Dow points near the opening, as equity investors pondered the weakness in bonds. But share prices later recovered to near their opening levels as the session progressed. American Express showed the best gain among the Dow components, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 27 5/8: the company completed the distribution of 98.2m shares of Lehman Brothers (off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 18), finishing the spin-off of the investment banking firm. McDonald's added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 62 1/8 on the heels of announcing a two-for-one stock split and a heftier dividend. Merck was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 62, On the downside, Walt Disney shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/4 and Union Carbide lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 27. Blockbuster Entertainment, whose proposed takeover by Viacom has become uncertain, was near the top of the NYSE's most active list. It rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 on volume of 3.2m shares after Robertson Stephens &amp; Company lifted its rating on the issue. Two entertainment software companies also announced a marketing pact with the video rental chain. Bombay, a home-furnishing retailer, jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 7/8 after posting a 23 per cent increase in May sales for stores opened at least a year. CBS suffered a further fall in the aftermath of last week's announcement that several television stations were switching their affiliation to the Fox network. The issue dropped Dollars 8 7/8 to Dollars 261. Canada Toronto also ended on a mixed note following moderate trading. The TSE 300 index gained 6.1 points at 4,326.8 but falls narrowly led rises by 409 to 401. Volume was 48.1m shares. Eight of the 14 sub-indices were lower, led by transportation, off 1.6 per cent. The gold group rose 1.6 per cent as the New York bullion price put on USDollars 2.40 to USDollars 387.15 an ounce.</p>

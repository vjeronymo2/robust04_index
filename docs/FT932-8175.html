			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Boots withdraws suncare injunction BOOTS, the chemist chain, withdrew its application for an interim injunction preventing its rival Superdrug selling a range of private-label products called Solait, which Boots claimed could be confused with its own Soltan brand. Boots said it had withdrawn the application because it did not have time to respond to evidence introduced by Superdrug shortly before yesterday's court hearing. Boots said it still intended to proceed to a full trial.</p>

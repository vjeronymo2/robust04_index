			<p>CSO     [Text] Last Saturday, a flock of ministers, governors, and  mayors who had resigned their posts before the end of their  terms of office took flight to try their luck at the ballot box  on 3 October. Ten of the 27 governors elected in 1990 stepped  down. Only one of them, Leonel Brizola of Rio de Janeiro,  announced on Good Friday that he will run for the presidency.  The others plan to compete for Senate seats, a race that is  never easy but will be relatively pleasant. In 1994, there are  two senatorial vacancies in each state -- a situation that  offers each contender twice the chances of victory as in 1990,  when only one seat was available. The last governor to make a  decision was Geraldo Bulhoes, of Alagoas. Until very early  Saturday morning, Bulhoes was in Maceio putting together a  "superslate" inspired by the big man himself, former President  Fernando Collor. The name of Rosane Collor came up at the  negotiating table, but was promptly rejected by the former  president. Interested in running for a Chamber seat, his wife,  toalheira Denilma Bulhoes was hoping until the last  minute that her husband would resign and thus remove any legal  obstacle to her own campaign.    Besides FHC [Fernando Henrique Cardoso], two other stars  from  the Itamar Franco campaign, left office at the last minute:  Mauricio Correa, who left Justice to run for governor of the  Federal District, and Walter Barelli, of Labor, who is being  considered as candidate for lieutenant governor of Sao Paulo on  a slate with tucano Mario Covas. Among mayors of  state capitals, all sworn in 15 months ago, the most notable  departure is that of Dante de Oliveira, from Cuiaba, who will  run for the governorship of Mato Grosso under the PDT  [Democratic Labor Party] banner. Their chances for success and  the reasons that led governors and mayors to enter the race  vary, but all took as their starting point a decisive factor --  the opinion polls. Nowadays no candidate makes decisions based  on the enthusiasm or the advice of his friends. They decide on  the basis of research institute surveys.    A month ago, when he ranked second in the polls among  candidates for Planalto Palace, Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf  announced his "irrevocable" decision to run for president. Last  week, when the same polls reported he had been overtaken by  Fernando Henrique, Maluf summoned the press and read a statement  in which he said: "I am a candidate for president...in 1998."  Another poll encouraged him to make the same decision. Eight out  of 10 respondents who had voted for Maluf said they were opposed  to his stepping down as mayor. Before making his final decision,  he listened to some advice, and later, a promise. "If those who  voted for you don't want you to run, it would be wiser not to,"  Deputy Antonio Delfim Netto told him.    On Monday, Maluf had dinner with businessman Roberto  Marinho,  of Globo Network. "He told me that if I were to run, he would  wish me luck, but that I am young and can wait," Maluf himself  revealed. "He said that if I run, he would treat me fairly,  which is saying quite a bit." On Tuesday in Brasilia, Maluf met  with top PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] leaders and heard the  same suggestion. "You are like Corinthians [a Sao Paulo soccer  team], the paulistanos' emotional favorite, and you  cannot let them down," Senator Esperidiao Amin told him. "You  could run, but the people want you to stay." It is true that the  PFL's [Liberal Front Party] preference for Fernando Henrique  also influenced Maluf's decision. But the absence of allies has  never played a decisive role in the mayor's decisions. Since  1978, he has run for president twice, sought the governorship  three times (winning once, in an indirect election), run twice  for mayor (and won once), and tried for and won a seat as  federal deputy in 1982. If Maluf's ratings had been better in  1994, there is no doubt he would have stayed in the race.  <H5>  Free Sample </H5>   The year 1994 is different from 1989 because of a crucial  element. The election five years ago was for a single office.  Twenty-two candidates for president flooded the first round.  Most were merely adventurers who entered the contest without the  slightest chance of victory and without letting that bother  them. They were interested in giving voters a free sample for  the 1990 elections, when governorships, the Senate, the Chamber  of Deputies, and seats in state legislatures would be at stake.  The 1994 elections will cover all those posts at one time. There  will not be another chance like this until 1998 when, as was  approved in the constitutional revision, "joint" elections will  be held again. The only opportunity between now and then will  come in 1996, but those will be municipal elections -- for mayor  and city councilmen.  <H5>  Key to the Vault </H5>   "We won't see any `parachutist' candidates in 1994, the ones  who enter today's race so they can try to win tomorrow's,"  explained Professor Francisco Weffort, of the University of Sao  Paulo. "Anyone who runs now is really serious about it." A  typical feature of a "joint" [casada] election are  the alliances, which are very important. A candidate for the  presidency needs solid support in each state if he is to prevent  an internal hemorrhage of his electorate. Likewise, a candidate  for governor will try to ally himself with a presidential  candidate who would help to fill, rather than empty, his basket  of votes. The government apparatus is another ingredient in the  mortar between the bricks of this state/federal edifice. That  mass of public funds, jobs, and influence helps explain why 17  governors decided to remain in office.    "I cannot just hand over to Fernando Henrique a state  government like that of Rio Grande do Sul," admitted Governor  Alceu Collares, a Brizola campaign worker who, were he to leave  Piratini, would have to turn over the key to the vault to his  lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto Coelho, from whom he  is estranged. An identical situation prevails in Ciro Gomes's  Ceara State, but the party banners are reversed.  Tucano Ciro Gomes is popular enough to run for and  easily win a seat in the Senate. His headache is his lieutenant  governor, Lucio Alcantara, a brizolista who was  demanding his share of the government pie even before the  campaign began. Apprehensive, last week Ciro Gomes said he would  wait until his term ends before starting studies at Harvard  University in the United States.  <H5>  Reheated Cafe au Lait </H5>   Whether to stay in government or leave prematurely is a  decision that each politician also makes on the basis of his own  performance. Most Bahia voters believe Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes [ACM] is doing an excellent job, and he said farewell  to the post in grand style last week to run for the Senate. His  final act was to free 154 prisoners who had been jailed for  petty theft, such as stealing a package of candy or a pair of  glasses. Always with an eye to topics that can seize the voters'  attention, ACM explained his gesture as a protest "in a country  where the judiciary never takes action against the rich."    In a different situation are the governors of the country's  most populous and wealthiest states: Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho  of Sao Paulo, and Helio Garcia, of Minas Gerais. On the  popularity list among governors, Fleury ranks just above Helio  Garcia, who is next-to-last. The booby prize belongs to Leonel  Brizola. Fleury and Helio Garcia spent the last few months  cooking up conversations in an atmosphere of mystery. They even  gave the impression they were reheating the old cafe au lait of  the Old Republic. Actually, Fleury was playing at being a  presidential candidate until Orestes Quercia reentered the  ticket-taker's booth at the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] amusement park. On behalf of the Minas distillery, Garcia  tried to hitch a ride as vice president on Fernando Henrique's  slate. Turned down, he had neither the heart nor the ratings to  attempt a run for the Senate.  [Box pp 30-31]  <H5>  Dance of the Governors </H5>    -  Goias: Governor Iris Rezende, of the PMDB, will  run for the Senate. Since Lieutenant Governor Maguito Vilela  will be a candidate for governor, the state will be governed by  the president of the state legislature, Agenor Rodrigues de  Rezende, of the PMDB.    -  Brasilia: Singed by the Budget  CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], Governor Joaquim  Roriz of the PP [Progressive Party] announced he will stay put.  He will try to get his public works secretary, Jose Roberto  Arruda, elected to succeed him.    -  Parana: Governor  Roberto Requiao of the PMDB resigned to seek his party's  nomination for president. If he is not successful, he will run  for the Senate. In his place will be Lieutenant Governor Mario  Pereira, his former transportation secretary.    -  Rio Grande  do Sul: Governor Alceu Collares, of the PDT, said he is  staying in office. He does not want to hand over the  governorship to his lieutenant, tucano Joao Gilberto,  with whom he is not on speaking terms.    -  Ceara:  Tucano Governor Ciro Gomes, Brazil's most  popular, with a 69 percent approval rating, announced he will  stay on. Tasso Jereissati, president of the PSDB [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party], may be a candidate to succeed  him.    -  Pernambuco: Governor Joaquim Francisco, of the  PFL [Liberal Front Party], said he will serve out his full term.  At the last minute, Recife Mayor Jarbas Vasconcelos, of the  PMDB, announced he is staying. He gave up the idea of running  for the state governorship in an alliance forged with Joaquim  Francisco to defeat Miguel Arraes, the candidate of the PSB-PT  [Brazilian Socialist Party/Workers Party]  coalition.    -  Bahia: Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes,  of the PFL, resigned to run for the Senate. Lieutenant Governor  Paulo Souto is a candidate for governor, and the president of  the state Assembly, Antonio Imbassahy, will run for the Chamber.  So, Bahia will be governed by the president of the Court of  Justice, Ruy Trindade, who will call indirect elections in 30  days. Likely to be chosen is state Transportation Secretary  Raimundo Britto.    -  Minas Gerais: Governor Helio Garcia,  of the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], tried until the last minute  to step down to become Fernando Henrique's running mate.  Unsuccessful, he called a press conference to say that he will  serve out his term.    -  Rio de Janeiro: Governor Leonel  Brizola, the country's least popular governor, left office to  run for president. Nilo Garcia, his lieutenant and current  secretary of the Civil Police, will take over.    -  Sao  Paulo: Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, of the PMDB,  will remain in office and support the presidential candidacy of  his political godfather, Orestes Quercia. Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo  Maluf gave up the idea of running for president and will stay  until the end of his mandate.    -  Santa Catarina:  Governor Vilson Kleinubing, of the PFL, will try for the Senate,  or for the vice presidency on Fernando Henrique's slate. He will  pass on the post to his lieutenant governor, Antonio Carlos  Konder Reis, of the PPR. Reis is a cousin of Jorge Bornhausen,  president of the PFL.</p>

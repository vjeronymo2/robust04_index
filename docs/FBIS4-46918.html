			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Shchepkin: "A Governor in Conflict </F> With the Constitution"]    [Text] An attempt by the head of administration of  Ulyanovsk Oblast, Yu. Goryachev, to bring about a review by the  Russian Supreme Court of a regional court decision which  actually forced him to shift elections to the local legislative  assembly from the spring to the fall has ended in defeat. The  statute which regulates an election campaign was drawn up by the  governor's subordinates with so many "stipulations" for local  conditions that citizens' right to direct, secret, and equal  elections declared by the Russian Federation Constitution turned  out to be in question, to put it mildly.    They were planning in the oblast to create a bicameral  representative organ and to organize voting in two stages with  the help of electors--persons entrusted by their fellow citizens  to elect the deputies. This was needed for an obvious purpose:  they put forward their own nominations among the other 43  representatives of the oblast administration at various levels  for the 50 seats in the legisalative assembly. The protectionist  articles in the local statute on elections were to contribute to  their election as well.    Activists of the Ulyanovsk regional center of the Russian  Democratic Reforms Movement and the Simbirsk "Democratic Russia"  sounded the alarm. They instituted action in a local court  demanding a review of the obviously overstated powers of the  administration in the Statute on Elections. The Ulyanovsk Oblast  Court contended that the third branch of government is also  capable of holding a consistent and independent position in  observing the law. It remained only for the governor to make a  complaint to Moscow. Which he did.    The decision of the Collegium on Civil Matters of the  Russian  Federation Supreme Court set a noteworthy precedent in denying  the recent appeal by Yu. Goryachev. No one has been authorized  to rewrite the Basic Law of the state and adapt it to his own  purposes.    Alas, the costs of the elections held in the oblast are paid  from the budget, and hence out of our common pocket.</p>

			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Observer: Patriotic gesture Three cheers for Lord Sterling of Plaistow. While the chairman of P&amp;O may be a property developer at heart, when it comes to the national interest he can be relied upon. He wants to remove the restriction in the company's Royal Charter on the amount of P&amp;O stock that may be owned by overseas interests, but he has reassured Her Majesty's Government, formally, that 'the P&amp;O fleet will, as always, be available for the defence of the Realm'. Lord Sterling, who knows more history than most company chairmen, tells me that it was Sir Thomas Sutherland (one of the founders of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank) who inserted the condition in 1903 that the company should 'remain a British concern in name and reality'. The Germans were playing up a bit at the time. Rather surprisingly, P&amp;O does not charge the government for having its fleet permanently on call. Perhaps it should.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL DOES A DOUBLE TAKE, DECIDES KRUGER WORK IS ART;  </P> <P> RULING: BUILDING AND SAFETY COMMISSION REVERSES ITSELF, UNANIMOUSLY DECLARES  MURAL IS NOT A SIGN.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Building and Safety Commission on Tuesday reversed an earlier  decision and voted unanimously to declare a huge proposed mural by New York  artist Barbara Kruger to be a work of art and not a sign.  </P> <P> The vote, which reversed a ruling a month ago by the same five-member panel,  apparently permits the Museum of Contemporary Art to hire painters to install  the Kruger mural on a 29-by-218-foot outside wall of the Temporary Contemporary  museum in Little Tokyo.  </P> <P> "Do what you want," museum officials were told by Tim Taylor, a top city  department permit official, after Tuesday's vote. "Get the paint brushes out."  The museum said the work might be installed within two months.  </P> <P> The tone of the encounter between Taylor and MOCA officials after the hearing  was jovial, but the commission vote came after City Councilman Joel Wachs urged  the board not to let the city government Los Angeles involve itself in  controling the content of artworks.  </P> <P> Wachs' plea came after commissioner Benito A. Sinclair bluntly told museum  officials that they would have to provide proof that the Kruger work could be  considered as art in order to avoid jurisdiction of a city sign ordinance that  would have drastically reduced the size of the mural and altered its contents.  </P> <P> The mural is to be a red, white and blue work in a layout suggesting the  American flag. In one corner, wording will identify the Temporary Contemporary.  The area of the flag traditionally occupied by red and white stripes will be  taken up by a series of nine politically provocative questions.  </P> <P> Wachs asserted that the building and safety commission could cause Los Angeles  to enter the ranks of communities that have slapped controls on the content of  artworks. Wachs specifically likened a decision to declare the proposed Kruger  mural as a sign to the prosecution of a Cincinnati museum on obscenity charges  over a show of work of the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> Wachs also urged the commission to take the action he advocated to avoid  providing Congress, which may continue or expand content-controls on work  funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, with additional local precedents  to justify legal regulation of what an artwork may say.  </P> <P> "I think it's an extremely important issue for the city," said Wachs, who has  been an activist on the City Council in favor of ordinances to try to control  the proliferation of advertising signs in Los Angeles. "No council member ever  considered the work of artists like Barbara Kruger. We wrote a (sign-control)  law that never contemplated this issue. It would be ironic if a law drafted to  enhance the city was the reason for denying contemporary art of greatness."  </P> <P> In its 4-0 vote Tuesday, the commission reversed its own April 3 decision in  which it upheld a finding by the Department of Building and Safety that the  Kruger mural should be treated as a sign and thus subject to an ordinance that  limits the total space in a sign that can be taken up by its written message to  3% of the sign's total area. The massive Kruger work, with letters six feet  tall, would be almost entirely devoted to its text message -- in keeping with  an artistic style with which Kruger has been prominently identified.  </P> <P> The mural proposal, which was approved last December by the city Cultural  Affairs Commission, had roused controversy in Little Tokyo last year after  residents and businessmen objected to a plan to include the wording of the  Pledge of Allegiance. After a series of meetings in the community, Kruger  agreed to delete the pledge wording, which opponents said would be an bitter  reminder of the forced incarceration of Japanese-Americans in internment camps  during World War II.  </P></p>

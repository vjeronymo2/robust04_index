			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / British Gas urged to repay Pounds 4.4m Central Manchester Development Corporation is demanding that British Gas repay with interest Pounds 4.4m in grants paid to help develop a 7.5-acre site near the city centre. The corporation alleges that the company submitted 'excessive' estimates for the redevelopment and the Pounds 12m tender accepted for the work meant that a grant was never needed. British Gas would not comment, but the company's land division investment director Ms Dru Vesty said an internal investigation was under way 'as a matter of urgency'. The company's land division was granted the money to help regenerate the wasteland site, which now contains the new headquarters of the British Council. The corporation promised grants of up to Pounds 5.4m, but withheld the last Pounds 1m when it discovered the true cost of the project was Pounds 5.8m less than the figure projected by British Gas's land division. The government-funded corporation said that on one project 'the recipient was apparently in breach of the conditions of the assistance contained in a legal agreement and appears as a result to have received an overpayment'.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Toyota denies taking Dollars 46m stake in Indonesia's Astra TOYOTA MOTOR of Japan has denied agreeing to buy into Astra International, Indonesia's main vehicle manufacturer. The denial followed an statement by Astra on Friday  - restated yesterday  - that Toyota was to acquire about 4 per cent of the company in a deal worth about USDollars 46m. Toyota said yesterday: 'It is not a fact that we have agreed to the investment as cited by Astra'  - although approaches made by Astra were under consideration. It added: 'We will do what is necessary to ensure that our relationship (with Astra) will be successful.' Astra intends to bring in foreign shareholders following a decision by the Soeryadjaya family, which owns 76 per cent of Astra, to sell down its holding to raise about Dollars 350m in finance for its troubled Summa Group. Astra, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 1.2bn, is reported also to have held talks with General Electric of the US and Temasek of Singapore.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SAKS 5TH AVENUE WILL ELIMINATE 7% OF JOB FORCE  </P> <P> In another sign that the weakening economy is affecting consumer spending,  glitzy fashion retailer Saks Fifth Avenue said today it is cutting its staff by  7% to streamline operations.  </P> <P> Saks, which was bought in July by Investcorp International, an Arab financial  syndicate, said it will eliminate 700 positions.  </P> <P> The upscale store's performance in the first half of the year fell short of its  own projections, with profits at $26.3 million versus expectations of $32  million to $33 million, according to published reports.  </P> <P> Retailers have been reporting sluggish sales, and industry analysts are  predicting that September figures will show no improvement from August.  Consumers have been pulling back over signs of a recession and higher inflation  caused by the jump in oil.  </P> <P> Saks said it sees "satisfactory" results for the current year.  </P> <P> Unveiling its growth strategy for the next five years, Saks said it plans to  invest about $250 million to expand its business.  </P> <P> Saks said its strategy will focus on store renovations, and it plans to  substantially increase its direct mail business.  </P> <P> Some Saks employees will be given a chance to buy shares in the company. All  four members of senior management have bought "significant" stakes in Saks, it  said.  </P> <P> Saks also plans to expand its resort store operations, test a new specialty  store concept, and will explore opportunities for growth internationally.  </P></p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / The Week Ahead Results due LONG regarded as one of the stock market's favourite 'recovery plays', Dixons is likely to disappoint some followers by emitting cautious noises about the state of the electrical goods retailing market when it reports interim results on Wednesday. Pre-tax profits may have fallen to Pounds 20m from Pounds 27m. Christmas, which falls after the end of the interim period, is also not expected to have been as buoyant as previously hoped. The UK retailing division should have continued its profits improvement, but any advances will have been dragged down by losses at Silo, in the US, and reduced contributions from property and interest. Securicor, the security and parcels delivery company, and its 51 per cent controlled sister, Security Services, report full-year earnings on Thursday. The figures are likely to reflect an improvement from the companies' 40 per cent stake in Cellnet, the mobile telephone network, which disappointed at the half-year. The companies are still dominated by Cellnet earnings. While Cellnet has suffered from a higher rate of disconnection than its main competitor, Vodafone, profits are likely to have benefited from a recession-induced cut in capital spending. Securicor is estimated to have made pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m (Pounds 51.9m). The pre-tax figure for Security Services, which is consolidated, is expected to be Pounds 21m (Pounds 36.1m).

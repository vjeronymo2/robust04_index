			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / El Salvador adversaries agree to peace plan THE El Salvador government and leftist rebels who have fought a 12-year civil war agreed yesterday to a peace plan which begins with a ceasefire on February 1, Reuter reports from the United Nations, New York. A complete peace treaty has still to be finalised. President Alfredo Cristiani said: 'This agreement initiates a new period for Salvadoreans.' He said his nation, which had suffered 75,000 deaths through the war, could begin spiritual and material reconstruction. Mr Bernard Aronson, US assistant secretary of state, said: 'Both sides know that the war is over.' Mr Aronson, who led a delegation of US officials at the margins of the peace talks, added: 'For the Salvadorean people, it is the best new year's present they could have.' For Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, who spent the last day of his 10 years as UN secretary-general on December 31 pursuing the peace accord, the agreement was particularly gratifying. 'I am a free man, I feel as light as a feather,' the 71-year-old Peruvian said. The accord draws on a 75-page document which will form the basis of a formal peace settlement in the tiny Central American country of 5m people. Negotiations resume on January 5, either in New York or Mexico. A communique said that if no final agreement was reached the new UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt, would take decisions for the two groups before January 16, when the talks are scheduled to be concluded formally. President Cristiani said remaining issues were 'technical', involving a timetable for implementing the accord, dissolving the rebels' military structure and integrating them into civil life. The Salvadorean president, credited with flexibility in the talks despite criticism from right-wing supporters, said he knew it was not easy for the rebels to agree to the accord. But he said 'the step they have taken will benefit the whole country'. Mr Schafik Handal, one of five rebel commanders, said all accords should begin to be implemented during the official ceasefire period that ends on October 31. If all goes according to schedule, he said, the rebel forces would be demobilised by then. Not all details of the peace settlement were disclosed but both sides involved in the past 20 months of negotiations had already agreed on a reform of the country's judiciary, human rights safeguards, electoral reform, a reduction of the 55,000-member armed forces and an overhaul of security services. The government was said to have presented plans on how to reduce the army over a two-year period to half its size and abolish some paramilitary counter-insurgency battalions. The rebels also wanted the government to allow peasant squatters in areas they control to continue living there. The government instead offered to settle the peasants but not necessarily on private property they now occupied. The agreements apparently call for a special commission to hear individual cases. The existing army-controlled security forces, numbering about 17,000, will be phased out and a new civilian police force is to be created. If the peace accord is implemented, the US has volunteered to be a guarantor of the settlement. It has also offered to initiate a generous reconstruction programme that includes aid from Europe, Canada and Japan. Washington has supported several Salvadorean governments with more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in financial aid since 1979.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joe Carroll: "Taoiseach Urges SF To Endorse </F> Non-Coercion Policy on Unionists"]    [Text] The Taoiseach, [prime minister], Mr Reynolds, has  appealed to Sinn Fein on the eve of its ard-fheis [annual  conference] to "make an immense step forward" and clearly  endorse a policy of non-coercion towards the unionist majority  in Northern Ireland.    He reminded Sinn Fein that a future British Government  "would  be quite free to adopt a united Ireland" as its long-term policy  under the Downing Street Declaration and the Anglo-Irish  Agreement, provided it adhered to the requirement of majority  consent.    While welcoming this week's speech by the Northern  Secretary,  Sir Patrick Mayhew, favouring a role for new North-South  institutions, the Taoiseach insisted that now was the time when  "the republican movement needs to clarify more fully its own  attitudes to Northern Protestants and unionists."    He said he did not expect Sinn Fein to renounce violence and  make a definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration at  the ard-fheis but "it would be very welcome if they do." If  Sinn Fein could "clear up" where it stood on the right of the  protestant population in Northern Ireland not to have to accept  Irish unity, then "this would be a vital step...to trying to get  everybody into the political process...."    In a speech to the Association of European Journalists in  Dublin, the Taoiseach quoted from an article in the Republican  magazine, the Starry Plough, in January 1992, by Mr Mitchel  Mclaughlin of Sinn Fein where he stated: "The truth is that we  cannot and should not ever try to coerce the Protestant people  into a united Ireland."    But Mr McLaughlin had also acknowledged "an element among  republicans and others who secretly believed the Protestant  population could be coerced into accepting Irish unity and  independence." Mr McLaughlin had said that was "not acceptable,  and it was not possible, as Republicans should know better than  anyone...."    The Taoiseach said: "If that is Sinn Fein's policy, and I  believe it is, the implications of it need to be thought through  and debated.... A clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion  vis-a-vis those they regard as a national minority at the  ard-fheis would represent an immense step forward."    In an attempt to rebut republican critics of the  declaration,  the Taoiseach said there were still misunderstandings that  needed to be cleared up. "It is wrongly claimed that the  unionists have been given a veto on British Government policy in  the Joint Declaration. A future British Government would be  quite free to adopt a united Ireland as its long-term policy  aim, provided they adhered to the requirement of consent," which  was an obligation under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.    In answer to questions, the Taoiseach pointed out that the  one-time unionist veto on British policy had been "diluted along  the way. That kind of veto does not exist any more."    Mr Reynolds said it was "nonsense to suggest that in  embracing the peace process only republicans are being asked to  make sacrifices for peace. Unionists have to accept that the  constitutional future of Northern Ireland remains open and that  if there is to be real peace there has to be an agreement  between the people of Ireland, North and South, on one shared  future on this island."</p>

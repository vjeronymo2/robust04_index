			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings doubled at Hollinger EARNINGS at Hollinger, the international publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, more than doubled last year, thanks to proceeds from the sale of shares in the UK Telegraph group as well as improved operating results at its main subsidiaries. These gains more than offset losses early last year from the sale of a small minority interest in United Newspapers. Hollinger's earnings from continuing operations rose to CDollars 77m (USDollars 61m), or CDollars 1.19 a share, from CDollars 32m, or 32 cents, in 1991. Revenues climbed to CDollars 878m from CDollars 783m. Tax provisions jumped to CDollars 47m from CDollars 24m, reflecting the end of loss carryovers claimed by the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph group in the UK. Hollinger said operating results at all its leading subsidiaries improved during the fourth quarter and were well ahead of budget. Operating profits in the UK, consisting mainly of the Telegraph, rose to CDollars 111.5m from CDollars 90m. Equity earnings from John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which the Telegraph has a 15 per cent stake, climbed to CDollars 3m from CDollars 384,000. The Fairfax contribution has been adjusted to reflect Canadian accounting principles. Income from American Publishing, a group of more than 200 small US newspapers, rose to CDollars 26.4m from CDollars 21.5m. In Canada, where the company owns two chains of small newspapers, operating losses narrowed to CDollars 2.5m from CDollars 3.6m. Southam, meanwhile, Canada's biggest daily newspaper publisher in which Hollinger earlier this year acquired a 22.6 per cent stake, reported a 1992 loss of CDollars 262.9m or CDollars 4.28 a share against a deficit of Dollars 153.2m or Dollars 1.94 the previous year. Fourth-quarter losses were CDollars 76.9m or CDollars 1.21 a share against CDollars 114.3m or CDollars 1.94, agencies report from Toronto. The group, however, would have broken even if unusual items totalling CDollars 122.7m after tax and a provision of CDollars 140m related to discontinued operations had been excluded. The fourth-quarter loss included CDollars 90.9m in after-tax unusual items. Southam also said it plans to issue at least CDollars 100m in equity shortly to cut debt, and continue a programme of selling non-core or non-performing assets. Hollinger has proposed transferring half of its 22.6 per cent interest in Southam to the Telegraph.</p>

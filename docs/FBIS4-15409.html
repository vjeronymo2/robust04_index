			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has not concluded a single contract to  purchase grain from abroad since the beginning of this year,  Russian Vice Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha told a  conference of representatives of 55 regions who had come to a  wholesale fair in Sochi, Krasnodar territory. Zaveryukha said  Russia's current stocks of soft grain will last until the new  harvest, those of fodder for 1.5 years and those of rice and  other cereals for two years.    In 1993, Russia concluded contracts on the purchase of 16 Mn  tons of grain, while its imports totalled only 11 Mn tons the  same year. In 1992, Russia's grain purchases amounted to 26 Mn  tons.    At the same time, Zaveryukha called for stricter control  over  the use of stocks of grain and other food staples. In his  opinion, this is a task for a nation-wide network developed by  the World Bank, Russian Agriculture and Food Ministry and the  Finance Ministry which would store information about the current  state of the stocks, prices of the products and other data.</p>

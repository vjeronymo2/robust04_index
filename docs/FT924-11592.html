			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese brokers report first-half losses JAPAN'S leading securities houses reported losses for the first half, and Nomura Securities, the largest broker, also suffered a serious loss of face by falling behind Daiwa Securities for the first time. Brokers blamed their poor performance on the continuing weakness of prices and turnover on the Tokyo stock market, as well as a fall in underwriting fees and a halving of their financial revenue. The earnings figures would have been worse if all brokers had written off the losses on their securities holdings. In an attempt to encourage the market in August, the finance ministry allowed the houses to delay the write-off until the end of the fiscal year in March. Nomura, Daiwa, and Nikko Securities reported small pre-tax profits, while Daiwa reported zero after-tax profits and Nomura and Nikko had net losses. Yamaichi Securities, the final member of the Big Four, reported a pre-tax loss of Y19.3bn (Dollars 160m), up from a Y5.4bn loss last year, and an after-tax loss of Y15.8bn, up from Y3.8bn. All the brokers are forecasting improved results for the second half, but the renewed weakness of Tokyo prices in recent weeks has prompted companies to broaden their cost-cutting programmes, which include scaling down international operations and closing unprofitable domestic branches. The country's 10 second-tier brokers are under extreme pressure, with pre-tax losses ranging from Y3.8bn at Tokyo Securities to the Y18.9bn at New Japan Securities, which admitted that 'our revival plan was not strong enough for us to make a profit'. When the first half began, most brokers reckoned that the daily average trading volume in Tokyo would be around Y350bn, but the actual figure was Y258bn. Trading volumes have remained weak since the second half of this month, but brokers have based their full-year forecasts on an optimistic turnover figure of around Y350bn. Nomura said the stock market was weighed down by the worsening domestic economy and poor corporate earnings. The company reported a 39.6 per cent fall in stock brokerage commissions, and a 77.4 per cent fall in the total value of stocks underwritten by the company. These large declines were common throughout the industry, though there was an improvement in many brokers' bond dealings. Nomura reported a Y15.8bn profit on its trading in bonds, while the total amount of bonds underwritten fell 17.8 per cent on the same period last year. At Yamaichi, which has launched the deepest restructuring of the Big Four, the lack of enthusiasm among individual investors was seen in 28 per cent fall in commission income on investment trusts. Ordinary Japanese investors turned away from the market after the collapse of prices and a spate of stock scandals last year. Individuals have been net buyers so far this month, and the second-tier brokers, who are more dependent on individuals as customers, will be reliant on a continuing increase to improve their profits. But many second-tier companies have already conceded that it will be difficult to turn a profit this year, and New Japan forecast a pre-tax loss of Y19bn, an improvement on last year's loss of Y44bn. For the full year, Nomura expects a pre-tax profit of Y20bn, down 55 per cent, while Daiwa is expecting a pre-tax profit of Y12bn, up 29 per cent, and Nikko is forecasting a profit Y15bn, compared to Y3.1bn. Yamaichi is hoping for a pre-tax profit of Y1bn, compared to a loss of Y36.5bn last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST-HALF RESULTS, YBN (1991)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         NOMURA        DAIWA         NIKKO       YAMAICHI  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating income 178.6 (246.0) 133.2 (193.6) 118.7 (165.3)  97.6 (138.6)   commissions     94.7 (147.1)  70.6 (101.1)  66.4  (97.4)  61.5  (97.6)   profit on securities    dealings       36.0 (18.8)   22.8  (16.9)  18.3   (7.4)   8.5 (-13.6) Pre-tax profit    0.98 (39.7)   1.87  (20.6)  0.95  (12.0) -19.3  (-5.4) After-tax profit  -8.5 (18.1)    0.0  (10.8)  0.61   (1.2) -15.8  (-3.8)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Boardroom Shuffle - Theatre Christopher Warrick's Boardroom Shuffle begins with wine for the audience but fails to maintain this level of entertainment. The directors of the multi-billion ecu Satellite Energy Transfer Technology company are all set to cheerlead their shareholders and the press through a glossy annual general meeting when the company's head announces his resignation. Peter Blake (Jeremy Spriggs), has begun to believe in his corporate image - a nauseating creation of the company as family. He invites four candidates for the top job to take their pants down in public as part of a contest which appears to be based on Endurance, the Japanese game show of Clive James fame. The disintegration which follows is a provocative exploration of loyalty, treachery and ambition. Everyone, except the mysterious supercomputer, unveiled at the AGM, has at least one hidden shame and most have betrayed someone. The imaginatively chosen set, the yawning, glazed atrium of the Cotton's Centre in London's Tooley Street, is a challenge for the cast. The production opens with the members of the American Connexion theatre company, self-consciously in character, milling around making mad small talk with those who arrive early. It is a nice device and might have worked had the actors not been foiled by genuine city slickers passing by from nearby offices and stomping implacably through the props, looking much the madder of the groups. Gregg Ward's strong script is let down by some of the performances. However, Jeremy Spriggs is competent as the messianic inventor (to underline that point, he enters riding on a bicycle to the strains of the corporate hymn). Martin Chadwick (Keith Bayliss), the finance director, is all paternal complacency. It is his deeply antipathetic character, supported by greasy hair and square spectacles, which best expresses the potential tensions between the idea of loyalty to corporate profits and loyalty to life. Paula Mitchell (Meera Devon), as head of communications, captures something of the modern press officer. Parroting the weird patois of corporate literature, she knows how to smile with just the right degree of insincerity. She is amusing as the patient peon whose work is undermined by the stupidity of her boss. The pace of the production is patchy. There are compelling moments. One contestant for the top job is forced to reveal a personality disorder for which she was institutionalised. But the atmosphere moves through pathos to bathos as she discloses it was an addiction to sex. However, the production is slow to start and sags worryingly in the middle.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Dornemann tipped to lead Bertelsmann As QVC and Viacom hogged the financial headlines with their frenzied bidding for Paramount last year, Bertelsmann, the German media group, was winning frequent mentions as a would-be bidder, writes Michael Lindemann. The group has made no secret of its desire to take a stake in Hollywood, and with Michael Dornemann about to take over as head of the redesigned entertainments division, speculation is rife that Bertelsmann may finally step out of the sidelines. The sums being paid for Hollywood media properties have never fitted into Bertelsmann's conservative, family-owned philosophy. '(They) are completely absurd,' Dornemann was quoted as saying recently, explaining the group's reluctance to join the fight for Hollywood turf. But while outright purchases have not been ruled out, Dornemann prefers the idea of 'partnerships or mergers' where Bertelsmann could deploy its music and television expertise. Dornemann, whom sources tip as the successor to Mark Wossner, chief executive since 1981, moved into entertainment when he took over the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1987. Before that, he had masterminded the takeover of Doubleday and RCA, the record label, as chief strategist at the family-based company based in Gutersloh where it was founded in 1835. The 49-year-old from Frankfurt studied at the Technical University in Berlin before joining IBM in 1970. After seven years in computers, which included time at European headquarters in Paris, Dornemann tested the waters at BMW before moving to the Boston Consulting Group to run the Munich office for four years.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Japan's Daihatsu in Malaysian car joint venture MALAYSIA'S ambitious programme of industrialisation took a step forward yesterday with the signing of a joint venture deal between Malaysian and Japanese companies to build the country's second car plant. Daihatsu Motor Company of Japan will build a 660cc mini-car in partnership with three Malaysian partners and Mitsui, the Japanese industrial and trading conglomerate. The initial cost of the project is put at MDollars 400m (USDollars 153m). Malaysia already produces more than 100,000 Proton cars a year in a joint venture with Mitsubishi of Japan. Under the terms of the joint-venture agreement, Daihatsu will take a 20 per cent stake in the project, the local Daihatsu distributor 5 per cent and Mitsui, 7 per cent. The Malaysian partners are the state-owned Permodalan Nasional - which together with its listed subsidiary, UMW Holdings, will control 48 per cent  -and Med-Bumikar Mara, a newly-formed Malay-controlled company, which will have a 20 per cent stake. The new car, to be based on the existing Daihatsu Mira model, will be built at a plant now being constructed outside Kuala Lumpur. The first car is scheduled to roll off the assembly line in mid-1994. Initial production at the plant is put at 20,000 vehicles a year, subsequently rising to 45,000 units. As with the Proton, launched in the mid-1980s, the driving force behind the new car project is Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. However, many question the need for a second national car, particularly at a time when the Malaysian economy shows signs of slowing and sales of Protons in the highly-protected domestic market are falling. Dr Mahathir says the new car will provide a cheaper alternative to the Proton. A standard Proton now costs about MDollars 33,000 on the domestic market. Malaysian officials say that the new car will be given various tax incentives and protection - including exemption from duty of components imported from Japan - and will not cost more than MDollars 24,000. The future of the new car venture was in doubt for much of last year, apparently due to Daihatsu's insistence that its executives fill important management positions in the project. At a signing ceremony yesterday, Mr Takashi Toyozumi, Daihatsu's president, said his company was committed to transferring technology to its Malaysian joint-venture partners. Dr Mahathir is reported to have been dissatisfied at the slow rate of technology transfer from Japan in the Proton car venture.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Italian mini-budget gets accelerated passage THE Amato government's emergency economic package to cope with Italy's deteriorating finances yesterday passed its first parliamentary hurdle. The chamber of deputies agreed by 294 to 228 that the decree containing the economic measures could be accorded urgent status. The entire parliamentary passage for the mini-budget, raising an extra L30,000bn (Pounds 13.9bn), is now expected to be completed by next Wednesday, according to a timetable agreed by the 16 political parties. The government, headed by the Socialist prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, has a 16-seat majority with the backing of the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. In addition, the small Republican party yesterday decided to support it. The political parties have been remarkably muted since the budget was announced on July 17, even though traditional privileges of patronage in a slimmed-down state sector are under threat. In part, this reflects internal divisions within all the main parties. But Mr Amato also appears to be having some success in persuading them there is no viable alternative but to approve the package if Italy wishes to regain international credibility and improve its public finances. He has been backed by Mr Carlo Azelio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, who addressed parliament on Monday. The most visible opposition has come from the trade unions, whose leaders met Mr Amato and the government economic team yesterday. As a sop the government may cut the increase in social security contributions for salaried workers from 0.8 per cent to 0.6 per cent and modify proposals on ending controlled rents for the lower paid. But last Saturday the three main union confederations could only muster a crowd of 8,000 in Rome to protest against these. Confindustria, the employers confederation, whose representatives also met the government yesterday, is prepared to back the measures provided Mr Amato does not give ground to the unions which they are then asked to make up.

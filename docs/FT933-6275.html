			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK insurance Guardian Royal Exchange is the last of the UK composite insurers to take a tentative step towards direct selling. But it has taken the startling success of Direct Line, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, to stir the industry giants into action. Royal Insurance was first into the fray, but was careful to disguise the parentage of The Insurance Service for fear of backlash among insurance brokers. It is a sign of the now resigned attitude among brokers that Royal Northern, its second direct insurance venture, carries the parent company name. GRE should thus feel bold enough to use its own identity. While that might be useful, big insurers do not have much of a reputation for consumer marketing. Besides, it will take more than clever branding to catch Direct Line. Its competitive edge turns on an expense ratio well below that of the established competition and faster, more detailed analysis of risk. That will be matched only if the composites allow their direct subsidiaries freedom over pricing. Direct selling will never be more than an additional channel of distribution if prices are based on parent company expenses and claims experience. The reluctance of established insurers has also allowed Direct Line to build critical mass. That in itself is an advantage. Keeping telephonists and computer systems busy writing new business, rather than making uncompetitive quotes, contributes low expenses. Smaller rivals are some way from achieving such economies of scale.</p>

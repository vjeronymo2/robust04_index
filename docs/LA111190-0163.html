			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A FITTING PUNISHMENT  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council's revocation of the opening of Pomerado Road ("S.D.  Council Revokes Plan to Reopen Pomerado Road," Nov. 6) is petty and arrogant.  </P> <P> Too bad about extra traffic coming through Scripps Ranch. Every community in  greater San Diego has the same problem, but they don't fence off public  streets.  </P> <P> The city of San Diego and the council should be ashamed of being so  small-minded. I sentence all of them to two hours of nonstop driving on I-15 at  rush hour for at least six months.  </P> <P> CHARLOTTE B. GORDON, San Diego  </P></p>

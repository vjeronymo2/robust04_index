			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC press release No. PRES/94/2: "Communique by The </F> Presidency in The Name of The European Union on The Situation in  Azerbaijan"]    [Text] The European Union is deeply concerned at the fact  that large-scale fighting has been going on again in the  Nagorno-Karabakh region since mid-December.    It would request the opposing parties to display  self-control  and not inflict further suffering on a civilian population  already sorely tried by the war.    It reaffirms its support for the principle of the  territorial  integrity of Azerbaijan and calls for a peaceful solution to the  conflict. Given the danger of internationalization, which could  aggravate the situation, it would urge the parties concerned to  cease fighting and implement the relevant resolutions of the  United Nations security council.    The European Union requests the opposing parties to resume  current negotiations immediately under the aegis of the CSCE  Minsk group and fully backs those negotiations.</p>

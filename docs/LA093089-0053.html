			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: AN INTRIGUING 'BIRD OF YOUTH' WITH TAYLOR AND HARMON  </P> <P> "Sweet Bird of Youth" transfers to television Sunday as a worthy and  interesting character drama about desperate, self-corrupting people losing  their struggle to live.  </P> <P> Airing at 9 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39), this version, starring  Elizabeth Taylor and Mark Harmon, softens some of the passion and rawness of  Tennessee Williams' play. But writer Gavin Lambert and director Nicolas Roeg do  capture the despair, isolation and utter hopelessness of Williams' huddled  lost, who speak to us from the much-segregated South of the late 1950s.  </P> <P> The characters smell of inward decay. Flamboyant actress Alexandra Del Lago  (Taylor) and opportunistic drifter Chance Wayne (Harmon) come together at a  crossroads in their miserable lives, briefly merging their demons and their  dreams in St. Cloud, Fla., the small town that Chance fled years ago.  </P> <P> In flight herself from the realities of age and a fading career, Alexandra has  met and slept with the 30-ish Chance in Palm Beach after falling for his smile  and special back rubs. In a stupor from drugs and booze, she now accompanies  him back to St. Cloud, oblivious to his plans to exploit her and to the  hostility and potential violence awaiting them from ambitious political boss  Tom Finley (Rip Torn).  </P> <P> Harmon is credible and has the magnetism for Chance. But there's no danger in  his performance, and that hurts.  </P> <P> Taylor, however, performs grandly as Alexandra, who arrives in town beside  Chance in her leased fin-tail convertible with the top down, wearing a mink  coat and sipping from a flask that almost seems to be an extension of her hand.  </P> <P> Although stout, Taylor at first looks almost too smoothly beautiful and  youthful. Then comes the first close-up, when a network of thin lines appears  beneath her eyes, revealing the very aging erosion that terrifies Alexandra.  Watch for a wonderful scene when Alexandra, seeking security in her insecure  companion, leans back against Chance, all wistful and dreamy, almost melting  into his body. "By the time I was your age, I was already a legend," she says.  </P> <P> The legend blurs along with Chance's dreams, his hopes for resurrection dying  in St. Cloud as an old rendezvous with Finley's daughter (Cheryl Paris) comes  back to haunt him and ultimately costs him "the only thing you have to get by  on." Three guesses.  </P> <P> In the 1962 movie version of "Sweet Bird of Youth," which starred Torn's late  wife, Geraldine Page, and Paul Newman, the worst that the womanizing Chance had  to face was a broken nose. On Sunday, true to the play, something far more  extreme looms as a possibility.  </P> <P> In some ways, this adaptation is closer to the play than the movie was. In all  ways, it's good viewing.  </P></p>

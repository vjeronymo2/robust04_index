			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Foreign investors turn to US real estate Foreign investor confidence in US real estate has rebounded with Atlanta and Washington DC heading the list of most desirable cities for investment, according to a new survey. The findings, by the Association of Foreign Investors in US Real Estate (Afire), contrast sharply with reports that Japanese investors have been trying to off-load assets acquired in the 1980s buying spree. 'There have been rumours that the Japanese are trying to sell but no evidence of it,' said Mr James Fetgatter, chief executive of Afire, an organisation which represents about half the foreign investment in US real estate. 'Japanese investment has remained at the same level for the past four years.' Most of the new foreign investment in real estate is coming from Europe. The Afire survey found 46 per cent of respondents planning to increase US holdings, up 14 per cent from 1993. An equal number said they would maintain investment levels while 8 per cent said they would reduce their holdings Real estate investment trusts (REITS), which suffered widespread losses in the 1970s, have been making a comeback, according to the survey. Forty-five per cent of those surveyed indicated a willingness to invest in future REITs, up from 11 per cent last year. The results of the survey seem in line with industry experts' reports. Mr Randall Rowe of Equity Financial Management, a national office property company, said the overbuilt commercial property market was showing signs of recovery, particularly in Denver and Boston. 'In many cities this may be the last opportunity to lock in cheap space,' he said at a recent Afire conference. Mr Raymond Torton of Torto/Wheaton Research said office vacancy rates, now 16.3 per cent, would fall to no less than 12 per cent in 1995 and could drop to 3.1 per cent by 1999 without a return to overbuilding. Atlanta, which ran second in the Afire survey in 1993, was ranked as the most viable city for foreign real estate investment, followed by Washington, New York, Phoenix, and Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>

This document also establishes policy and procedure, assigns responsibilities, and delegates authority under the President's Five-Part Plan, ``A Program to Revitalize Base Closure Communities'', July 2, 1993. Because such guidance must be issued and effective to enable the Department to perform various acts required by the law to be accomplished by May 30, 1994, such guidance is being issued as an interim final rule and is effective upon publication.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This document is effective April 6, 1994.

Congressional legislation in 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510) provided for non-partisan Commissions to assess the closure recommendations of the Secretary of Defense, and make base closure and realignment recommendations to the President and the Congress. The bases recommended for closure and realignment by the 1988, 1991, 1993 Commissions were all approved under this process. Another Commission will meet in 1995. As a result of the 1988, 1991 and 1993 actions, the Department of Defense is now in the process of closing 70 major installations throughout the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even in large cities a military base often represents a major employment center and a significant economic stimulus for the local economy. With its multimillion dollar payrolls a base closure can be a serious blow to the local community. The Department of Defense recognizes that the manner in which real and personal property at closing bases is disposed of can have a dramatic impact on the local community's prospects for economic recovery. In the past, the traditional property disposal methods focused on maximizing proceeds from the sale of real and personal property with little regard for enhancing the prospects for economic recovery in the community. Recognizing that the old way of doing business was not designed to dispose of major military installations in a way that would revitalize base closure communities, President Clinton announced, on July 2, 1993, a major new program to speed the economic recovery of communities where military bases are slated to close. In a sharp departure from the past, the Clinton Administration pledged to give top priority to early reuse of the base's valuable assets. Rapid redevelopment and the creation of new jobs in base closure communities are the goals of the new initiative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In announcing the program, the President outlined the following five parts of his community reinvestment program: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Jobs-centered property disposal that puts local economic redevelopment first. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fast-track environmental cleanup that removes needless delays while protecting human health and the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Transition coordinators at major bases slated for closure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Easy access to transition and redevelopment help for workers and communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Larger economic development planning grants to base closure communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

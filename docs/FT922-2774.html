			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Defender of a fine British line - Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, talks to Robert Mauthner and David White Few members of the post-general election cabinet have settled in more quickly - or more comfortably - into their new jobs than Mr Malcolm Rifkind at the Ministry of Defence. Draped elegantly on the office sofa in his shirt sleeves, the Secretary of State gives the impression of having dealt with security and defence issues for most of his life. His relaxed manner, coupled with one of the most articulate intellects in Mr John Major's new team, are in sharp contrast to that of the bustling and somewhat less ordered Tom King, his immediate predecessor. If the Scottish Office, Mr Rifkind's last but one portfolio, was a thistle which even a native Scot sometimes found difficult to grasp, the MoD is not very different in character. Though it may not be quite the ministerial 'ejector seat' that its German equivalent is reputed to be, it can be something of a graveyard for political ambitions. Neither of Mr Rifkind's two predecessors, Mr King and Mr George Younger, have continued their ministerial careers. The new defence secretary was thrown in at the deep end. Opponents of army cuts seized on his appointment to fan speculation about plans to rescue some of the Scottish regiments, condemned by Mr King's rationalisation measures. But Mr Rifkind, in spite of his origins, seems determined not to reopen that emotional debate. Foreign mines also strewed his path. Hardly was he appointed, than Germany's doubts about the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) came to the boil, threatening the imminent break-up of the venture (Spain and Italy are the other partners). While recognising, 'as a fellow politician', the parliamentary pressures on the German government to withdraw from the project and making constructive cost-cutting suggestions, he has not hesitated to speak his mind on the consequences for European co-operation. 'I don't think it is possible for the German government, on the one hand to speak robustly about the desirability of a European defence dimension and European co-operation, and at the same time consider withdrawing from the single most important example of European defence collaboration that exists at the present time.' That is tough talk from the representative of a country which has not exactly distinguished itself by its enthusiasm for European collaborative projects in other fields, such as space research. Nor does Mr Rifkind appear at all put out by criticisms that Britain continues to be unduly 'Atlanticist' in its approach to European security problems. Though he undoubtedly sees himself as 'a good European', Mr Rifkind's views do not diverge an iota from the traditional British government line on defence. That is based on the hallowed proposition that, whatever steps are taken to deepen European defence co-operation, absolute priority must continue to be given to the preservation of Nato as the principal organisation responsible for Europe's defence. Only in this way can Washington's commitment to the defence of Europe be guaranteed. 'The US shares with all European countries a desire to see better European co-operation. There is no problem about the basic consideration of Europe getting its act together more effectively. The question is whether the practice of European co-operation is to strengthen the Atlantic alliance or ultimately to weaken it.' His main concern, Mr Rifkind went on, is not so much the view of the US Administration, but how the signals sent from Europe were interpreted by Congress and American public opinion as a whole. Any talk of a 'European army' is bound to alienate the sensitive people on Capitol Hill and lead to the very troop withdrawals that all America's European allies say they want to avoid. That said, Mr Rifkind is firm in his support of the British interpretation of the formula on a common European security and, eventually, defence policy, laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. The present furore over the future of the treaty in no way invalidates the objective of developing a European defence identity, he emphasises, because parallel decisions were taken in other western forums at about the same time. The decision to develop a European defence dimension via the Western European Union (nine-nation defence organisation, pre-dating Nato), for instance, was taken by the Rome Nato summit last November and was subsequently referred to in the Maastricht communique. 'But, actually, in the legal sense, it was an independent decision. It is precisely because the European Community does not have direct competence in defence matters that they do not directly relate to the Maastricht Treaty.' That is called killing two birds with one stone. In one short statement Mr Rifkind has proclaimed both Britain's commitment to greater European defence co-operation within Nato and its rejection of an independent EC defence organisation - even in the long run. The link that the French, and to some extent the Germans, believe should be established between the EC's institutions and the WEU is recognised by Mr Rifkind only in the broadest sense that both organisations 'are relevant to the development of common European interests'. He is quick to add, however, that 'there is no single authority which covers both. There is no legal binding relationship between the two nor any proposal that there should be so . . . the WEU itself takes its decisions with regard to its own development and possible role.' As for the practical measures required to give some substance to a new European defence identity, such as the provision of forces for possible WEU operations outside the Nato area, Mr Rifkind concedes, with a wry laugh, that they do tend to be rather 'confusing'. Britain's original idea of a European rapid reaction corps is basically using Nato forces in another guise - 'double hatting' in the deceptively jokey official jargon. This is very different from the French and German concept of a 'European corps'. Mr Rifkind does not oppose the Franco-German force in principle. It could be one of a whole number of forces made available to WEU. But he has strong reservations about the fact that it is made up of German forces which are assigned to Nato and French forces which do not come under Nato's integrated command. In short, he finds the German argument that the joint force will bring France closer to Nato, from whose military structure the French withdrew as long ago as 1966, less than convincing. 'As an aspiration, we can obviously see it as an attractive objective. But if that is the reason for the Franco-German corps, then it would have been the easiest thing in the world for the French government to make that clear,' Mr Rifkind proclaims. 'Will the relationship between the Franco-German corps and Nato be the same as the current German relationship (with Nato) or the current French relationship? It must be one or the other, and the indication so far is that the relationship would be closer to the current French than the current German one. If that is true - and I say, if - then clearly we would have to see the Franco-German corps as weakening Similar scepticism is displayed about the possibility of giving the new European defence identity a nuclear dimension, involving essentially nuclear co-operation between Britain and France. 'I cannot conceive a foreseeable future situation in which the use of nuclear forces did not point towards Nato responsibility. Obviously, we are not averse to a closer French involvement in Nato at any time, whether it be on nuclear or non-nuclear matters. Close co-operation between Britain and France on nuclear defence very much depends on France's ongoing relationship with Nato. In present circumstances, I think the French would rule it out.' The British litmus test for European defence co-operation has thus been forcefully restated by Mr Rifkind. It is likely to be modified only if the US itself has a fundamental change of heart about its commitment to Europe. PERSONAL FILE 1946 Born Edinburgh.

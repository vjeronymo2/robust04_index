			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 7, IRNA -- Former Saudi Arabian  diplomat, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Khalawi says he is adding his  voice to a growing number of moderate, educated Saudi  intellectuals, who can no longer tolerate the abuses of power by  the present regime in Riyadh.    This voice, he declares, will not be stilled by bribery or  character assassination, nor stifled by threats, from stating  its legitimate demands to ensure that political freedom and best  interests of the peace-loving people of Saudi Arabia are  recognized.    Al-Khalawi defected from being the first secretary at the  Saudi mission to the United Nations in New York after writing a  letter to heir apparent [Crown Prince] 'Abdallah last month  stipulating his "sincere opposition" to the Riyadh government.  He laid out that he opposed policies based upon family  favoritism, corruption and the purposeful incitement of hatred  among various social and sectarian groups, which he said, were  to divide and weaken the social fabric of the Saudi people. In  addition, he spoke against steps taken taken by the regime in  the international arena that involved itself in "wars and  enmities with Muslim countries, both Arab and non-Arab" and  entering into nuclear arrangements without necessary legal  guarantees.    The former Saudi diplomat has since sought political asylum  in the United States and made known his views to the Committee  for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia (CDLR),  which moved its office to London in April this year.    His defection is the first from a senior political figure  and  is seen as a coup for the committee, set up last year by a group  of Saudi academics calling for moderate reforms to the  autocratic rule of the royal family. In a letter to the CDLR,  al-Khalawi suggested that he had been subjected to a kidnap  attempt and a visit from Saudi intelligence since writing the  letter. He said that he was first made an offer to buy his  silence before threats were made to his life and those of his  close family both in New York and in Saudi Arabia. The governor  of Riyadh, Prince Salman, is also understood to have asked his  relatives to bring him back from the U.S. or failing this, to  stay in exile themselves.    The former diplomat said he also has proof of the severe  violations of human rights that have been going on in Saudi  Arabia from almost 14,000 secret documents he collected while  being first secretary at the United Nations for the past four  years. His letter to the heir apparent set forth demands for  the elimination of such wrongdoings, which he said he could no  longer tolerate.</p>

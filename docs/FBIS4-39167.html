			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev: On 2 June, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  signed a directive "On providing the formation of Ukraine's food  resources with finances and credits."    In Ukrainian Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy Karasyk's  words, a large group of professionals, who include National Bank  of Ukraine board chairman Viktor Yushchenko, has been engaged to  draft this directive.    The directive deals with a new source of credits, which is  10  percent of the credit resources that are available to commercial  banks and that are to be sold by them to the National Bank of  Ukraine to provide payments in advance and credits for the  agrarian sector. The economic mechanisms contained in this  provision should be of interest to commercial banks as the  directive rules that the taxes payable by the banks on credits  in the event of their sale to the National Bank of Ukraine are  to be cut from 55 to 11 percent.    The directive also makes provision for the return of  stabilization funds rather than adopting a money-printing  approach to the allocation of funds providing credits for  agriculture.    The directive also contains the following mechanism for  payments to be made by the trading organizations to the  agricultural producers: Upon the expiry of three days following  a sale, a penalty to the amount of three percent of the sum  outstanding is charged daily. There is a term of 15 days for  credits to be issued to trading organizations for them to pay in  advance for agricultural produce. The directive instructs the  Cabinet of Ministers to devise a pricing mechanism by 1 July.    In Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this provision in the directive is  very important as agriculture is owed 12 trillion karbovantsi by  the army, prison services, and trading organizations, with the  debt of the latter to the countryside amounting to 4 trillion  karbovantsi. This clause in the directive also enables city and  town state administrations, goods manufacturers and trading  organizations to work without waiting for the government."    However, in Yuriy Karasyk's view, "this is a once only  directive. In the transitional period, no legislative basis has  been created yet so the president has said the word for the  Supreme Council not to be `firemen'."    In the minister's opinion, there will be no confrontation  between the Supreme Council and the president because the  directive takes account of proposals by Ukrainian people's  deputies.</p>

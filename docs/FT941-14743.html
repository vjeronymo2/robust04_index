			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Car sales forecast to surge in 1990s Car sales will be boosted strongly during the 1990s by an increase in the total of single-person households and the numbers of cars per household, a MORI poll of more than 1,700 motorists indicates. Motorists' buying intentions over the next two years, examined by MORI as part of its research for the annual Lex Report on Motoring, indicate a relatively quick return to annual sales of more than 2m cars last seen at the end of the 1980s. The record of 2.3m car sales in 1989 may be broken by the end of the decade. After 1989 the UK market underwent its steepest postwar recession, plunging to 1.59m within two years. It recovered more strongly than expected last year to 1.78m. Lex Service, the vehicle importer and distributor that controls more than 100 dealers in the UK, yesterday launched its annual report by predicting growth to 1.9m sales this year. MORI's findings reinforce a belief at Lex that this year's recovery could again outpace expectations to reach sales of 2m. MORI's research found that, for the first time in three years, surveyed drivers expected the number of cars in their households to rise. Some 40 per cent of households currently have more than one car. If MORI's research is borne out, the average will rise from 1.54 cars per household now to 1.6 in two years time. When the increase in the number of households is included, there is the potential for 700,000 extra sales per year on top of 1.5m replacement car sales. The report finds little evidence of a shift away from company cars as a result of the tax changes due on April 6. Lex Report on Motoring: The Consumer View.

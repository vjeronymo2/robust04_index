			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CITY OF INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> GOLF INJURY CLAIM FILED  </P> <P> Diamond Bar Councilman Gary Werner is asking the City of Industry to pay him  for damages he suffered when a golf ball ricocheted off a metal railing and hit  him in the eye.  </P> <P> The accident occurred July 6 when Werner was practicing hitting golf balls at  the Industry Hills Golf Course Driving Range. He was rushed by paramedics to  Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, where he underwent surgery and  received 21 stitches.  </P> <P> Although most of the railing is covered with mesh to absorb the impact of stray  golf balls, Werner said, "at the very end of the range, where I was, there was  no mesh screen. It was negligence on the city's part."  </P> <P> Werner's attorney, Marc Lebovitz, has filed a claim with the City of Industry  asking that Werner be compensated for hospital expenses, potential plastic  surgery and lost wages. Lebovitz said he hadn't calculated the total monetary  amount but said in the claim it may exceed $100,000.  </P> <P> Industry City Atty. Graham Ritchie was unavailable for comment Wednesday.  </P></p>

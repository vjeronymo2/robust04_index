			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Shake-up planned for defence homes The Ministry of Defence is to set up a new tri-service executive to manage its married quarters' estate of some 68,000 homes, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced yesterday. The new body - the Defence Housing Executive - will assume responsibility for the estate from April. It is currently managed on single-service lines. Mr Rifkind said the body would be established in the first instance as a budgetary unit within the MoD 'but with a remit to move towards autonomous operation as a likely candidate for . . . privatisation in due course'. The MoD faces a Pounds 500m gap in its budget next year if it cannot find a way of transferring the estate to the private sector. The ministry last month appointed NatWest Markets to advise on new options for privatisation. MoD officials said yesterday the executive would be 'a short-term arrangement while we continue to work towards privatisation proper'.</p>

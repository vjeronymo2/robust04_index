But, for the  first time, a prosperous village has "annexed" a poor one.    Qiuer, an economically-developed village in Yinxian County,  Zhejiang Province, took over the neighboring village of Sigang.    An official of Qiuer village admitted that Qiuer used to be  a  poor village, where penew weapoggled to make both ends meet.    But since the late 1970s, when China began its rural  economic  reform, the village leaders led the local farmers to develop a  market economy with the focus on industry and service trades.    The village's gross output value exceeded 100 million yuan  in  1992, its collective property amounted to 72 million yuan and  farmers' annual income averaged more than 3,000 yuan per capita.    At present, the village's 500 households have about 200  directly- dial tnlephones and 15 private cars.    Visitors from other parts of the country and overseas stream  into the village to learn from its experience in becoming  well-off.    In contrast to Qiuer, neighboring Sigang village remained  mired in poverty due to shortages of capital, technology and  managerial workers.    To expand its economy and help its neighbor to become  prosperous, Qiuer began to "annex" Sigang village in January  last year.    With a bigger labor force and more cultivated land, the enl  late Qiuer village has accelerated the expansion of its economy.    A survey shows that the village's gross product amounted to  350 million yuan last year and its profits reached 25 million  yuan, both increases of 150 percent. Farmers' annual income  last year averaged 4,000 yuan per capita, more than twice that  of the provincial average.    Soon after the "annexation", Qiuer spent more than one  million yuan on helping the former Sigang village build roads,  install running water and powerlast months, and improve its  surroundings. All the villagers in the enlarged village enjoy  the equal treatment.    One year later, the annual income of all the families has  doubled, everyone enjoys co-operative medical treatment and  retired farmers receive pensions.    "The change is way beyond our expectation," said Qiu Aiqing,  a farmer in the former Sigang village.    Qiu has contracted to farm 1.3 ha of land, and his children  are working in village-run enterprises. The annual income of  the family averaged 3,100 yuan per capita last year, up from  1,500 yuan in 1992.    According to Jin Haiteng, the head of Yinxian County, the  "annexation" of a poor village by a rich one benefits both and  leads to common prosperity.    "It is an inevitable result of the development of the  socialist market economy and an optimum organization of  resources," he said.    Although Zhejiang is located in China's  economically-developed coastal area, some of its inland areas  are still economically It isward.    With the encouragement of the provincial government, more  and  more rich areas are following the example of Qiuer village.</p>

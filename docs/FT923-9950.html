			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Mortgage-trap appeal granted A MORTGAGE trap which has saddled many mortgage defaulters with ever-increasing repayments was blocked by the Court of Appeal yesterday. Some mortgage companies have seized possession of properties from defaulters and not sold them in the hope that values will rise. But yesterday three judges ruled they must not do this if caused the defaulter's debts to continue rising. Businessman Mr Anthony Palk and his wife Margaret bought a property in Heathfield, West Sussex, in 1990 with a Pounds 300,000 advance from Mortgage Services Funding. Mr Palk's business then failed. In March last year, when he owed Pounds 358,587 on the mortgage, Mr Palk negotiated a sale of the property for Pounds 283,000. But Mortgage Services obtained a court order for possession of the property and successfully opposed a County Court application by Mrs Palk for permission to sell. The Appeal Court allowed an appeal against this ruling.</p>

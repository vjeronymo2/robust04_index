			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Yardsticks made to measure - Haig Simonian considers the issues surrounding green indicators Indicators, like the statistics that underpin them, may not lie. But like statistics, indicators can be used to support a variety of arguments. Hence the debate rekindled last week after seven UK environmental groups unveiled new indicators to illustrate the state of the environment. The conclusion from 10 of the measures, which will be published as an annual 'Green Gauge' of environmental trends  - painted a bleak picture of rising pollution and biodiversity under threat. But while the Green Gauge was designed to grab headlines, the wider set of 46 environmental yardsticks on which it is based* has spotlighted the broader question of the suitability of indicators to track environmental performance. The issue is not limited to a coterie of statisticians or theoretical mathematicians. As concern about the environment and sustainable development grows, attention is moving to the validity of traditional measures of economic well-being, such as gross national product, to assess a country's 'true' quality of life. Part of the debate, conducted by august international institutions such as the World Bank and the US Department of Commerce, involves arcane arguments about adjusting national accounts to reflect green concerns. But the issue has also entered the broader political arena. In July, Britain's Labour party committed itself to introducing adjusted national accounting in a landmark report on the environment. The use of environmental indicators forms an important, and more accessible, part of the debate than fine-tuning national accounts. How valid are statistics about, say, animal numbers, in tracking a nation's environmental well-being? And how carefully should such information be used if the underlying data are only partial? Alex MacGillivray, the economist who co-ordinated the study on which the Green Gauge is based, is bullish. But his research revealed many contradictions. While there is no lack of data on the British environment (the report talks of an 'information overload'), much of the material was unusable because it was either too specific or covered an insufficient time-span. The work also exposed differences in the academic community about the applicability of environmental yardsticks. Many specialised departments and international bodies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have concentrated on choosing measures that meet strict statistical criteria. On the other hand, non-governmental agencies, such as the pressure groups that sponsored the Green Gauge, are as interested in finding indicators that will strike a chord among the general public. In the new study, availability, frequency and international comparability of data emerge as three of the most desirable criteria to determine good environmental indicators. The 'quality' of the indicator is an essential fourth, says MacGillivray. That means preferring a measure, such as the standard of a country's bathing water, that also gives an insight into other environmental factors such as river pollution and sewage discharges, over narrower indicators. International comparability, however, is the environmentalist's Achilles heel. Since 1990, the OECD has been at the forefront of work on comparable indices. Recently, it published a set of core indices covering 13 environmental issues, such as waste, urban environmental quality and soil degradation. It warned, however, that much of the national data on which it had drawn should be treated with caution. Canada and the US have set an example in measuring environmental data. Environment Canada, the ministry responsible in Ottawa, was among the first to produce indices in the early 1990s. After publishing an initial 700-page tome, it now also produces shorter, more readable updates on the indices it tracks. In the US, two cities, Seattle and Jacksonville, Florida, have made names for themselves for their environmental initiatives. In Seattle, citizens were asked to select the green yardsticks that best reflected their perceptions of environmental quality. The quantity of salmon in local rivers and the number of days residents could see the coastal mountains through the urban smog were favourites. But it is a somewhat different approach that may affect most Europeans. The Netherlands government, a pioneer of environmental indices, monitors a range of environmental pressures. These are given different weightings to produce a single measure of the Netherlands' environmental performance. Critics say the Dutch method is simplistic since no single figure can sum up so many factors. Its supporters argue that the approach has the advantage of immediate public 'resonance'. The dispute should be worth following as the Dutch system appears likely to be adopted by the European Commission, which has just started a project on developing European environmental pressure indices. While specialists are beavering away on new indicators, most shy away from the much more sensitive issue of setting targets. Yet most environmentalists argue that indicators in themselves are of little value if not combined with specific targets to show how a country's environmental policies are helping, or failing, to meet popular demands. Targets could also prove useful to business  - usually at the sharp end of lobbying from green pressure groups  - to help set yardsticks for environmental performance. If there were visible signs of progress, industry could also help rid itself of its image of environmental neglect. Targets, of course, remain prescriptive, and highly contentious as a result. It will be some time before agreement can be reached on the principle of targets, let alone where they should be. In the meantime, the environmentalists believe that creating standardised environmental indicators is a small, but significant, step in the right direction. *Environmental Measures: Indicators for the UK Environment.

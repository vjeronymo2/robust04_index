			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Key is not to produce less - but differently / Exploring the meaning of sustainable development and the difficulties of putting this idea into practice How could anyone be in favour of 'unsustainable development'? It would be like favouring matricide, the victim being Mother Earth. Yet what precisely is 'sustainable development'? Sustainable development, says the World Commission on Environment and Development, consists of 'forms of progress which meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs'. That does not make one wiser. Try this, instead: '. . . In the end, sustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional change are made consistent with future as well as present needs.' This is merely wordier. What, above all, are future needs? Citizens of rich countries would number among them a standard of living at least as high as that enjoyed today. To most of the world's poor that would be no more related to 'need' than is a Rolls-Royce motor car to cost-effective transportation. Fundamentalist environmentalists, who often advocate something like the medieval manorial economy, would agree. How then can the concept of 'sustainable development' be made operational? One way is to recommend that the capital stock be maintained. More narrowly still, it is suggested that not the total capital stock, but the stock of natural resources alone should be maintained. The reason for this restriction is evident. How many miles of road are worth one rhinoceros? Among the rules suggested for use of the natural capital stock is that there should be 'no net losses', meaning that any natural resources should be replaced. Another is 'assume the worst': any action affecting the environment is guilty, unless proved innocent. Yet how many acres of wetlands compensate for a forest? Is a glamorous species on the savanna worth two obscure ones in the rain forest? Unless one advocates the impossible - actions that have no deleterious effect on any ecosystem - the commandment that natural capital must be preserved takes one little further. The World Commission asserts that sustainable development, 'with its concern for the needs of people today and tomorrow, is ultimately a moral and ethical issue'. But that is all it appears to be. It is not a policy. Nevertheless, one thought is buried within it: that the globe's ecosystems have limited carrying capacity. The idea has intuitive appeal. Over the last generation gross global product (GGP) has been growing at more than 3 per cent a year. At that rate, GGP would be 1,600 times greater 250 years from now. Either growth would have ceased long before, or the composition of output would be so different as to be incomparable. Just contrast today's output with that of 1742. This notion is the basis for the relative optimism of the World Bank's World Development Report on Development and the Environment. 'The key to growing sustainably is not to produce less,' it opines, 'but to produce differently.' The report argues that there is no linear relationship between economic activity and environmental damage. On the contrary, the emission of many important pollutants has declined with development. This may not be true of municipal waste and carbon dioxide emissions, which have continued to rise with income. But that, suggests the report, is because there have been no incentives for changed behaviour. The World Bank asserts that the link between economic growth and the environment depends on four factors: structure: the goods and services produced; efficiency: the quantity of inputs per unit of output; substitution: the ability to substitute for scarce resources; and technology and management: the environmental damage per unit of input or output. The report also offers a strategy for 'sustainable development', defining that term as 'development that lasts'. This has three elements: build on the positive links: many policies that promote growth - appropriate energy prices, for example - will also improve the environment; break the negative links: introduce appropriate incentives and disincentives; and clarify and manage uncertain links: where the consequences of human activity are unknown, the response should be the search for further information, combined with precautionary measures. How can sustaining the natural environment or, where possible, improving it be made consistent with development? The problem is market failure, the way people can ignore the environment in their economic decisions. The solution is to introduce environmental incentives. Unfortunately, this conclusion is more easily written than implemented. First, the use of non-marketed, but scarce resources, has to be reflected in corporate and national accounts. Second, rational incentives to improve the environment have to be introduced against entrenched vested interests. Third, many important environmental goods (and bads) - species diversity, the composition of the atmosphere, the number of children people have - cannot be property. Others, like rain forests, are difficult to protect. Polluters should pay. But how much? And who will make them? Fourth, turning hitherto 'free' goods into property or taxing their use redistributes wealth, sometimes massively. Equally intractable distributional questions arise when valuing the welfare of future generations against that of those living now. Finally, some problems run across frontiers. A few affect everyone. Establishing, enforcing and distributing rights to pollute across countries is vastly more difficult than doing that within them. Nothing raises more difficulties than global warming. Both the size of the threat and its potential economic costs are uncertain; the costs of lower emissions for important interests would be large; the atmosphere is not appropriable; emissions can only be monitored with difficulty; the way in which rights to emit carbon dioxide are allocated would affect the international distribution of income; and overall reductions in emissions would influence inter-generational income distribution as well. No wonder, developing countries argue that the rich countries want them to stay poor, merely so that they themselves can continue their profligacy. No wonder, too, that developing countries believe they now have goods to offer  -more trees, more species, less carbon-dioxide - that the rich want still more than they do. Rio is just a start to the hard bargaining ahead. If environmental market failure is, in fact, as great a problem as many now believe, a world as divided as ours seems unlikely to deliver a solution.</p>

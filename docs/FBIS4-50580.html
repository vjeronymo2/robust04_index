			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- Interim Provisions for  the Financial Control of Foreign Exchange To Be Used for  Nontrade and Nonoperational Purposes:    Article 1. These provisions are formulated to strengthen the  financial control over the budgetary buying of foreign exchange  for nontrade and nonoperational purposes.    Article 2. Foreign exchange needed by various offices,  undertakings, and mass organizations for nontrade and  nonoperational purposes within their budget will be bought with  renminbi on a limited basis.    Article 3. The limit for buying foreign exchange with  renminbi will be authorized in a unified manner by the financial  departments. The Bank of China (including its branches --  similarly hereinafter) will open accounts for units using  foreign exchange according to the amount of foreign exchange  authorized by the financial departments and will supervise their  use. At the end of the year, the account balance will be  automatically erased by the bank.    Article 4. The kinds of budgetary use of foreign exchange  for nontrade and nonoperational purposes include the following:    (1) Foreign exchange for regular and advanced studies abroad  with public funds.    (2) Foreign exchange for paying annual fees, share fees, and  funds to international organizations.    (3) Foreign exchange for foreign aid, international  assistance, and donations.    (4) Foreign exchange for initial and regular expenditures of  government organizations, embassies and consulates, and offices  set up by social organizations abroad.    (5) Foreign exchange for hiring foreign experts.    (6) Foreign exchange for short-term official visits and  inspections abroad; holding exhibitions and study and training  classes; and attending international conferences.    (7) Foreign exchange for going on pilgrimages abroad.    (8) Foreign exchange for external propaganda.    (9) Foreign exchange for other approved budgetary uses.    Article 5. Procedures for the purchase of foreign exchange:    (1) Various purchasing units should present an "application  form for a nontrade foreign exchange purchase" and a renminbi  check to the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange  according to the exchange rate on that same day within the  authorized limits.    (2) The Bank of China will sell foreign exchange to  purchasers within the approved limit after checking their  "application form for a nontrade foreign exchange purchase,"  their seals for their accounts, and their exact figures of  foreign exchange.    (3) Units in need of foreign exchange cannot purchase  foreign exchange in excess of their authorized limit, and the  Bank of China must not sell foreign exchange in excess of the  authorized limit.    Article 6. Various central units should forward reports on  their yearly plan for using renminbi to purchase foreign  exchange for those purposes to the Finance Ministry. Various  local units should forward reports on their yearly plan for  using renminbi to purchase foreign exchange to local financial  departments (bureaus), which will submit those reports to the  Finance Ministry. After balancing the overall requirement for  foreign exchange, the Finance Ministry will decide the quotas of  foreign exchange for various central units and tell the Bank of  China to establish limits in the accounts of those central units  on a quarterly basis. The quotas of foreign exchange to be  purchased by various locales will also be decided by the Finance  Ministry, which will allocate foreign exchange limits to finance  departments of various locales on a quarterly basis through the  Bank of China.    Article 7. The financial and accounting departments should  examine the "application form for purchasing foreign exchange by  departing delegations or groups (personnel)" submitted by  delegations or groups for impromptu official visits to foreign  countries in a strict manner according to the standard for  expenditures set by the Finance and Foreign Ministries. Those  delegations or groups should submit their accounting within 10  days of their return to China and should forward "notes for  returning nontrade foreign exchange" to the Bank of China  concerning their unused foreign exchange. The Bank of China  will add the amount of the renminbi limit to their accounting on  foreign exchange authorization according to those notes.    Article 8. Various foreign exchange purchasing units should  forward a "(combined) statistical report on the state of using  renminbi to purchase foreign exchange for nontrade purposes" and  a "(combined) statistical report on the status of the authorized  limit for purchasing foreign exchange with renminbi" to  financial departments at the same level within five days of the  end of each quarter.    Article 9. All documents and forms should be printed by the  Finance Ministry. Financial and accounting departments should  establish and perfect procedures for examining expense accounts  of various units concerning the use of foreign exchange.    Article 10. "Certificates for using foreign exchange to buy  airline tickets and to transport cargoes (the `three-slip')" and  the reward system for saving foreign exchange by nontrade units  shall be rescinded. The "circular on handling the procurement  of airline tickets for international trips by central units,"  the "provisional procedures for awarding the saving of foreign  exchange for nontrade purposes," and the "procedures for  retaining a portion of foreign exchange for nontrade purposes"  issued by the Finance Ministry shall be rescinded simultaneously.    Article 11. The Finance Ministry is responsible for  explaining these regulations.    Article 12. These regulations shall come into force on 1  April 1994.    [Signed] Finance Ministry    [Dated] 29 March 1993 [as received]</p>

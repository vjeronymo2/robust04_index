			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreigners may buy up to SKr30bn of stock BETWEEN SKr20bn (Dollars 3.6bn) and SKr30bn net of Swedish corporate stock is likely to be bought by foreign investors in 1992, according to estimates by the country's shareholders' association. This is the expected result of a change in Swedish law which came into force this week, enabling foreigners to buy without prior government permission an unlimited number of Swedish shares. Under legislation enacted in 1916 foreigners were not allowed to acquire voting shares or equity in Swedish companies without permission from the public authorities every time the purchase exceeded 10, 20, 40 or 50 per cent of the company's shares. The reform promises to increase foreign interest in Swedish shares. This will be helped by the sell-off of Swedish state-owned companies due to start this year. The reform, however, does not mean the end of the country's two tier system of free and restricted A and B shares. These enable Swedish shareholders - such as the powerful Wallenberg dynasty - to maintain control of companies by owning a substantial slice of the voting shares but only a small portion of the total equity. Any change must await agreement on European Community company law.</p>

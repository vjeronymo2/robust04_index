			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS CLINCH PLAYOFF BYE WITH 24-21 WIN;  </P> <P> NFC: HOSTETLER MAKES FIRST START THIS SEASON IN PLACE OF SIMMS AND BEATS  CARDINALS FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE TIME.  </P> <P> Jeff Hostetler has not played much in his seven seasons in the NFL, but the New  York Giants' backup quarterback has made a career out of beating the Phoenix  Cardinals.  </P> <P> In his first start this season on Sunday, Hostetler passed for 190 yards and  scored the go-ahead touchdown on a four-yard run in the Giants' 24-21 victory  over the Cardinals.  </P> <P> The victory gave the NFC East champion Giants (12-3) a first-round bye in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "We got what we wanted. I'll take 12 wins in this league any time," Giant Coach  Bill Parcells said. "Hostetler did a good job. He played error-free and made  good decisions on the field.  </P> <P> "We got a good lead, but then we gave the Cardinals some momentum and allowed  them to come back on us. It looked like they were going to win it at one  point."  </P> <P> Hostetler, who completed 13 of 23 passes and rushed nine times for 31 yards,  has beaten Phoenix three times in relief of Phil Simms -- including 20-13 last  season at Phoenix and 20-19 on Oct. 21 at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P> <P> Simms is sidelined with a severely sprained right foot, sustained in a loss to  Buffalo on Dec. 15.  </P> <P> "I just told myself to relax and play my game," said Hostetler, who had only 14  quarters of NFL experience before Sunday. "I was rusty a little bit, but I got  more confidence as the game went on.  </P> <P> "The guys responded well to me and I think they have confidence in me."  </P> <P> It was the Cardinals' fifth consecutive loss to the Giants and eliminated  Phoenix (5-10) from wild-card playoff contention despite a career-high passing  day by Timm Rosenbach.  </P> <P> Rosenbach completed 23 of 41 passes for 381 yards and brought Phoenix within  24-21 on his third touchdown pass, a three-yarder to rookie Ricky Proehl with  2:09 left.  </P> <P> Proehl recovered the ensuing onside kick at the Cardinal 43. Rosenbach drove  his team to the New York 40 but they got no closer.  </P> <P> A holding penalty and Lawrence Taylor's sack for an eight-yard loss brought the  ball back to the Giants' 42, and New York took over after a fourth-down  incompletion with 52 seconds to play.  </P> <P> "The Giants are the class of the East," Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel said. "We  wanted to battle them and see what would happen.  </P> <P> "We laid it all on the field today and came up a little short with a couple of  critical errors. We have to find a way to win games like this one of these  days."  </P> <P> Hostetler put New York ahead17-7 when he connected with Mark Ingram on a  44-yard touchdown pass play with 7:31 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> The Cardinals closed to within 17-14 just 22 seconds later when Ernie Jones  turned a swing pass from Rosenbach into a 68-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> It was the longest completion of Rosenbach's two-year NFL career and the  longest play from scrimmage allowed by the Giants this season.  </P> <P> Phoenix appeared ready to take the lead, but reserve running back Terrence  Flagler dropped a third-down pass at the New York five and Al Del Greco was  wide left on a 30-yard field-goal attempt with 1:50 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Everson Walls returned his 50th career interception seven yards to the New York  37 to set up Hostetler's four-yard scoring run on a broken play for a 24-14  lead with 8:58 remaining.  </P> <P> Dave Duerson's end zone interception with 4:34 left on a first-and-goal play  from the New York nine-yard line ended another Cardinal threat.  </P> <P> "Timm was trying to throw the ball away, but he didn't get it high enough,"  Bugel said. "I told him the next time, give the fans in the stands a souvenir.  He's young and still learning."  </P> <P> The Giants built a 10-0 lead on Matt Bahr's 27-yard field goal with 46 seconds  remaining in the first quarter and Rodney Hampton's two-yard touchdown with  3:15 left in the first half that capped a 78-yard drive.  </P> <P> Phoenix cut its halftime deficit to 10-7 on an 11-yard scoring pass from  Rosenbach to Flagler with 45 seconds left.  </P> <P> Bahr was short on a 48-yard field-goal attempt on the half's final play. Del  Greco was short on a 47-yard try early in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Johnny Johnson gained 50 yards in 15 carries for the Cardinals.  </P></p>

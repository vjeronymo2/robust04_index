Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the Act (section 327(a)&hyph;(c)). Exceptions to this general rule include the following: (1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remain in effect until the applicable energy conservation standard begins (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard (section 327(b)(2) and (e)) and certain building code requirements for new construction, if certain criteria are met, are exempt from Federal preemption (sections 327(b)(3) and (f)(1)&hyph;f(4)); (3) State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters; and (4) State standards for television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal standard for such products (sections 327(b)(6) and (c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act directs DOE to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in advance of DOE consideration of prescribing a new or amended standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Advance Notice to which this is a supplement, the Department indicated its intention more explicitly to consider environmental and energy security externalities associated with alternative energy efficiency standards. The Department also noted that it would attempt to establish monetary values for externalities if a sound analytical basis could be found for doing so. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  If the Department finds that a sound analytical basis exists, externalities may be incorporated in its analysis of the net national benefits of alternative levels for the appliance efficiency standards covered by this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products, Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Three Types of Consumer Products, 58 FR 47326, 47333, September 8, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Externalities arise when the production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or confers benefits on members of society external to the transaction that are not reflected in market prices. Environmental externalities reflect the net national reductions in the adverse health effects or other damages associated with a reduction in emissions of pollutants due to reductions in energy use as appliance efficiency is increased. Energy security externalities reflect the net national reductions in energy security vulnerability associated with reduced reliance on external energy sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many comments received in response to an earlier ANOPR in the appliance standards program <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>  indicated a high level of public interest in this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products; Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Energy Conservation Standards for Nine Types of Consumer Products, 55 FR 39624, September 28, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) suggested that DOE account explicitly for environmental costs in its economic analysis. (ACEEE, No. 6 at 6). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In addition, Public Citizen stated that the Department should include in its analyses all external costs and benefits, e.g., environmental quality, national security, and reduced energy imports. (Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the Appliance Standards rulemaking record, comments are assigned docket numbers; the second number represents the page number from the submittal where the issue discussed may be found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis'' and ``Life Cycle Cost Analysis'' is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis: (a) Environmental external costs; and (b) national security and balance of payments costs of increased/decreased oil consumption. (Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Ohio Office of the Consumers Council (OOCC) said that the consumer and utility analyses should include monetization of externalities (environmental and security). Environmental externalities include sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current trends in state utility regulations. (OOCC, No. 60 at 2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recognizing that the specification of monetary values for such environmental and energy security externalities is a complex analytical effort, the Department is now supplementing its original Advance Notice for the three-product rulemaking. This supplement provides an indication of the Department's intent in this area, identifies a range of specific issues for public comment, and solicits identification of additional relevant issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated in the 1993 Advance Notice, the Department will attempt to develop analytically sound estimates of the values of energy and environmental externalities. Provided that such values can be calculated, the Department intends to use them in the analyses supporting the proposed and final rules establishing the standards for the products covered by this notice. Estimates of such externalities would be considered in conjunction with the estimates of the total net national benefits (or costs) of the standard, rather than in the analysis of consumer life-cycle costs. The life-cycle cost analysis is intended to estimate the actual cost impacts on consumers. So long as externalities are not internalized, individual consumers would not incur these benefits (or costs) directly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

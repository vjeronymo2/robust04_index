			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disposal of on-line unit could net Dollars 1bn for Mead Mead Corporation, the US paper group, said yesterday it would divest Mead Data Central, its electronic information operation, and concentrate on its core forest products business. Analysts said the information business, best known for its Lexis/Nexis on-line legal, business and general news services, could fetch more than Dollars 1bn. Mead said it had retained Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, to advise on divestment alternatives but it thought a sale to a strategic buyer was the most likely alternative. It hoped to complete a deal this year. Mead bought the business in 1968 for Dollars 6m. Last year it had sales of Dollars 551m and pre-tax profits of Dollars 50.4m. Mead said the subsidiary was on track to 'far exceed' its 1993 sales this year. Through its various Lexis services, MDC is the leading global provider of on-line and CD-Rom legal information, while Nexis provides a wide-ranging general and business news retrieval service. Analysts said Mead was selling at a good time, when MDC's results were accelerating and potential buyers were interested in broadening their information services base for the mass-market development of multimedia. The forest products industry is starting a cyclical upswing. Mr Steven Mason, Mead chairman, said it was a time of opportunity in the paper industry and the company believed it could maximise shareholder value by devoting all its resources to what it knew best. MDC's growth potential could be best realised independently of the group. If the business were sold, Mead would use the proceeds to strengthen the core business. Possible uses include focused acquisitions, further productivity and quality improvements, debt reduction and a stock buy-back. Mead shares closed at Dollars 44 1/2, up Dollars 1 1/4.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING ANSWERS DOUGLAS-MIRAGE SUIT BY FILING HIS OWN AGAINST THEM  </P> <P> Boxing promoter Don King, slapped with a lawsuit Wednesday by heavyweight  champion Buster Douglas and the Mirage Hotel, responded in kind Thursday.  </P> <P> King, in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Douglas and  the Mirage, seeks several million dollars in damages and an injunction to  prevent Douglas from fighting anyone without King as promoter.  </P> <P> Douglas and the Mirage are seeking to break King's exclusive promotional clause  in the contract Douglas had to sign in order to fight then-champion Mike Tyson  in Tokyo Feb. 11.  </P> <P> King's suit names the Mirage and Golden Nugget, Inc., parent company of the  Mirage, as interfering with King's contract with Douglas.  </P> <P> The Mirage said Wednesday it had signed Douglas to a "conditional agreement"  for his first title defense in September, probably against Evander Holyfield,  providing his contract with King can be broken in court.  </P> <P> Also Thursday, new details trickled out on the Douglas-Mirage deal. It was  reported that it is actually a two-fight deal, with Douglas getting $25 million  for the first fight and, if successful, $35 million to fight Tyson. Douglas  will also acquire, if successful in both fights, an option to buy 100,000  shares of Golden Nugget stock, the Associated Press reported. EARL GUSTKEY  </P></p>

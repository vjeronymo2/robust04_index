			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Marc Paoloni report: "Alain Lamassoure Wants a Reform of </F> the EU Commission"]    [Excerpt] At the European Union (EU) General Affairs  Council meeting in Luxembourg, French European Affairs Minister  Alain Lamassoure yesterday expressed the view that the  Commission's existing status has "had its day," that it is "no  longer tolerated by public opinion," and that it ought to be  reformed with a view to "greater answerability." This statement  comes 10 days before the European summit in Corfu, where the  process of the EU's institutional reform will be launched,  culminating in the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996.  According to Alain Lamassoure, this will require a new  referendum. The Corfu summit, Alain Juppe stated for his part,  ought to launch the preparatory work for this institutional  meeting. The Council of Ministers, the Commission, and  Parliament will be asked to draw up an assessment of the  implementation over a little more than one year of the Treaty on  European Union. These reports will serve as the raw material  for a "think tank" which will be created in mid-1995 to prepare  for the Intergovernmental Conference the following year.  <H5>  No Details on Future Projects </H5>   Yesterday, Alain Lamassoure seemed sensitive to the problem  of "guiding" the European programs on large networks, which, in  his opinion, rank as the "third biggest common policy exercise,"  alongside agricultural policy and structural policy. It is a  program to which the Twelve will solemnly reaffirm their  attachment at the Corfu summit on 24 and 25 June. However, they  will limit themselves to approving the 11 priority projects for  the construction of major transport infrastructures and the  eight energy projects, the list of which was confirmed in  Luxembourg yesterday by their foreign ministers.    Alain Juppe, apparently anxious to correct the impression  given by the relative modesty of these initial investments,  stressed the "determination" of the Twelve to implement the  whole of the program envisaged. The same tone was taken by his  European affairs colleague: "The Brussels decision to spend  ECU20 billion per year has not been called into question," Alain  Lamassoure said. The fact remains that no details have been  given on the additional projects which might be implemented to  move from an overall investment of less than ECU32 billion to  the ECU200 billion mentioned at the Brussels summit six months  ago. However, with regard to a program aimed at speeding up and  consolidating economic growth, nobody can deny that the overall  effect is not the same in the two cases. [passage omitted]</p>

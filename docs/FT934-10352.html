			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo urged to drop Renault deal AKTIESPARARNA, the Swedish small shareholders association, yesterday urged Volvo to abandon a planned merger of its car and truck operations with Renault, arguing that the agreement was too seriously flawed for renegotiation. The organisation was the first Swedish group to openly criticise the accord last month, setting in train a wave of domestic criticism which earlier this week forced Volvo to postpone a shareholders meeting called to approve the deal. Aktiespararna members hold up to 10 per cent of Volvo's shares - not enough to sink the deal, but influential enough to increase the pressure on Volvo and Renault to clarify details of the accord. 'There are so many deficiencies in this proposal that it's not realistic to expect the two parties to be able to negotiate any major improvements,' said Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, Aktiespararna president. He said it made more sense for the two groups to continue with their three-year alliance and start new talks which took the main objections to the merger into account. The criticisms centre on valuation, the timetable for Renault's privatisation and the French 'golden share' which could compromise Volvo's 35 per cent ownership of the new company. Mr Forsgardh warned that Volvo shareholders risked losing SKr9bn (Dollars 1.1bn) if the merger went ahead. 'The fundamental point is that Volvo has not succeeded in showing that this deal is good for its shareholders,' he stated. Volvo has resheduled the shareholders meeting for December 7. If it wins backing for its plans, Aktiespararna is threatening a legal challenge on the grounds that the merger contradicts the vehicle company's articles of association.</p>

Novikov, a Russian Democratic Reform  Movement leader, laboratory chief at the Russian Academy of  Sciences' Chemical Physics Institute, and a well known  specialist in chemical weapons, accidentally "straying" from the  subject of elections, stunned invited journalists by saying that  the latest register of chemical weapons subject to elimination  (under the convention on banning chemical weapons, which was  signed by Russia) lists only five tonnes of mustard gas. It  also clearly indicates that these are Russia's entire mustard  gas reserves as of today. If this is so, a chilling question  arises: What happened to tens of thousands of tonnes of this  deadly chemical substance? Professor Novikov knows for sure  that according to all post-war "catalogues," the quantity of  mustard gas operational with the Armed Forces and located on  Russian territory was measured precisely in these figures and  that it has never been exported, destroyed, or dumped.</p>

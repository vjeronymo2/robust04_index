			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian State Duma Representative Anatoliy </F> Lukyanov, member of the Russian Federation Communist Party  Central Committee Presidium, by Natalya Bakhir; place and date  not given: "About the Age-Old Disease of 'Leftism' Among  Communists"]    [Text] The "Russia and Belarus -- Path to the Future"  conference has recently been held in Minsk. The conference was  attended by well known Russian politicians. A SEM DNEY  correspondent attended a meeting with Russian State Duma  Representative Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the Russian  Federation Communist Party Central Committee Presidium.    Anatoliy Ivanovich described the current situation in Russia  as the result of a "the three-year policy of wrecking the  foundations of people's life." To confirm this, he provided the  following figures. Decline in production, compared with the  last year, amounts to 51 percent (27 percent during the first  five months of this year). About 5,500 Russian enterprises have  been brought to a standstill, around 400 companies stop working  every month. Twenty percent of society lives below the poverty  level, the same amount -- on the verge of poverty. Meanwhile,  0.3 percent (586 families) of people are billionaires in terms  of rubles, including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The  crime rate has increased by 2.5 times, according to official  data. Moreover, the current state leadership is blamed for  allowing the pilferage of public property (which is currently  governed by the criminal capital), the disruption of economic  ties, and the subordination of foreign policy to nondomestic  interests.    Anatoliy Lukyanov also responded to some questions. We  present a few of his answers.    [Bakhir] Is Belarus' joining the ruble zone really so  burdensome to Russia?    [Lukyanov] This, in my opinion, is a concoction of people  who do not want real unification. No ruble zone will diminish  the loss caused by our disunion.    [Bakhir] How do you see the mechanism for cooperation  among Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, etc.?    [Lukyanov] I see it as a massive pressure on the  authorities, though within the law. In particular, this is the  establishment of a union of 19 communist parties, the "Accord in  the Name of Russia" movement, development of a concept to  restore the Soviet Union, and the September Congress of USSR  Nations, which should be linked to the establishment of cells to  support the union.    In particular, a special debate in the State Duma was  devoted  to relations with Belarus. The conclusion was unequivocal. The  majority believes that our rapprochement is necessary by any  means.    [Bakhir] Can one presume that the tide of stormy  events (the State Committee for Emergency Situation [GKChP], the  October events) came to nothing?    [Lukyanov] If the tide had succumbed, there would not have  been political amnesty. The cause of the GKChP is being  continued; the trial of Varennikov has just begun. Each one of  us is interested in defending our comrade, and we intend to  reveal what we have not been able to reveal before. Now, it is  completely clear that there was no coup, no blockade of  Gorbachev's dacha, and so on. Regarding the October events, I  think that was the authorities' greatest provocation. The  defenders of the Constitution simply lacked political restraint.    [Bakhir] Do you not think that the main reason behind  these events was the rejection of a class analysis of the  situation?    [Lukyanov] A class analysis is now more important than ever  before. The Russian Communist Party has not abandoned it.  There are people, however, who believe that forceful methods  should be applied now, based on class positions. But, there is  no revolutionary situation... I sometimes have the impression  that this is the age-old disease of "leftism" among communists.    [Bakhir] What do you think is the weakness of the  patriotic (communist) movements in the republics?    [Lukyanov] It is their disunity, the ambitions of leaders,  the lack of a real revolutionary situation, and speculations  with patriotic movements by such populist activists as  Zhirinovskiy....</p>

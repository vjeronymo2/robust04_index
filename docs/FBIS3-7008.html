			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Requests to the Government Regarding Auto </F> Trade Frictions"]    [Text] To improve trade ties between Japan and the United  States, Japanese automakers are soon to disclose their voluntary  action plans to increase procurement of auto parts from U.S.  manufacturers. Concerning this, Yutaka Kume, chairman of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said: "These are  voluntary plans to be carried out by the private sector. It is  improper for the government to comment on them." He then  demanded that automakers' plans not be included in a package of  government market-opening measures to be disclosed at the end of  March.    We support Kume's opinion. The Japanese Government should be  discreet in word and deed, or automakers' voluntary plans might  be considered to be an agreement between the two governments.    The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other U.S.  Government offices in charge of trade with Japan have asserted  that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] gave auto manufacturers guidance in compiling their  voluntary plans. They said that because the plans were  formulated under the government's guidance, it was necessary for  the Japanese Government to guarantee them.    To refute such U.S. assertions, MITI should refrain from  giving automakers administrative guidance whereby it pokes its  nose into their business behind the scenes. It is not good if  what the government has asserted in talks with Washington is  inconsistent with what it has done to domestic companies.    In the framework trade talks, Washington has demanded that  Japanese automakers procure more auto parts from U.S.  manufacturers and that Japan take measures to help the U.S. Big  Three increase their sales in the Japanese market. It has also  demanded that the Japanese Government guarantee that these goals  be achieved.    Tokyo has rejected these demands by saying that the  government cannot control private sector business activities.  However, because Japan's exports of autos and auto parts to the  United States exceed its imports from the United States and  because the framework trade talks remain stalled, the government  has called on the auto industry to compile and disclose  voluntary plans to expand parts procurement and to help U.S.  automakers increase sales in Japan.    Automakers are worried that their voluntary plans might be  included in the government's market-opening measures. If they  are included, it will be considered that the Japanese Government  is responsible for carrying out the voluntary plans.    When former U.S. President George Bush visited Japan two  years ago, the government forced automakers to work out plans to  increase their imports and procurement of U.S.-made autos and  auto parts and included them in the action plan issued at the  end of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. After that, it pressed them  to carry out their plans, and automakers tried to achieve their  goals at an immense cost.    This has set a bad precedent. Washington has now demanded  plans to expand Japan's imports and procurement of U.S.-made  autos and auto parts, as well as a guarantee from the Japanese  Government to carry out the plans. However, from the viewpoint  of deregulation and free trade, the government should quit  poking its nose into voluntary efforts by automakers.    The government forced semiconductor makers to carry out the  Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord and automakers to carry out  their action plans compiled two years ago by justifying its  demands as means to improve ties between Japan and the United  States. The companies still are affected by these demands. The  government should not make the same mistake.</p>

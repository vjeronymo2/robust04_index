			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian Airlines uses lease to finance four aircraft A desire among Japanese entities to reduce their tax bills by offsetting capital allowances has allowed Indian Airlines to make a significant saving on the financing of its fleet. Rather than the airline taking out a loan to buy four A320-200 aircraft, the aircraft were bought by a Japanese company which then leased them on to Indian Airlines. The period of the lease is 10 years, at the end of which the airline has the option to purchase the aircraft. An official at ANZ International Merchant Banking, which arranged the Dollars 170m transaction, said that during the first 10 years it was cheaper for Indian Airlines to lease the aircraft rather than repay a loan. Meanwhile, the Japanese entity will be able to take advantage of the depreciation which goes with the ownership of the aircraft. The official said the transaction also reflected the renewed confidence which Japanese companies have in the Indian sub-continent. The aircraft are due to be delivered in September, October, November and December and are the final four deliveries of a six A320-200 aircraft mandate to ANZ in a financing totalling Dollars 206m.</p>

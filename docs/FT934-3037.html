			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Clinton and Assad to meet as Syria-Israel talks resume Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, yesterday announced Syria's formal return to direct peace talks with Israel and said President Bill Clinton would meet President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader, early next year in Geneva. Syria has for three months refused to resume bilateral talks without a prior Israeli undertaking to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 war. The last round of bilateral talks, the 11th, took place in September. At a press conference in Damascus, Mr Christopher declined to reveal what undertakings Syria had been offered, saying any revelations might hurt progress in the negotiations. Mr Clinton is expected to meet Mr Assad in Geneva after January 15, adding a stop to a European tour already embracing Brussels, Prague, Moscow and Minsk. It will be the first meeting of US and Syrian leaders since Mr George Bush met Mr Assad in November 1990 during efforts to create the multinational coalition which ejected Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, said the summit would 'help to push the peace process forward', adding: 'Such a meeting is so important  -I think it would produce results.' The summit will mark a significant opportunity for Syria to press for the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed because the US and other western nations consider it to be a state sponsor of terrorism. However, Mr Christopher said that nothing had changed in the US assessment of Syria either in this regard or in respect of its human rights record. Mr Christopher also announced that Lebanese and Syrian heads of delegation had agreed to meet in Washington on January 18 to discuss a full resumption of peace talks with Israel, either at the end of the month or early in February. Mr Christopher said he was confident that such agreement would follow. The fruitful climax to Mr Christopher's latest Middle East shuttle came as Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, met in Spain in an attempt to inject momentum into their own stalled negotiations. They restated their hope that Israeli forces could start withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho on schedule next Monday. However, Mr Nabil Shaath, head of the Palestinian negotiating team with Israel, said in Cairo that 'major differences' remained. Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, are to meet in Cairo on Sunday in an attempt to bridge outstanding differences. The urgency of meeting Monday's deadline was underlined by continuing violence in the occupied territories. US tempts Syria, Page 4</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO'S RILEY MAKES THIRD ROUND IN A HURRY  </P> <P> Speed was the main topic of conversation during the second round of match play  at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championships at Singing Hills Golf Course Thursday  afternoon.  </P> <P> And the talk didn't involve the greens.  </P> <P> Chris Riley, a 15-year-old from San Diego, had just finished the front nine of  his second-round match in 65 minutes. That's 7.2 minutes per hole in a sport  that traditionally uses everything but cattle prods to get competitors to play  faster.  </P> <P> But it seems Riley's penchant for fast play is well known among San Diego  junior circles.  </P> <P> "He hit out of turn five times," Mel Skelley said of a junior tournament  earlier this year in which he scored for Riley. "He just gets tired of waiting.  Either he'll revolutionize the game, or someone will slow him down."  </P> <P> Chris Stutts nearly stopped Riley in his tracks by rallying from a 6-hole  deficit with seven holes remaining to trail by one going to the 18th.  </P> <P> "The last hole, I couldn't believe that he was coming back," said Riley, a  freshman on the Madison High School team that won the San Diego Section title  this year. "I think I was forcing it. I was worrying more about him than  playing my game."  </P> <P> Riley, who defeated Rob Booth of Gladwyne, Pa., 4 and 3, in the first round of  match play in the morning, was 4-up after his whirlwind nine holes against  Stutts.  </P> <P> Riley went 6-up after 11 holes and looked to have an insurmountable lead. But  Riley bogeyed 12 and 13 to fall back to 4-up.  </P> <P> Stutts birdied the 15th and then made two pars to cut the lead to a single  hole.  </P> <P> But Riley gathered himself on the 170-yard, par-three 18th.  </P> <P> "I saw his shot go over the green," Riley said. "I just wanted to par it. If he  birdied it from there, he deserved to go on."  </P> <P> Riley didn't take any chances. His tee shot landed three feet from the pin, and  he made the putt to advance to the third round this morning at 7.  </P> <P> And having the opening tee time suits Riley just fine.  </P> <P> "I like to be the first person out on the course," he said. "I like to play  fast."  </P> <P> His morning round was completed in two hours 15 minutes, but that went just 15  holes. Riley also lost a big lead in that match: He was 5-up, then lost three  out of the next four holes.  </P> <P> "I should slow down," Riley said. "I concentrate, but I could concentrate a  little more. But that's just the way I am.  </P> <P> "I play ready golf."  </P> <P> Riley is believed by tournament officials to be the youngest player to earn  medalist honors. He was involved in another first Wednesday when four tied at  one-over 145 after 36 holes of medal play. All shared medalist honors.  </P> <P> Only two of the medalists -- Riley and Brian Gay of Daleville, Ala. -- remain  after Thursday's rounds. The other two medalists lost in the second round.  </P> <P> Jason Worth of Des Moines, Iowa, lost, 4 and 3, to Notah Begay III of  Albuquerque, and Chris Edgmon of Edmond, Okla., was defeated, 3 and 2, by David  Duval of Ponte Vedra, Fla. Edgmon was the first-round leader with a 68.  </P></p>

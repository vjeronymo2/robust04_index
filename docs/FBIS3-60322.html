			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jochen Wagner: "Crafty Accounting in Toepfer's </F> Budget -- Little Future for New Environment Projects"]    [Text] The Federal Government intends to spend an overall  total of more than 478 billion German marks [DM], DM1.35 billion  of which have been allocated to Federal Environment Minister  Klaus Toepfer. The opposition prophesies doom: "He can't even  pay the branch office's phone bill with that." In spite of the  budget cuts announced across the board, the environment minister  can still show an increase of about DM90 million on paper.    According to the present draft, the Environment Ministry's  budget includes a total of DM626.9 million in individual budget  16 solely for the Federal Radiological Safety Office in  Salzgitter, the major item - around DM549 million -- being the  neutralization and permanent storage of radioactive waste.    Over DM151 million have been earmarked for reactor safety  and  radiological safety, including DM21 million for improving plant  safety at Soviet-design nuclear power stations. About DM52  million have been injected into the budget for nuclear safety  purposes. Other major budget items are the ministry itself, with  about DM100 million, and the Federal Environment Agency with  around DM93 million. The Federal Research Station for Nature  Conservation and Rural Ecology has DM20.3 million, nature  conservation in general receiving DM67.4 million.  <H5>  Job Cuts </H5>   The Federal Environment Ministry as such shows a total of  806  established posts for 1994 -- 34 less than this year. Posts at  the Federal Environment Agency have fallen from 839 to 824,  whereas jobs with the Federal Research Station have increased  from 189 to 195. The Federal Radiological Safety Office is  reducing posts from 580 to 574. This means a cutback from 2,448  to 2,399 -- an overall loss of 49 posts.    The environment minister was shown no pity by his political  competitors in the battle for cash. The costly "dynosaurian  technology" that nuclear power entailed was held up as the main  culprit for the financial imbalance within the environment  budget. "We deplore the fact that, yet again, you have emerged  from this year's budget savings round stripped bare. You owe  your budget increase to crafty accounting. Permanent items in  the radiological safety and reactor safety section artificially  inflate the budget, but the room for maneuver in your  appropriation is becoming smaller and smaller. More and more  money is being spent as a result of the Federal Government's  failed nuclear policy, and at the same time less is going to  pioneering environment technologies, environment research, and  traditional nature conservation, not to mention investment in  the environment in the new laender," said SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] deputy Marion Caspers-Merk, criticizing the  new budget in the Bundestag.    To rub salt into the wound, she accused the Federal  environment minister of "incompetence in environment policy,"  referred to Toepfer's statements in the media as "a mixture of  attempts at self- justification, buck-passing, and juggling with  words," criticized his "passive stance," and opined that,  "Toepfer the environment policymaker has no fight left in him."    Klaus-Dieter Feige (Alliance 90/Greens) said, "The emptiness  of environment policy also finds expression in the federal  budget for 1994. Once funds for radiological safety have been  deducted, all that remains to the Federal environment minister  is a risible DM200 million, about DM80 million less than in  1993."    Dagmar Enkelmann (PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism]/Leftwing List) described the Bonn Environment  Ministry's new budget as a "hoax package or an atomic waste  budget." "With over DM1.3 billion, the 1994 draft budget shows  an increase of 7.1 percent over 1993. However, viewed  realistically, the environment budget remains stationary at 0.3  percent of the overall budget."    Hans Georg Wagner of the SPD said, "It is not hard to see  that the environment minister is once again the great loser.  The actual environment and nature conservation sector has  suffered a DM64- million or 3.3-percent cut in real terms. If  we add the cuts suffered in the 1993 budget, the environment's  share in the budget has taken a 17-percent cut since 1992.  Since 1992, when the situation in the new laender caused an  explosive growth in environmental problems for us all, the  budget has shrunk by nearly one-fifth. We no longer have an  environment policy in the true sense of the term. The federal  environment minister is a loudspeaker for environment policy."  <H5>  "Looks" Do not Matter </H5>   In his 10-minute speech, the federal environment minister  barely referred to the massive objections voiced by the  opposition. Instead, Toepfer trotted out a series of well-worn  statements, brandishing a sort of balance sheet as his  contribution to the budget debate. "Our environment policy in  Germany has created jobs. Environment policy currently provides  employment for 680,000 people in Germany. About 50,000 people  are directly employed in environmental reclamation as a labor  market policy measure. In recent times we have employed 120,000  people under job creation schemes. About 15,000 people are  usefully employed on reclamation work in the lignite mining  industry. The federal and land governments spend DM2-3 billion  a year on this item; this spending does not appear in my budget,  but 75 percent of it is borne by the Federal Government. What  matters is that we get the environmental reclamation done, not  whether I would like a better-looking budget."    Toepfer pronounced himself in favor of the creation of a  disposal infrastructure involving private industry. "We need an  environmental infrastructure for sewage treatment and waste  disposal facilities, and for reclaiming contaminated land that  we have inherited from the centrally planned economy of the  former GDR. We want to attract private capital as well for this  purpose. In the new federal laender, 46 sewage treatment plants  are currently being planned or built, or have already been  completed, with private capital -- DM4.3 billion are being  mobilized. I should be happy if as many private sewage works  had been built in the original federal laender in the whole  40-year history of the Federal Republic. Hats off to those who  have assumed responsibility there and achieved this. This is  growth policy and environment policy rolled into one. We shall  pursue it to the best effect."  <H5>  Morsleben Can Still Be Used </H5>   Referring to the dispute over nuclear waste disposal,  Toepfer  stressed that all forces in the Federal Republic, regardless of  their ideas as to the duration and exploitation of nuclear  power, had to reach a consensus on disposal. Referring to the  controversial Morsleben permanent disposal store, Toepfer said:  "Morsleben can legally be operated until the year 2000. The  Nuclear Safety Commission has pronounced the Morsleben store  still usable. The storage quality will be changed, and the waste  will not be stored at the taxpayers' expense; the cost will be  passed on in the form of fees to those who store material there."    Toepfer said that he aimed to abolish ecological subsidies.  This meant altering prices, as prices changed behavior and  brought about technological developments. This road toward an  ecological market economy was more successful than ecological  regulations imposed from above or planned economy  considerations. The Federal Republic already enjoyed a  worldwide reputation for environment engineering.    Individual budget 16 also features a couple of interesting  items. For instance, the federal minister receives an annual  salary of DM275,000 inclusive of local weighting, plus an annual  official expenses allowance of DM7,200 and a per diem allowance,  albeit reduced to take account of the per diem etc. to which he  is entitled as a Bundestag deputy. The parliamentary  secretaries of state receive annual salaries of approximately  DM65,000 less. The "secret fund" at the minister's disposal for  extraordinary service-related expense in special cases contains  another DM60,000 for 1994, and there are DM380,000 more for  public relations work. Another DM14.7 million are earmarked for  work designed to raise public awareness (pamphlets, films,  informative material), inclusive of DM69,000 for technical  publications.    DM325,000 are budgeted for the official vehicle fleet, and  an  approximate total of DM3.8 million for traveling expenses, DM3.5  million for the ministry's telecommunications bill, and just  DM2.6 million for data processing. Long-distance data  transmission alone costs around DM300,000. The books and  periodicals budget amounts to DM995,000.    The German Nature Conservation Circle receives DM485,000 and  the German Council for the Care of the Countryside DM321,000 in  subsidies. Further subsidies to the tune of DM450,000 are  awarded for schemes run by various nature conservation groups  and associations. DM3.6 million are earmarked for dues payable  to international organizations, and the United Nations  Environment Fund due amounts to DM10.8 million. Dues to smaller  international organizations (waterfowl research, lesser whales)  come to about DM1.75 million. The Association of German  Engineers receives about DM3 million for the "clean air"  program, and a similar sum goes to the Environmental Standards  Institute. Operating expenses for the Environmental Sample  Bank, which will gradually begin to cover the whole federal area  from 1994, rise from the current DM5.5 million to DM6.86 million.    Party disputes notwithstanding, as far as alternative  figures  in the Bonn government camp are concerned, SPD environment  spokesman Michael Mueller said, "If Toepfer were to go, it would  be even worse."  [Box p 37] Brief Interview: Grave Error [box head]    The interview with Federal Environment Minister Toepfer was  conducted by our colleagues from the French periodical  L'ENVIRONNEMENT MAGAZINE [EM], which publishes the original  version in full and which has kindly allowed UMWELTMAGAZIN to  print the following extract.    [EM] Do you really believe it is possible to reconcile the  market economy with ecology?    [Toepfer] To be perfectly honest, yes. But the market  economy can only solve its problems if it absorbs its  environmental protection costs. In a market economy, everyone  tries to cut costs or offload them on to others or onto nature.  This is one of its basic principles. My motive for introducing  environment taxes is not to take more money from the taxpayer  but to induce polluters to mend their ways. German industry  complains about an excess of environmental protection charges  and claims that this is detrimental to competitiveness. The  professional associations echo this cry. I have never tired of  repeating that a proper environmental policy creates new jobs,  but in the current time of crisis the first item to be deleted  from the budget is environmental protection. In my opinion,  this is a grave error that will create enormous problems in the  future.    [EM] Are GATT and environmental protection compatible?    [Toepfer] Of course. I have recently discussed this with  Brice Lalonde, who is currently drafting a report on this very  issue. In any case, I believe that environmental protection as  a concept must gradually find its way in so as not to halt the  GATT machinery, by which I mean not leaving those countries that  practise ecological dumping a free hand.</p>

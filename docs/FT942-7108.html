			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / ITV companies told to improve programme quality The ITV network was yesterday accused of showing a lack of courage and adventure, and two new commercial television franchise holders, Carlton Television and Good Morning Television, were severely criticised for their programme performance. The attack came in a review by the Independent Television Commission, the industry watchdog, of programme standards in 1993, the first year of the new licences awarded under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. Carlton Television, the largest ITV company and a subsidiary of Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications, was told that its national network performance was 'well below expectations' and that most of its national programmes were neither distinctive nor of notably high quality. The commission said it wanted to see 'a significant improvement in 1994 and beyond' in the performance of Carlton, which outbid Thames Television to take the London weekday franchise. GMTV, which outbid TV-am for the breakfast TV franchise, was given a formal warning in view of 'its unsatisfactory performance over 1993 as a whole.' There were significant shortfalls in the required amount of news, current affairs and children's programming and there was general concern about quality. The commission said it would review GMTV's performance in September and would consider sanctions unless improvements had been made. For a first offence, the commission can impose a fine of up to 3 per cent of revenue, which in GMTV's case would be about Pounds 2m. Mr Nigel Walmsley, chairman of Carlton Television, said the criticism of his company had to be seen in the light of its achievements, such as the launch of 43 series and 20 single programmes. Mr Green was travelling in Germany and unavailable for comment. Mr Walmsley, who also recently became chairman of GMTV - Carlton is a 20 per cent shareholder - said continuing progress was being made. He added: 'I am confident that we can build on the standards and audience loyalty we are now achieving.' The commission gave relatively clean bills of health to most of the rest of commercial television, with star reviews for Channel 4 and to a lesser extent for Granada Television and newcomer Meridian, holder of the south of England franchise. Sir George Russell, the chairman of the ITC, praised ITV for keeping its 10 per cent lead over BBC 1 in a period of disruption and change. 'The ratings performance was undoubtedly satisfactory but we are looking for more adventure and courage in 1994,' said Sir George. He warned that because advertising revenues were rising in real terms there was 'no excuse for failing to improve services during 1994.' Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Council, said the most important judges of ITV's programmes were the viewers and the network's share of total viewing was 43 per cent. Anglia Television, which the ITC praised, announced 171 redundancies following a reorganisation. Carlton runs foul of watchdog's perception of quality, Page 10</p>

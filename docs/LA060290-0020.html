			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MARINES HONOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS WHO KEPT JAPANESE GUESSING IN WAR  </P> <P> Nihima, ch'ah ligia, ch'al.  </P> <P> It means nothing to most. But to American Marines during World War II, such  words were used to code secret combat messages and transmit classified  documents in a way that baffled the enemy.  </P> <P> More than 400 Marines, recruited from Navajo tribes in Arizona, New Mexico,  Colorado and Utah, served as code talkers during the war by sending messages in  the Navajo language.  </P> <P> Four code talkers were honored Friday at the San Diego Marine Corps Recruit  Depot during graduation ceremonies for the 270 men in Company M. The code  talkers are in town for the San Diego Museum of Man Indian Fair, being held  today and Sunday.  </P> <P> "They didn't tell us we'd be coding when they recruited us," said Thomas Begay,  a code talker who now lives on a Navajo reservation in Gallup, N.M. Begay,  recruited in 1943 at age 16, said Marine recruiters looked for men on Navajo  reservations fluent in English and Navajo. The Navajos thought they would be  regular soldiers, he said.  </P> <P> The unwritten Navajo language, difficult to master because of its complex  syntax and intricate tonal qualities, was adopted by the Marine Corps during  the war as a voice code because Japanese intelligence experts had broken every  other code the United States devised. Some estimated that no more than 28  persons outside the Navajo tribe understood the language at the time.  </P> <P> The code talkers would take the letters of each word of the message in English,  and devise a code in which they would pick an English word that began with each  letter, but translate the word into Navajo. The system required a Navajo at  each end, one to transmit, the other to translate the Navajo words back into  English and use the initial letters to spell out the message.  </P> <P> "It could not be deciphered by the enemy, which were the Japanese at that time.  We developed our own terminology for names of units, boats, planes,  everything," said Keith Little, a code talker from an Indian reservation in  Crystal, N.M.  </P> <P> Among the code words they devised were nihima, ch'ah ligia, ch'al -- which  translate to our mother, white hats and frog. In the code, they would mean  America, sailors and amphibious. Japanese cryptographers were never able to  break the Navajo-based code.  </P> <P> "The code talkers' greatest claim to fame was that they used their Indian  heritage to help the war effort. They saved thousands of lives," Lt. Tony  Wells, spokesman at MCRD, said.  </P> <P> Begay and Little were joined by code talkers Wilson H. Price of Costa Mesa and  Carl Gorman of Window Rock, Ariz., the capital of the Navajo Nation. For the  day's events, all four men donned their code talkers uniforms, maize-colored  shirts, red caps and Navajo-made conch belts of silver and turquoise -- a  tribute to both military dress and Indian heritage.  </P> <P> While in the service, Begay and Price landed with troops at Iwo Jima on Feb.  19, 1945, and were present when the famous battle photograph was taken during  the second flag raising on that island.  </P> <P> "I was quite young when I landed on Iwo Jima. I was right there when they  raised that flag," Begay said.  </P> <P> The confusing chatter of code talkers like Begay and Price on Iwo Jima was so  effective that Maj. Howard Conner, signal officer of the 5th Marine Division at  Iwo Jima, has been quoted as saying, "Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines  would never have taken Iwo Jima." Begay and Price served under Conner.  </P> <P> Although the Marines initially had 30 Navajo recruits, that number later soared  to 420. All went through boot camp at MCRD and were trained in coding at the  Marine communications school at Camp Pendleton, where they were required to  memorize codes as well as learn to set up and maintain radio equipment.  </P> <P> Code talkers also fought in combat.  </P> <P> "There was always somebody guarding us because we were classified as top  secret. We couldn't talk about it," Price said. His wife, Rose Price, said she  was not even aware that he had been a code talker until after his retirement in  1972, after 30 years of service in the Marines.  </P> <P> Although the military can now scramble messages electronically, Navajo code  talkers were a fast, efficient way to scramble messages during World War II. In  fact, Begay and Price were part of a team of four code talkers who beat four  other Marines, who used conventional coding procedures, in speed and accuracy  of message transmissions.  </P> <P> "We would take those messages from our officers and code them in Navajo. We had  to do it fast, in a split second," Begay said.  </P></p>

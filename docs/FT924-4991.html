			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: A guider's guide - Nicholas Lander goes on his armchair food travels AS A restaurant reviewer, I never lack for advice. 'Go there', 'Try that', 'You will never finish what's on your plate there'. But over the past year I have been lucky enough to receive two pieces of advice I hope not to forget. The first came from my counterpart at the New York Times, Bryan Miller. 'Never criticise local restaurants too harshly,' he told me, 'they fulfil many other roles than just trying to please the critics.' The second came, almost inadvertently, from one of London's most successful restaurateurs after his business had been lauded in a national newspaper. On the night the reviewer was in, two adjacent tables had to wait a long time for their food. The review appeared on the same day as an angry, but justified letter of complaint from the occupant of one of the tables landed on the restaurateur's desk. This strengthened my belief that to do my job properly I should scrutinise other tables as well as my own in a restaurant. These convictions were reinforced when the last of the six 1993 guides to the restaurants and hotels of the UK thudded through my letter box. My spirits have never sunk so low as on the two occasions a publisher has proposed that I write a restaurant guide and working my way through these guides I am glad I declined. Lunch in Liverpool would be lovely, dinner in Doncaster a delight - but not on the same day, a routine many inspectors have to follow. Familiarity would bring contempt and indigestion. The Ackerman and Ronay guides are so bubbly that it is almost as if there is nothing wrong with the quality of British restaurants. This is not a criticism that could be levelled at the Good Food Guide. Comments in the Harden guide are understandly terse because they are trying to include so much information. Time Out's is aimed at the readers of its magazine and the AA' s slightly impersonal voice is typical of a big organisation with an extensive data base. Two guides have sought financial security via sponsorship, two by accepting advertising. My strongest reaction to the sponsorship involved in the Egon Ronay and Ackerman guides is that I feel both have been done so tastelessly. Ronay's sponsorship list reads like a badly put-together menu: British pork followed by Haagen-Daz ice cream eaten off a Wedgwood plate, the lot paid for with a Diners' Card on which the restaurant asks for approval on a Cellnet phone. Cleverly, Ackerman has gone for a champagne house's sponsorship but someone has forgotten to tell the illustrator how appetising an open bottle of champagne can look. Although Ackerman honestly details his restaurant interests, his desire to include all his many friends in the business makes him write about private dining clubs not open to the general public. The two guides which accept advertising - the AA guide and the Time Out Guide to London - are also the most comprehensive of their kind (in the AA's case the heaviest, too). Given that the AA guide is weakest on London (not to mention graphic design and layout), these two together would make a good fit. The Time Out guide is unusual, and perhaps most consumer friendly, in that it has divided its entries into cuisines - French, Jewish, vegetarian etc - not a practical option for a national guide. The Good Food Guide relies strongly on readers' reports. This is a structural weakness. However, Tom Jaine, the guide's editor, is undoubtedly beginning to show his teeth and to convert the guide into something that conveys information as well as opinion. The round-up lists are particularly useful. The difficulty of being as up-to-date as possible is a problem that has preoccupied Richard and Peter Harden with the second edition of their London guide. In the 1993 edition, the lists and the maps are improved but in an effort to be comprehensive the guide includes details of restaurants that were not open at the time of publication. The Hardens maintain that these restaurants are the ones most likely to make an impact in 1993 and are therefore what their readers will want to know about. My reaction is that the restaurants which will succeed in 1993 are those which manage to please their customers regardless of pre-publicity. Who, for instance, would have predicted that one of London's most successful restaurants in 1992 would be a restaurant in Camden Town serving Belgian food? Certainly not me. Harden's London Restaurants (Pounds 6.95), The Time Out Guide to Eating and Drinking in London (Pounds 6.99), The AA Hotels and Restaurants in Britain &amp; Ireland (Pounds 12.99), Egon Ronay's Cellnet Guide (Pounds 13.99), The Good Food Guide (Pounds 14.99) and The Ackerman Guide (Pounds 14.99). A useful accompaniment to all these would be the 1993 Michelin Great Britain &amp; Ireland Motoring Atlas (Pounds 9.95).</p>

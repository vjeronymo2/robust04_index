			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK BAR EMPLOYEES, 6 OFF-DUTY POLICEMEN BRAWL  </P> <P> Authorities said Thursday that they are investigating a bar brawl that erupted  between six off-duty Los Angeles police officers, five employees and a customer  at a Burbank restaurant.  </P> <P> Four Burbank police cars responded to a major disturbance call shortly before  midnight Wednesday in the bar at the Black Angus restaurant at 235 S. 1st St.,  Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said.  </P> <P> The officers found that six off-duty Los Angeles officers had scuffled with a  bartender, two cocktail waitresses, two bouncers and at least one customer  after one of the officers accused the customer of knocking over a bottle of  beer, authorities and witnesses said.  </P> <P> Several people involved in the brawl, including at least one officer, suffered  minor injuries. No arrests were made, although the incident is being  investigated by Burbank police and has been referred to the Los Angeles Police  Department for an internal investigation, Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Because no arrests were made, Burbank police declined to name the officers, who  are assigned to the Wilshire Division, and the other people involved.  </P> <P> "It was a major disturbance," Goldberg said. "Apparently everybody had been  drinking. We have several versions of what happened. In essence it became a  brawl."  </P> <P> Black Angus bartender Ronnie Ortiz said the officers were sitting at the bar  drinking beer about 11:15 p.m. when they became involved in a shouting match  with a customer whom one of the officers accused of knocking a bottle of beer  to the floor.  </P> <P> "They were very loud and obnoxious," said Ortiz, who added that he did not know  they were police officers until after the fight broke out.  </P> <P> Ortiz said two waitresses moved between the officers and the man with whom they  were arguing. He said the officers pushed them out of the way, knocking one to  the ground and the other against the bar.  </P> <P> "They threw me onto the floor," said Norene Youngblood, one of the waitresses.  "Then one twisted my arm up behind my back. It turned into quite a ruckus.  Customers were scattering all over the place."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Put Into Chokehold  </P> <P> Ortiz said he jumped over the bar to try to protect the waitresses but was  grabbed by the officers and put into a chokehold. Ortiz and Youngblood said two  bar bouncers joined the fracas, which finally ended when the officers dragged  the man accused of spilling the beer out a side door and handcuffed him face  down in the parking lot. Ortiz said he saw the officers striking the man while  he was on the ground.  </P> <P> After Burbank police arrived, the handcuffed man was treated by paramedics and  released.  </P> <P> "Our officers determined there was insufficient evidence to hold him, coupled  with the fact that he needed medical attention," Goldberg said.  </P> <P> Cmdr. William Booth, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, said the incident  is being investigated by the department's internal affairs unit.  </P> <P> "We will make a determination about propriety or impropriety of our officers'  actions," he said.  </P></p>

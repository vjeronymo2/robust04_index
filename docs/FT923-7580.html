			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / US threatens air strikes if Iraq again defies UN THE US is prepared to bomb targets in Iraq within days if President Saddam Hussein again attempts to defy UN weapons inspectors in Baghdad. Officials say air strikes would be triggered if Iraq carried out its threat, made earlier this month, to deny the UN team access to government ministries. The US administration is confident that the 22-strong UN team in Baghdad will demand to visit the Ministry of Military Industrialisation before its planned departure from Iraq tomorrow. Mr Nikita Smidovich, the Russian who heads the team, said yesterday he was 'awaiting instructions' from UN headquarters in New York on the timing of his departure. Following five hours of discussions with Iraqi officials, Mr Smidovich said: 'Tomorrow (Monday) will be an inspection day.' The New York Times claimed yesterday the confrontation with Iraq was being provoked by the White House to boost President George Bush's flagging re-election campaign. It said the decision was taken last week during a series of meetings which included consultations with British and French officials. But Mr Bush angrily denied he was trying to 'pick a fight' with Iraq and said the election campaign had 'nothing to do with this'. A State Department official stressed that any US-Iraqi confrontation was entirely the responsibility of Baghdad. Iraq's refusal last month to allow UN inspectors access to the Ministry of Agriculture sparked the present crisis. Washington has repeatedly stressed its readiness to use force if Iraq did not comply with UN resolutions. Military preparations for renewal of hostilities with Iraq are well advanced. More than 5,000 US troops are in Kuwait for two months of exercises, brought forward in response to the increased belligerence from Baghdad. Additional batteries of Patriot missiles are being delivered to Bahrain and Kuwait, while the Pentagon confirmed that an air warfare control group has been sent to Saudi Arabia from its base in South Carolina. The US has more than 200 strike aircraft in the region, principally in Saudi Arabia and on the carrier Independence in the Gulf. It also has Tomahawk cruise missiles which could be used as the main strike weapon. The US could also use the confrontation with Iraq to aid Shia groups in the south of the country who have been attacked by Saddam Hussein's forces, including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Reports from Iraqi opposition groups say Baghdad is trying to root out dissidents in the southern marshes. Iraq responded in typically aggressive fashion over the weekend. Mr Hamed Youssef Hammadi, the Minister of Information, said in an interview yesterday: 'If attacked we will fight to the last man without regard for the consequences.' He told the German magazine Der Spiegel that Iraq also stood by its territorial claim to Kuwait and would not rule out the use of force to achieve it. Iraq's ambassador to the UN, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, said: 'Obviously someone is trying to provoke Iraq into taking a confrontational stand.' He hoped his government would realise this. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will discuss Iraq as well as the crisis in the former Yugoslavia when he meets top ministers tomorrow. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a key US Arab ally during the Gulf War, made a surprise visit to Kuwait yesterday for talks with the emir and other leaders, adds Tony Walker. Arab and western officials said it appeared the Egyptian leader wanted to reassure nervous Gulf states of Egypt's support against possible Iraqi belligerence. Mr Mubarak's visit to Kuwait followed that of the Kuwaiti foreign minister, Sheikh Salem al-Sabah to Cairo and Damascus last week, prompting speculation that Gulf states may be reviving plans for an Arab deterrent force.</p>

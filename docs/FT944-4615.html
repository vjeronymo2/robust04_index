			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (8): High-quality leaves - Tobacco production After two disastrous seasons in which tobacco prices on the Harare auction floors plunged more than 60 per cent to US124 cents a kilogram, 1994 was a much better year for the industry than anyone predicted. In the early 1990s, production took off in response to a shortlived global shortage, with volume jumping 68 per cent between 1989 (130m kg) and 1993 (218m kg). Initially, this was accompanied by rising prices, up from US176 cents a kg in 1989 to a record 325 cents in the boom year of 1991 when the crop was worth Dollars 572m, with exports of Dollars 532m contributing 30 per cent of total foreign earnings. Farmers raised their plantings but the severe 1992 drought and the subsequent collapse of world tobacco prices in 1992-93 reversed this process. The 1994 crop of 169m kg was 22 per cent lower than last year and the smallest since 1990. Firmer world demand and global production cutbacks boosted prices on the Harare floors which rose 40 per cent to 173 cents a kg, little different from 1989 levels. Exports fell by a third in 1992-93 but have recovered modestly to an estimated USDollars 400m in 1994. Tobacco is the country's largest export, accounting for an estimated 22 per cent of the total. While the 1991 euphoria has disappeared, the industry is mildly optimistic about future prospects. The world tobacco market is divided into two - with the low-value, low-quality segment dominated by Asian producers, especially China, while the US, Brazil and Zimbabwe are the lead players in the flavour, high-quality leaf sector. Here demand and supply are in rough balance, subject to planned sell-off of the US stabilisation stockpile currently being negotiated. Zimbabwe producers are optimistic about modest growth - 5 per cent annually  -in the second half of the decade, targeting planned increases in cigarette production in Eastern Europe and possibly also China. The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, which represents some 1,650 large-scale growers producing over 95 per cent of the crop, has recommended a maximum 7.5 per cent increase in planting this season. Given the poor and late start to the rains, growers say crop could exceed 190m kg this year - dry seasons result in larger, though lower quality, production. Expansion, culminating in lower prices, during the 1990-93 period was a reminder that Zimbabwe's future lies in niche production. Industry experts urge growers to focus on quality rather than volume, since Zimbabwe cannot outcompete low-cost producers in Brazil and Asia, especially China.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TOBACCO: OUTPUT, EXPORTS AND PRICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------             Output            Value          Exports     Average price Year          (kg)   (US Dollars m)   (US Dollars m)   (US cents a kg)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1987           128              167              260               125 1988           120              262              279               219 1989           130              203              309               176 1990           134              354              395               265 1991           171              572              532               325 1992           201              320              450               160 1993           218              270              366               124 1994           169              292              400               173 1995*          190              na             na             na  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office, Harare  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

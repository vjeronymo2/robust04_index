			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today  in Thessaloniki that the Turkish claims that Greece give  so-called help and encouragement to terrorism are close to being  ridiculous. Venizelos made the above statement when he was asked  by the MACEDONIAN NEWS AGENCY to comment on the new barrage of  Turkish press reports and the statement by the Turkish Foreign  Ministry spokesman on this issue. Venizelos said that the  Turkish claims are an attempt to export Turkey's domestic  problems. Contrary to Turkey, he said, Greece is absolutely  open and accessible to everyone, so that at any moment anyone  can check on the validity of the provocative Turkish claims  about the existence of so-called PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] military camps in Greece.    Asked whether there is any link between the provocative  statement by Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman  and similar remarks by Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi  yesterday in Paris, Venizelos said that Greece is following all  these developments and trying to analyze various points; it does  not underestimate any version and factor. The spokesman  concluded that Greece is firmly and persistently trying to be a  factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkans.    In addition, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas  described the Turkish charges against our country as devoid of  truth and totally unfounded. Bikas said that Turkey is going  through a deep crisis in all sectors; it should search for the  reasons for this and solve its problems with its domestic  situation, socioeconomic shortcomings, and human rights  violations. Greece wants to normalize its relations with  Turkey, he concluded, but this depends on its stance on the  Cyprus issue, absolute respect for sovereign rights in the  Aegean and, of course, the suspension of the slanderous campaign  against our country.</p>

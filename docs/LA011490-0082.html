			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN LIBERATED EUROPE, LIBERATION MAY BE THE BANE;  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY: DYING FOR IT IS MORE ENNOBLING THAN LIVING IT. AND THAT IS WHAT THE  EAST BLOC IS STARTING TO FIND OUT.  </P> <P> In the euphoria, it is easy to forget that liberation is often the beginning of  human folly, not the end. Because folly requires freedom, liberty is an  invitation to folly. (The book of Exodus is a useful text on the subject.) In  the liberated zones of Eastern Europe, the invitation is being accepted.  </P> <P> Bulgarians have been free for about a month. What is the first great cause they  have taken up with their new-found freedoms of assembly, petition and speech?  Chanting "Bulgaria for Bulgarians," they demand the repression of the Muslim  minority. The country is racked with civil disorder protesting the repeal by  the new Communist regime of oppressive anti-Turkish decrees.  </P> <P> At the first whiff of glasnost, Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Georgians and  Ossetians, Uzbeks and Meskhetians marked the lifting of the yoke of the Soviet  imperium by taking to the streets to beat each other bloody. The newest riots  in southern Azerbaijan, however, have progressed beyond mere ethnic quarreling.  The local citizenry, Shiite Muslims, are near insurrection, attacking  authorities and tearing down border posts. Their demand? Reunification with  Iran.  </P> <P> To my recollection, the British historian Paul Johnson was the first (in  August, 1988) to warn of the coming Balkanization of East Europe and the  rekindling of ancient ethnic strife as the Soviet Empire broke up. By now,  everyone is familiar with the fact (though few anticipated the fury) of  intolerant nationalism as the great bane and the potential ruin of the newly  liberated Soviet zone.  </P> <P> Another source of potential ruin is now equally obvious: the economic costs of  de-communization. A report from Poland spoke of people losing patience with  Solidarity's program of radical economic reform. Polish capitalism was all of  six days old at the time.  </P> <P> There is one other bane facing liberated Europe, less obvious than ethnic and  economic disillusionment, but just as preordained. It is the coming political  disillusionment. Democracy in the abstract is a glory second to none. But  liberated Europe is about to experience the first half of Churchill's famous  quip that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others.  </P> <P> Not just that it is messy and corrupt. A friend of mine, an adviser to one of  Hungary's new democratic parties, brought a group of aspiring Hungarian  politicians over to the United States last fall to imbibe democracy at the  wellspring. They were treated to a tour of the New York mayoralty and the  Virginia gubernatorial campaigns. During their 40 years of jail and repression,  of samizdat and secret police, did they dream, could they have imagined, that  at the end of the tunnel lay Jackie Mason?  </P> <P> It is not just that Hungary and the rest are headed for party squabbling and  back-room deals, media events and campaign lies. The disillusionment with  democracy will involve something far deeper.  </P> <P> First, the realization that real democracy actually establishes limits to  popular will. Under constitutionalism, not everything is permitted even if the  people will it.  </P> <P> In one of the liberation's more remarkable twists, Bulgaria's government last  week rejected calls in the street for a referendum.  </P> <P> The demonstrators demanded a referendum on ethnic rights in order to deny them  to the 15% Turkish minority. A statement pointing out that fundamental human  rights cannot be subject to popular vote was issued jointly by the democratic  opposition and -- how rich our history -- the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The second and more deeply disillusioning truth about democracy is that it is  designed at its core to be spiritually empty. As Isaiah Berlin wrote 30 years  ago in his great essay "John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life," the defining  proposition of liberal democracy is that it mandates means (elections,  parliaments, markets) but not ends.  </P> <P> Democracy leaves the goals of life entirely up to the individual. Where the  totalitarian state decrees life's purposes -- Deng's Four Modernizations,  Castro's Rectification Campaigns, and the generic exhortation about "building  socialism" -- democracy leaves a naked public square.  </P> <P> What a shock for those whose lives have been so infused with purpose by the  struggle against totalitarianism. That is why the original East German  oppositionists looked with dismay at the post-Wall revelers, those content to  see the revolution "drowned in West Berlin chocolate." That is why the victory,  the miracle, of 1989 will be as disillusioning as it is now exhilarating.  </P> <P> The fruit of victory is bourgeois democracy -- the most free, most humane, most  decent political system ever invented by man, and the most banal. Dying for it  is far more ennobling than living it. Liberated Europe is just getting to the  living part.  </P></p>

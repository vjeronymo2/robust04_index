			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WELCH'S SPEEDY RECOVERY LEADS TO TRIATHLON VICTORY  </P> <P> Three weeks ago Greg Welch was in Phoenix with fellow Australian Simon  Skillicorn. The two were preparing for a triathlon, eyeing the course a day  before the race when the car they were parked in was broadsided by another car  being driven at 50 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Skillicorn suffered a broken neck. Welch came away with two cracked ribs and  two more separated from the spine.  </P> <P> No, they didn't run the next day. Skillicorn won't be running for quite some  time and on Friday when doctors looked at Welch's X-rays, they advised him not  to even train.  </P> <P> But there was Welch, all smiles, no indication of fatigue and giving the  thumbs-up sign in the middle of the 10-kilometer run along Harbor Drive, the  last event in Sunday's Mountain Dew Sport San Diego International Triathlon.  </P> <P> Sure, doctors said don't train, but they didn't bar him from competing. So  Welch competed.  </P> <P> At that midway point in the 10K, Welch had a 30-second lead over Miles Stewart,  also from Australia, and Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo. It was more than  apparent he was going to win the race, which also consisted of a one-kilometer  swim and 30 kilometers on bike. Welch, 25, did so in a course record of  1:27:27.  </P> <P> Scott Tinley's old record was 1:27:42.  </P> <P> "That was for Simon," Welch said after the victory. "I did it all for him."  </P> <P> Welch was not the only one to set a course record and then proceed to tell a  story about how quickly the human body can mend itself. Paula Newby-Fraser's  story is not so dramatic.  </P> <P> By finishing in 1:34:56, Newby-Fraser, a Zimbabwe transplant who now lives in  Encinitas, eclipsed her own course record of 1:37:16.  </P> <P> As it was for Welch, this was a surprise considering Newby-Fraser spent the  previous six days recovering from the Nice Triathlon, which she won just a week  ago.  </P> <P> And recover is the applicable word. It took Newby-Fraser 6 1/2 hours to finish  the Nice event, which consisted of four kilometers in water, 75 miles on bike  and 20 miles on foot.  </P> <P> By winning in France, Newby-Fraser cashed a $12,000 check. For winning in San  Diego, she earned $1,500, as did Welch. The second-place finishers, Stewart  (1:27:55) and Erin Baker (1:37:53), got $1,000 and the third-place finishers,  Scott Molina (1:28:04) and Joan Alley (1:41:15), picked up $750.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey National Had Abbey National been determined to stick to its previous target of three times for dividend cover, its payment might not have increased at all this year. As it is, the 22 per cent increase, which is broadly in line with earnings growth, is a welcome admission that it has enough capital to be going on with and does not need to retain every last penny of earnings. The desire to avoid building up surplus capital is perhaps a signal that the bank is more interested in boosting return than in further expensive attempts at diversification for its own sake. That is also good news after its embarrassing excursions into estate agency and French commercial lending. Yet Abbey's dividend cover of just 2.1 times is at the bottom of its new target range of two to three times. That is in line with other banks that have also paid large dividend increases, but it suggests something of a struggle to reach the top of the target range by the peak of the cycle. Special factors, including a lower tax rate, will boost earnings this year. Continental provisions should fall sharply and the cost of getting out of estate agency will not be repeated. Less certain are the prospects for operating profit. Abbey expects the contribution from insurance to increase substantially. But mortgage margins may narrow as interest rates stop falling, and treasury profits will grow more slowly. Abbey's dividend increase looks like a one-step jump, even though low inflation reduces the need for cover.</p>

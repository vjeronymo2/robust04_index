			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Investors push gilts toward German yields CASH continued to flow into the UK government bond market, extending the euphoria of last week's general election result and pushing sterling bond yields closer to their German counterparts than at any time since last summer. With 10-year gilts gaining around half a point, the market continued to shrug off the threat of substantial new issuance of bonds. However, many observers expect this to return to the top of investors' agenda once the post-election rush is over. Apart from the net Pounds 28bn needed this year to fund the UK's public sector borrowing requirement, there is also the danger of further issuance if, as widely feared, the true borrowing requirement was understated for political purposes in the run-up to the election. The Bank of England took a step further towards hitting its funding targets with the issue of an Pounds 800m tranche of gilts. The 10 per cent stock due 2003 - which followed two other Pounds 800m tranches issued in at the end of last week - was reported to have sold out quickly. Market estimates put the Bank's total gilt sales - both official and unofficial - at anything from Pounds 3.5bn to Pounds 5.5bn since early election results began to suggest the return of majority Conservative government. Yesterday, longer-dated bonds advanced strongly, while shorter-dated paper was held back by a belief that interest rates are unlikely to be cut immediately. The benchmark 9 3/4 per cent bonds due 2002, which opened at 103 15/32 , advanced to 104 3/32 in late afternoon trading, a yield of 9.12 per cent. Converted to an annual yield - a comparable basis to German government bonds  -that is equivalent to 9.33 per cent, or around 145 basis points higher than bunds. Analysts expect any further narrowing of the yield spread to be slow. According to Mr Philip Tyson, an analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew: 'It's going to have trouble coming in much more than that in the near term. We are targetting 120 basis points for the year end.' Gilt futures, which opened at 98.25, rose a point before falling in later profit-taking to close to their opening, with a heavy 97,000 contracts traded. CONCERN about political upheaval in Russia, where the government of Boris Yeltsin has submitted its resignation, boosted US Treasuries. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/4 at 101 19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. Prices were even firmer at the short end of the market, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 101 3/16 and the yield down to 5.088 per cent. In early trading, the market benefited from a 'flight to quality' by investors, spurred by worries that uncertainty in Russia would spill over into world financial markets. Investors traditionally favour US government bonds during times of political turmoil, and shorter-dated securities usually benefit more because they are regarded as safer and more liquid financial assets. The short end of the market was also buoyed by talk that the Federal Reserve was buying in securities ranging from three-month bills to two-year notes. Although there was no confirmation of the talk, analysts suggested the Fed was probably buying the securities for a customer, usually a foreign central bank or big international institution such as the World Bank. The Fed stayed out of the credit markets, with Fed funds trading at 3 5/8 per cent. Some observers said the Fed's willingness to refrain from intervening at that rate suggested its new target for Fed funds might be 3 1/2 per cent, and not 3 3/4 per cent as originally thought on Thursday when the Fed eased monetary policy. GERMAN government bond prices softened, with the uncertain underlying tone of the market compounded by events in Russia. The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures exchange, opened at 8.26 but fell to a low of 88.00 and proved unable to sustain a recovery. The contract closed at 88.04, with volume at 48,500 contracts. In the cash market, the benchmark 8 per cent unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.60, from 100.80 at the close on Friday, for a yield of 7.90 per cent. The announcement from Russia reminded bund market participants that the economic and political problems of eastern Europe could still spill over into Germany. Recently, the market has been focused on the economic prospects within Germany. A positive note was sounded by a report from five German economic research institutes which suggested economic growth of around 1 per cent in western Germany this year, down from 3.1 per cent in 1991. A slower rate of growth could lead to lower inflation expectations and an easing of monetary conditions in the second half of the year. A strike of public sector workers is likely if talks between employers and unions fail to reach an agreement over pay. Employers have offered a five per cent increase. The unions are claiming a settlement in line with the average for private sector pay deals, currently around 6 per cent. Traders said the government's determination to impose a lower wage settlement could contribute to lower inflation and interest rates later in the year. JAPANESE government bond prices fell sharply overnight in Tokyo, despite intervention by the authorities to prevent further downward pressure. The Ministry of Finance offered to buy up to Y50bn each of the benchmark government bond issues Nos 129, 121 and 122 - funding the purchases from a sinking fund. The action supported bond prices for a short time, but selling pressure returned to drive prices lower. The benchmark issue No 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield of 5.495 per cent, up from 5.445 per cent on Friday. The June bond futures contract closed at 101.61, down 0.28 of a point on the day. Volume was 35,290 contracts. Analysts said the bond market remained cautious about the outlook for inflation as the government looks to support both the slowing economy and sliding stock market through fiscal expansion.</p>

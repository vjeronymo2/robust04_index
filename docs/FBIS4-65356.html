			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "French Source Tells </F> AL-HAYAH: No Secret Deals With Iraq; Rather, Disagreement With  Washington Over Lifting of Embargo"]    [Text] Paris -- An official French source confirmed to  AL-HAYAH yesterday the existence of differing positions between  Paris and Washington vis-a-vis the international embargo imposed  on Iraq. The source said that Paris is not concluding secret  deals with that country.    The source pointed out that the United States refuses to  lift  the embargo as long as the Iraqi regime under President Saddam  Husayn is in power, while France believes that lifting the  embargo is linked to Iraq's implementation of the Security  Council resolutions.    The source added that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe clarified  his country's position to his U.S. counterpart Warren  Christopher during his visit to Washington.    The source pointed out that the United States suspected  France's political intentions, and thought that Paris was trying  to make contacts with Iraqi officials.    The source added that the French Government is not  concluding  any secret deals with Iraq. But it insists that lifting the  international embargo is linked to Iraq's implementation of the  Security Council resolutions. And it believes that Iraq has not  yet implemented all these resolutions, including recognizing  Kuwait's sovereignty.    The source went on to say that there is clear progress with  regard to implementing the other resolutions adopted by the  council. And if Iraq implements all the resolutions required,  France will ask the Council members to reconsider the embargo  and to begin to engage Iraq in a six-month trial period after  which the embargo would be lifted. The French source pointed  out that the United States continues to reject a trial period.</p>

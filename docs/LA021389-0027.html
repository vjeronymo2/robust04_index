			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A sketchbook belonging to the British poet and artist William Blake that sold  125 years ago for the equivalent of $30 is expected to fetch about $875,000  when it comes up for auction next month at Christie's in London. "The works of  William Blake have been in such demand for so long that it is rare for anything  by him to come to market now," said the head of English watercolors and  drawings at Christie's. Blake, who died in 1827, earned a meager living as an  engraver while writing and publishing poems on biblical and mythological  subjects illustrated with his own colored engravings.

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: US bonds upset UK equities before the close - Market report UK stocks closed firmly but well off their best levels yesterday after a session led by developments in markets in New York and elsewhere in Europe. Both equities and British government securities stumbled badly in the second half of the session when US Treasuries fell, albeit briefly, when the US Conference Board announced a sharp rise in its Consumer Confidence Index. The early part of the trading saw saw only favourable developments as shares moved ahead in response to Wall Street's 57 point rise over and good recoveries in bond markets across Europe. The trend was emphasised when German markets responded favourably to annualised growth of 15.2 per cent in March money supply, down from 17.5 per cent in February and restoring confidence that the Bundesbank will continue to cut rates; the German central bank confirmed that today's money market repos tender will be at a variable rate. By mid-session, the FT-SE was 31.6 ahead at 3,137.7, and investors seemed little troubled by the comment from the chairman of the Confederation of British Industry that there was no need to cut UK base rates any further; the CBI had previously been a leading advocate for base rate reductions. The stock market has lost most of its confidence in any further cut in rates but the pound's sharp rise after the CBI chairman's comments was discouraging for shares in the blue chip export companies. But the fall in Federal bonds, quickly mirrored in a weak start on Wall Street and a reversal of the 1 1/2 point gains in UK gilt-edged securities, bit hard into the FT-SE, halving the morning's rise. Trading volume increased as shares turned back. Markets recovered themselves later, although the Dow Industrial Average was still 7 points off when London went home. The final reading of 3,125.3 on the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 19.2. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 10.1 off at 3,777.7 as nervousness spread across the second line stocks. With US markets closed today for the funeral of the former President Nixon, markets in Europe will await their next lead on Thursday, when the Bundesbank policy council meets and the postponed auction of US Treasury notes takes place. There was no shortage of active features to boost Seaq volume to 753.6m shares yesterday, compared with only 522.3m on Monday. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.67bn on Monday, confirming the continued strength of underlying investment business in UK equities. Shares in BAT Industries closed below the best as the stock market assessed the planned Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco. Sector analysts saw it as a cash generative move for BAT, increasing its position in the large and still highly valuable US tobacco and cigarette markets. Bid speculation and share placings continued to enliven the market background, and investors reacted strongly to the final profits disclosures of the 1994 first quarter. While the undertone of the market appeared firm, there was some disappointment that equities were still so clearly vulnerable to developments in global, and particularly US, bond markets. With a further tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve still possible, analysts sounded cautious on the near-term outlook for a UK stock market now trying to focus on domestic fundamentals.</p>

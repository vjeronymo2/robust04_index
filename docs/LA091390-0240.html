			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> IS 'EVITA' IN MADONNA'S FUTURE?  </P> <P> * Disney Studios VIPs are so delighted with Madonna's performance in "Dick  Tracy" that they are hotly pursuing a project for her that Madonna has been  "breathlessly" coveting for years -- "Evita." If things work out right, it will  be the "Material Girl" in the screen role of Argentina's controversial former  first lady. A prior film project starring Meryl Streep was shelved last year  and, before that, a version starring Liza Minnelli was also discarded. But  perhaps the third time's the charm inasmuch as one thing Madonna and Eva Peron  share is plenty of "blonde ambition."  </P> <P> Actor Edward James Olmos and three music industry veterans have formed an  independent record company, Primero Entertainment Group. According to the  Hollywood Reporter, the fledging company, described as a "crossover Hispanic  label," aims to launch young Latino talent. An official for the company  confirmed the report, but could not offer further information. Some of you may  recall that before finding fame in the stage play "Zoot Suit," Olmos was known  as a skilled singer, performing at various Southland clubs.  </P> <P> The Univision network is launching "Platavision," a 90-minute programming block  geared toward the 5-million-plus Latino children ages 2 to 11 in the U.S.  market. A sitcom, "Pepe Plata," which will debut on Sept. 17, anchors the new  programming. The series will star 16-year-old Simon Maldonado as fictional pop  star Pepe Plata, the world's richest youth. The show will feature Dyana Ortelli  ("La Bamba" and the game show "Uno Nunca Sabe"), Luis Accinelli and Olivia  Royval. The character of Pepe Plata will also be marketed as a recording star,  with an original song performed weekly by Maldonado, who will be handled by the  managers of the musical group New Kids on the Block.  </P> <P> The highly rated Spanish-language TV program "Sabado Gigante" has inspired the  first bilingual board game for the U.S. Latino market. Introduced by Univision  Network and Milton Bradley, the game features a miniature figurine of the  show's Chilean host, "Don Francisco," and bilingual cards that quiz players on  a variety of trivia questions.  </P> <P> "Adam 12" has returned to the TV screen as a new syndicated series featuring  Alma Martinez ("Born in East L.A." and "Zoot Suit"), Ethan Wayne (son of actor  John Wayne and his Peruvian-born wife, Pilar), and Peter Parros ("Knight  Rider"). Its imaginative new title -- "The New Adam 12." And Universal Studios  has also revived another police oldie, "Dragnet," under the title -- yes, you  guessed it -- "The New Dragnet."  </P></p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan may scrap GDR offering for China Steel Taiwan may cancel a planned issue of global depositary receipts in state-run China Steel Corp in favour of domestic offerings. Amid discord over the pace of privatisation of the island's biggest steel-maker, a 450m share offering - 6 per cent of the company's equity - to overseas investors has been postponed indefinitely, Mr Yen Chi-li, spokesman for China Development Corp, which served as the lead underwriter for previous domestic offerings, said yesterday. The Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m GDR offering was to have been launched by the end of this year. Instead, the Commission of National Corporations under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has proposed offering another 950m shares to local investors first. The proposal awaits Cabinet approval. If the market can successfully absorb so large an offering, the government will likely scrap the GDR issue in favour of further domestic offerings. The government must sell 1.3bn more of its shares to achieve privatisation. Following several tranches of sell-offs, China Steel is now 67.1 per cent government-owned, with the Ministry of Economic Affairs holding most of the government's shares. Merrill Lynch, which was to manage the GDR issue, could not be reached for comment. Observers believe market conditions could allow the privatisation to be completed domestically as the stock market traditionally rallies leading up to elections. Key provincial and mayoral elections will be held in early December.</p>

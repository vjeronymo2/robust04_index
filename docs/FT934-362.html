			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Oftel to look for lessons abroad Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, plans next summer to publish comparisons of telecom services in Britain and those in the US and France, Andrew Adonis writes. He will focus on short-comings in services available to UK consumers compared with those in the two other countries. Mr Cruickshank, who visited the US recently, is keen to find out why levels of phone ownership among lower-income groups appear to be markedly higher in the US than in the UK. 'I particularly want to direct our energies to areas where regulation may be stifling innovation,' he said. Mr Cruickshank recently visited several leading US operators including American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and was 'impressed' by the quality of innovation. Like the UK, the US has a broadly competitive regime for the provision of telecom services. Oftel has chosen France because of its reputation for providing advanced and efficient services even though France Telecom is a state-owned monopoly. Mr Cruickshank's US visit included discussions with politicians and the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator, about the terms for full competition between US and UK operators in each other's markets. The issue is set to be discussed at ministerial level by the US and UK governments during the early months of next year.</p>

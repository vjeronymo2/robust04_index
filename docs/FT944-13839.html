			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Banks given Maxwell deadline International investment banks and advisers to the pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Robert Maxwell have been given until November 4 to make an offer of restitution, Norma Cohen writes. Sir Peter Webster, the former High Court judge appointed to help find a 'global solution' to the shortfall in Maxwell pension scheme assets, met trustees and advisers to most of the schemes yesterday. Sir Peter said he hoped the plan would raise enough for each scheme to meet its liabilities in full. Sir Peter has been working since last spring to find ways of allowing investment banks and advisers to make restitution without implicitly admitting wrongdoing. Those which do not make reasonable offers by November 4 risk legal action by the pension schemes. It is understood that several schemes have prepared writs, which have not yet been served, seeking millions of pounds. Sir Peter is understood to have told trustees that participants in the solution are likely to set conditions on their contributions. In particular, they will seek confidentiality and a guarantee that no further claims be made against them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 17 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The secretaries  general of nine political parties that will participate in  Sunday's general elections in El Salvador today signed a new  pledge to maintain "judiciousness and peace" on election day.  The document was signed at the Onusal [UN Observers for El  Salvador] headquarters, and President Alfredo Cristiani was the  "honorary witness."    The declaration says: "Convinced of the historical  importance" of Sunday's elections, "we ratify our firm  determination to cooperate and guarantee that these elections  are held in an atmosphere of tranquillity, safety, and complete  freedom."    The political leaders, who included members of the most  conservative right-wing group of the old FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] guerrilla groups, pledged to urge  their party members and sympathizers to abstain from all acts of  intimidation, coercion, pressure, or fraud, and from provoking  the contenders.    In addition, they pledged to punctually open the polling  places, scheduled for 0700 (1300 GMT), and guarantee that  functions at the polling places be carried out only by duly  accredited members of the Voting Table Boards.    The Salvadoran party leaders pledged to abide by the legal  provisions for the elections, to guarantee that the polling  places will close at 1700 (2300 GMT), and to maintain "order"  during the vote-counting process. Likewise, they asked the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to enforce the Electoral Code  provision concerning the ban on military in active service and  the police, as well as pastors and religious leaders, engaging  in partisan publicity. "Our large-scale and peaceful  participation in the elections will be the best example of the  Salvadoran people's civic mindedness and their determination to  build the democratic, modern, just, and participatory nation we  all hope for," the document states.    Between 2.3 million and 2.4 million Salvadorans will elect  the president and vice president of the Republic, 84 Legislative  Assembly deputies, 20 Central American Parliament deputies, and  262 mayors throughout the country.    The declaration was signed by Armando Calderon Sol, of the  ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena); Shafik Handal,  of the FMLN; Victor Valle, of the National Revolutionary  Movement; and Ciro Cruz Zepeda, of the National Conciliation  Party (PCN). The document was also signed by Aronette Diaz, of  Democratic Convergence; Guillermo Guevara, of the Authentic  Christian Party (MAC); Edgardo Rodriguez, of the National  Solidarity Movement (MSN); Jorge Martinez, of the Unity Movement  (MU); and Antonio Morales, of the Christian Democratic Party  (PDC). Armando Calderon Sol, Edgardo Rodriguez, and Jorge  Martinez are also candidates for the Presidency of the Republic.</p>

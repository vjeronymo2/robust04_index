			<p>BFN     [Text] Although the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] insists  that it will not participate in the election, the party is  apparently spending considerable amounts of money on election  posters. Several IFP election posters were seen in the streets  of Durban and surrounding areas, some with the message "vote  when the time comes."    [Begin IFP spokesman Arthur Koningkramer recording, in  English] There's nothing contradictory in it. We still believe  in elections. We are absolutely convinced that it is not  possible to go ahead with democratic elections without a major  player like the IFP. In addition, as you're well aware, the  concerns of His Majesty the king, in terms of self-determination  of the Zulu people, have not been addressed. We are confident  that they will be addressed. And in conclusion I would just  like to say that we're absolutely committed to elections. There  will be genuine all-inclusive elections, and the IFP will fight  them. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, Congratulations on your pre-election editorial, concluding, marginally, with advice to vote Labour. Not that I agreed with you; I didn't. But I admired the fearless way with which you reached and published a judgment that was unlikely to be shared by most of your readers. This action increased the confidence which I already felt that your editorial stance would be based, not on prejudice, but on the relevant facts as you saw them  -unlike nearly all other press editorials. Richard Morgan, 11 Malbrook Road, London SW15 6UH</p>

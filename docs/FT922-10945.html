			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Boeing records strong first quarter BOEING yesterday reported a 43 per cent increase in first-quarter net earnings to Dollars 441m from Dollars 309m in the same period last year. Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 7.97bn, compared with Dollars 6.1bn in the first quarter of 1991. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.29, against 90 cents. Return on sales was 5.5 per cent, slightly higher than last year's 5.1 per cent. The solid first-quarter performance reflected higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a profit from company's defence and space business, which lost money in the first quarter of last year. Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said he expected sales and earnings in the second half to be lower than in the first half because of fewer deliveries of 747 jumbos and reduced production of 737 narrow-body aircraft from 21 to 14 a month in the second half. He told the company's annual shareholders meeting that group sales this year were expected to be slightly higher at Dollars 29.5bn compared with Dollars 29.3bn last year. Although Boeing continued to face a difficult short-term industry environment as a result of the financial problems of many airlines, it continues to have a strong backlog of orders, totalling Dollars 95.8bn at the end of last month. Orders in the first quarter totalled 124 aircraft compared with 91 last year. Demand for narrow-body aircraft with less than 150 seats was sluggish but demand for wide bodies remained buoyant. The company expects to see a gradual recovey in civil aviation this year but no significant recovery in new orders until later next year. To adapt to the current weak market conditions, Boeing plans to reduce its 104,000-strong workforce in the Seattle area this year by about 8,000. The company is also facing heavy research and development expenditure largely to finance the development of its new 777 wide-body aircraft and other commercial aircraft projects. Spending was expected to peak this year at about Dollars 1.8m and then continue in the Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.6bn range for several more years. The company is studying the possible development of a very large aircraft seating 600 to 800 passengers. This could involve a stretched version of the 747 or a completely new aircraft. McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's US competitor, is expected to unveil soon details of its plan to develop a 400 to 600-seat, four-engined jumbo aircraft to challenge Boeing's dominance in the very large airliner market. The European Airbus consortium also has similar plans. Boeing took on about Dollars 1bn in new debts last year, but has retained a debt-equity ratio of just 15 per cent.</p>

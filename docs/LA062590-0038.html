			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> GERMAN ISSUES: EXPECT PAYOFF MUCH LATER  </P> <P> The West German stock market has suddenly come back to life after a dismal  spring. That's stirring new interest in the market on the part of U.S.  investors, who are remembering all those post-Berlin Wall stories about the  united Germany's dynamic future as the economic leader of the "new Europe."  </P> <P> Should you have money invested in German stocks? Yes, most global market  strategists will tell you. Will you have to wait awhile for your payoff? Most  likely, yes. But to try and time the turn of events in Germany would probably  be futile. When that market moves, it moves very quickly.  </P> <P> In the first quarter of this year, the West German market was the world's  hottest. From January 1 to April 2, the Frankfurt exchange's 30-share DAX index  rose 10%, to 1,976.43. In the same period, the U.S. market fell 3.4% and  Japan's plunged 26%.  </P> <P> But just as the U.S. and Japanese markets rebounded in the spring, Germany's  stagnated. Steve Keddell, who handles big U.S. investors' trades of German  stocks for Deutsche Bank in New York, notes that the German market was hit by a  number of problems at once: concerns about the cost of unification; rising  interest rates; a strong Deutschemark, which hurt export profits, and turmoil  in Brazil, a big market for German firms.  </P> <P> Those problems sent the DAX down to 1,787.39 by June 13. Then, last week,  buyers returned, boosting the DAX 80.66 points for the week to 1,872.92 on  Friday.  </P> <P> Is this the start of a new surge? That's probably up to American and Japanese  investors. Because the German stock market is relatively small, "in the short  term, what drives German stocks is the action of outsiders" who suddenly throw  large sums at the stocks, says George Murnaghan. He runs two international  stock mutual funds for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Some American investors believe that relief over the economic cementing of East  Germany with the West on July 2 -- via East Germany's conversion to West  Germany's currency -- could precipitate a flood of money into German stocks.  "The market could rebound violently," says Frank Jennings, who runs American  International Group's $500-million international investment portfolio.  </P> <P> On the surface, German stocks don't appear overpriced. Keddell says the average  stock on the Frankfurt exchange sells for 14 times estimated 1990 earnings per  share, about on par with U.S. stocks and well below Japan's still-lofty  price/earnings ratios.  </P> <P> The big question now is whether West German companies will be able to show  decent profit growth this year and next. Keddell admits that his expectations  are coming down. "We originally expected 12% (average) earnings growth this  year, but we now see 9%," he says. And for 1991, he sees just 7%.  </P> <P> The problem is that no one knows what West German companies will have to invest  to revitalize their East German counterparts, as unification proceeds. There is  a growing realization, however, that "these companies will have to spend a lot  of money before they can earn anything," Keddell says.  </P> <P> George Noble, one of Fidelity Group's key international stock managers, toured  the two Germanys earlier this month. He returned to the United States sobered  about chances of a fast payoff from unification. In fact, Noble cut back a bit  on his Overseas Fund's position in German stocks.  </P> <P> The East German economy is a shambles, he says. Its plants are grossly  inefficient. Officials at a West German auto parts plant told Noble about an  Eastern counterpart that employs 800 people. The Western plant produces as much  with 150.  </P> <P> Everyone knows there's a huge bill that the West Germans will have to pay to  rebuild the East. The German stock market may even be prepared for little or no  earnings growth by German firms this year and next, as capital spending soars.  The big unknown, says Noble, is whether social upheaval in the East will lead  to rioting. That could panic foreign investors.  </P> <P> "I think you're going to see unemployment be a real problem," he says. Add the  potential for interest rates to remain high -- as the two Germanys borrow  massively to fund unification -- and Noble believes German stocks could slide  further this year.  </P> <P> But beyond the short-term gloom, he says he is convinced that the German market  could one day be the world's best -- because German economic power is certain  to be pre-eminent in Europe. If you think you can time the market, good luck.  The smartest investors will probably put money into German stocks this year,  and vow not to touch them for three years minimum.  </P> <P> Here are some mutual funds that specialize in German stocks or have heavy  investments in that market:  </P> <P> * Germany Fund, New Germany Fund and Future Germany Fund. They trade on the New  York Stock Exchange. All are managed by Deutsche Bank Capital, 31 W. 52nd St.,  New York, NY 10019.

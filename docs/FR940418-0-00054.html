The term ``meeting'' does not include any procedural deliberations required or permitted by &sect;&sect;6.1, 6.2, 7.4, or &sect;7.5 of these bylaws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;7.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Open meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) It is the policy of the United States, established in section 2 of the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94&hyph;409, 90 Stat. 1241, that the public is entitled to the fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes of the Federal Government. The Postal Service is charged to provide the public with this information while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities.

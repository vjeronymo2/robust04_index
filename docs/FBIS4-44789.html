The one most closely related to  technology is headed by Commissioner Martin Bangemann  (Industrial Affairs, Information Technologies and  Telecommunications). It met for the first time in Brussels on  15 February, bringing together a group of experts ("wise men"),  mainly leading industrialists.    Their task is to pave the way for the "information highways"  which form part of the Trans-European Networks, a system of  infrastructure which the Commission has planned in order to  complement the Single European Market.    The Bangemann group agreed on a work programme and the views  of the professionals were garnered on the proposals for  establishing a trans-European telecommunications network, one of  the White Paper's priorities. Two sub-groups were established.  Their chairmen are Carlo de Benedetti, president, Olivetti, and  Etienne Davignon, Societe Generale.    The Christophersen Task Force, chaired by Henning  Christophersen, (Economic and Financial Affairs -- in agreement  with Mr. Delors -- Credit and Investments, Statistical Office)  met for the second time on 21 February in Brussels. Its job is  to oversee the implementation of the more conventional  infrastructure programmes like transport and energy, ensuring  efficiency, consistency and speed.    These task forces will pave the way for key aspects of the  Trans-European networks highlighted by the White Paper, which is  the response of Commission President Mr. Jacques Delors, to the  European Union's unemployment crisis. It envisages the creation  of 15 million jobs between now and the end of decade, by "making  employment policy the centrepiece of our overall strategy."  <H5>  Strong Role for R&amp;D </H5>   Research and development and the extensive implementation of  technology strongly linked to economic and industrial policies  represents one of the White Paper's central themes. The  Trans-European Networks providing a coherent infrastructural  system is a clear manifestation of this.    The White Paper accepts that in some circumstances  technological progress can erode jobs. However, it also sees it  as a major stimulant of growth and hence job opportunities. The  White Paper looks towards creating a "sustainable development  model" by creating a healthy, open and decentralised economy.  It therefore points to the following requirements:    -- making the most of the Single Market;    -- supporting the development and adaptation of small and  medium-sized enterprises;    -- pursuing the social dialogue that has, to date, made for  fruitful cooperation and joint decision-making by the two sides  of industry, thereby assisting the work of the Community;    -- creating the major European infrastructure networks;    -- preparing and laying the foundations for the information  society.    To ensure that the information society becomes a reality,  the  White Paper has drawn up an Action Plan consisting of the  following:    -- promote the use of information technologies;    -- provide basic trans-European services;    -- create an appropriate regulatory framework;    -- develop training on new technologies;    -- improve industrial and technological performance.    The Bangemann Task Force is expected to report to the  Council  before the end of March, so that the Action Plan can be applied  as soon as possible.    The information networks will integrate concepts like  highways, access channels, service areas and highway users.  Telecommunications hardware consisting of broadband optical  fibre networks will represent the physical basis of this system.  The anticipated priority applications of this are:  teleworking; teletraining; telemedicine; and, links between  administrations.  <H5>  Information Highways on the Way </H5>   Over the next ten years, it is expected that something like  ECU150 billion will be needed to create these sort of high-tech  structures. ECU67 billion will be required between 1994 and  1999 for priority projects. The source of this investment will  mainly be the private sector, with European money playing a  kick-starting role. R&amp;D is also accorded some importance for  job creation in coming years. Research at the national and  Community level will be stepped up, embracing greater  cooperation between companies. The Commission will propose that  Member States implement this innovative vertical cooperation on  the basis of a restricted number of large joint projects in the  following areas:    -- new information technologies;    -- biotechnology;    -- ecotechnologies.    A forum for concertation and exchanges between the various  European research bodies and centres is suggested. A science  and technology assembly to encourage the development of  concerted strategies linked to the Community's activities is  another measure being advocated.    Other aspects of the Trans-European Networks, such as  transport and energy, are dealt with by the White Paper. In  essence it is a statement of economic policy which assesses the  need to develop Europe-wide infrastructure, embracing the most  advanced information and communication technologies. It also  formally reaffirms the importance of mobilising and coordinating  R&amp;D efforts towards clearly-defined economic goals.</p>

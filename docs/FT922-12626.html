			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report May SILVER futures fell below critical support at Dollars 4 a troy ounce on Comex in hectic afternoon trading yesterday, depressing the precious metals complex across the board. 'No one wants to buy it,' said one floor analyst, while another predicted Dollars 3.50 would be hit in the short term. Perceptions of more than adequate supply and lessening demand weighed on sentiment after early selling by two big funds in Chicago. GOLD, which eased further on the London bullion market, was setting life-of-contract lows on Comex, also in hectic trading. London dealers said the failure to break above Dollars 340 a troy ounce had turned sentiment bearish. On the LME COPPER prices bounced off lows, three-month metal regaining the Dollars 2,200 a tonne level. Sentiment was helped by news that Chile's El Teniente mine is closing its sub-level six until 1993 because of rock falls, although Codelco said overall mine production should not be affected. New York arabica COFFEE futures were sharply down at midsession after a rise in warehouse stocks. 'This market just has no conviction to the upside,' said one analyst, predicting a fall below 64 cents for the May contract. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the command of the Northwestern Group of  Russian Forces submitted to the Latvian bureau for monitoring  the Russian troop withdrawal data on the number of discharged  Russian military personnel living in Latvia. According to this  information, 21,976 discharged Russian military personnel live  in Latvia at the moment. The majority are over 60. More than  3,000 discharged Russian military personnel living in Latvia are  Latvian citizens.    Since 28 January 1992, when Russia officially took over the  former USSR armed forces, almost 2,000 military personnel have  been discharged from service in Latvia and have not left for  Russia. The report explains that these people are waiting for  apartments in Russia and will leave Latvia after they receive  them.    Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring  the withdrawal of the Russian army, will also send this  information to State President Guntis Ulmanis.</p>

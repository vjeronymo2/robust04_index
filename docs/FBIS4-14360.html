			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Results of the Test Will  Not Change," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Israel's rulers  always precede U.S. envoys' visits to the region with  intensified media campaigns designed to throw dust in the eyes  of the international community, creating the deceptive  impression that Israel is being flexible and that it is willing  to pay the price of peace.    AL-BA'TH adds: In light of Warren Christopher's current  visit to the region, Israel sparked and guided a media campaign  throughout the world to cast the rulers of Israel in a favorable  light, portraying them as taking peaceful regional initiatives.  At the same time, this media campaign seeks to portray Syria as  the party that fails to offer initiatives, or what the rulers of  Israel call concessions for peace.    The paper explains that mere talk about Israel's willingness  to abandon the settlements within an unspecifified period, in  accordance with a list of Israeli demands and conditions, in no  way changes the problem on the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace  process. The paper says the obstacle to progress in the peace  talks is Israel's refusal to announce its acceptance of the  resolutions of international legitimacy by withdrawing from all  occupied Syrian Arab territories. The peace talks will not  progress without full withdrawal.    The paper says Syria, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said,  accepted the bases of the peace process. It is willing to offer  full peace in return for full withdrawal. Syria is not avoiding  a just and comprehensive peace. It has always sought this peace  and is sincerely cooperating with the United States for its sake.    AL-BA'TH concludes: There can be no peace without the return  of all the territories, not just part of them. The territories  cannot be divided, diminished, or replaced. The exercise of any  kind of pressure, intimidation, deception, and threats by any  party is a method that has been tried and tested more than once.  The results have never changed.    Under the headline "The Fact," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  says: Perhaps the most outstanding fact all observers realize is  that the peace process needs new momentum. A propelling force  has been lost due to Israel's continued intransigence,  procrastination, and time wasting, all designed to entrench  facts on the ground, like the partial agreements it concluded  with the Palestinian side in Oslo and Cairo. AL-THAWRAH adds:  New momentum requires an effective U.S. role in accordance with  United States' commitments as an honest partner in the peace  process, which was originally based on a U.S. initiative founded  on the UN Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace  principle.    AL-THAWRAH discusses Israeli intransigence and its role in  blocking progress in the peace process. The paper says the  policy of deception and prevarication resulting from Israel's  violation on the Palestinian track -- a track that has become  the prisoner of a separate and partial agreement -- is the  outcome of secret hallway negotiations outside the peace  process. Because of this policy, the peace process is fraught  with dangers.    The paper says Israel wants only the formal activation of  the  peace process, via the formal U.S. role regrettably expressed by  Warren Christopher before his arrival in the region. This was  in noticeable contrast to the optimistic statements that used to  precede each of his visits to the region. The paper continues:  Today, there is no way to hide from the fact that it is a  priority to translate the U.S. admission of Syria's central role  into reality. The paper demands an effective U.S. role in order  to implement the UN Security Council resolutions. The U.S.  Administration has been committed to this role. It should  manifest this in its behavior and on the diplomatic and  political levels. This is what the peace process needs to avoid  remaining the prisoner of Israeli intransigence.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by asking: Does Christopher realize  that the ball is still in the Israeli court? Is he bringing any  indication of the effective U.S. role that will put the peace  process back on track toward a just and comprehensive peace?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman unveiled a  monument to Mihovil Pavlinovic, a 19th-century Croatian  politician and publicist, in Podgora today. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Speaking about the current  state  of Croatian state policy, Franjo Tudjman had the following to  say about relations with the Serbs:    [Tudjman] ``As the head of the Croatian state, and assuming  full responsibility, I declare here that they cannot count on  such a policy [not further specified]. Croatia will try to do  its utmost to integrate the occupied Croatian areas into  Croatia's constitutional and legal system in a peaceful way on  the basis of UN Security Council resolutions and the deployment  of the peace forces. But, if this cannot be implemented within  the current mandate of the peace forces, Croatia will use all  means -- to which it is entitled as an internationally  recognized and sovereign country -- to establish its  constitutional and legal system on every inch of Croatian soil.''    [Correspondent] Speaking about Croatian state policy on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian president said that its  continuity resulted in the Washington agreement, the  implementation of which will contribute to improving Croatia's  already good status in the world.    [Tudjman] ``The Bosniak Muslims have no other way to survive  in Europe than to rely on and ally themselves with the Croats.  They have no other way to join democratic Western civilization  than with the Croats. The Muslim leadership understood this,  and this has made possible the end to the war and the agreement  which, as I said, is in our interest, but also in the interests  of the Muslims. It is therefore in the interest of the Croatian  people and the Croatian state. This must be clear even to our  Croat people who, in those terrible events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, first suffered huge losses inflicted by the  Serb aggressor, and then in the war with the Muslims at the time  when they were orientated towards the creation of their  independent Muslim state.''    [Correspondent] President Franjo Tudjman also spoke about  the attempt to create a parliamentary and government crisis in  Croatia. He said:    [Tudjman] ``Croatia's political pluralism has showed its  maturity. Croatia will come out of this temporary parliamentary  crisis stronger. The departure of a few deputies to another  party will not dent its reputation. On the contrary, this will  further reinforce democratic Croatia and prove the stability of  our system, which has enabled us to achieve what we have  achieved in establishing an independent Croatia and in the  economy.''

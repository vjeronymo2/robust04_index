			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV, BUSH INVITED TO GERMAN CEREMONIES  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday invited President Bush and Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to witness the Cold War's demise at Oct. 3  ceremonies celebrating German reunification, although Bonn and Moscow are still  haggling over some details of the historic merger.  </P> <P> Kohl telephoned the two leaders to go over the remaining areas of contention  and to ask them to take part in the festivities, Hans Klein, a spokesman for  the Bonn government, said.  </P> <P> It was not known whether both erstwhile adversaries would attend, but the  ceremonies would provide a welcome backdrop of foreign policy success for the  presidents, who are currently struggling with other crises.  </P> <P> The East German news agency ADN reported from Moscow that Gorbachev plans to  take part and that he hopes to shake Bush's hand at the Brandenburg Gate, near  the site of the Berlin Wall, which stood for 28 years as a symbol of East-West  division.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and Bush are expected to discuss the invitation at their meeting  Sunday in Finland.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher, leaders of the other two victorious powers of World War II, have  already indicated that they will attend the festivities in Berlin.  </P> <P> The two Germanys concluded a treaty last week that spells out the specifics of  their reunion, but an accord on the international aspects remains to be signed.  </P> <P> "Two-plus-four" talks, involving the two Germanys and the four victorious  powers, ended Friday without agreement on how much support West Germany should  provide for the Soviet troop withdrawal from East Germany over the next four  years.  </P> <P> Diplomats in East Berlin said they were confident that the last wrinkles could  be ironed out next week when the foreign ministers of the six nations meet in  Moscow.  </P> <P> The Soviets have been pressing for more financial assistance from Bonn in  repatriating their 370,000 troops from East Germany.  </P> <P> The reunited German state will be a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, although the Soviets will not complete their pullout from the  East German sector until 1994. The fate of the East German People's Army is  still unclear.  </P> <P> Much of the Kremlin's concern is with economic questions, such as where to  house the soldiers and their families and how to integrate the forces into  domestic defense units.  </P> <P> In addition to the withdrawal difficulties, the Soviets have also insisted that  the final document specifying international terms for reunification must  include a promise to keep nuclear weapons out of what is now East German  territory, diplomatic sources said.  </P> <P> The Western allies have reportedly rejected this demand on grounds that such a  written commitment would infringe on the sovereignty of the new German state.  </P></p>

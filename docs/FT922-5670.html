			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saffa holds dividend despite profits decline SAFFA, the Italian boxboard and packaging company controlled by the Bonomi family, yesterday reported a 13.8 per cent fall in consolidated group profits, to L22.4bn (Dollars 18.2m) last year from L26bn in 1990. The group, which has transformed itself in the past 18 months with the sale of its paper activities and concentration on the boxboard business, is paying an unchanged dividend of L420 for ordinary shares and L440 for savings stock. Adjusted for disposals, group sales rose by 21 per cent to L655.7bn, while profits at parent company level went up by 5.9 per cent to L27.1bn. The company, which is now the second biggest boxboard maker in Europe, confirmed it wanted to raise its market share by increasing its own productive capacity and by buying stakes in other manufacturers. Fiat may restructure its car production, leading to a cut in the workforce, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome. An Italian newspaper earlier reported that Fiat intended to close its Chivasso car plant as a cost-cutting move. The closure would not affect actual car production.</p>

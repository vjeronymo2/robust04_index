			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Liberal Selection"] </F>   [Text] The Liberal Forum, which split off the Freedom Party  of Austria 15 months ago, is girding itself for its first  Nationalrat election campaign. In addition to Heide Schmidt,  top candidate and leader of the federal list, the other four  Liberal Forum deputies -- caucus Leader Frischenschlager, Thomas  Barmueller, Hans Helmut Moser, and Vorarlberg deputy Klara  Motter -- also plan to run.    Following Wolfgang Grassl's resignation, Hans Helmut Moser,  federal manager ad interim, will take over heading the election  campaign.    The provincial list and the list for the Vorarlberg Diet  elections will be approved at the next federal congress on 18  September.</p>

A survey shows that farmers obtained an additional 2.43  billion yuan from growing new varieties of grain and cotton on  eight million hectares of farmland, averaging 240 yuan per  household over the past three years.    Jiangsu began to encourage farmers in 1990 to undertake  scientific farming in line with the market economy.    The province now has 12 comprehensive experimental farm  centers, 324 townships and more than 2,000 villages doing  pioneer work in the application of agro-science, and 150,000  households specializing in scientific farming.    These organizations and households have formed a network to  popularize agro-science.    While encouraging scientists to go to the rural areas to  help  farmers boost production, Jiangsu has paid attention to  importing advanced technology for growing grapes and apples and  cultivating rice.</p>

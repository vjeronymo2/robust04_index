			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / French Government Bonds: Salami tactics bring some optimism though hardly wild - optimism has settled into the French bond market, after the government continued its salami tactics of slicing another quarter percentage point off interest rates on Thursday. The consequent rise in bond prices led to some profit-taking, and the market closed the week with the yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds at 8.01 per cent, compared with 8.05 per cent a week earlier. The most durable factor behind this optimism is that it is not built on expectations of early cuts in German interest rates, or any immediate further rate reductions in France. Mr Bernard Godement, an economist with the Nomura Research Institute in Paris, says it will be 1993 before German rates come down. Certainly, the French government wants to avoid its mistake of a year ago when it moved ahead of Germany in cutting interest rates, only to have the foreign exchange markets force it to step smartly backwards. Having to reverse an interest rate cut would be politically worse than no further cut at all in the run-up to next March's parliamentary elections. So far, all the Banque de France has really done this month is catch up with the interest rate cut the Bundesbank made in early September. Some economists, such as Mr Christopher Potts, a Banque Indosuez economist, believe the current  3/8 to  1/2 percentage point margin of French money market rates over German ones gives the government 'a slight margin of manoeuvre', which it might use to lower official rates a bit before the end of year. These constraints limit a further narrowing, in the near future, of the famous spread between the yields of long-term French OATs and German bunds. This has shrunk, from 1.25 per cent at the height of September's currency crisis to 0.68 per cent on Friday. Mr Potts does not see grounds for any further big reduction in this spread. However, the general gloom which has hung over the French economy is vanishing for three reasons: First, the franc has emerged with battle honours from its September crisis. The Banque de France has larger foreign exchange reserves than before that crisis, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said this week. In addition, the chances that France's likely centre-right government next year will abandon the socialists' strong franc policy receded further last week. Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullists' anti-Maastricht standard bearer and leading proponent of a more flexible exchange rate policy, said he was most unlikely to be part of the next government. Second, if the recent interest rate cuts help contain servicing costs on the public debt and promote investor confidence, then government forecasts of 2.1 per cent growth this year and 2.6 per cent next year may no longer look like gross over-estimates. The public deficit will still be nearly FFr220bn in 1992 and more than FFr200bn in 1993. But it may not skew the bond market as much as it has. New government issues rose 42 per cent in the first nine months of this year, but those of financial institutions and of industry fell 21 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Third, the opposition's commitment to a sizeable privatisation programme gives hope for deficit and debt reduction. The bond market would clearly benefit from this.</p>

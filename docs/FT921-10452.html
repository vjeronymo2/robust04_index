			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Astra subsidiary follows parent into receivership FOLLOWING the appointment of Cork Gully as receivers to Astra Holdings, the munitions and fireworks maker being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry, Astra's largest UK subsidiary has also gone into receivership. BMARC, based in Lincolnshire, makes armaments, ammunition and pyrotechnics. Cork Gully said it aimed to find a buyer for the business as a going concern. It has been returned to profit at the operating level. It was bought for Pounds 32m in May 1988, funded by a rights issue. But debt associated with the acquisition made the total cost impact nearly twice that, according to Mr Tony McCann, one of the company doctors running Astra prior to the receivership. Soon after the BMARC purchase, Astra arranged a Pounds 50m credit facility with five banks. With debt stuck at close to that amount, recent attempts at a restructuring fell through and the banks called in Cork Gully. About 75 per cent of Astra's business lies in the US, where operating profits have continued to be made through the period of upheaval at the parent company, which dates back two years to the discovery of difficulties with PRB, a Belgian acquisition that was never consolidated, and the descent into loss of the group. The US subsidiaries have not been put into receivership. Cork Gully said this was to facilitate a 'ring-fence' being put around them. Haley and Weller, a UK concern, has not been put into receivership either.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Hong Kong airport talks stall over financing THE Chinese government has ensured Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, an early trial of wills by failing to agree with Britain on terms for financing the colony's multi-billion dollar airport. High-level Anglo-Chinese talks in Beijing broke up yesterday without reaching agreement, just three days before Mr Patten arrives in the colony. Although the airport is not due for completion until the colony is handed over to China in June 1997, Hong Kong government officials believe the further delays in the financing will make that deadline impossible. Tenders for levelling and extending the island on which the airport is to be built have already closed but the authorities are unable to award the contract until China approves the financing terms for the whole project. The failure of the talks - agreed by the prime ministers of the two countries at the Earth Summit last month in Rio de Janeiro - heightened suspicion in Hong Kong of a linkage by the Chinese of the airport's funding with political developments in the colony and a desire to see how Mr Patten, who arrives on Thursday, conducts himself. The two sides have decided on further talks, possibly next week, by members of the joint Anglo-Chinese airport committee. In Beijing, Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, was given a letter from Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging China to approve the financing without delay. China's concerns are believed to centre on the escalating costs of the HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.9bn)airport and related projects and the financial guarantees the Hong Kong government has given the two main public authorities responsible for construction of the projects.</p>

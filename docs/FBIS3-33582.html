			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by FSLN Militant Carlos J. Vegacruz] </F>   [Text] I would like to contribute to the debate inside the  FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. I will put forth  several ideas in this connection.    The FSLN is not the personal property of any leader. The  FSLN  is not the private property of any member of the National  Directorate or of any Sandinist activist. Therefore, no one can  claim to own the FSLN. In reality, however, we can see and show  that Daniel, our national coordinator, appears to be the lord  and master of the FSLN, or is made to so appear. I do not deny  Daniel's major historic merits, but they do not mean that he is  the most able or the only leader of the Sandinist Party.    The times in which we live demand that we be consistent with  the Dialectic. If we remain bogged down in internal political  changes, the social dynamic will wipe us off the political map.  The FSLN must continue to move forward with its democratization  in order to be able to democratize society. This means that our  main leaders, at every level of the party, must be agents of  change, leaders who are in tune with the democratic winds that  are blowing through the ranks of the FSLN and all over the world.    We must promote change in the styles and methods of the  Directorate, in the leadership, in our organizational structure.  Therefore, we must be flexible yet firm, self-critical, and  humble. We must struggle in a public-spirited manner together  with our people for peace and for life. We must seek ways of  erasing our party's militaristic image from the minds of the  people. Our leaders must be peace-loving, intelligent people of  progress who possess true social sensitivity and are not  demagogues. Our leaders must be and have the reputation of being  honest and must be respected by Sandinists and non-Sandinists  alike, because when we return to power in the next elections, we  are going to govern for the progress of the entire nation.    The essence of the FSLN is its democratic spirit. We want to  democratize Nicaraguan society. We tried to do so during the  revolutionary government through agrarian reform, education, and  the single health-care system, but we did not progress to the  internal running of the FSLN. The methods of the historic  National Directorate did not permit this, perhaps owing to the  influence of its underground past, and they justified these  methods by citing outside aggression. Today, however, the  democratic spirit of Sandino must once again take hold of the  minds and deeds of Sandinists. We must not allow creativity,  freedom of individual thought, and collective consensus to be  crushed. The democratization of the FSLN begins with respect for  individuals and with not allowing people who seem to be one  thing but who are quite the opposite to impose their unhealthy  wills.    The FSLN is opposed to dictatorship on principle. The FSLN  emerged as the antithesis of Somoza's dictatorial system. A  dictatorship is, in essence, the antithesis of democracy. Thus,  dictatorship means imposition, a top-down hierarchy, arrogance,  autocracy, violence, terror. This is why we in the FSLN must  never allow any trace of dictatorship. On the contrary, all  activists and the people must have confidence that our beliefs,  our judgments, and our right to elect and be elected  democratically are respected. Let us not allow leaders to be  imposed on us.    Let us democratize the FSLN. Let us bring in people who  think  and act democratically, leaders who have done a great deal for  the party and the people and who have not made it a point to  maintain their idolized image. Leaders who are in the vanguard  of thinking, who look to the future, not to the past of  violence. Leaders who think about a new Nicaragua. Leaders like  Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado, who has worked without political  propaganda, who has not availed himself of the FSLN's resources  to cultivate his image. He shines with his own light.    We Sandinists are thinking beings. The people are wise; they  know how to distinguish what is good; a people who want a better  future, a future of peace and of harmony.    Carlos J. Vegacruz B.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology: Oilseed fuel on trial The UK's first trial to assess the commercial prospects for refining oilseed rape into biodiesel begins this month. Farmway, an agricultural co-operative, plans to produce 25,000 litres of biodiesel at a Chemoxy refinery on Teesside in north-east England. The co-op will then test the fuel in one of its vehicles and three of its cars for several months. Further trials are being conducted by another farm co-op, United Oilseeds, which is running three of its cars on imported biodiesel for a year. The car emissions will be checked to see whether the fuel holds environmental benefits over conventional diesel. Farmers are looking at the prospects of finding a fuel market for produce grown on land set aside as part of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy reforms. This land cannot be used for food crops. Other countries in the EU, such as France and Italy, have established a market for fuels refined from oilseeds. But to compete with conventional fuels, these products need government tax breaks. The European Commission has proposed that biodiesel and other similar products attract lower rates of duty. However, the British government has pointed to the lack of trial data in the UK. Martin Farrow, managing director of United Oilseeds, does not expect biodiesel to achieve mass market status. 'But there is potential for its use in environmentally sensitive areas, urban transport systems, buses, taxis and waterways.' The fuel is expected to be 10p a litre more expensive than conventional diesel. Some users, on waterways, for example, may be prepared to pay for a more environmentally friendly product. Diesel spills in waterways can cause greater environmental damage than biodiesel which disperses within weeks.</p>

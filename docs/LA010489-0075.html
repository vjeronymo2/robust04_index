			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANEL URGES A U.S. 'CATCH-UP' EFFORT ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY  </P> <P> The United States is likely to fall behind Japan in the commercial exploitation  of superconductivity unless it puts more money and better organization into  long-range development, an advisory panel said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The report to President Reagan said the U.S. scientific establishment is not  organized properly for development work in fields such as superconductivity,  where important profit-making uses are at least a decade away.  </P> <P> It urged the creation of four to six superconductivity consortiums scattered  around the country that would unite university, government and industry  laboratories that are working on superconductivity.  </P> <P> The consortiums would cost the federal government about $25 million to $30  million a year, on top of the roughly $90 million the government already spends  on superconductivity research, the panel said.  </P> <P> In addition, the panel recommended an increase of "a few million dollars" a  year in grants to universities for basic research.  </P> <P> Superconductors can conduct electricity without any loss of energy from  resistance when they are kept extremely cold, raising the possibility of more  efficient engines and motors, faster computer chips and improved scientific  devices such as particle accelerators and magnetic fusion machines.  </P> <P> Newly discovered materials are superconductive with less refrigeration, which  makes them cheaper and easier to use.  </P> <P> However, the report said some of the hopes for superconductivity are overblown.  For example, magnetically levitated trains still may not be practical in spite  of higher-temperature materials, said Ralph Gomory, the chairman of the panel  and the chief scientist of International Business Machines Corp.  </P> <P> The proposed consortiums would close the gap between the short-term profit  focus of industry laboratories and the long-term scientific focus of university  laboratories, Gomory said.  </P> <P> Americans are probably "neck-and-neck" with the Japanese in basic scientific  research on superconductivity, Gomory said.  </P> <P> But the report said that in terms of commercial applications, the Japanese  effort is "better structured than the U.S. both for systematically developing  new materials and for coupling these developments closely to industry."  </P> <P> Gomory said important commercial applications are so far off that there is  plenty of time for Americans to catch up.  </P> <P> "Everybody's just out of the gate. Ahead or behind doesn't matter. What matters  is who's better structured to run," he said.  </P></p>

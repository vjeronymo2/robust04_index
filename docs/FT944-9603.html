			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Observer: Read all about it Whatever city English-speakers find themselves landing up in these days, there seems to be a local English-language newspaper ready and waiting. From the Moscow Times to the Buenos Aires Herald, someone wants to tell you what's going on in their neck of the woods. Two new ones have now joined the ranks. Prague yesterday saw the launch of the Bohemia Daily Standard, a tabloid backed by Bank Austria and publisher Erik Best, aiming for sales of 10,000 in a city with about 30,000 English-speaking expatriates. It's edited by Francis Harris, who covered the former Czechoslovakia for the UK's Daily Telegraph. Meanwhile in Switzerland, The Geneva Post was launched on Monday. Publisher Jacques Werner, a lawyer who also publishes academic journals on arcane legal matters, hopes his paper will appeal to Geneva's large expatriate community attached to numerous UN and other international organisations. Werner, who has hired former Independent foreign editor Harvey Morris as editor and is aiming to sell around 10,000 copies, apparently has only one prejudice - he doesn't want to see the phrase 'gnomes of Zurich'. So we won't mention that. But what a pity that both papers missed the chance of snapping up Andrew Neil, former editor of the Sunday Times, who has now severed most of his links with Rupert Murdoch. Maybe the Phnom Penh Post is scouting around for a new champion . . .</p>

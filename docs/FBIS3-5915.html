President Kim reaffirmed that a special envoy exchange by  South and North Korea and Pyongyang's cooperation in the IAEA  nuclear inspections are preconditions for a third round of  high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington.    Kim also stressed that Seoul and Washington should make  joint  efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem.    The third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks  cannot be held unless the two Koreas exchange special envoys, an  official at Chongwadae [presidential office] quoted Gallucci as  saying.</p>

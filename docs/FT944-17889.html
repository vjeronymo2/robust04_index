			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Post sell-off 'without any public support' The government yesterday delayed a decision on privatising the Post Office as Labour warned that it would put the fight to keep the corporation public at the forefront of its attack on the Tories. The conference unanimously voted for a motion opposing privatisation and calling for the Post Office to remain in the public sector with more commercial freedom. Downing Street said today's cabinet meeting was unlikely to make a decision on whether to press ahead with flotation of the Royal Mail. This followed contacts between Mr John Major and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, on the implications of Post Office privatisation. Although the consultative period over the Post Office's future ended last week, government officials said the Department of Trade and Industry needed more time to work through all the responses. They suggested that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may make no announcement on the Post Office's future at next week's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. Mr Heseltine, strongly backed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would like to make a quick decision in favour of selling off 51 per cent of Royal Mail. Any delay is likely to undermine their efforts to press ahead with the privatisation. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry spokesman, yesterday told his party's conference in Blackpool that the people who used the Post Office wanted it to remain public instead of being turned into someone else's business. He said: 'If the government cannot persuade the people who use the Post Office to privatise it, ministers have no right to ask the House of Commons to pass a bill to privatise it.' Mr Cook recalled that Baroness Thatcher, former prime minister, had drawn back from privatising the Post Office because of public feeling. 'I warn Michael Heseltine, John Major and the cabinet: People still feel very strongly about keeping the Post Office in the public sector.' He said Labour would put the fight to keep the corporation public in the forefront of its attack on the government when the Commons resumes next month. Mr Derek Hodgson, deputy general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, attacked Post Office management for promoting privatisation. 'They are a disgrace,' he said. 'The Post Office does not need to be exposed to the ravages of money-grabbing speculators.' After the debate the Post Office said: 'It is misleading scaremongering to talk about post office closures and loss of services. Whatever happens, the post office network will stay in the public sector, with a firm commitment that it remains a nationwide service.'</p>

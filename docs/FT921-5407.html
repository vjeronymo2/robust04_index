			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (8): Sector grows fast in a decade of change - Insurance THE PORTUGUESE insurance sector has gone through as much change in a decade as most industries would experience in a lifetime, and the challenge is not over yet. Nationalisation, mergers, the growth of underdeveloped types of insurance, an influx of foreign investors, and changes in both the products and the way they are sold: every factor imaginable has been subject to incredible flux. Celso Cardoso do Amaral, managing director of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), a French-based international insurance company, reflects the change. When asked what challenges he sees for the future for his company, he leaps eagerly to his feet in an elegant boardroom, and flicks back the pages of two flipcharts behind him. They show rapidly-written scrawls on many sheets, evidence of brainstorming which has taken place only a few days earlier with senior colleagues. UAP is in the throes of adjustment to the merger of four companies: Alianca Seguradora, UAP Portugal, UAP Portugal Vida and Garantia. 'We have sorted out our logo and decided on our new name: UAP-Allianca,' he says proudly. 'Now we have a five-year plan. Our priorities are to harmonise internal systems, improve performance per employee, and to do it as fast as possible.' In another, rather humbler, office only a few minutes away across Lisbon, adjustments of a different kind are going on. Mr Nuno Cardoso da Silva, director of marketing at Mundial Confianca, one of the state-owned insurance companies, is preparing for privatisation. A few years ago, three nationalised companies were merged into the present one. The business is perhaps still adjusting to that influence. But now it is having to prepare for the uncertainties of private ownership and an increasingly competitive insurance market, while still digesting the effects of over-staffing of the last few years. 'We were probably the only successful merger at the time it happened,' says Mr Cardoso da Silva. 'It was highly profitable and all very nice. But I am less optimistic about the future. Whatever happened in the past bears no relation to what will happen now.' If there were a book on the recent history of insurance in Portugal, it would probably begin in 1974. Previously there had been a regulated and stable market, which remained almost unchanged for more than 40 years. Then came the Revolution, and with it, nationalisation. About 23 companies were taken into state ownership. Many of the existing executives trained in the sector left the boards. Other qualified staff drifted away. Contact with international insurance organisations came to an end. Renewed change did not take long, however. In 1976, the National Insurance Institute was created under the auspices of the ministry of finance. Many laws and regulations were reviewed. Ruy de Carvalho, president of the Association of Portuguese Insurers, says there then followed a 'very shy liberalisation' over the next decade, partly in preparation for membership of the European Community. Actions on solvency margins, third-party liability and freedom of establishment (determining who could set up in business) were taken, to bring Portugal into line with its other European counterparts, he says. There were innovations in the development of work-based compensation. Automobile insurance became compulsory. The 23 state insurance companies were merged into six large groups, while foreign companies began to nibble at the market again. 'We were very close to economic chaos,' says Mr Carvalho. 'It seems incredible today but not at that time.' It was not until the late 1980s that a clause in the Portuguese constitution forbidding privatisation was overturned. But for several years, the government had allowed the nationalised companies to act almost as if they were private. From 44 companies in 1983, the sector has now grown to about 80. Many are branch offices of foreign insurance companies, led numerically by British owners, followed by the Germans and the French. Foreign companies collected 19 per cent of all Portuguese premiums in 1980. Last year the figure had increased to 28 per cent. Aside from Acoreana, which deals with insurance in the Azores, only two directly state-owned insurance companies remain to be fully sold to the private sector: Mundial and Imperio. Both sales should be completed this year. That leaves two others - Fidelidade and Cosec  - which are owned through state-controlled financial conglomerates. One of these at least may soon also be sold. Portugal still represents only a tiny part of the European market for insurance, with an estimated market share of 0.5 per cent. But it is developing fast. The ratio of premiums to gross domestic product, which stood at 2 per cent for many years, is now at about 4 per cent and rapidly growing towards the European average of 6 per cent. The penetration for non-life business is already roughly comparable. Life business is far less developed, and has experienced rapid compensatory expansion in the last few years as a result, growing by 80 per cent in 1989, more than 50 per cent in 1990 and at an estimated rate of 33 per cent in 1991. At the same time, there has been a lot of product innovation, says Mr Carvalho. The re-opening of the Portuguese stock exchange opened opportunities for creating new life products. 'In the old days, we had products we tried to sell to customers,' he says. 'Now we have clients and try to understand what they need.' The distribution network, for insurance, is still tightly controlled, with work from agents and brokers representing 60-65 per cent of premiums. However, the banks and even the post office are beginning to take a share of business. Before his enthusiasm goes too far, however, Mr Carvalho stops, almost in mid-sentence. 'That's the good news. Now let's deal with the bad,' he says. Many of the insurance companies appear to be overstaffed. That reflects political decisions by the state to find jobs for all those returning from its former colonies, and also to provide guarantees during the mergers within the sector. It is still extremely difficult to fire people. Profit levels are unsatisfactory. In fact, at 2 per cent of premiums with current inflation, Mr Carvalho estimates that there are no profits being made at the moment, although premiums continue to fall. Regulation and taxes on premiums remain. 'Personally, I feel that the companies have to do something about the level of competition,' he says. 'From now until 1995 there will be difficult times. This year will be the most difficult.' Mr Cardoso do Amaral, of UAP, concedes the same point. 'We must be viable and profitable,' he says. 'These are words not often used in the insurance industry in Portugal.'</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / French missile bid stirs row: George Graham on US anger at Thomson-CSF's move to buy missiles division of US defence contractor THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, has provoked a storm in Washington over its efforts to buy the missiles division of LTV, the US steel and industrial group operating under bankruptcy protection. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a review body chaired by the Treasury, this week decided to launch a full investigation of the deal under the Exon-Florio rules, introduced in 1988 to give the president the power to block or reverse any foreign acquisition that 'threatens to impair the national security'. But, even before the formal CFIUS review has begun, Thomson-CSF has come under fire from Congress. The French group's representatives have been grilled by a series of hostile Congressional investigative committees. Two of the Senate's most senior members, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, have sponsored a bill to ban the deal. The Bush administration's decision on LTV's missile business - which is involved in top-secret US military programmes, such as the Losat anti-tank missile and the MLRS anti-artillery missile system - could foreshadow US policy on an expected wave of foreign acquisitions in sensitive technology areas. As military purchasing budgets shrink, the US defence industry is restructuring. Some industry executives estimate that 100 subsidiaries, divisions or units of defence contractors are up for sale. Many of these are likely to interest foreign buyers. 'The LTV case offers the president an opportunity to demonstrate that, in fact, he has a strategy for America's defence industrial base in the post-Cold War era,' said Senator James Exon, co-author of the Exon-Florio rules. LTV at first agreed in February to sell its missile and aircraft business as a whole for Dollars 355m to a consortium formed by Lockheed and Martin Marietta, two leading US defence contractors. In April Thomson-CSF bid Dollars 280m for the missiles division, coupled with a Dollars 120m bid for the aircraft division from Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchant bank headed by Mr Frank Carlucci, the former defence secretary. After a round of bidding, the New York bankruptcy judge presiding over LTV awarded the two units to Thomson-CSF and Carlyle for a total of Dollars 450m. Opposition to the Thomson-CSF-LTV deal focuses on three points of concern: The security of secret US military technologies. Thomson-CSF's state ownership, which its competitors fear could give it unfair subsidies, cheap capital and political advantages. Hostility to France, which has been described by senators as 'aggressive', 'stubborn' and 'cocksure', and accused of widespread industrial espionage against the US. Thomson-CSF has already begun discussions with the defence department about measures to protect US secrets. These include a 'special security arrangement' by which classified information would be placed under the control of a special committee of US citizens with the necessary security clearances. Pentagon officials appear, however, to be happy with this kind of arrangement only up to the 'Secret' level of classification. In past foreign acquisitions involving 'Top Secret' or 'Comsec' classifications, the Pentagon has insisted that control of the company be placed in the hands of a voting trust or of proxies. 'It has to become a passive ownership or it doesn't fly,' said Mr Donald Atwood, deputy secretary of defence, last month. Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive of Lockheed, argues that even proxies or voting trusts are inadequate protection, since it is at the level of a company's engineers that technology is transferred. Mr Carlucci retorts that Thomson-CSF engineers already have access to their US pany's participation in US programmes, such as the US Army's MSE battlefield communications system based on Thomson-CSF's Rita system. 'Thomson-CSF already bids on defence department contracts. It has at least 20 classified contracts now. The only question is whether it should bid offshore or onshore,' he says. On the issue of government ownership, Thomson-CSF has an even harder task defending itself. 'What we have here is a policy problem involving government involvement in the free enterprise system, and the two are like oil and water,' said Mr Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta. More troubling, however, is the extent of anti-French sentiment displayed in the tussle over the LTV deal. Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina is perhaps the most overtly xenophobic member of the Senate, but his gibes are usually directed at the Japanese and the Koreans. Of the French, he said: 'We love each other. I've stood on tables all over France singing the Marseillaise.' But in a barbed exchange with Mr Carlucci, he placed France alongside Iraq in his pandemonium. 'I couldn't possibly see General (Norman) Schwarzkopf being employed by Saddam Hussein to train his troops. Why should we allow you to come in now as a former Secretary of Defence and take over our defence technology for France?' he said. The old days of ever-expanding military budgets are over, however. Today's procurement budgets may not sustain even a single domestic supplier in many areas of defence technology, let alone competing suppliers. The alternative to foreign acquisition may, for many US defence companies, be shutdown.</p>

Today is January 8 in the Tibetan Lunar Calendar.    Hundreds of thousands of people from the urban Lhasa and its  outskirts came by foot, taxi or tractors to monasteries such as  Zhebung, Gandain, Sera and Johkang to give alms and pray.    At the Zhebung Monastery, over 500 monks sat in the hall of  the temple to recite the Buddhist sutra. There were huge crowds  of Buddhists, many of whom went among the monks to give them  money as alms.    A worker from the Tibetan autonomous regional oil company  gave the monks a huge sum of money and told XINHUA that he came  with two wishes: namely a wish for good luck for all the members  of his family and a wish for God's protection of the soul of his  late father.    Leading members of various departments of the Tibetan  autonomous regional government also went to the temples to  prepare food for the lama monks and the Buddhists. The regional  government allocated a total of 150,000 yuan for the event,  according to a government official.    Moinlam Qenmo, meaning summons ceremony, dates back to 1409,  the year Tsong Kapa, founder of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan  Lamaism, sponsored the first such event. The Buddhist service  will reach its peak in a week's time, on January 15 of the  Tibetan calendar.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATED SOLUTION URGED BY BAPTISTS  </P> <P> The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc., the nation's third-largest  Protestant denomination, Friday urged the United States to negotiate a  settlement with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis, "no matter how horrific the  position of Saddam Hussein might appear."  </P> <P> About 1,500 delegates to the black denomination's annual meeting in Los Angeles  approved without debate a resolution that reflected the stance of National  Baptist President T. J. Jemison.  </P> <P> Jemison had said Wednesday that he supports President Bush's deployment of  troops but does not want American lives lost because of oil.  </P> <P> The resolution also praised one of the denomination's own ministers, the Rev.  Jesse Jackson, for his "courageous efforts to get the release of hostages" when  he met with Iraqi President Hussein in Baghdad late last month.  </P></p>

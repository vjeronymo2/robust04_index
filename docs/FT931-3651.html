			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Boycott threatens school rankings TEACHERS' boycotts could make it impossible to carry out testing in schools as part of implementing the national curriculum, Mr John Patten, education secretary, has been warned. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the NAHT, the largest union representing headteachers, has warned Mr Patten in a letter that industrial action against tests threatens the compilation of school performance league tables. On Friday the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, instructed its members to boycott assessment and testing associated with the government's national curriculum. The NUT, the largest teaching union, will ballot its members in May over plans to boycott just the English tests for 14-year-olds. Mr Hart said that headteachers could not always be expected to administer the tests if the boycotts occurred. A boycott would be the first industrial action by teachers over a professional issue, he said, and heads may be unwilling to instruct other teachers to do the work. In some cases heads may have to cancel tests in one or more subjects, Mr Hart said, if boycotts meant that the results would not 'properly reflect the performance of the school'. He added: 'This means that the results would not be reported to parents, governors or local education authorities and they would not be forwarded for national collation or publication. A head cannot be expected to insist upon testing taking place where the extent of industrial action would lead to a flawed picture.' The test results are used in compiling school performance league tables, a central plank of the government's education policy. The government's scope to compel heads to administer tests appears to be limited, according to Mr Hart. Teachers could do more to use test results to plan their work, according to the Ofsted, the schools inspectorate. Reviewing progress in implementing the national curriculum, the inspectors say that the results are often ignored by teachers in planning school work. Ofsted says pupils' strengths and weaknesses as revealed in tests should be used to prepare work which reflects their differing abilities.</p>

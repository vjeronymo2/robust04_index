			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, ITAR-TASS </F> column under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric: "Press  Will Not Survive Without Concessions"]    [Text] "The only way of preventing an information vacuum  is to provide the Russian mass media with tax, financial, and  customs concessions."    Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko voiced that  opinion at a meeting with journalists yesterday. As you know,  he has sent the State Duma a draft law "On State Protectionism  Toward the Russian Mass Media" by way of a legislative  initiative.    Vladimir Shumeyko believes that all the mass media, apart  from promotional and erotic publications, should be exempt from  profits tax. The draft law that he is proposing contains the  following stance: "The editorial offices of mass media,  publishing houses, printing enterpries, television and radio  companies, news agenices, and a number of other organizations  'are not liable to value added tax, tax on enterprises' land and  property, or profit tax in respect of the proportion payable  into the federal budget.'"    The government has sent a similar law to the State Duma.</p>

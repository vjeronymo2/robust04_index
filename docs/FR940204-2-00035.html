			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects funded by the DOE Industrial Combustion Equipment Program are generally phased, but it is not required that they be phased. Phase I typically involves an expansion of market and economic estimates based on those presented in the proposal, the identification and finalization of host site arrangements, additional laboratory (bench scale) or theoretical evaluation of the system proposed, and development of a business plan. Phase II typically encompasses development, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a pilot scale unit. Additional economic evaluations are generally conducted to assess commercial scale systems. Phase III typically encompasses the installation and testing of a demonstration (proof-of-concept) scale unit at an industrial host facility. Tasks in more than one phase may be addressed simultaneously. For the purpose of cost share determination, Phase I and Phase II tasks are considered to be research and development while Phase III tasks are demonstration. The demonstration is designed to provide industry with credible data to accelerate the adoption of new technology combustion equipment. A commercial product that improves the efficiency, reduces emissions, and enhances the competitiveness of U.S. industry is expected to result from each project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Project Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This solicitation is to promote new and advanced natural gas utilization technologies for the research, development and demonstration of cost effective, very low emission industrial natural gas combustion equipment in intermediate temperature applications which will improve efficiency and reduce emissions without the need for post-combustion controls. This approach to emissions control reflects the view that it is substantially more economical to prevent pollution than to eliminate it after it has been produced. This proposed technology may be a retrofit to existing systems or may require totally new systems. A commercial end product is the main objective of each project funded by this solicitation. Awardees will be required to prepare a business plan that illustrates how the equipment end product will be commercialized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed technology must meet the current EPA Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) NOx standards without add-on emission controls such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). The NOx target value for intermediate temperature range industrial combustion equipment for the purposes of this solicitation will be 9 ppm or less at 3% excess oxygen. Not only are NOx emissions to be low, the emissions of other undesirable products of combustion are to be within EPA specifications or low (if no source specifications have been promulgated) as well. Included are carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, and air toxics. For the purpose of this solicitation the CO target value will be 50 ppm or less. Regulations for air toxics and hydrocarbons have not yet been developed for the types of industrial boilers, furnaces, etc, which are the subject of this solicitation. Additional information for air toxics and hydrocarbons is contained in Title I and Title III of the 1990 CAAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The focus of the project(s) to result from this solicitation is on natural gas combustion equipment with low emissions production from intermediate temperature industrial combustion applications. For the purposes of this solicitation, the intermediate temperature range includes process steam applications (all temperatures), direct heat, and process fluid heating applications between 800 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 2000 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. Examples of direct heating applications (but not limited by this list) include heat transfer from combustion gasses to a heat sink such as used in metals processing, calcining, smelting, annealing, forging, and melting. Examples of process fluid heating applications include petroleum refining, distillation, and oil loop heating. Internal combustion engines, gas turbines and waste incinerator applications are excluded from this solicitation. It would be advantageous if the equipment developed were applicable to more than one industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All projects that are within the above project description are eligible for consideration under this solicitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of possible projects include, but are not limited to: (1) Optimization of porous radiant burner heat transfer; (2) catalytic combustion burner for furnaces and boilers; (3) inert porous media furnace/boiler, and; (4) precombustion chamber burner for heavy oils which facilitate interruptible natural gas usage. Additional information will be provided for these four technologies in a paper included in the pre-applicant package entitled, ``Very Low Emission Industrial Combustion Equipment, Research and Development''. It is stressed, these are example projects only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is intended that during the demonstration phase, emissions are to be measured using a certified methodology by an independent commercial emissions measurement company. If ``before and after'' measurements are warranted, the above is to be used for both to assure the quality of the results obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

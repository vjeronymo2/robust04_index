This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during operational checks of evacuation slides on in-service airplanes, the inflation valves failed to deploy the evacuation slide properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically on demand, which would necessitate the flight crew to manually deploy the slide; this situation could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during an emergency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by January 4, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;163&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The CAA advises that, during operational checks of evacuation slides on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes, the inflation valves failed to deploy the evacuation slide properly. Subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation, conducted by Air Cruisers (the manufacturer of the evacuation slides),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revealed that the existing design of the inflation valves requires excessive operating pull  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> force to activate deployment of the evacuation slide. This condition, if not corrected,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could result in failure of the evacuation slide to deploy automatically, which necessitates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flight crew to manually deploy the slide. This situation could delay or impede the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evacuation of passengers during an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 25&hyph;328, Revision 2, dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 10, 1993, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections to verify proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deployment of the evacuation slide at each door position, and various follow-on actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to correct discrepancies. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addditionally, Air Cruisers Company has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 201&hyph;25&hyph;17,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dated June 4, 1992, which describes procedures for modification of the inflation valve of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the evacuation slide. This modification entails replacing the existing valve with a new,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved valve. The new valve has a lower maximum operating pull force, which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the evacuation slide to deploy automatically on demand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require repetitive inspections to verify proper deployment of the evacuation slide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at each door position, and various follow-on actions to correct discrepancies. The proposed AD would also require modification of the inflation valve of the evacuation slide, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 41 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $8,610, or $210 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act.

A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

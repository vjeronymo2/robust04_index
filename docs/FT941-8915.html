			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Observer: Odd man out How come John Major didn't include a doctor in his team for Moscow? Given that there has been so much speculation about the health of Russia's President Yeltsin, it might have been helpful if the PM's quack was on hand, especially since Yeltsin is not going to have any more foreign visitors for several months to come. In the good old communist days, foreign governments often seemed more interested in how long Russia's leaders would last physically rather than politically. When Harold Wilson visited the Kremlin in the 1960s, he took along his personal physician with the sole aim of getting an arm's-length diagnosis of whether Andre Gromyko, Russia's foreign minister, was nearing the end of his innings. Sadly, the only thing that Wilson's doctor could conclude was that there was something wrong with Gromyko's jaw.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bui Thien Ngo, Politburo member and interior </F> minister, by Hong Vinh; date and place not given]    [Text] [Hong] Could you please give an overall evaluation  of recent important changes in the struggle against corruption  and smuggling?    [Bui] In implementing Directive No. 15 dated 20 November  1992  issued by the CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and the  Decision No. 114 dated 21 November 1992 by the prime minister on  suppressing and eliminating corruption and smuggling, the  government has tried to direct the ministries, sectors, and  localities in carrying out various important measures and has  achieved significant initial progress. The determination of the  party and state in radically suppressing corruption and  smuggling received widespread support from the cadres and  people. There have been more corruption and smuggling cases  detected and handled strictly than before.    [Hong] But, Dear Minister, our cadres and people still have  a  lot to worry about in regard to these problems.    [Bui] That is correct. Although the direction has been more  resolute than before, our achievements were still very limited,  and in some areas the number of corruption cases even grew.  Areas of great concern are basic construction, real estate, and  illegal automobile and motorcycle imports through the ports and  southwestern borders. These activities occur mainly in major  economic sectors like trade, construction, communication and  transportation, marine products, agriculture, and the food  industry. Many agencies and authorities have allowed individual  traders to use their power to engage in smuggling activities.  In the first 10 months of this year, we discovered 918  corruption cases involving 285 billion dong, 95 percent more in  terms of the number of cases and 244 percent higher in terms of  the money involved compared with the same period last year.  Corruption was detected, not only in economic and business  agencies, but also in law enforcement agencies or in agencies  directly charged with preventing and fighting corruption and  smuggling, such as customs, taxation, public security,  inspection, courts, and so forth.    [Hong] What are typical recent examples of corruption?    [Bui] Analyzing the cases detected, we can list some general  types of corruption activities as follows:    Violating laws and regulations relating to budget  expenditure and income.    Abusing joint business ventures by colluding with foreign  partners to cheat in import-export activities.    Violating state regulations on real estate management and  basic construction.    The most serious situation was the popular trend of  wrong-doing among leading cadres at some ministries, sectors,  and localities, who only care about their sector's benefit and  ignore the laws and regulations. They even go beyond their  authority to set up economic and financial regulations  themselves, thus assisting corruption and smuggling activities  and worsening the already complicated situation.    [Hong] Dear Minister, what are the noteworthy features of  the  struggle against smuggling?    [Bui] There was a reduction of smuggling directly involving  state authorities and economic agencies under social and  political organizations. The implementation of verification and  control measures, though still bearing many shortcomings, has  begun to help the concerned agencies recognize those  professional smugglers, punish them severely, and repress the  haughty and challenging attitude of the smugglers towards the  government.    The smuggling situation, however, is still very serious,  because it has become so complicated and diversified in various  regions and localities, at different points of time, with some  hot spots being the southwestern border, the northern border,  and at sea. These are some emerging issues:    violations of lumber export regulations are common    smuggling of foreign cigarettes along the west and  south-west borders is on the rise, even more openly than before    automobile smuggling through the southwestern border is  still serious    for items whose importation is prohibited, or whose import  permits are cancelled temporarily, the smugglers still find ways  to elude control measures and investigation    smuggling at sea has become more complicated    Most major smuggling activities (via sea, air, and inland  routes) involved using state-owned vehicles and ships, by either  arrangement by the people in charge of the media with the  smugglers, or the state economic agencies directly carrying out  the smuggling themselves. The concern is that there has been  collusion among smugglers, corrupt people, and degenerate cadres  in the forces directly in charge of smuggling suppression.    [Hong] Could the minister please outline the policies and  measures to suppress corruption and smuggling?    [Bui] The report of the government to the fourth session of  the Ninth National Assembly has outlined the following policies  and measures:    1. Reorganize, adjust, and complete the current system and  policies relating to the suppression of corruption and smuggling.    The government will soon issue documents to distinguish the  state management authority with production and business  management functions of ministries and sectors. For the near  future, the government is going to issue preliminary documents  on public service regulations, government employee awards, and  on a number of urgent issues such as regulations on receiving  gifts and bonuses, expenditure of public fund, and so forth.    2. Heighten responsibility of leaders of all agencies in  fighting corruption and smuggling.    3. The law enforcement authorities will concentrate on  regions and areas where conditions allow smugglers and corrupt  people to make connections with degenerate cadres, in order to  fight corruption and smuggling effectively.    4. The law enforcement agencies will take up resolute  measures to consolidate and cleanse the organizations. They  also have to promote clean and just cadres for this campaign.    5. The ministries, sectors, and localities should  regularly scrutinize the implementation of government decisions  on anti-corruption and anti-smuggling work.    6. Consolidate the ancillary anti-corruption and  anti-smuggling bodies within ministries, sectors, and  localities. Determine clearly the responsibility and power of  these bodies to ensure their effective operation.    [Hong] Thank you, Dear Minister.</p>

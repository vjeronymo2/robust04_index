			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Losses deepen 10-fold at Hoogovens on price cuts STEEP PRICE cuts and a stream of cheap imports from eastern Europe helped push Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, into heavy losses in 1992. This has forced the company to omit a dividend for the second consecutive year. Hoogovens' net loss widened to Fl 595m (Dollars 318m), a 10-fold increase from its 1991 loss of Fl 51m. More than half of the loss was due to after-tax provisions of Fl 370m which were taken to pay for job cuts and write-offs. Although first-half losses in 1993 are likely to match the deficit seen in the 1992 second half, the company expects to see a turnround in the downward trend in the course of the first six months, thanks to its own cost-cutting efforts as well as to firmer prices and rising demand in the market. Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said Hoogovens would be able to ride out Europe's steel crisis 'under its own steam'. Price increases for steel announced in January were holding a development which he described 'as very good news but something that was badly needed'. In 1992, steel prices slumped by 6 per cent, taking the cumulative decline since 1989 to 20 per cent. Yesterday's figures were less gloomy than analysts had feared, and the shares closed up 9.2 per cent at Fl 27.30. In steel, losses widened to Fl 234m from Fl 98m. The aluminium sector, badly hit by a flood of primary metal from the former Soviet Union, swung into a loss of Fl 162m from a marginal profit of Fl 3m a year earlier. The 1992 losses helped push down shareholders' equity to 21.2 per cent of total assets from 27.4 per cent in 1991. The company aims to strengthen its finances by reducing inventories and deconsolidating some non-core activities, either by divesting or hiving them off into partnerships. It gave no details but cited the example of its recent venture in scrap metal with Klockner of Germany. Hoogovens will also use part of its Fl 1bn stand-by credit facility from ABN Amro and Rabobank towards meeting up to Fl 700m in 1993 loan redemptions. The credit facility, formed in 1986, has never not been used until now.</p>

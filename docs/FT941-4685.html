			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Accountancy Column: Transformation of practice not always as easy as ABC - A look at the challenges facing management accounting Since the late 1980s, management accounting has faced the strongest and most vociferous challenges ever for its transformation. The profession needs to embrace new initiatives without throwing out all the experience of the past. New forms of technology, 'leaner' production and organisational processes, and demands for product quality and diversity at the lowest cost have all encouraged more receptive attitudes to new management ideas. There has been a greater willingness to question existing long established practices, and to borrow ideas from other countries. Advocates of the transformation of management accounting have urged the use of a rich portfolio of new techniques and processes including activity-based costing (ABC) - which allocates overheads between the different components of the production process - and its more advanced variants, such as activity-based budgeting and activity-based cost management. Our new book* that coincides with the 75th anniversary of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants proposes various immediate needs for change. It also warns of the pitfalls of jettisoning management accounting approaches which have stood the test of time in favour of unthinkingly deploying a variety of emerging accounting techniques which are not proven to be superior. First, it is essential to recognise that the management accountant has a duty to go beyond fulfilling a watchdog function and needs positively to develop mechanisms of significant use to managers. One area of great promise is a much greater use of non-financial information, reflecting the enormous explosion of - often real time - information available from production processes. At present, there is a lack of research and documented practical experience of the changes needed in management accounting in globalised businesses. The current fast pace of developments has created an environment generally conducive to reform, making it far easier for the accountant to act as an agent of change than ever before. This is especially true when working in cross-functional managerial teams operating near to the market. Management accountants can help mobilise managers in ways which would otherwise be neglected. Accounting mechanisms do not operate in isolation from organisational or managerial factors. In exploring the potential of novel techniques in management accounting, attention must be paid to inter-relationships between accounting activities and other business processes. Accounting must be grounded far more fully in the technology of the enterprises than previously. Many companies are experimenting with new accounting approaches, and others have gone further. Novelty has become convention in many cases and the change is irreversible. However, even a combination of new techniques can neither shore up a poorly managed organisation nor convert badly managed businesses into those on the leading edge. Such typical problems need far more than a change in accounting techniques. Accounting's role often expands as enterprise activities grow. For example, manufacturer-supplier relationships are in many industries becoming much more partnership oriented, allowing greater contact between purchasers and suppliers. This requires an expansion of the role of accounting in channelling information effectively and in helping to improve the joint efficiency of such partnerships. It seems to be difficult to make significant changes to accounting systems, perhaps because they reflect both informal and formal organisational structures and may help to sustain the organisation's power structure. For whatever reason, it can be reasonably said that only about 10 per cent of large companies are using activity-based costing in a substantial way. Many others are still thinking about it or are involved in fairly minor experiments. There is no doubt that activity-based costing is better than using simply the volume of production units when trying to understand overheads that vary directly as a result of clear and unique factors. However, the conditions required to legitimately apply these approaches are more restrictive than has been recognised. The use of ABC works best where factors that affect costs can be identified and where each activity can be demonstrated or assumed to be relatively unaffected by the level of the company's other activities. Its use in suitable circumstances helps to make understandable the behaviour of some costs which are presently lumped together as overheads and then allocated. It also helps to make the behaviour of some costs far more visible, especially those which yield benefits to the consumer. These include quality and warranty, and those associated with manufacturing flexibility, which are more controllable and more susceptible to cost management. By contrast, traditional management accounting methods submerge these costs as general overheads. A significant contribution of ABC is the strategic and management questions it poses, making the technique a general decision-making tool rather than purely an accounting technique. Accounting control measures can be used in a way that sometimes induces short termism by managers. The concern with monthly variances, many of which are beyond the control of managers, provides one example. In many instances, planning and monitoring performance may be improved if the emphasis is shifted away from the specific responsibility for mistakes to using the information for re-planning and development. There is a strong argument for companies to introduce a strategic dimension to accounting. They should determine the costs associated with strategies employed by the business and monitor the cost structure of competitors. Strategic management accounting (SMA) seeks to make such costs visible to management and allows strategy to be forced down the organisation. A major difficulty possibly inhibiting the use of SMA is the perception that it makes impossible information demands. However, much of the information needed for strategic management accounting is already collected by 'well managed' companies. The Japanese practice of 'target costing' has a role to play here. Target costing takes the price of a product or service from the market, thereby determining the maximum production cost required to support this price, and seeks in planning to reduce existing costs to such a level. It is not suggested that this and other Japanese techniques should be unthinkingly introduced. But their emphasis on using accounting for continuous cost reduction, such as 'taxing' expensive uses of components or labour, should be considered. Leading edge management accounting in both theory and practice is addressing relevant modern problems tied to the search for world class competitiveness, customer orientation and dynamic entrepreneurialism. A major aim must be to position the management accountant to play a full role in both the increasing number of more informally managed and cross-functional organisations and in the full set of relationships encountered in modern organisations. These are key ingredients of growth, not just for the profession but for industrial concerns and the national economy as a whole.

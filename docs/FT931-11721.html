			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai carrier registers 85% fall in net profits THAI Airways International, Thailand's partially-privatised national airline, yesterday reported an 85 per cent fall in net profits to Bt120.01m (Dollars 4.7m) for the first quarter to December 31, down from Bt792.23m a year earlier, AP-DJ reports. Gross revenues edged up 0.3 per cent to Bt14.09m from Bt14.05m, but operating revenues fell 1.7 per cent to Bt12.19m. Pre-tax profits, meanwhile, tumbled 88 per cent to Bt144.44m from Bt1.61bn. Operating profits from airline activities fell 61 per cent to Bt638.89m from Bt1.63bn. Charges for aircraft depreciation rose 29 per cent to Bt1.89bn. The airline's shares, which began trading in July, represent nearly 6 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Thai stock market. The share price fell Bt1 yesterday to Bt53.00 in moderate trading. Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research lowered its earnings forecast for the full fiscal year to Bt2.2bn from Bt4bn. It said it had expected the airline to derive Bt1.5bn of its profit from the sale of three DC-10 and four Airbus jets this year. However, the decline in earnings in the latest period was 'larger than we were going for,' Ms Sarah Knaggs, BZW analyst, said. She noted the first-quarter result was particularly significant because it came during the tourist high season, when the airline was expected to pull in the most revenue. Thai Airways company said an explanation of the steep fall in earnings would be released today, following disclosure to the stock exchange authorities.</p>

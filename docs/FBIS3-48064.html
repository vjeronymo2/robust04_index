			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larry Jagan from the "Current International </F> Affairs" program]    [Text] The Karen National Union [KNU], the strongest armed  minority group in Burma, is still hoping to hold peace talks  with the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] jointly  with other minority groups.    In his birthday speech to members of the Burmese opposition  groups gathered at Manerplaw yesterday, General Saw Bo Mya  reassured them the KNU will hold talks with the SLORC in  accordance with the principles laid down by the Democratic  Alliance of Burma [DAB]. Gen. Saw Bo Mya also stressed the need  for continued unity in the opposition movement. Larry Jagan, in  his report, noted the 12 students detained at Manerplaw were  released in view of this desired unity.    A report from the group leader of the All Burma Students'  Democratic Front [ABSDF] and other sources claimed ABSDF leader  Moe Thee Zun is now safe and secure. An opposition source at  the Thai-Burma border noted the KNU released the 12 students  detained on Sunday. The students also explained that the  misunderstandings have now been cleared. According to  yesterday's announcement of the National Council of the Union of  Burma [NCUB], which includes the armed minority groups,  students, and Dr. Sein Win's National Coalition Government of  the Union of Burma [NCGUB] -- a Burmese opposition group, the  students were not really detained but instead were holding talks  with KNU leaders. An opposition source said the KNU is worried  about students taking KNU-supplied arms out of KNU- controlled  areas, which they agreed not to do from the very beginning. The  NCUB announcement claimed no problems exists between the KNU and  the student armed wing and other allied groups.    An opposition source from the border explained the students  are getting very worried about their position since all the  opposition minority armed groups are holding peace talks with  the SLORC military government. According to the source, Gen.  Saw Bo Mya personally affirmed the students have nothing to  worry about and that they are always welcome. Gen. Saw Bo Mya  also guaranteed the safety of the students in KNU-controlled  areas. There is no doubt differences in opinion existed between  the students and the minority groups in connection with the  cease-fire talks. At a meeting held in Manerplaw a few days  ago, members of the NCUB emphatically stressed the need for  unity in the entire opposition movement. At present, although  some members still criticize and condemn the SLORC's peace talks  with individual groups, they also want to prevent the  disintegration of the opposition movement. All the member  groups understand that if the opposition movement disintegrates,  it will become favorable for the SLORC who desires to crush the  opposition.    The KNU leader, Gen. Saw Bo Mya, reiterated in his speech at  his 66th birthday celebrations held at Manerplaw yesterday, that  the KNU prefers all opposition groups to hold peace talks with  SLORC together. Gen. Saw Bo Mya noted, although the KNU will  hold peace talks, it will also discuss human rights issue, the  freedom of all national races, and other political problems with  the SLORC. He said the peace agreement reached separately with  various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace in  Burma. Next, Gen. Saw Bo Mya appealed to all other armed  organizations to work for national reconciliation and urged them  to participate in the roundtable peace negotiations with SLORC.  A KNU spokesman said no date has yet been fixed for the first  preliminary peace talks between the KNU and SLORC.    Although the KNU leader has been insisting the peace talks  be  held in Bangkok, most observers expect the talks to be held in  Yangon [Rangoon]. The Thai foreign minister, Prasong Sunsiri,  said yesterday the Thai Government will consider accepting the  peace talks proposal only when the SLORC government legally  informs the Thai Government.</p>

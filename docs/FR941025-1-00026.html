			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has reviewed information about burn deaths and injuries to children younger than one year old associated with sleepwear, including a report prepared in 1978 in conjunction with a proposed exemption for sleepwear garments smaller than size 1 (11). The 1978 report discussed 66 cases in which children younger than one year old sustained burn injuries associated with clothing. In ten cases, the clothing involved was specifically identified as sleepwear; nine of these involved whole-house conflagrations and the other involved a home-made sleepwear garment. Consequently, none of these cases involved risks of injury which the sleepwear standards were intended to address. In all but two of the ten cases involving sleepwear garments, the burn victims were older than six months (11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering comments received in response to the ANPR (6), child development literature (12), and available injury data (10), the Commission finds that the sleepwear garments intended for children younger than six months of age may not present an unreasonable risk of burn deaths or injuries to children. For this reason, the Commission has reason to believe that the standard for sizes 0 through 6X in its existing form may not be limited to those garments which present an unreasonable risk of fire leading to death, personal injury, or significant property damage, as required by section 4(b) of the FFA. Consequently, the Commission has preliminarily decided that garments in sizes suitable for children younger than six months of age could be exempted from the requirements of the sleepwear standard for sizes 0 through 6X without decreasing the protection afforded by that standard. The Commission also concludes that the exemption should be stated in terms of maximum dimensions for the chest and length of the garment. Separate maximum length dimensions are specified for one-piece and two-piece garments. The maximum dimensions specified were selected by considering body sizes of children approximately six months old as set forth in ASTM standard D 4910&hyph;89 ``Standard Tables of Body Measurements for Infants, Ages 0 to 18 months,'' published by ASTM (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) (12).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment also requires that an exempted infant garment must be labeled with the words and figures ``0 to 6 mos.'' The label required by the proposed amendment is for the use of the Commission staff when determining whether a garment is exempted from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standard because it is intended to be worn by infants younger than six months old. For this reason, it is not required to be permanently attached to the garment, but must be visible to the consumer when the garment is offered for sale at retail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to meeting the dimensional and labeling requirements, garments in infant sizes must meet the applicable requirements of the flammability standards for clothing textiles and vinyl plastic film (16 CFR parts 1610 and 1611) to be eligible for the exemption from the children's sleepwear standard made by the amendment proposed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Can Tight-Fitting Garments Be Exempted From the Sleepwear Standards Without Reducing the Protection They Provide?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of the comments favoring exemption of tight-fitting garments from the children's sleepwear standard express the view that cotton sleepwear is as safe or safer than sleepwear which complies with the applicable standard. Other comments express support for an exemption of tight-fitting garments from the sleepwear standards if available information demonstrates that such an exemption would not reduce the protection against burn injuries provided by the standards. A small number of comments express the view that the standards should not be changed because they have effectively reduced risks of serious burn injuries to children from ignition of sleepwear garments (6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful consideration of all comments on this issue (6), technical literature (8), (11), injury data (10), and provisions of sleepwear standards in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (11), the Commission concludes that tight-fitting garments could be exempted from the standards without reducing the level of protection against burn injuries which they provide to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently available information from technical literature demonstrates that tight-fitting garments are less likely to contact an ignition source and, if ignited, burn less rapidly than loose-fitting garments (8), (11). Burn injury data indicate that in the event of clothing ignition, burn injuries associated with close-fitting garments are less severe than those associated with loose-fitting garments (10).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

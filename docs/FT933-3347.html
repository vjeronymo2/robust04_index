			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Compaq warns on growth COMPAQ, the US computer manufacturer, warned yesterday it expected relatively flat growth in its North American personal computer shipments during the second half, after achieving 40 per cent growth in the first six months of the year. Its shares closed Dollars 4 1/8 down in New York at Dollars 53 1/4 . Compaq said total sales of PCs in North America would reach 13.8m units, 15 per cent up on 1992. It attributed the slowdown in the second half to an unusually high level of shipments in the comparable period of last year, when the industry was embroiled in a price war. The North American market accounts for more than 45 per cent of turnover, which reached Dollars 4.09bn in 1992. Overseas markets, however, are becoming more important. Sales in the Asia-Pacific area are expected to grow this year by 185 per cent.</p>

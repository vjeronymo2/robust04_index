			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Yugoslav premier claims western support for reforms THE Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Ante Markovic, who is facing growing internal opposition, says he has the support of western governments for his economic reforms and his attempts to hold the country together. Some of the Yugoslav republics, notably Croatia and Serbia, remain determined to topple him and will try to do so again on Friday when Mr Markovic will ask the federal parliament who is for, and against, the reforms. Despite this dark shadow hanging over his future, Mr Markovic remains an optimist. 'We have succeeded in passing through this difficult period. The recent pledge of support - particularly from the United States and the European Community - means that Yugoslavia now has a greater chance at becoming integrated eventually into Europe,' he said. President George Bush last month sent a letter to Mr Markovic, backing his reforms. In a wide-ranging interview in London, where he is attending the inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr Markovic, prime minister for the past two years ago, said that without western support, the country would disintegrate. 'Such a Yugoslavia is in no western government's interest. For some time, western governments adopted a 'wait and see attitude'. This played into the hands of separatists who have exploited this lack of western support for the federal government. It would have isolated Yugoslavia completely from Europe, and from the main financial institutions which are necessary for the reforms to succeed.' Mr Markovic admitted that his reforms have had little effect over the past year. His attempts to impose a strict monetary policy have been undermined by Serbia which earlier this year printed money to prop up loss-making enterprises. Other republics were imposing higher taxes on enterprises to finance their budgets. 'Under these circumstances, capital investment was cut back and industrial production was falling. It will fall a further 20 per cent this year,' he said. Earnings from tourism, which total Dollars 2bn a year, are likely to plummet following a spate of ethnic unrest, the virtual collapse of JAT, the Yugoslav airline, and overpriced hotels and restaurants. Mr Markovic believes that the present struggle waged by some of the republics against the federal government is not about whether Yugoslavia should remain a federation, or a confederation of loose states. 'This comparison is merely a facade. A struggle against the reforms is taking place. It is a struggle for power - and especially totalitarian power, which caused a great setback for the reforms. We are now paying for it.' Mr Markovic believes the reforms are being hampered, not only by nationalism, but by the absence of clearly defined property rights. Last year, he had planned to replace socially-owned property, a nebulous system devised by the late President Tito which placed property outside the hands of the state and individuals. 'The basic conflict now is between those who support and oppose private ownership,' he said. The republic of Croatia, for instance, wants to transfer socially-owned property to the state, while the republic of Serbia is against individual ownership rights. 'The new governments know that if they support private ownership, they will lose their powers. That is why they want to have property in the hands of the state,' he said. Mr Markovic added that 'sooner or later, the republics will have to address why state property is inefficient. If it was not, then the other countries in eastern Europe would not be trying to move state property into private ownership. Without this kind of ownership, we will not be able to develop democracy.'</p>

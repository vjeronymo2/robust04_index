			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine looks ahead Those inclined to pessimism about the non-Russian republics of the former Soviet Union would do well to look closely at the results of Sunday's presidential elections in Ukraine and Belarus. Both polls passed off peacefully and were generally attested free and fair. Both resulted, moreover, in a genuine alternance of power and the replacement of Soviet-era incumbents - in Belarus by a populist sloganeer of uncertain policies, in Ukraine by a former missile factory manager promising gradual economic reform. Whatever now transpires, the fact that both republics have passed this test of democracy in difficult times is a remarkable and hopeful sign. Of the two, the Ukrainian result is the more encouraging. Outgoing President Leonid Kravchuk deserved credit in his time for building a sovereign state from the ruins of the Soviet one. But he failed utterly to consolidate independence by establishing a viable economy, preferring to concentrate on a series of futile disputes with Russia. The election of Mr Leonid Kuchma, who as prime minister last year flirted with reform, is a fitting verdict on Mr Kravchuk's failure, and a signal that a majority of Ukrainians now want better relations with their eastern neighbour. As a result, the new president will be able to make a fresh start - if he so chooses. By campaigning on a pro-Russian ticket, Mr Kuchma won overwhelming support in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and in the disputed region of Crimea, but he did not completely alienate the rest of the country by calling into question Ukrainian independence. His challenge now is to unite his country in confronting the twin tasks of reforming the economy and coming to terms with Russia. Neither will be easy. For Mr Kuchma to embark on serious reform will mean inflicting severe pain on the very people who got him elected, industrial workers in eastern Ukraine who look to mother Russia for economic salvation. Equally, if he anticipates much help from Moscow - whether in continuing supplies of cheap energy or in more far-reaching economic links - he may be deluding himself. The danger is that he may have raised inflated expectations as to what he can achieve on this front; subsequent disappointment may be bitter. If only for this reason, Mr Kuchma may well feel that he has no alternative but to press ahead with reform. If he does, he will add to his support in the east of the country that of nationalists in the west who yearn for policies guaranteeing them greater economic freedom. Provided he does not backtrack on promises to hand over nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, external conditions will also be set fair, with the European Union's recently concluded association agreement and the G7's promises of financial assistance. Time is short, but the desire of Ukrainian voters for change is now clear. If Mr Kuchma does not deliver, they will not be as patient with him as they were with his predecessor.</p>

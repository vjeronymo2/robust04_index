			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY AID TO CAMBODIA  </P> <P> Operation California flew the very first American relief plane into  famine-ravaged Cambodia on Thanksgiving Day, 1979. We were accompanied by a  Times reporter (Ellen Hume) who bore witness to the incredible devastation  wrought in just 3 1/2 years by the brutal Khmer Rouge regime led by Pol Pot.  </P> <P> It mystifies me why Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) can advocate ("Military Aid  Would Help Avoid a Return to the Killing Fields," Op-Ed Page, May 31) further  arms for the resistance forces of both Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the ex-Prime  Minister Son Sann's faction. Both led regimes which (with full American  military support) failed to keep the Khmer Rouge from taking over Cambodia in  April, 1975.  </P> <P> To visit the Thailand-Cambodia frontier periodically over the past 10 years is  to know clearly and convincingly that the non-communist Cambodian resistance  has failed miserably to mount more than a token military presence which has had  no effect on the Vietnam-backed Hun Sen regime and which, in fact, has fought  more military battles against their "allies" the Khmer Rouge for control over  refugee populations, black markets and clandestine trade routes into the center  of Cambodia.  </P> <P> Arming these factions is not necessarily what they themselves want (indeed,  most observers believe they will abandon their alliance with the Khmer Rouge,  return to the capitol of Phnom Penh and share power with the incumbent Hun Sen  government). Solarz probably was vehement in his opposition to President  Reagan's plans for building and deploying the MX missile but is falling into  the same trap as Reagan used so often: the bargaining chips for later  negotiation. In this case, there have been 2 million lives lost and shedding  more blood will help no one.  </P> <P> RICHARD M. WALDEN  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Operation California, Inc.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

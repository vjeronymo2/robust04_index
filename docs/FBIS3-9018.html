He said the ODS fully respected Slovakia's sovereignty and  independence and its new cabinet.    The Czech Republic considers Slovakia to be its primary  partner and has an eminent interest in "smooth, good, and  constructive relations with the Slovak Government," Klaus said.    He warned against the Czech Republic perceiving Slovakia as  so- called "near abroad." Klaus explained that this term is  appearing in the interpretation of Russia's politics which makes  no difference between domestic affairs and foreign affairs.  "They have invented the term "near abroad" in reference to  former republics of the former Soviet Union which Russia seeks  to treat differently than other foreign countries," Klaus  elaborated.</p>

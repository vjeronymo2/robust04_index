			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market welcomes RHM bid SHARES in RHM (Ranks Hovis McDougall) soared following the hostile Pounds 780m bid from Hanson closing 66 ahead at 241p - 21 above the bid price - in very heavy turnover of 14m, making it the heaviest traded stock in the market. RHM has long been rumoured a bid target as the shares have underperformed amid increasingly difficult trading conditions which has seen overcapacity rife in the milling and bakery market. Hanson, which has made little secret of its acquisitive intentions in a variety of industries, has been one of several companies said to be eyeing RHM recently. Hanson shares declined 5 1/2 to 202p. However, many in the market believe Hanson will not face a counter bid. Mr Carl Short at Nomura said: 'This is exactly what anyone waiting to buy a discreet part of RHM will have wanted.' Market sources indicated that if broken up the RHM group could be worth around Pounds 1.1bn, with the grocery products division worth about Pounds 430m and the food services business some Pounds 200m. Brokers reported institutional investors as largely supportive of the Hanson bid, although the price may have to be increased. RHM's profits have been in decline for the past five years and the board is seen as largely friendless in the City. Mr Julian Lakin at Smith New Court suggested that in the absence of a counter bid an increased offer of around 240p would likely to be acceptable to most large investors. Associated British Foods rose 9 to 409p on hopes of a restructuring of the UK bakery market. Eurotunnel weak The announcement from Eurotunnel of a seven-month delay in the planned opening of the Channel tunnel, upset an already gloomy market and sent shares tumbling, as worries of a rights issue resurfaced. The company, which reported its figures yesterday, also cut its revenue forecasts for the first year of operation. The shares responded by dropping 62 to 358p, a fall compounded by the general weakness in the market, with turnover reaching 1.6m, a hefty figure for Eurotunnel. Analysts brushed aside assurances from the company's chief executive and suggested that the delay in openning now set for December 1993 could force the company to seek further funding. Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court said of yesterday's fall: 'The market reaction is one of disappointment that we are now into a different phase of uncertainity, brought about by the delay in the opening. The implication is for some form of cash call.' Owners Abroad busy Speculative takeover talk surrounded Owners Abroad for most of the day, pushing the shares higher in brisk turnover of 1.7m. The company was reported to have denied the market hints to analysts, suggesting that its shares often attracted such spurious talk when staging a recovery. Owners shares have drifted from a year high of 121p in March to a low of 46p three weeks ago. However, news of a healthy late summer season has lifted shares in the holiday groups. Yesterday Owners climbed 1 1/2 to 71p, while Airtours, a rumoured predator for Owners, slipped 13 to 240p. Insurance shares tumbled across the board, affected primarily by the general plunge in international markets, but additionally weakened by the air disaster in Amsterdam and the latest floods in the US. Fears that the downward pressure on sterling could force a rise in interest rates, also upset the sector. Commercial Union was the worst affected of the composite insurers, retreating 39 to 497p on higher than usual turnover of 2.3m, amid hints of a broker sell note. General Accident lost 25 to 485p on 1.6m traded, while Royals fell 10 to 173p and Guardian Royal 8 to 143p. Lasmo Legal &amp; General dropped 25 to 325p and Prudential 16 to 250p, the latter after relatively heavy trading of 4.7m shares. The big banks were among the market's most heavily traded stocks. The start of a series of presentations to US institutions, ahead of the forthcoming ADR listing, failed to prevent Enterprise Oil stock from retreating in line with the market. They ended a busy session 17 weaker at 408p. Lasmo performed well in early trading, with the shares only marginally off at 161p, sustained by reports that the group will seek a US listing next year, before turning off to close7 1/2 down at 154p. Turnover in Lasmo was a good 2.9m shares. Although closing a net 7 down at 333p, Vodafone shares were among only a handful of stocks to have traded in positive territory during the session, having touched 342p in mid-morning. The early rise followed appraisals of new subscriber numbers for September and the initial response to the launch of Lowcall, Vodafone's new service which offers lower monthly access prices in exchange for higher call charges. Newly-demerged Racal Electronics settled at 129p and Chubb Security at 184p, down 17p. Among internationally traded stocks, Reuters fell 39 to 1198p, Glaxo lost 36 at 737p and BAT Industries also dropped 36 to 791p. ICI, which tends to be affected by the D-Mark rather than the dollar, performed slightly better, shedding 29 to 1070p. SmithKline Beecham was firmer towards the close of trading on expectation that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would act favourably over a SmithKline anti-depressant drug. There are estimates that the product could generate revenue of around Pounds 300m within three years compared to only Pounds 3m last year. The 'A' shares were down 26 at worst but rallied to end the day 22 off at 469p. Reed International shed 19 to 536p. The UK's largest market research organisation, Taylor Nelson (formerly Addison Consultancy), was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the market. The group's broker Peel Hunt completed the sale, initiated on Friday, of a near-five per cent stake in Taylor. Hunt crossed a large block of shares at 14p a share on behalf of one investment fund prompting turnover of 9.3m. The shares closed only a halfpenny easier at 14 1/2 p.

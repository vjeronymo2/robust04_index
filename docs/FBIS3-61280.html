			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vsevolod Solovyev: "The LDPR Defeated the </F> Communists in Saransk. The Communists Are Content"]    [Text] In Mordovia the results of the parliamentary  elections were perceived, as throughout the country, with a  certain astonishment. But as distinct from Moscow, say, the  people here were surprised not by the victory of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] but by the fact that the  present democrats obtained any substantial votes in the State  Duma at all.    Two years ago, the Mordovian Soviet Socialist Republic  (Mordovian Soviet Socialist today, as before, incidentally)  supported President Yeltsin, elected as its republic president  the democrat Guslyannikov, and interpreted the democrats'  program statements as the promise of a just, replete life  protected against the tyranny of both the authorities and  criminals.    Today, however, the electorate's party slate vote at the  State Duma elections in Mordovia was distributed as follows:  LDPR, 34.5 percent; Communist Party of the Russian Federation,  18.3 percent; Agrarian Party, 12.2 percent; Russia's Choice, 7.5  percent; Women of Russia, 6 percent; YABloko, 5.2 percent; and  the other parties and blocs, less than 5 percent.    As far as the new Constitution is concerned, it was utterly  swamped in all areas of the republic (only 37 percent "for"),  with an activity of the people's masses that was relatively high  for that ballot--60 percent.    Zhirinovskiy's victory in Mordovia was predetermined  primarily by the public's distrust of both the democrats and the  communists. In addition, Vladimir Volfovich came to Saransk in  person and won the voters' affections, skillfully demonstrating  his concern for their problems.    "I had no choice," one 40-year-old man told your SEGODNYA  correspondent. "Zhirinovskiy is educated and forceful. He gives  the favorable impression of being a strong person who knows what  he is saying. Everyone has now suddenly begun to intimidate us  with Zhirinovskiy. He is a fascist, they say, he means war. No,  I do not believe that he is a fascist. He is a worthy  replacement for Yeltsin. He should be given power, and if it  turns out that war really does come with him, we will elect  someone else or will fight him. As far as the democrats are  concerned, we had begun to fear them here, in Mordovia, like the  plague, and as for the communists, well, we had replaced them  with the democrats."    This is the thinking of the majority of those who voted for  Mr. Zhirinovskiy. They are not interested in what specifically  Vladimir Volfovich is offering in the sphere of policy or the  economy. It is enough that he is very easy to understand in his  criticism and abuse of the present authorities. For example, he  is promising to do away with crime, which in Saransk is  considered problem No. 1, at a stroke. And no one is interested  in why this cannot be done by the present authorities and in how  this will be managed by the LDPR.    It was said at one plant in the city: "Democracy here is  something remote from the people. They cannot even meaningfully  say how their programs differ from one another. But our plant is  on the point of coming to a halt, and how am I to feed my  family? Not with their inflation. They have not kept a single  promise. The president promised to lie down on the track. The  time has long since expired; why has he not done so? The people  are openly disenchanted and embittered by the fact that  everything is falling apart, and the people are of no concern to  the democrats. Just bribes and bribes. Away with them, they are  even matching the communists. Medvedev, for example. He is from  Mordovia. One of ours. Everyone here knows him as a fervent  communist, and he has of late been working for Yeltsin. Neither  the democrats nor the communists here call him anything other  than a prostitute, but the authorities are feeding him, so they  need him, consequently. But they are not feeding us. So for whom  to vote?" In a word, things are with the democrats in Mordovia  today as clear as could be. As Sergey Serebyrakov, who ran as a  YABLoko candidate, said, the democratic movement here has  suffered political collapse. Not, in the main, on account here  of severe impoverishment, which cannot be seen in the republic,  but because of the ineptitude of the pro-reform authorities and  the showdowns among them.    Egon Gauer, the prominent local democrat, is convinced here  that "people sincerely support democracy, for all that. But when  they have to express this publicly, they are afraid of the  consequences. The authorities here are simply not democratic."  The communists have not gone anywhere but have continued and now  continue to control the local organs of power and  administration. And are shunning nothing to restore power to  themselves in full. Thus, in the course of the election campaign  one communist candidate frightened the people with the fact that  were the democrats to remain in power, the governors would soon  be "Germans."    Since August 1991 Mordovia's communists have openly been  making common cause with Zhirinovskiy's party. Nowhere else in  Russia have the communists thus far formed a bloc with the LDPR.  In Mordovia this alliance has now celebrated its second  anniversary. The communists are united with Zhirinovskiy, as  Ivan Dolgayev, secretary of the Mordovian Executive Committee of  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, announced, by the  principles of patriotism and statehood. In the course of the  recent election campaign, the communists in Saransk gave  Zhirinovskiy's party organizational assistance in mounting his  campaign (the LDPR's structure in Mordovia is very weak) in  order to defeat the anti-communists, who are "ensconced in  Moscow." It is beyond the powers of the communists themselves to  overcome the democrats, even in Mordovia, where the failures of  the democratic movement are obvious.    The results of the choice made by the public are frightening  no one. On the contrary, they are inspiring: some to struggle  for the reconstitution of the Soviet Union, others to organize  an anti-fascist front. Optimism commands the thoughts of both  the left and the right and of those in the center also, and this  optimism of the politicians is being fed not so much by their  own strength as by the obvious weaknesses of their rivals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, Presidential Council chairman in the sisterly Republic of  Yemen, arrived in the country at noon today on a two-day visit  to the sultanate.    His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Said led those who received  President Salih upon his arrival in Salalah Civil Airport.  [passage omitted]    His excellency the Yemeni president made a statement to the  press upon arrival in which he said: We are very happy to make  this visit to the Sultanate of Oman to meet my dear brother His  Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id to discuss everything that  concern our bilateral fraternal relations, which are eternal and  warm relations based on amity, brotherly cooperation, mutual  respect, and good-neighborliness. These relations are  witnessing continued progress in a manner that serves and  benefits our mutual interests.    There are many subjects that will be discussed within the  framework of continuous bilateral consultations, whether  concerning developments in our country and the efforts made to  contain the political crisis and safeguard Yemeni unity, or  regarding regional and Arab issues and international  developments that concern our two sisterly states or our Arab  nation, foremost of which are the efforts to restore Arab  solidarity.    He added: We greatly appreciate the sincere fraternal  efforts our brothers in Oman are making and the efforts of the  Omani military team within the joint military committee. These  efforts realized several good results, such as stopping the  military deterioration in our country. We also appreciate the  eagerness shown by the Omani brothers to contain the crisis and  protect the march of unity and stability in our country based on  the awareness that stability is something that concern all  brothers and neighbors of Yemen, and that Yemeni unity is an  important and vital factor for security, stability, and peace in  the region. This unity is an element that consolidates our Arab  nation, which is in need now, more than at any other time, of  unity, solidarity, and a basis of joint interests for the Arabs.    Oman has led the sisterly states that have supported and  blessed the Yemeni unity. Probably, one of the positive  elements realized by the unity was that it has made a solution  to the border problem between Yemen and Oman possible. A border  agreement was signed, and this agreement laid down a solid basis  for developing fraternal bilateral relations to realize the  joint aspirations of the two sisterly and neighborly peoples.  The agreement demonstrated a model that can be followed in  solving border problems and establishing strong relations  between brothers and neighbors.    We are confident that our Yemeni people, thanks to the  support of their brothers, will be able, God willing, to  overcome all the challenges posed by the crisis, in order to  continue their march and work toward achieving their objectives  of progress and development under the banner of unity, which is  an umbrella of security and peace in our Yemeni homeland and the  region.</p>

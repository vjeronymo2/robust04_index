			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK water sector With next year's regulatory review looming, water companies can draw mild encouragement from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on British Gas. The rate of return on new investment recommended by the MMC is around 1 percentage point higher than that suggested by the water industry regulator. Water companies will be loath to risk a direct appeal to the MMC, but its findings set a precedent. Capital expenditure may run at Pounds 5bn a year through the second half of the decade, so a 1 percentage point increase in rate of return adds Pounds 50m a year to profits. Existing assets may also earn more. The snag is that the MMC's findings might strengthen the argument that water companies have made excessive returns on capital since privatisation. As the MMC recognised, valuing the capital base of utilities is no easy matter. Ofwat's favoured approach is to take the market capitalisation of the water sector at privatisation as a measure of historic assets, to which new investment is added. On that basis - and applying the MMC's rates of return for gas - the water sector should be making annual profits of perhaps Pounds 800m. Last year, profits amounted to well over Pounds 1bn. The question is whether Ofwat will try to claw back what it might argue are excess profits by allowing lower rates of return in future. The comfort for shareholders is that such action would have to be gradual. Water companies' ability to service the huge amounts of capital needed to fund investment would otherwise be damaged. On that basis, there seems little to disturb the recent rally in the sector. As in the case of other utilities, investors' enthusiasm for shares which yield more than the market average is proving a match for regulatory doubts.</p>

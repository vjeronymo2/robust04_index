They said the proposed legislation is expected to be  presented to a meeting of the ruling coalition's policy-making  officials Thursday and is likely to be approved by the cabinet  on March 18 for presentation to the current Diet.    The committee is expected to promote the easing of existing  economic restrictions, discuss the opening of government-held  information to the public and make recommendations to the prime  minister on the basis of its surveys and discussions.    Under the proposed bill, the five-member committee with a  three-year tenure will be created in the prime minister's office  and will function like other advisory councils appointed by the  prime minister, the officials said.    One or two of the members will serve full-time on the  committee.    Some lawmakers have expressed doubts about the proposal to  establish a committee in the government to monitor the  government's economic deregulation.</p>

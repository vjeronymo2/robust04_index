			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1800 GMT on 1 March reports the  fiercest fighting in the following regions:    Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Fermic reports that "the  Serbian aggressor" began infantry attacks in the southern and  southeastern parts of defense early this morning. As he  reports, "the fighters of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  Maglaj heroes withstood the wave of attacks and have once again  saved their town. A true cannonade of the defense positions and  civilian targets ensued." As Fermic continues to report, "the  afternoon brought a more peaceful spell, which the aggressor,  judging by the reports of military scouts, has been using to  fill its ranks and reposition its arms, preparing itself for the  continuation of the offensive." He adds that the situation  regarding food and medicine supplies in Maglaj is "highly  dramatic."    Reporting from the 7th South Operative Group of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Mirudin Aldobasic says that "the  situation was particularly hellish in the area of Kamatova Kosa  today, where the enemy has attempted tank-infantry breakthroughs  on several occasions. Thanks to the outstanding bravery of the  fighters of the 207th Famous Hill Brigade Jela and the 110th  Famous Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] Usora, all  enemy attacks were successfully resisted." "In retaliation for  unaccomplished tasks, the chetniks did not leave the civilians,  the civilian quarters of Tesanj, and the free territory of Doboj  and Teslic in peace the entire day. The chetniks have been  using this 44th day of the constant offensive at this area to  regroup their forces along the entire defense line, which is 133  km long. A large concentration of enemy troops and hardware has  been spotted in the vicinity of Usce on the Doboj battlefield."    As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac "the earth has been  simply burning since 1300 [1200 GMT]." According to him, many  parts of the town are no longer recognizable due to massive  destruction. "The destruction of the industrial zone of Bihac is  terrible," Sadikovic exclaims. "At the moment, it is not  possible to establish the number of casualties; however, it has  exceeded 200 over the last three days. There are also many dead  civilians, and a considerable number of defenders perished in  the savage shelling, too. The defenders in Grabez and  Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau have been exposed to horrendous  attacks of howitzers, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers from  Jelaca Greda, [word indistinct], and Tihotina throughout the  day, especially since 1300." Sadikovic draws attention to the  "joint fervent battles fought by the members of the 5th Corps,  the fighters of the HVO of this region, and the members of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs. Besides this, the chetnik  helicopters performed combat actions on several occasions today,  firing rockets at Jezero and transporting fresh troops and  military hardware."</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S RIGHTS LAW AND THE ATTEMPT TO AMEND IT  </P> <P> Herman Wong's article (May 4) is a wonderful example of how good reporting of  the facts can break through the lies, distortions and myths so frequently  perpetrated about homosexuals.  </P> <P> Yes, Jim Boone and Joe Bucuzzo are "just like any couple" in Irvine, and,  indeed, in Orange County. And they are just two of the many thousands of  committed lesbian and gay couples who live in all parts of our county.  </P> <P> They are also concerned about and assaulted by that small number of virulent  homophobic people, like (Rep. William E.) Dannemeyer, who would actively deny  Orange County's lesbians and gay men their full civil and human rights and  subject them to unfettered discrimination. These people argue that lesbians and  gay men should be subject to loss of employment or residence due only to the  whim of a bigoted person.  </P> <P> I am confident that the voters of the city of Irvine will overwhelmingly vote  for human decency and equal civil rights for all Irvine residents, irrespective  of their sexual orientation or any other irrelevant factor.  </P> <P> WERNER P. KUHN  </P> <P> Executive Director, Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County  </P></p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (18): Travel booking system - Technology Profile The booking system runs on a Pounds 50,000 IBM RS/6000 computer under IBM's AIX version of the Unix operating system. There are 30 IBM PS/2 personal computers at the Croydon office linked to the machine and two terminals in Dover, which handle last-minute bookings. The PS/2s are connected via a local area network which also links to the RAC's central IBM 3090 mainframe computer in Milton Keynes. This is to allow reservations staff to check RAC membership numbers in case of doubt, for example where claims are being made for special discounts. The system leads the reservations person through the booking and selling process, for example moving from the reservations screens to the insurance screen and immediately filling in the caller's personal details in the relevant places on the new screen. A move from one screen to another is done at the touch of a single key. System response is instantaneous. The only time callers become aware of a slight delay is when the system dials out to a ferry operator's computer. The travel services unit also has a Pounds 110,000 automatic call distribution system from STS, now used as standard across the RAC. It has 30 outside lines and 24 internal stations. Calls can be directed to individuals or groups, with or without delays. The RAC says the system produces comprehensive management information. The total project, including equipment, cost Pounds 600,000. Half the total went to Travellog, although this included the cost of the RS/6000 and the personal computers.</p>

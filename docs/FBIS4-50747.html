			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China can offer "the  greatest business opportunity" to the world, Chinese Vice  Premier Li Lanqing said here today, reassuring foreign  businessmen that investment in China will "definitely produce  good returns".    "The progress of the world is providing enormous  opportunities for China's development. And China's development,  in turn, provides many opportunities for the world's  prosperity," Li said while addressing the international  conference of "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam, and China:  Opportunities for World Business".    More than 800 delegates, mostly high ranking government  leaders and officials, successful businessmen, and policy  researchers, from 21 countries and regions throughout the world  are attending the three-day meeting, which began on Tuesday.    "I can tell our friends with assurance that investment in  China will definitely produce good returns and opportunities for  your business development," the vice premier promised in his  keynote speech.    He said that from 1979 to 1993, the total foreign capital  that China utilized in various forms reached 137.8 billion U.S.  dollars, of which, direct foreign investment was 61.8 billion  dollars.    The number of foreign invested enterprises already in  operation in China reached 83,000 by the end of 1993. Most of  them have had very good business performance and satisfactory  economic returns, he said.    Last year, the total output of those enterprises exceeded  33.3 billion dollars and their imports and exports reached 67  billion dollars, accounting for one third of the country's total  trade volume, Li added.</p>

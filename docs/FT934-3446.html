			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Markets buoyant as Bank governor hints at interest rate cut Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday there could be another cut in interest rates early next year should the recovery falter. Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, Mr George denied he was an 'inflation nutter' but said price stability was a vital ingredient in long-term growth and wealth creation. His comments on interest rates, made during a relatively upbeat presentation on UK economic prospects, helped to buoy the London stock market - already strong on the back of a highly successful auction by the Bank of Pounds 3bn in 10-year gilts. Stock was heavily oversubscribed, underlining optimism among investors that the UK upturn would be relatively smooth with continuing low inflation and government borrowing under control. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 40.1 at a new peak of 3,277.4, a rise of 3.5 per cent since last week's Budget. The market was helped by firm trends on other European bourses boosted by hopes of a world trade agreement. Gilts finished up to three-quarters of a point higher on the day. Mr George said he thought 'plausible' the Budget forecast of Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, that the UK economy would expand 2.5 per cent next year. Although he said this rate of growth would not necessarily require a cut in interest rates from 5.5 per cent, he agreed with MPs that there were uncertainties about the outlook, partly linked to the Pounds 8.1bn of tax rises due to take effect next April. Under questioning from Ms Diane Abbott, a member of the committee, Mr George said: 'If this (growth) was not happening . . . we would assess the scope for movements in interest rates.' He said there was 'limited danger' of rates rising due to inflationary pressures. Demand for the gilt auction stock - the 6 3/4 per cent bond due 2004 - was strong with a cover ratio of 2.19 times. The cover ratio (of bids to offers) is a good measure of investor appetite. It last topped 2 times at the July 28 auction. Optimism over the trade talks and hopes of a cut in German rates in the next few weeks pushed Frankfurt share prices to a new high, the DAX index closing 1.5 per cent up on the day. The committee last night agreed on a report recommending that the Bank be responsible for setting interest rates. Its report is due to be published next week.

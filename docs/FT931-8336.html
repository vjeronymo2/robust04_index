			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Framatome in stake talks FRAMATOME, the French state-controlled nuclear reactor group, is negotiating with CEA-Industrie, another public sector nuclear concern, to buy a 20 per cent stake in Technicatome, which specialises in nuclear motors for the marine field. The planned investment in Technicatome, which was a profitable business with sales of about FFr1bn (Dollars 183m) last year, forms part of its ongoing strategy of reducing its reliance on its declining traditional nuclear activities. Framatome on Tuesday disclosed a fall in net profits to FFr900m last year from FFr980m in 1991 on sales down from FFr14.2bn to FFr12.5bn over the same period.</p>

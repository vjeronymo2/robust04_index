"The government cannot but express deep concern and regrets  at the results that are due from North Korea's uncooperative  actions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a  statement, referring to the IAEA announcement in Vienna that its  inspection activities in North Korea were restricted.    The agency further said it could not verify that North Korea  had not diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes.    "The government urges that the IAEA inspections of  unfulfilled parts be carried out immediately without delay,"  Chang said. "We will watch closely the decision by the IAEA  special board of governors meeting."    Seoul also called on Pyongyang to be sincere in talks on  exchanging envoys, voicing hope that the nuclear issue would be  discussed substantively through the exchange.    "The government reconfirms (there is) no change in its  original stance that the IAEA inspections of North Korean  nuclear facilities must conclude successfully and that the  inter-Korean special envoy exchange for solution of the nuclear  problem must be implemented before the third round of North  Korea-U.S. dialogue," Chang said.</p>

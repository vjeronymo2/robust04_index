			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Germany best hope for ecologists The Greens in Germany are expected to achieve the best result of any of the so-called 'protest' parties in the European election. According to opinion polls, their support is standing at around 10 per cent, but even their opponents expect they may do even better than that. Ironically the party's revival in support, compared with their decline in west Germany in the 1990 general election to under 5 per cent, comes at a time when the party has switched from being hostile to European integration to broadly sympathetic. 'We always had a programme which was critical of a centralised Europe and in favour of a Europe of the regions,' says Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former 1968 student revolutionary who is now one of the party's leading candidates for the European parliament. 'Since the division of Germany was overcome, we are faced with the choice of a revival of German nationalism or European integration: there is no longer a choice. We must choose the latter.' The party is now campaigning for Europe-wide environmental standards, and wants the EU to put more stress on political integration and less on economic integration. In France the election campaign may prove the undoing of the French ecologists. The two main environmentalist parties - the radical Greens and the mainstream Generation Ecologie - fell out so badly that they failed to agree to field a common list of candidates. Infighting within the Greens became so fierce that Mr Antoine Waechter, their veteran leader, dropped out of the campaign. Opinion polls show the two parties have minimal support.</p>

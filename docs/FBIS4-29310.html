			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Day of Madness and Treachery"] </F>   [Text] It was the ultimate anti-climax, probably the  biggest twist of the year. The protest for constitutional reform  by Chalat Worachat which began with a big bang ended with just a  heart-breaking whimper.    After three weeks of tension and political cliff-hanging,  the  abrupt end of the protest by supporters of hunger striker Chalat  last night and his decision to give himself up to police to face  a lese majeste charge left observers almost dumbstruck. The  surprise turn of events also left a host of questions that beg  answers, particularly from Chalat himself and from the so-called  Organisation for Political Reform.    Have all the tireless efforts of Chalat's sympathisers and  democratic aspirants for constitutional and political reform  gone down the drain? Was this melodrama which had been played  out in a deadly serious fashion merely a carefully-plotted  political charade to fool the entire nation just for the sake of  fun. If so it was not funny at all given the damages, which are  yet to be estimated, already inflicted on our economy and on our  investment climate. Or was it, after all, typical Thai politics  which is unique in itself? Or has political sanity finally made  a comeback to our childishly insensible political world?    Although puzzled or disappointed by the twist, quite a few  will certainly sigh in great relief now that the protest is over  and the situation about to return to normal. For the Democrats,  the unexpected event constituted a double triumph in a single  day and it will certainly give them good, although unjustified,  cause for celebration.    It would be nice to be able to give credit to someone for  bringing this unfortunate political event to a peaceful end.  But there is no one that deserves the credit, not even Chalat  himself who may well have instigated his own political demise by  the sudden about face, for which he owes many of his supporters  and sympathisers a reasonable explanation. He cannot take any  credit and neither can the Democrats nor the Phalang Tham [PTP].    The Democrats have shown without any doubt that they had no  intention whatsoever of ending the crisis despite the fact that  it could probably have been resolved peacefully yesterday had  the PTP rebels' motion for a panel to write a new charter been  allowed to move forward, debated in Parliament and endorsed with  the support of the Opposition. Yet, the Democrats chose to  scuttle the motion and thus allowed the crisis to continue, at  least until next Thursday when the House reconvenes.    The adjournment of the parliamentary session by Deputy House  Speaker Wan Muhamat Nomatha until next week which effectively  blocked the motion was not coincidental, but plotted in advance  in collaboration with the New Aspiration Party. This coup de  grace is proof positive of the Democrats' political intrigue and  treachery which are unequalled by their fellow MPs in the other  parties. It is a special craft learned, nurtured and honed from  decades of political experience by the Democrats.    A victory and the sense of joy that goes with it, even  temporarily, seems to be what the Democrats craved for,  regardless of the cost that this country will be made to pay. If  common sense and political sanity still prevail among the  Democrats who seem to be blinded by their arrogance and  stubbornness, the crisis should have ended with the Democrats  rightfully claiming the credit. Yet, they knowingly and  intentionally allowed the opportunity to slip past.    After all, there are no real winners in this political  charade. There are only losers -- and the real losers are  undoubtedly the people in general.    The unsavory political events in and out of Parliament  yesterday were simply too much to digest, even by Thai  standards. It was the ultimate in absurdity and defied all  reason.    Where do the people get their hopes from now after the end  of  this farce? What trust is there for a government which is only  good at political manoeuvring and intrigue, but which has failed  completely in national administration? Can we still place our  hope and the destiny of this country in the hands of the same  incompetent politicians a year, a month or a week longer?    It's time we asked ourselves loudly whether we want a new  hope -- perhaps a better future -- through a general election or  should we just let ourselves go down the drain with this sinking  ship of state?</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ML Holdings tumbles Pounds 1.31m into the red ML HOLDINGS, the aerospace, cargo handling and electronic component distributor, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.31m for the six months to end-September, compared with profits of Pounds 3.03m last time, writes Paul Betts. The loss included Pounds 1.9m of restructuring costs in defence activities. The workforce has been cut from 1,768 at end-March last year to 1,496 by the end of December. The company, which has been reducing its dependence on the defence market during the past four years by developing its civil aerospace and electronic component distribution businesses, said it had suffered from the combined effects of the slump in civil aviation and the reduction in military spending. Turnover in the first half fell from Pounds 44m to Pounds 40m. After accounting for some 64 per cent of total sales for the year to end-March 1988, the contribution of defence activities has declined to 29 per cent of total sales for the 12 months ending September 1991. It is expected to continue declining to about 20 per cent of total sales. The company said its order book, which had fallen very sharply as a result of the Gulf war and the recession, had recovered strongly in recent months. Interest costs rose to Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.05m) in the half-year to September. But borrowings peaked in October with gearing of more than 70 per cent and were now on a downward trend. The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.85p. Losses per share emerged at 2.6p (earnings of 3.9p).</p>

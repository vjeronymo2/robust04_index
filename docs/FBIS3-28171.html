A spokesperson for the foreign minister,  Gareth Evans, said although the decision does not include the  establishment of diplomatic relations, it is a positive step  toward Vietnam's acceptance in the international community. The  spokesperson says the increased competition which is likely to  result between Australian and U.S. firms in Vietnam should also  be welcomed.</p>

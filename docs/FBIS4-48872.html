			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, May 30 (AFP)--Moshood Abiola, the presumed  winner of presidential elections annulled in Nigeria last June,  has again vowed to form a government in the near future, defying  the military regime.    In an interview with the magazine NEWS published Monday [30  May], Abiola called on the junta of General Sani Abacha to stand  down and said "I am fully ready to claim the mandate. I am  ready for the worst."    "Nobody can stop me," the millionaire businessman from the  Yoruba southwest said in a separate interview with Concord  magazine. "We are dealing with people who are looters. They are  not leaders. They are dealers and they must go."    A newly formed nationwide group of anti-government  movements,  the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), has told the  government to hand over to Abiola by Tuesday, May 31, but the  regime dismissed this as a "joke".    The military warned that it would tolerate no hindrance of  its own plans for restoring civilian rule, beginning with a  constitutional conference it plans for June 27. It has not  detailed its programme for change any more than Abiola said how  he planned to organise his "government of national unity."    NADECO and other pro-democracy movements called for a  boycott of elections of delegates to this conference and few  voters turned out in the last round on May 23, but observers  said turnout was higher in Saturday's second round. No official  indication of the outcome of the poll has been released.    In his interviews, Abiola personally critised Abacha, who  seized power in November last year.    "Who is Abacha? The man didn't even pass the staff college,"  Abiola said. "Professionally, he shouldn't even have been a  lieutenant-colonel. You do not become a lieutenant-colonel  unless you have passed the staff college."    "You heard him read the budget (in January)," the  presidential hopeful added. "It was obvious he didn't understand  what he was reading. How can a nation of brilliant people like  Nigeria be led by a man like that?"    Abiola was said on unofficial results comfortably to have  won  the June 12 poll, hailed as free and fair by international  observers, until then junta leader General Ibrahim Babangida  annulled it, alleging irregularities.    Babangida stepped down in August, handing over to an  unelected civilian caretaker administration. It was this  government that Abacha overthrew, going on to scrap all  Nigeria's democratically elected institutions.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling takes a shine At last, things seem to be going more the chancellor's way. The Bundesbank has hinted at lower interest rates to come; UK inflation appears under control; after a further robust rise in M0 money supply, there is a whiff of recovery in the air which makes Mr Lamont's reluctance to cut rates that bit more credible. At least he should be spared a sterling crisis in the run up to the budget. A stable pound as well as a competitive exchange rate is needed to attract overseas buyers into the gilts market. Sterling's 3.5 pfennig rise yesterday suggests the markets may be getting ahead of themselves. There is no guarantee that the Bundesbank will cut official rates that quickly. Long bond yields have fallen in Germany and there has been some good news on the wages front, but retail price inflation of 4.2 per cent, continuing high wage demands in the construction sector and the unresolved budget negotiations give pause for thought. The Bundesbank may confine itself for the time being to a further cut in the money market repurchase rate. Mr Lamont has a balancing act to perform at home. While the recovery remains tentative, a tight budget would be difficult to sell in the absence of lower interest rates. Without some sign of fiscal discipline, the markets might come to doubt his ability to finance the PSBR. Since the government appears to be concerned about the exchange rate, it could certainly do with some timely accommodation from the Bundesbank.</p>

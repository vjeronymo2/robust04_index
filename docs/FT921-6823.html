			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Paint sales lift Kalon to Pounds 9.2m A BUMPER last quarter for paint sales to DIY chains helped Kalon Group raise pre-tax profit by 57 per cent last year, from Pounds 5.87m to Pounds 9.22m. The group also benefited from the rapid growth of its sundries range, including paint stripper and adhesives. In the past two years annual sales have leapt from Pounds 2m to Pounds 10.6m. Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said most of the products were supplied in-house, so boosting margins. The improvement showed through at group operating level, where profit rose by 40 per cent to Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 6.54m) on sales up 13 per cent to Pounds 98.5m (Pounds 87m). Interest turned from a Pounds 665,000 charge to a small income as year-end cash balances grew to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 3.1m). Virtually all the profit came from the decorative division, which made Pounds 10m pre-tax on sales of Pounds 87.3m. Prices went up by 10 per cent early in the year, with wage and raw material inflation only 5 per cent. Volume growth had flowed through especially in the last quarter as DIY chains to which Kalon supplies own label products mounted aggressive promotional campaigns. In retail paint, the market was flat, but Kalon's volume was 18 per cent up and it claimed its market share improved from 22 to 27 per cent. This partly reflected the greater proportion of the market - 36 rather than 31 per cent - taken by the stores' own label paint at the expense of branded products. Losses were roughly doubled at three small, problematic divisions: chemicals, industrial coatings and Spain. Between them the deficit was Pounds 1.12m on turnover of Pounds 11.4m. Top management has been changed in all three areas and Mr Hennessy said this was the year for 'resolving' their future. Earnings per share rose to 5.28p (3.64p). A final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2.2p (1.5p). COMMENT With the DIY enthusiast flushed out of hibernation by the aggressive marketing of B&amp;Q and Texas Homecare, 1991 was the first year of serious volume growth since Kalon's in-the-red year in 1987. While the group's market leadership in own-label paint limits the scope for growth there, the potential remains strong in sundries and the expanding Leyland trade centre chain; and the resources are clearly available for acquisitions. All this makes the tiny loss-making divisions look even more incongruous. The crunch is coming when they must be either disposed of or expanded to a more viable size. Nevertheless, damage reduction by the new managers should help profits this year. With the pre-tax figure forecast to reach at least Pounds 11m, the prospective multiple of 16 is at a deserved premium to the market. But after a near tripling of the share price in the past 12 months, further growth will probably be medium term.</p>

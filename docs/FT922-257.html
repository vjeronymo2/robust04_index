			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Britons confess to legal mystery SEVENTY NINE per cent of Britons see UK law as 'a bit of a mystery', according to a survey by General Accident, the insurance company. Only 30 per cent of those interviewed had used solicitors more than twice, and then mainly for house buying and selling. Most expected solicitors to charge less than Pounds 50 an hour, while the true rate was from Pounds 60 to Pounds 150 an hour.</p>

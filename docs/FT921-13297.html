			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / EC carriers condemn postal rules EUROPEAN Community rules on customs and value added tax give national post offices a competitive advantage worth more than Pounds 50m a year, private postal operators said yesterday, writes Roland Rudd. The Association of European Express Carriers called for an overhaul of the system, which it claimed was 'unfair and uncompetitive'. It has compiled a report outlining the difference in treatment of express mail by private operators and state post offices. A copy has been sent to the European Commission. Mr Peter Davies, UK managing director of DHL, the international carrier, said that private operators were forced to satisfy a number of customs and VAT regulations which did not apply to post offices. Private carriers, for example, had to prepare and submit to customs or input on a computerised system an import customs entry, calculating the amount of duty and VAT due. The operator is liable to a fine if it miscalculates the amount. The assessment for post offices is carried out without charge by customs officers. The association's study has been compiled ahead of the Community's green paper on postal services, due to be published later this month. A final draft of the green paper shows the Commission favours more competition but does not advocate changing customs and VAT regulations. Mr Davies said: 'DHL has never advocated the abolition of postal monopolies. Our principal concern is that we be allowed to offer in the UK and throughout Europe our value added services without being at a competitive disadvantage to any national post office.'</p>

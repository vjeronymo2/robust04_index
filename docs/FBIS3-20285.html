			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/P/94/22: "Commission To Create a </F> European Science and Technology Assembly"]    [Text] On Commissioner Antonio Ruberti's initiative, the  Commission has decided to create a "European Science and  Technology Assembly." Following the example of the U.S.  "National Research Council" or the Japanese "Japan Research  Council," this consultative and advisory body is to assist the  Commission in designing and implementing the Community's  research and development policy in the field of technology.    Professor Ruberti underlined that "the Community can only be  successful in the science and technology sector if it fully  takes the versatility of European research into account for  designing and assessing its actions. This new tool will make it  possible."    The "European Science and Technology Assembly" will include  approximately 100 high-level officials appointed on the basis of  proposals from the various organizations involved in science and  technology on the European level.    The creation of the Assembly had been announced by the  Commission in the "White Book on Growth, Competitiveness, and  Employment." Indeed, by establishing a direct, close, and  permanent contact between the Commission on the one hand and the  European scientific community and industrial world on the other  hand, the Assembly will ensure that the Community's research and  development activities have the expected positive impact on the  European economy and society.    Technological research and development call for a growing  part of the Community's financial resources. The activities  carried out in the sector have considerable effects on the  economic activity and the life of citizens. With the very high  level of expertise of its members, the Assembly will be able to  guarantee:     -  the relevance of the choices made in the field  of science and technology;    -  the quality of research;    -  that the  most recent developments in the field of technology as well as  the needs of the economy and the society are taken into account.    The Commission will systematically request the opinion of  the  Assembly on a certain number of issues: the scientific and  technological contents of the Community's research programs, the  criteria and the methods for assessing proposals, etc. On its  own initiative, the assembly can also prepare reports and give  opinions on the various aspects of the Community's research  policy or the development of science and technology in Europe  and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Banesto loss less than expected Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the Spanish bank which came under the control of Banco Santander in April in the final phase of a rescue operation, reported a lower-than-expected loss of Pta21.8bn (Dollars 168m) in the first half of the year and forecast that it would almost break even for the year. Initial estimates made at the time of the auction were that the bank was losing some Pta55bn a year, indicating a first-half loss of around Pta27bn. Banesto said there was no comparable figure for the same period of 1993. Following the Bank of Spain's intervention and a revision of Banesto's accounts, losses for the whole year were put at Pta577bn. The bank said the half-year performance reflected improved management following the intervention rather than the impact of financial support for the bank, which would be more evident in results for the second half of the year. The rescue package involved a Pta180bn capital injection, the purchase of Pta285bn worth of non-performing assets by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a Pta315bm zero-interest loan to offset current losses. The bank said it had recovered most of the customer deposits lost during the crisis. In June and July deposits increased at a rate of Pta150bn a month. The half-year figures, showing an operating margin of Pta58.6bn for the parent bank, are the first evidence of the impact of the chairmanship of Mr Alfredo Saenz, who was appointed by the Bank of Spain and kept in place by the new controlling shareholder. More detailed figures are expected at the bank's annual meeting on August 22.</p>

EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Supplement to the General Preamble'')).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out requirements applicable in Marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program in paragraph (3) of that subsection for stationary sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements showing actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This paragraph provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992, establishing this emission statement program. Whatever minimum reporting level is established in a State emission statement program, if either VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is emitted at or above the designated level, the other pollutant should be included in the emission statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA requires facilities to submit the first emission statement to the State within three years after November 15, 1990, and annually thereafter. EPA requests that the States submit the emission data to EPA through the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS). The minimum emission statement data should include: Certification of data accuracy; source identification information; operating schedule; emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions); control equipment information; and process data. EPA developed emission statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements. This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation of all EPA reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the submission of the emission statement data to AIRS, States should provide EPA with a status report that outlines the degree of compliance with the emissions statement program. Beginning July 1, 1993, States should report quarterly to EPA the total number of sources affected by the emission statement provisions, the number that have complied with the provisions, and the number that have not. This status report should also include the total annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all reporting sources, both corrected and non-corrected for rule-effectiveness (RE). States should include in their status report a list of sources that are delinquent in submitting their emission statement and that emit 500 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOC or 2500 tpy or more of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This report should be a quarterly submittal until all the regulated sources have complied for the reporting year. Suggested submittal dates for the quarterly status reports are July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement program will become a part. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 110(l) similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAAA must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, under section 110(k)(1)(B), a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months after receipt of the submission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State passed the revisions to the TACB General Rules, 101, by repealing the existing section 101.10 and replacing it with a new section 101.10 on August 20, 1992. The State submitted the revision to public hearing on April 19, 1992. The rule was submitted to EPA on October 15, 1992, by the Governor, as a proposed revision to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 15, 1992, SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 15, 1993, was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. The provisions of the regulations are outlined under the analysis of the State's submission below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 1, 1993, the TACB merged with the Texas Water Commission to form the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) and is now called the Office of Air Quality within the TNRCC. The merger did not abrogate, void, or rescind any rules, regulations, Orders, permits, or any other action previously taken by the former TACB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Components of Emission Statement Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and specific source requirements detailed below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. SIP Revision Submission. Required within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) (November 15, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability of the regulations, definitions for key terms used in the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements for sources. The emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement, source identification information, operating information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information. These elements are described in greater detail in section D of this document. EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the sources no later than April 15 of each year to insure that the State can meet the July 1 deadline for the submission of data into AIRS each year. The guidance document prepared by EPA provides a draft model State rule which can be used as the basis for the States to develop their program. The guidance document also provides suggested language for the specific program elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Sources Covered. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification (Marginal, Moderate, etc.).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to EPA. States should get clearance from the appropriate EPA Regional Office to waive the emission statement requirement for these smaller sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Reporting Requirements for Sources. The State of Texas requires facilities to report on an emissions inventory questionnaire supplied by the State. Sources covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a minimum, the following data elements: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Source identification information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Operating information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Process rate data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Control equipment information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Emissions information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Review of the State's Emission Statement Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicability of the regulation to ozone nonattainment areas is documented in subsection (a) and (a)(1). The rule states that the owner or operator of the following stationary sources in the State of Texas or on waters that extend 25 miles from the shoreline shall submit emissions inventories to the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) on forms or other media approved by the TACB: a major facility/stationary source, as defined in Section 101.1 of this title (relating to definitions), and any stationary source in an ozone nonattainment area emitting a minimum of 10 tons per year (tpy) volatile organic compounds (VOC), 25 tpy nitrogen oxides (NOx), or 100 tpy carbon monoxide (CO).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Types of Inventories <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two types of inventories identified in the regulation which are pertinent to emission statements. They are an initial emissions inventory and an ozone nonattainment area inventory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for initial emissions inventories is documented in subsection (b)(1). Stationary sources, as identified in subsection (a) of Section 101.10 shall submit an initial emissions inventory (IEI) for any criteria pollutant or hazardous air pollutant that has not been identified in a previous inventory. The IEI shall consist of actual emissions of VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, sulfur dioxide (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), lead (Pb), and particulate matter of less than 10 microns in diameter (PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from stationary sources and emissions of all hazardous air pollutants identified in the FCAA, Section 112(b). For purposes of this section, the term ``actual emission'' is the actual rate of emissions of a pollutant from an emissions unit for the calendar year or seasonal period. Actual emission estimates must also include excess emissions occurring during maintenance, start-ups, shut-downs, upsets, and downtime to parallel the documentation of these events in the emissions inventory and must follow emissions calculations identified in subsection (c) of section 101.10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for ozone nonattainment areas inventories is documented in subsection (b)(3). This subsection requires stationary sources in ozone nonattainment areas emitting a minimum of 10 TPY of VOC, 25 TPY of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or 100 TPY of CO to submit an annual inventory. The inventory shall consist of actual annual emissions and typical weekday emissions that occur during the summer months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Minimum Data Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The data requirements include a certifying statement, facility identification information, operating information, process rate data, control equipment information, and emissions information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The certifying statement is documented in subsection (d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statement is required from the owner or operator to accompany the emission inventory certifying that the information is true and accurate to the best knowledge of the certifying official. The certification will include the name, title, signature, date of signature, and telephone number of the certifying official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data requirements are contained in the questionnaire used by the State to gather emission statement data. The questionnaire is required from all facilities which must report emission statement data. A copy of the questionnaire and instructions for completion is contained in the Technical Support Document (TSD). Source data elements required by Texas through the questionnaire sent by the State to the facilities are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Calculations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Calculations of emissions are documented in subsection (c). The subsection specifies that actual measurement with continuous monitoring systems (CEMS) is the preferred method of calculating emissions from a point source. Other means of determining actual emissions may be utilized if CEMS data is not available in accordance with detailed instructions from the Emissions Inventory Division of the TACB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting requirements are documented in subsection (e). The reporting deadline for the 1992 ozone nonattainment area is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 31, 1993. Subsequent emission statements are due on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 31 of each year and will contain data for the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F. Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The enforcement requirements are documented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsection (f). The State of Texas has included language in its regulation that permits the State to enforce the provisions of the regulation under all pertinent State enforcement authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA. The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et al. (see 57 FR 13541 (April 16, 1992) (``Review of State Implementation Plans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency'')). SIP provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis of the Texas regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State grants process and to provide quarterly status reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In today's action, the EPA is granting final approval of the Texas emission statement program as submitted. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this FR publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse comments be received. Thus, this action will be effective October 25, 1994 unless, by September 26, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document which will withdraw the final action. All public comments will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976; 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 25, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section three of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Nitrogen dioxide, Oxides of nitrogen, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Volatile organic compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Incorporation by reference of the SIP for the State of Texas was approved by the Director of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 1, 1982. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Allyn M.

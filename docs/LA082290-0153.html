			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> JUNIOR EXECUTIVE;  </P> <P> FRANCINE BROWNER IS BIG IN L.A.'S JUNIOR MARKET, THE 'MOST CREATIVE IN THE  U.S.'  </P> <P> A Cheshire cat grin creeps across Francine Browner's face as she confesses that  the jacket she wears does not carry her own label.  </P> <P> "It's a Calvin Klein," the 44-year-old sportswear designer admits, adding that  she has not "interpreted" its look and feel into her own line. Yet.  </P> <P> Klein is one of several top names in the business who inspire Browner's designs  for Rue de Reves, a company she founded six years ago and has built into a  leader among Southern California's junior market.  </P> <P> But there is at least one major difference between Browner and those who  inspire her. She strives for a $100-per-outfit retail price. They get about 10  times that.  </P> <P> "We go for the look and then we work on the prices," she says. "We go for the  best garment we can get within our price range."  </P> <P> The approach has paid off. She claimed $75 million in retail sales last year,  and experts rank her company among the best in the field.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is the most important market for junior and contemporary fashion  right now," says Mona Danford, co-owner of Directives West, a Los Angeles-based  buyer service company. "Rue de Reves is one of the few large companies besides  Esprit and Generra to garner a lion's share of it."  </P> <P> New York-based fashion forecaster Pat Tunsky suggests that Los Angeles' junior  market rates so high because "it is the most creative in the U.S. The designers  aren't always playing it safe, letting themselves be dictated to by economic  factors." Designers here are more willing to gamble on unproven trends, Tunsky  said.  </P> <P> From the time Browner launched her business in December, 1984, she aimed her  collections toward a silent-majority segment of women's ready-to-wear  customers. She targeted women like herself, in their 30s, old enough to have a  career but physically fit, fiscally limited and young-spirited enough to  appreciate the junior department.  </P> <P> This was a break from the traditional profile that said a junior-wear shopper  was a teen-ager or a college-age woman.  </P> <P> "It was a real uphill battle trying to get the stores to realize that adult  women are junior customers, too," Browner says. "We pretty much created the  (contemporary juniors) department, but it was tough teaching the buyers about  what we were doing."  </P> <P> Browner's business now includes Hearts, a junior dress line, Hearts II, a  junior plus-size label, D'Knits, for knit separates, and several signature  lines, including one for petites, one for plus-size separates and one for  dressier separates, called Workables.  </P> <P> It was her father who introduced her to the fashion world. He worked for Bobbie  Brooks, a pioneering junior label, then started his own business with a  showroom in Manhattan, where Browner maintains a space. Like other girls, she  made doll clothes. But art was her first love. Before attending New York's  Parson's School of Design, she spent a year at Syracuse University studying  fine art. Her father kept nudging her toward fashion.  </P> <P> "He thought designers had great jobs and made a lot of money," she explains.  But "it wasn't until I got in the work force and had to make a real living that  I was happy he had done that."  </P> <P> She worked briefly for Personal Sportswear, a division of Leslie Fay, but after  marriage, quit to have children. Seven years later, as a 32-year-old divorcee  and mother of two daughters, she was faced with re-entering the work force.  </P> <P> She held a garage sale, sold most of her possessions and in 1977 moved to  California to seek work.  </P> <P> Breaking into the design community again was no easy feat -- particularly in a  new city.  </P> <P> She remembers a job interview at Organically Grown, the natural-fiber advocates  of the junior sportswear industry.  </P> <P> "I thought I knew what I was doing, but later I realized I had no idea," she  said. "I hadn't worked in years, but when they asked me pointed questions about  what I could do, I automatically said yes, because I had two kids I had to  support and I was going to get this job."  </P> <P> She got the job.  </P> <P> In time, she decided to start her own design firm. She drove a beat-up car and  socked away savings. She found herself trying to dress well on a very tight  budget.  </P> <P> That's when it dawned on her: She was to be her own customer.  </P> <P> When she and Neil Afromsky, now her business as well as her life partner,  launched Rue de Reves, her concept came alive.  </P> <P> "I design for a young-spirited woman who could be 18 or 40 who's on a budget,"  Browner says. "I have a real affinity for her because I was in her shoes. A  woman goes into a store, looks at my price tag and is shocked because she can  afford it."  </P> <P> Dana Fleming, who wears Browner fashions on ABC's "Home" show, says the  affordability was important when Browner's clothes were selected as one of her  main wardrobe sources for on-air wear. Because Fleming's hosting duties require  unpredictable movement, she likes the walking-short ensembles in her spring and  summer lines.  </P> <P> "Viewers are watching the show to find out ways to keep from spending a lot of  money," says Fleming, who estimates that she has received hundreds of letters  about the clothes she wears on the show.  </P> <P> Fleming says that what she likes most about the clothes is the subtle way  Browner interprets trends.  </P> <P> "She never copies anything exactly," Fleming says. "Francine is influenced by  trends just enough to keep the clothes current, but she's fresh enough to keep  everything interesting."  </P> <P> Although Calvin Klein jackets are now a luxury she can afford, Browner isn't  consumed with making her line more upscale. Neither is she interested in  returning to the Big Apple.  </P> <P> "L.A. is really where junior fashion is developing," she says. "People come  here with an entrepreneurial spirit, and that youthful attitude is reflected in  the garment industry.  </P> <P> "The kind of clothes that are designed here are free of limitations. They are  by and for people who are open to new possibilities. Whether they want to be in  the film or the fashion industry, that spirit allows them to reach for their  dreams."  </P></p>

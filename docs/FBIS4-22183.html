			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA observer Aleksandr Golts: </F> "Permission Not Necessary for Russian Peacekeeping Role"]    [Text] A rather unpleasant trend in international affairs  has been gaining momentum. Someone wishes to render the  peacekeeping operations Russia is carrying out in nearby  countries problematic relative to Moscow's relations with our  more geographically distant partners. Ever more frequent are  statements made by public figures and the news media to the  effect that Russia's peacekeeping activities constitute some  kind of "dual nature." The matter in essence amounts to  allegations that we are using the peacekeeping operations as a  cover for "neoimperial ambitions", in that Russia is demanding  the right to interfere in her neighbors' internal affairs. This  kind of allegation is expressed succinctly in an amendment  passed several days ago by the U.S. Senate without benefit of  vote. Included in the part of the draft legislation, which deals  with defense and foreign policy expenditures, is the following  provision: "The United States will oppose, employing suitable  measures, any efforts made by the Russian Federation to employ  intimidation by the application of military force or economic  pressure to create a sphere of influence in the republics of the  former Soviet Union..."    What is amazing here is that the document's authors are  doing  nothing more than shadowboxing. No one has yet been able to  furnish any kind of convincing proof of Russia's interfering in  the internal affairs of her neighboring states. Nonetheless,  this kind of allegation is not without harm, since it creates  the dangerous impression that Moscow "must be contained."    The above is why Russia's defense and foreign affairs  ministries considered it necessary to issue a joint statement  explaining Moscow's approach to the conduct of peacekeeping  operations. Stressed in the statement is the following: "The  actions taken by Russia are intended to merely effect a  cessation of armed conflicts in a number of new and independent  states, stabilize the situation there, and create conditions  conducive to a lasting and stable settlement."    Indeed, Russia, which more than other countries is  interested  in the cessation of all military activities occurring on her  borders, is shouldering a heavy burden in carrying out her  peacekeeping operations. This is not to mention the approximate  amount of 26 billion rubles spent for these purposes in only the  last 10 months. Russia is risking the lives of her young men.    In this connection, and this is something of special  importance in this situation, Russia's peacekeeping operations  are not actions arbitrarily taken. They are being carried out in  direct response to requests made by, and with the consent of,  the respective states and sides engaged in conflict. The point  here is that those who perceive the Russian peacekeeping as a  "threat" are raising the question of mounting these operations  exclusively on the basis of securing permission from the U.N. or  the CSCE. And in this they are mixing two issues.    Yes, Russia is in favor of the widest possible participation  by the U.N. and the CSCE in the settling of conflicts occurring  in CIS member countries. However, there is no need to secure any  "permission" from these or any other organizations or obtain any  other legitimation of peacekeeping operations. It would be  another matter to effect cooperation with international  organizations such that the latters' active and substantial  support would constitute meaningful assistance in the  realization of more effective and rapid settlement of conflicts.    In this regard, it is unfortunately necessary to state that  international institutions, in addition to the individual states  that are so apprehensive of Russian peacekeeping, are not in any  way anxious to demonstrate initiative in conflict settlement.  Thus, our diplomats were unable to obtain a mandate for Russian  troops from the U.N. or the CSCE for the conduct of peacekeeping  operations. In addition, other states are definitely not  enthusiastic about bringing peace to post-Soviet areas. Russia,  however, is willing to participate in U.N. and CSCE peacekeeping  operations in the territory of the former USSR.    Thus, as stressed in the joint statement issued by the MO  [Ministry of Defense] and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs],  Russia is not pitting its efforts against anyone at all. We are  not demanding that we be accorded a special position or  exclusive role. However, Russia at the same time has no  intention of backing away from her responsibility for her  position in this key geographic area.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By GUANGYE BAO (Mining Industry Paper) reporter Li Hongbing </F> (2621 3163 0393) and XINHUA reporter Li Guangru (2621 0342 5423)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- According to the second  executive meeting of the first council of the Mining Industry  Association held in Beijing on 25 February, China's mining  industry is seeking new development by deepening reform and is  advancing toward international markets.    The mining industry is a basic industry in China's national  economy, including undertakings in coal, the chemical industry,  nonferrous metals, construction materials, the metallurgical  industry, and geology and mineral resources. China has abundant  natural resources and can be considered a major producer of  mineral resources. At present, the number of minerals that have  been surveyed as being abundant is 151. China ranks third in  the world both in terms of the potential value of its mineral  resources and as a producer of mineral ores. In recent years,  it has considerably raised the output of raw and semifinished  materials which depend on mineral products for their raw  materials. China's output of coal ores, cement, and glass has  been the largest in the world, and its output of steel and  nonferrous metals, crude oil, and gold has been, respectively,  the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-largest in the world. Economists  made the following comment on the issue: The development of the  mining industry has enormously increased China's comprehensive  national strength and has laid a material foundation for  realizing the second-step strategic objective.    While deepening reform and gearing up toward the market,  China's mining industry has been actively seeking international  markets. It has been learned that cooperation in marine oil  exploration, which is generally concerned with international  joint ventures, has continually expanded. The China National  Offshore Oil Corporation has signed agreements with 50 companies  from 13 countries and regions to open up 560,000 square km of  the ocean's area, and foreign companies have accumulatively  invested $3.68 billion of funds. China has made various types  of progress in joint ventures to develop mineral resources with  Brazil, Mongolia, and South Africa. China has jointly launched  more than 30 geological exploration undertakings and surveying  projects for mineral resources with 17 countries and regions.  More than 20 Chinese mineral surveying teams have entered the  international market, and these have contracts for more than 100  projects. China's new nuclear power and nuclear fuel industry  has also begun to enter the international market. A Pakistani  nuclear power project, which was the first nuclear power plant  exported by China, is progressing smoothly.    According to the leaders of relevant departments and  commissions and mining industry representatives attending the  meeting, even though China has made attention-catching  accomplishments in developing its mining industry, it is still  facing an arduous situation with many problems and restraining  factors obstructing its path of progress. Therefore, they  proposed: It is necessary to deepen reform in the mining  industry's structure, particularly to enhance reform in  enterprise and investment, mining rights, and social security  systems.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT DEFERS ILLINOIS ABORTION CASE ARGUMENT  </P> <P> The Supreme Court on Friday dropped a much-watched Illinois abortion dispute  from its schedule of cases to be argued next week because of an out-of-court  settlement in the case.  </P> <P> The settlement was announced in Chicago last week, eliminating the case that  had been viewed as the high court's most likely opportunity to alter its 1973  decision legalizing abortion.  </P> <P> As anticipated, the justices granted a request from both sides that Supreme  Court arguments be deferred pending a formal settlement. The argument session  had been scheduled for Tuesday.  </P> <P> The settlement must be approved by a federal judge before it becomes final. The  case will remain on the Supreme Court docket, in limbo, until the judge acts  and both sides then ask the justices to dismiss the case.  </P> <P> The key issue in the Illinois dispute is a set of strict regulations imposed on  abortion clinics, where most early-pregnancy abortions are performed. The  regulations could have severely restricted the availability of abortions in  that state.  </P> <P> A federal judge struck down many of the state regulations, and that ruling was  upheld by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil Hartigan's appeal to the Supreme Court was accepted  for review last July 3 -- the same day the justices announced, in a Missouri  case, a decision giving states greater authority to regulate abortions.  </P> <P> But Hartigan, a Democratic candidate for governor in 1990, later sought a  settlement in which Illinois women would be guaranteed continued access to  abortions.  </P> <P> The case is Turnock vs. Ragsdale, 88-790.  </P></p>

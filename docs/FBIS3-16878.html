The meeting dealt with a specific subject discussed in  detail  by the MPs on the previous day -- defaults of payments -- and  not the entire spectrum of socio-economic problems.    It is noteworthy that, despite the premier's rigid stand (he  firmly declared against emergency measures in the economy,  against mutual offsets of debts and the emission of money), the  discussion was rather peaceful.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Friday's heavy snowfall and coup  rumours: "It snowed heavily in Moscow on Friday and, as is  usually the case, the mayor's office as represented by the  road-cleaning service was not prepared for such a whim of  winter. "There developed huge traffic jams in the streets, and  the cars of many statesmen got stuck. According to reliable  information, some of them, to while away the time, discussed  rumours about a coup that was allegedly to be carried out on  Thursday. "Analysing numerous pronouncements by opposition  members at a rally and in the state duma, one can only guess who  it was who intended to overthrow the lawfully elected president  or, vice-versa, to enhance his authority. "Even if a coup  began, it would have hardly succeeded because tanks (as the main  attribute of Moscow unrest) would not have been able to  manoeuvre in the snow-drifted and traffic-blocked streets of the  capital".    KOSMOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Moscow Mayor  Yuriy Luzhkov who, touching upon possible actions of the  opposition on May 1, stated: "We prepare for a possible unrest  most seriously. Militia have been provided with all the  necessary technical equipment. Law enforcement agencies have  been instructed to put a stop to actions that would threaten the  safety or disturb the peace of Muscovites". NOVAYA GAZETA on a  timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia:  "The diplomats of Russia and Latvia have agreed upon a  timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from the  territory of Latvia. Russia will lease the Skrunda radar for  four years and then it will dismantle it in 18 months' time.  The question of radar lease payments remains undecided. An  amount of two million U.S. dollars does not suit the Latvian  side. "Russian politicians do not want to draw lessons from  their lamentable experience. We assumed obligations for a  withdrawal of Russian troops from Eastern European countries and  we ourselves determined time-limits and then tried to settle the  financial problems. "Having left behind residential buildings,  a developed infrastructure, office space, etc. In the countries  where its troops stayed, Russia in exchange received bills for  ruined ecology, moral damage, etc".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the withdrawal of Russian  troops from Belarus. Two missile divisions stationed at Mozyr  and Lida are to be withdrawn and are to be fully disbanded by  mid-1996. All military and residential townships of missilemen  are to be turned over to the Belarusian side. Speaking about  the future of missilemen themselves, Lieutenant-General Viktor  Yesin, chief of the operations division of the main headquarters  of strategic missile forces, pointed out that they will serve in  undermanned Russian units. Commissioned and non-commissioned  officers who remain in Belarus will enjoy all the rights of  Belarusian citizens.    SOVIETSKAYA ROSSIA runs an address to the citizens of Russia  by the leaders of the left-centre opposition. The address  reads, in particular, as follows: "We are backed by the creative  experience and heroism of the great citizens of Russian and the  patriots of the motherland.    "We are backed by the millennia-long experience of Russian  statehood. We shall strive for national concord and  consolidation of society and for the enlistment of the efforts  of all citizens-patriots for the restoration of the wrecked  Russia which is at a loss."    ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE recalls that cityfolk are to go the  polls on Sunday to elect members of the ST. PETERSBURG municipal  assembly. Fifty seats are being contested by more than 740  candidates.    The municipal court issued a ruling recognising as invalid  the point in the statute of elections which previously limited  the participation of servicemen and students without a  residential registration in the polling. This time they are  also included in the voters' lists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakhstanis cannot get used to quickly changing  prices for food, basic goods, and services. In mid-May prices  for fuel have been increased very steeply, and this step was  explained by objective necessities. For instance, for oil  products the price has doubled, for electricity it has increased  by a factor of 2.8; for heating by 3.3 times; for gas by 3.6  times; and for rail haulage by 5 times.    As a KAZTAG correspondent was told at the Ministry of  Economy  pricing committee, this has automatically affected costs and  prices for other products.    In late May, prices for dairy and meat products doubled, and  as of 1 June prices increased for sugar, alcoholic drinks, and  light industry goods. The city administration has confirmed that  fares for public transportation in Almaty will double shortly.  Prices for bread, rolls, and some varieties of pulses and  combined fodder remain steady. One kilogram of beef in Almaty  state shops costs about 45 tenge; pork 51 tenge; chicken 50  tenge; butter 69 tenge; and sugar 47 tenge, which is by 2.5  times more than three weeks ago; a half-liter bottle of  Pshenichnaya vodka costs 73 tenge as of 1 June, which is also  almost 2.5 times more expensive than it was yesterday; a bottle  of three-star cognak is 83 tenge; of champagne 81 tenge.    This is not the limit, of course. According to the  specialists of the pricing committee, prices for food will again  increase by 20-25 percent shortly. It means our living standard  will fall again, and more people will find themselves below the  poverty level. One question remained unanswered -- when will  wages be increased again, and when will the national currency  finally stop falling?</p>

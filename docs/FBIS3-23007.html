He said  the government has facilitated the entry of extremists from  various countries of the world into Sudan. Addressing the Ansar  al-Sunnah group, whose mosque was attacked last week, al-Mahdi  said that the government has opened the country's doors to  extremists who only believe in violence and reject any dialogue  to resolve differences.    In statements published by the Algerian French-language  paper  EL WATAN today, al-Mahdi added that this incident, which left 16  people dead, is regarded as the most serious in Sudan since the  military coup carried out by 'Umar al-Bashir in 1989.    He noted that Sudan has become a place of refuge for all the  extremists from the various countries of the world, including  the Egyptian Islamic groups, the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda  Movement, the Moroccan al-'Adl wa al-Ihsan Group, and the  Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, as well as leader of the  Sudanese Islamic Front Hasan al-Turabi.    The Algerian EL WATAN said that 50 leaders of these groups  will form a council that will meet regularly in Sudan. There is  already a smaller council consisting of 15 top leaders,  including Algerian FIS leaders Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj.  The paper noted that after their arrest, Rached Ghannouchi,  leader of the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda Movement, has become the  most important figure in this council.    The paper wondered whether the extremists admitted into the  country by the Sudanese government were behind the armed attack  that took place against the mosque of the Ansar al-Sunnah group,  which is opposed to the government and is being persecuted by  the Sudanese authorities.

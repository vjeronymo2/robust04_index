			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT TO HEAR APPEAL OF CRIME FUND FEES  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear arguments in a case that  originated in San Diego challenging the constitutionality of a law requiring  people convicted of federal crimes to pay "assessments" to a special crime  victims fund.  </P> <P> Judy Clarke, an attorney with Federal Defenders, challenged the law as  unconstitutional in 1985, when her client pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor  counts of alien smuggling and paid a $50 assessment. The assessments, which  range from $25 to $200 per offense, are authorized by the Victims of Crime Act  of 1984.  </P> <P> In the 1985 case, German Munoz Flores was placed on two years' probation after  he pleaded guilty to alien smuggling. Munoz, 35, lives in Los Angeles and has  completed his probation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Origin  </P> <P> Clarke argued at the time that the assessments were unconstitutional because  they stem from a revenue-raising measure that originated in the Senate, instead  of the House of Representatives.  </P> <P> "The Constitution requires that all revenue-raising bills must originate in the  House of Representatives. The theory behind this was that the House is more  representative of the people," Clarke said.  </P> <P> Clarke argued this unsuccessfully when Munoz was sentenced by a federal  magistrate. She lost an appeal in U.S. District Court but won in the 9th U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court struck down the assessment law as  unconstitutional in December, 1988, and ruled that it was a revenue-raising law  that had incorrectly originated in the Senate.  </P> <P> Since then, federal courts in the 9th Circuit have not been accepting the  special assessment. The appellate court's ruling is binding in Arizona, Alaska,  California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the fee is still being collected in other federal jurisdictions. The  2nd, 3rd and 6th circuit courts have turned down challenges to the law and  declared it constitutional, Clarke said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where Money Goes  </P> <P> The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the 9th Circuit  Court's ruling. Government attorneys said the law is not a revenue-raising  measure because the money collected from criminals is deposited into the Crime  Victims Fund and not the U.S. Treasury.  </P> <P> Clarke has argued that the measure is an instrument to raise revenues because  the money goes "into a special fund that provides money for crime victims."  </P> <P> Although it is not known how much has been collected since the law went into  effect, Justice Department lawyers said the 9th Circuit Court's ruling  invalidates assessments against thousands of persons convicted in the nine  states covered by the court.  </P> <P> Clarke said that, in the fiscal year ending in June, 1988, there were about  40,000 criminal convictions in federal courts nationwide. She estimated that as  much as $5 million may have been raised from assessments during that period.  </P> <P> Before the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the law is  unconstitutional, the justices will have to be convinced that they have  jurisdiction in the matter, Clarke said. The court will have to be convinced  that it has authority under the 1803 decision in Marbury vs. Madison to review  laws that originate in Congress and decide whether they are constitutional or  unconstitutional.  </P></p>

Around 13,500 people left the  country and only some 2,200 came to Lithuania over the past  eight months, the Lithuanian Statistics Department reports.    A majority of those leaving are Russians, Ukrainians and  Belorus sans. Most of the emigrants are aged 40 and over. They  also include pensioners whose departure does not affect the  Lithuanian labor market.    The highest wave of emigration was registered in 1992 when  22,200 people left the country. Among the 13,500 emigrants of  this year, 550 people were Lithuanians. Around 30% of  them went  to live in the West. Around 800 Lithuanians came back to their  homeland, mainly from Siberia, northern regions of Russia,  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Approximately the same amount  of Russians, descendants of mixed families of deported  Lithuanians and locals, have decided to come and live in  Lithuania.    The state covers traveling expenses for ex-political  prisoners and exiles. These people also have the right to  participate in the privatization of state property and to get  housing on preferential terms.</p>

The ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA newspaper features an interview with  Sergey Volkov, D. Sc. (History), who says the following: "As for  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it is highly  improbable that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy (LDPR leader) will quarrel  with the president if Boris Yeltsin treats respectfully his  party.    "He has always sided with Yeltsin at the most fateful  moments: The dissolution of the old parliament and the approval  of the new constitution... Yeltsin benefited most of all by the  elections. Some people wanted to dump him and start the struggle  for the presidential office, but it has become clear now that  the country cannot do without him. He is the only mainstay."    In the scholar's opinion, "Zhirinovskiy will never be a  president, and the LDPR will never collect more than 30-40 per  cent of votes, as communists will never return to power  peacefully under their own name."    "People increasingly evaluate politicians by their deeds  rather than by their words," the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper  notes. "The LDPR's success at the general elections is only the  first stage of this party's downfall, as well as the downfall of  many other politicians determining the fate of our country now.    "Russia," the newspaper continues, "is a country of  revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. We have been  living in the conditions of the struggle between these two  parties for 150 years. The composition of these parties  constantly changes, and they come to power in turns. They  grappled in a bloody fight in Moscow's centre in 1993.    "Neither side was wise enough and responsible to stop and  even to retreat in order to prevent the country from going down  the drain. Regrettably, the fight has not ended yet. Victors  understand that they are not put in the dock. But they do not  understand another thing: The camp of victors immediately  divides into two factions of enemy friends. Russia has already  experienced all this in the 20th century."    The same newspaper carries an article by Aleksey Arbatov,  D.Sc. (History), saying the following: "The grim truth is that  the previous stage of reforms failed. Cosmetic patching-up and  personnel reshuffling will not improve the present situation.    "We should not `continue the course of reforms' but should  radically review both ways of drafting the policy and the policy  itself.    "Only a law-governed state can carry out democratic reforms  in the economy and policy. Not a single question of democratic  construction can be settled by force. It only aggravates  problems and yields diametrically opposite results."    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper runs an interview with  Former  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. "I cannot approve reforms,  especially when they are connected with a change of an economic  management system and the entire system and when authorities do  not keep the ailments of reforms under control," he says.    "Policy disregarding people's interests is immoral. I'm also  worried over a reverse movement from gained freedoms: from  openness and democratic institutions which started functioning.    "If anybody thinks that it is possible to gain stability and  order by discarding democracy, he makes a great mistake. If we  are to speak about firm order, it has been always based on the  efficient operation of all arms of government and firm  implementation of laws rather than on arbitrary rule," Gorbachev  stresses.    "I believe that Russia can restore its economic, political,  constitutional, legal and spiritual wealth," former chairman of  the Russian Constitutional Court writes in the PRAVDA newspaper.    "All of us should think over where we go, whom we elect and  whom we obey. We should overcome legal nihilism. We should  think abot responsibility, above all, of statesmen and  officials."    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper prints an interview with  Metropolitan Gedeon who says: "As a believer I claim: Russia is  the home of Holy Virgin. The mother of Jesus Christ cares for  our homeland. But we turned away from her. `Freedom' was  granted to us.    "Well, we partook of this freedom -- immorality, crime, drug  addiction and such shame when our Russian girls go to sell  themselves to underdeveloped countries for a piece of bread or  pie. Russia weeps with bloody tears and prays for stopping this  disgrace of lawlessness. Merciful Holy Virgin makes such  miracles and omens that we shall regain our consciousness  earlier or later and shall come to our senses."    The TRUD newspaper carries an article by chairman of the  Interdepartmental Commission of the Russian Security Council on  ecological security, dealing with the demographic situation in  Russia.    "According to the latest forecasts," he writes, "some  stabilisation of birth-rate is expected in the country, mostly  thanks to an increase in women of child-bearing age.    "The demographic situation in Russia as a whole, that is the  future of the nation, largely depends on whether the average  family will withstand this difficult time.    "If to speak honestly about the tragic statistics, the  conclusion is quite definite: Russia is ill, and the state of  its population's health already threatens the security of the  country."    Major-General Gennadiy Zaytsev, head of the Alfa group of  the  chief security department, describes the struggle against  terrorists in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper.    "Guided by an analysis of the present situation, we can draw  the conclusion that it is highly improbable that the level of  terrorism will drop in the near future. On the contrary, we may  encouter even its more audacious manifestations.    "To prevent them, it is necessary to create a streamlined  system of terrorism control at the state level. Besides, this  work should be directed from a single centre. In that case,  cooperation of various organisations participating in such  measures could be more close and fruitful," Zaytsev stressed.</p>

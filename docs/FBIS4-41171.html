			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian </F> deputy minister of defense, under "Topical Subject" rubric:  "Russia's Peacemaking Role"]    [Text] By virtue of the circumstances that have taken  shape, Russia today finds itself at the center of peacemaking  activity [mirotvorcheskaya deyatelnost] on the territory of the  former USSR. In some "hot spots" it remains the only force that  is actually exercising functions capable of ending fratricidal  war, separating warring sides, and getting them to sit around  the negotiating table.    An analysis of the situation attests to a significant future  broadening of the participation of Russian peacemaking subunits  on the territory of a number of CIS republics.    The participation of the Russian Federation, a permanent  member of the UN Security Council, in peacemaking operations is  determined by norms of international law, by the UN Charter, by  documents of the Security Council and the CSCE, and, with the  creation of the Council of CIS Heads of State, by the  Commonwealth Charter and the Agreement on Groups of Military  Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces [sily po  podderzhaniyu mira], which were adopted in Tashkent in May 1992.  Peacemaking problems were reflected in the Military Doctrine  adopted in the Russian Federation Security Council, which noted  for the first time that "Russia assists the efforts of the world  community and various collective security organs in preventing  wars and armed conflicts and in maintaining and restoring peace  and, to this end, deems it necessary to have Armed Forces and  other troops to conduct peacekeeping operations in accordance  with a UN Security Council decision or international  obligations."    But the existing legal basis is plainly inadequate. A draft  law defining the status, composition, maintenance, and functions  of Russia's peacemaking forces has been submitted to the State  Duma. The draft law lays down the procedure for providing  military and civilian personnel of the Russian Federation to  participate in operations to maintain and restore international  peace and security and in other kinds of UN peacemaking  activity, as well as in the fulfillment by the Russian  Federation of obligations adopted under international treaties  and agreements, including within the framework of the CSCE and  the CIS, as defined in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of the UN Charter.    Following the State Duma's adoption of the law, it is  necessary to draw up and adopt the Concept of Russia's  Participation in Peacemaking Activity and the Statute on the  Russian Federation's Peacemaking Forces. At the same time two  or three motorized rifle divisions of the Ground Forces must be  transferred to the authorized organizational structure of the  military contingents participating in peacekeeping operations.  It is proposed, starting in 1995, to relieve the airborne  troops of peacemaking tasks. Peacemaking force subunits must be  brought up to full strength, have modern, air-transportable  hardware with high off-road capabilities, be equipped with light  armament and means of communication and control, and be supplied  with the necessary resources to cope with autonomous actions  lasting two or three months. This hardware must not count  toward the maximum levels restricted by treaty obligations in  the European part of Russia.    The Russian Ministry of Defense is prepared to take on the  tasks of manning, training, and equipping military contingents  of peacemaking forces and military observers and supplying them  at permanent deployment garrisoning locations, but questions of  funding are very acute.    There are several reasons for this. First, legislation on  peacemaking has not been created in any of the former republics  of the USSR. Second, despite the protocol "On the Manning,  Structure, and Material, Technical, and Financial Support of the  Group of Military Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces  in the CIS," which was signed by the CIS heads of state in May  1992 and which provides for these costs to be borne from  contributions from the CIS states and the sides involved in a  conflict, Russia has received nothing.    Third, we consider it logical that the world community, in  tending toward the recognition of Russia as a guarantor against  the escalation of conflicts to the scale of regional wars, could  express this support not just in words but also by partially  covering Russia's expenditure on peacekeeping operations in the  near abroad out of UN funds. Or else offset this expenditure  against Russia's subscription to the United Nations for the same  purposes. During 1993 alone more than 26 billion rubles [R] was  spent out of the Defense Ministry's budget on the peacemaking  activities of military contingents. It is perfectly obvious  that Russia's peacemaking forces must be funded out of the  federal budget under a separate subhead, while expenditure  connected with peacemaking activity on the territories of the  republics of the former USSR must be covered by the CIS states'  contributions in monetary or other form on a shared basis.    A few words about the participation of Russian peacemaking  forces in the settlement of armed conflicts in the near abroad.  In accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Russian  Federation and Moldavia [Moldova] "On the Principles of the  Peaceful Settlement of the Armed Conflict in the Dniester  Region" of 23 July 1992, a contingent of the Russian Federation  Armed Forces was formed on a voluntary basis, consisting  initially of six battalions, and was sent into the regions of  the conflict from 23 July through 31 August 1992. Today the  strength of the peacemaking force there has been reduced.  Personnel serve in the zone of responsibility between the sides  involved in the conflict, which has an overall length of  approximately 225 km and a width of between 4 and 15 km, a  checkpoint-control regime is being organized, observation posts  are being set up, mobile groups are being created to patrol  sectors, important installations are placed under guard, and an  alert-duty subunit is appointed.    Purposeful and concerted actions have resulted in the  stabilization of the situation in the region and control over  its development. The blood of peaceful inhabitants is no longer  being shed, and the talks process relating to the final  settlement of the conflict by peaceful means is continuing,  albeit with difficulty. It is clear, however, from a forecast of  the development of the situation in the Dniester Region that the  withdrawal of our units and subunits of the peacemaking forces  appears premature, although the question of a further reduction  in the quantity of men and equipment in the conflict zone has  already been raised. A final solution to the conflict situation  in the region is a matter for the politicians.    In South Ossetia a military contingent of the peacemaking  forces was sent into the conflict zone in July 1992 on the basis  of "Directives of the Russian Federation Government" in the  light of the fulfillment of the Dagomys agreements of 24 June  1992 on settling the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, and it is  continuing to fulfill its tasks. A complex situation persists  in the region. Deliveries of food and essential goods from  Georgia have not been made for a long time. Paper currency has  been virtually withdrawn from circulation. The crime situation  is deteriorating. The population has been forced to defend  itself against robbery and lawlessness. Practically the entire  adult male population has weapons.    A CSCE mission is working in the conflict zone to monitor  the  situation and give some humanitarian assistance. A fragile  stability is being maintained in South Ossetia only thanks to  the presence of the Russian peacemaking force. If it is  withdrawn, the situation could instantly get out of control.  The danger of a further explosion of military confrontation has  now increased significantly.    Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division has been performing  peacemaking tasks in the Republic of Tajikistan for  approximately two years. In October 1993 it became part of the  Collective Peacemaking Forces which had been formed. The  division is a deterrent factor in the escalation of civil war  and the conduct of large-scale provocative actions on the  Tajik-Afghan border. Russia is taking an active part in  settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani and Georgian-Abkhazian  conflicts. A peacemaking operation began 14 June in the region  of the latter.    The performance of peacemaking tasks is attended by daily  risk to servicemen's lives and is carried out under conditions  of unceasing provocations from both sides. Isolation from the  permanent deployment garrisoning locations, the growth of  antiarmy and anti-Russian feeling among the local population,  and the lengthy stay in a zone of conflict (state of emergency)  rightly arouse the concern of servicemen. But the greatest  concern is aroused by the peacemaking forces' lack of status,  the vagueness of their rights and obligations, and the poor  social and legal provision: the low pay and remuneration, poor  life and health insurance, and lack of privileges in the  provision of housing.    Despite this, today Russia's Armed Forces play the paramount  role in maintaining peace and stability and in settling  conflicts. But the success of any peacemaking action depends on  the military contingent's qualitative training and on careful  planning. To these ends we have set up training centers in the  27th and 45th Guards' Motorized Rifle Divisions. But the  training facilities do not yet make it possible to fully train  personnel. It is necessary to improve them, but again the  matter is being held up by funding.    Russia actively participates in theoretical elaborations and  consultations on peacemaking activity with various international  organizations (United Nations, CSCE, North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, NATO, and others), including on a bilateral basis with  interested countries. This year it is planned to hold the first  Russian-U.S. joint command and staff exercise of the Russian  Federation's 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S.  3d Infantry Division. Their chief aim is to define mutually  acceptable approaches to the planning of troop operations and  organizing collaboration between units and subunits when  conducting a peacekeeping operation. It is also proposed to  rehearse questions of troop control during such operations, to  work out unified sets of documents and views on operating  tactics, and to enhance the subunits' readiness to operate as  part of coalition peacekeeping forces in "hot spots."    But the mass media and individual politicians have recently  been fueling passions over the upcoming exercise. The polemic  is undoubtedly being conducted by uninformed people, for the  purpose of misleading public opinion. On 16 March 1994 PRAVDA  published the article "Our Strategists Are Too Ingenuous" by  Major General Viktor Chudov, retired. The article contains a  number of gross distortions. In particular, it maintains that a  full division on each side will be involved in the measure. The  author casts doubt on the military-political advisability of the  exercise and on the whole package of Russian-U.S. relations in  the military sphere. The article attempts to link the upcoming  exercise to a U.S. desire to introduce its own armed contingent  onto Russian soil and to assimilate a new theater of military  operations.    The article's author distorted the scale and nature of the  planned exercises. It is planned to conduct not a troop  exercise but merely a command and staff exercise involving up to  250 people on each side and automotive equipment. The upcoming  exercise is regarded as a real contribution by our countries to  the preparation and conduct of peacemaking operations. The  initiative for holding it came from the Ministry of Defense, and  the presidents of Russia and the United States announced it back  in September 1993.    Several versions of a command and staff exercise were  considered. The U.S. military proposed holding it on U.S.  territory, but the U.S. side was unable to take on all the  costs, including the transfer of hardware and personnel. Such  expenditure was unacceptable to us. A proposal to hold the  exercise on FRG territory -- the stationing location of the U.S.  3d Infantry Division -- did not meet with understanding on the  German side. Therefore the territory of the Totskoye Range --  the stationing location of the 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle  Division -- was chosen. This means minimal expenditure for our  side -- approximately R100 million.    The U.S. Congress is allocating $5 million just to transfer  69 units of automotive equipment and 250 personnel from Germany  (city of Wuerzburg).    The U.S. side is prepared to pay for the Russian side's work  and services in preparing for the joint command and staff  exercise -- equipping the checkpoint and the motor vehicle pool,  refueling hardware, "damages" to the ecology, etc. -- in the sum  of R0.5 billion. If the command and staff exercise were held on  U.S. territory, our side's transport costs alone would increase  by a factor of four or five times.    If we were to abandon the holding of the joint exercise, as  individual politicians demand, Russia would not fulfill its  promises and would lose the confidence of the world public. And  yet the exercises are the most humane and noble.    On the basis of an analysis of the Totskoye exercise and of  additional coordination, and given the adoption of political  decisions, the next joint command and staff exercise or training  session will take place on U.S. territory.    Under conditions wherein the CIS states are pursuing a  policy  of strict neutrality, displaying no interest in resolving armed  conflicts using their own forces, Russia remains the only state  with the military and political potential to conduct operations  to maintain and restore peace -- which it confirms by its  practical activity. Russia's peacemaking role is a natural one.  For decades the peoples of the former USSR lived as a single  family, and a tight knot of interrelations was tied which had  both achievements and problems. This was the result of joint  efforts by all the peoples and ethnic groups of the USSR who had  earlier linked their fate with Russia. It is now the latter's  duty to do everything to ensure that the former members of one  family are not at odds with each other.    Russia has historically been a guarantor of other peoples'  reconciliation and has always come to their assistance at a  difficult time. In all conflict situations it has so far been  perceived as a kinsman, not as a stranger. It is considerably  simpler for it to get to the bottom of what is happening and to  influence reconciliation. It directs its main effort into  settling crisis situations in regions in direct proximity to its  borders, since stability and peace on these territories are of  vital importance to Russia and its citizens, 25 million of whom  live in states in the near abroad. It was and still is the only  force capable of fulfilling these tasks. Life itself suggests  that no international organization or group of states will take  the place of Russia's peacemaking efforts on the territory of  the former USSR.</p>

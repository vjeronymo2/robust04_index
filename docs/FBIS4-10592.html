			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with </F> unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in Tegucigalpa  -- live]    [Text] [Reina] Distinguished guests: The media have  produced in the past few days a number of reports on various  aspects of national life. Far from considering such reports as  negative expressions, I consider them to be positive, because  the people have high expectations and want to see the  implementation of a number of actions that are in line with our  proposal for a new style of government and a moral revolution  for everyone.    People know that this new course of action will soon be  established and want to participate. We have encouraged this  process through the establishment of a great national consensus  on which we are working intensively. A government that  establishes a new style also generates a new style of response.  No longer is there in Honduras a government that subjugates and  paralyzes the people. It is now trying to establish power...  [pauses] the role of co-protagonist in [words indistinct]. This  is essential (?under the circumstances).    We anticipated this in our messages of 27 January and 7  March. In them were clearly established the [word indistinct].  My next lengthy speech will be on 8 May, although on that day I  must travel to Costa Rica for the new president's inauguration.  That speech could be delivered a day early or a day late. In  that speech, marking 100 days in office, we will advance in our  efforts to keep our people informed.    We maintain an impartial position as we try to fulfill state  duties. The people gave us a very clear mandate: to attack the  problem of corruption in all its forms. This government is  committed to establishing the bases for tackling this major  problem. It is neither easy nor feasible in only 60 days to  change situations that have been present on national territory  or in the mentality of many of its protagonists.    Among such reports there was news of a plot against the  president of the Republic. This was analyzed in various forms,  but the truth is that the people have detected that persons  involved in very deplorable activities have tried to carry out  this kind of attack on Honduran democracy.    And lately, there was the news of a coup d'etat. I  understand that those charges are based on reports from human  rights organizations that wish to prevent in Honduras acts that  are so negative and so outrageous, not only to the nation's  dignity but also to constitutional rule and to the strength of  democratic institutions.    I am ready for your questions. I wish to reaffirm my  intention to maintain the best of relations with the media. I  will do whatever it takes to contribute to this with utmost  frankness and to promote greater rapprochement. I want the  common man in Honduras to benefit from correct information and  information that is not distorted in order to ensure that the  people are well informed. This is a requirement for all free  men.    [Reina] I want to take this opportunity to thank General  Luis Alonso Discua Elvir for his statements, which I think are  very timely and very correct. We must analyze their  extraordinarily positive nature, because they reaffirmed support  for civilian power and for the great strength of democratic  institutions. I believe the Armed Forces will play a new role  as an institution within democracy to contribute in order to the  country's development, to fight corruption, and to improve the  general situation of our compatriots. This new role reflects a  new mentality, which is totally contrary to the ideas of making  attempts against the people's sovereignty by threatening state  institutions. I am now ready to answer your questions.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] criticisms against government.  First there were reports of a plot and now of a coup d'etat. As  president of the Republic do you think there could be a coup  d'etat in Honduras? Also, what is the situation with regard to  the plot, since the suspect was released?    [Reina] I look at both situations in a positive way. With  regard to the plot, we will have to publish a white paper so  that the people can have all the [two-minute break in reception]  the Armed Forces. We are now getting used to this new style.  These rumors alert the people, so they can defend their  institutions and prevent any intention that could exist in the  minds of anyone, meaning anyone who is against the moral  revolution. After 8 May, when we will have names and specific  cases, you will see those reactions intensify. They will try to  seek things. What for example? Many Liberal Party members are  impatient because their hopes of getting a job with the  government -- which were fully justified -- have not been  fulfilled. If 1 million Liberals vote for the Liberal Party,  not all of them can get a job with the government. Good  citizens understand this, are patient, and above all, they want  this to be a good government in order to have the opportunity to  stay in power. In that sense, all good Liberals know of our  desire and intention to satisfy their needs.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Reina] The IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] is an  economic organization. It analyzes the country, and, however,  the country is run by the Executive Branch. All they do is give  ideas as to what they believe could or should be done. I am not  going to go into a detailed discussion of the Armed Forces  economic activities. We have referred to that before. However,  it is not the IDB which leads this country. It is the Executive  Branch and the other branches of the state, within the realm of  their duties, which run the country and it is with them that we  should discuss all the details of this situation.    When they hear the news, those who oppose the government  want  to interpret it negatively. We have had to take specific  actions. There was talk that no actions were taken. We did so  in order not to affect the large majority as was been done in  the past. Instead, we sought solutions to that bad tradition  which many do not want mentioned.    However, after two months [in office], we do have to talk  about the way we received the country. It is our obligation.  It is not an excuse, it is a reality and measures have been  taken. But I do not accept the charges that when there were  invasions it meant that there was anarchy. Actions were taken  to dislodge the land invaders, and then there is talk about  brutality in the methods used. This is a true picture of ill  faith. This is not correct because we are acting very  correctly. Some of the values of this government have not yet  been perceived by the majority. One of them is the honesty with  which we handle the government. It will yield its fruits, but  it is a matter of having patience to consolidate the great  values of democracy.    [Reporter] Recently there has been much criticism of your  government. Labor, peasant, and private sectors [words  indistinct] of your own party, what do you think is the reason  for this criticism? Do you think that your government has lost  popularity or credibility?    [Reina] Popularity is a value I appreciate, but if your  president is going to act based on keeping or losing his  popularity, then he could make big mistakes.    Criticism comes from sectors that do not want this  government  to move ahead with its theory of a moral revolution. When the  presidential designate said that some of the measures could  cause disappointment, that was interpreted as if the government  lost its credibility. But that is not true. As long as the  people trust that the moral revolution is on and that it will  give the people all their rights, the people's trust will  constitute the government's main source of support. There will  always be criticism. Some will be right. However, what we do  not want is for misinterpretation of facts to prevail. For  example, the story that someone can tell, from such a long  distance, that the United Nations wants a coup d'etat in  Honduras.... [pauses] this is where I call for your  understanding and help. How can it be that a human rights  organization, an organization to defend man, could perceive that  the government is threatened? The organization reported it.  That is a defense. Just as Costa Rica's solidarity is a  defense, Costa Rica has proven its solidarity in a thousand ways  and so has President Gaviria. He expressed his solidarity as  the new OAS secretary general. I also received a very  flattering note from U.S. President Bill Clinton. These are  facts that show that Honduras' image is an excellent one in the  eyes of all democrats on this continent and the world.    [Reporter] When we talk with the people, including the  leaders of the Liberal Party, everyone agrees that the  population is dissatisfied. The vice president of congress told  us just yesterday that you should fulfill your campaign  promises, because there is enormous doubt among the people,  which could polarize the country. That could end up who knows  where. I would like you to expand on this a little, because the  voice of the people is saying that your campaign promises are  not being fulfilled and there is discontent.    [Reina] I am glad you asked me that. I am going to fulfill  all of my campaign promises. I am not going to miss any of  them. If, by the end of my four years, I have to say that I was  unable to accomplish something I had promised, I will do so  honestly. But what were my campaign promises? We must  constantly remind everyone. My main promise was to promote a  moral revolution in Honduras. It would not be true to say I  have failed to meet that one. I promised to select the best  Hondurans to lead the Executive Branch. I fulfilled it. I  promised to restore justice in Honduras. The Supreme Court of  Justice is a guarantee for juridical security. I cannot change  these promises, and I am going to keep them.    I have not said that the media in general misinterpret the  facts. I have said that sometimes, under certain circumstances,  the media have published an interpretation of the facts that  differs from my analysis. An example is the UN issue, and  another example is the plot to assassinate me. This is not the  first time, either. Once, during the campaign, the media said I  had passed away, and when I reappeared they said I invented the  report myself. The same is happening now with this thing about  a plot. It is all an effort to hurt me or harm me, because  everything is subject to interpretation. I am not the kind that  hides cards up his sleeve or contradicts himself. I stand by my  principles. I have not failed to fulfill any of my promises. I  hardly made any promises.    What did I promise to do? I promised to throw all the  thieves in jail. How can anyone expect all of the thieves to be  shaven and groomed and in jail after just two months? I  promised to carry out a moral revolution; not hold discretionary  funds; be thorough in overseeing the people's money.    If you speak to any member of the PLH [Liberal Party of  Honduras] who has not managed to fulfill his legitimate  aspirations, he is not going to be very happy. He will say that  he struggled for so long and is still living poorly. That is  perfectly understandable, but that does not make that PLH member  an enemy of the government. He is a citizen who has the  absolute right to demand understanding and claim his share of  well-being from the government. This is not a loss of  credibility. It is impatience to see the government's  objectives fulfilled.    I will be in continuous contact with the media. I have the  greatest appreciation for all of you. Our state of  underdevelopment leads us into somewhat uncomfortable  situations. When I arrived at the Copn Sula Hotel [as received]  in San Pedro Sula the other day, I encountered 50 reporters all  hurrying to get the scoop -- which was very logical -- and they  almost smothered a woman who was just there to deliver an  envelope. She is a very respectable lady, and she almost  collapsed. Situations such as this are sometimes  misinterpreted. I would ask you not to promote such  misinterpretations, but to try and achieve an open and frank  flow of communication. I am an honest and open man, and I have  nothing to hide from the media or from anyone. I hereby submit  each event of my public and my private life to tour  consideration. I have not contradicted myself on this matter  either. I have not failed to keep any of my promises. I have  not yet had enough time or space to fulfill everything I  promised. These are all a matter of principles: to promote a  moral revolution; to fight corruption; to tell the truth; and to  guard the public funds. These promises, you can believe me, I  have kept.    [Unidentified speaker] Lourdes Janet Bonilla.    [Bonilla] [Words indistinct] government institutions and  this  hinders the country's socioeconomic development. He has said  that medium- and long-term measures will have to be adopted  immediately to prevent an imbalance in the country's economy.  What can you tell us about that?    [Reina] There are some tremendous contradictions. They are  demanding measures that could damage the economy of a people who  are facing a very difficult situation. I made a promise to  defend the poor in Honduras, and they are the majority, and I am  doing all that I can to keep that promise. The organizations at  times can be very cold, but I have to admit they can help us.  This will be proven when we show that the public funds are  being handled properly. The organizations become upset when  they see that the aid they are providing does not reach those it  was intended to help. I believe that even the charges made in  New York will work for the good of the government. No one makes  charges for something to happen; they make charges to ensure  that things do not happen.    Honduras has a new image. Everyone knows, and everyone has  admitted, that Honduras' image suffered during the Cold War.  Today, Honduras' image has regained prestige. It has a  legitimate government and authorities who want to work for the  good of the people.    [Unidentified speaker] According to the press secretary of  the Office of the President this will be the last question. Let  us hear what the president has to say. Basically, he is  analyzing his government and the international image his  government been able to project.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Merchant Marines to the  military, that Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise]  be privatized, and that the draft be abolished. Do you believe  that this would hinder the relations between the government and  the Armed Forces? What do you think your government should do  in light of the verbal confrontations between the Honduran  private sector and the Armed Forces?    [Reina] The steps you have mentioned are logical steps and  there is no reason why they should create problems between the  military and the civilians. The talks in Brussels will be open  talks. The highest scientific, technical, and ethical  international authorities will attend the talks. There will be  nothing hidden. We are going to accept the ruling.    Now, regarding the other two issues, the Merchant Marine and  the draft: the Executive Branch has drafted a bill on the  military draft and it is going to be submitted to the  Legislative Branch. We have taken our time on this to ensure  that the draft bill has been done properly. We do not have to  improvise because improvisation only leads to problems. The  draft bill will be submitted to the National Congress sometime  next week. The Merchant Marine issue is being studied, and I am  pleased to tell you that the Armed Forces has not defied me on  this.    Regarding the confrontation between private enterprise and  the Armed Forces, it is all a matter of the new times in which  we are living. We are undergoing a period of economic changes.  We have seen that the institutions that (?protect) their  employees social security rights and retirement have money, and  we must put that money to good use. This creates competition  for the private sector. However, a balance must be kept. As  long as the Armed Forces refrain from using their military power  for economic pressure, I believe they are in their right to do  what they think is correct. What would be serious would be for  the Armed Forces to abuse their power to compete. That is the  balance my government has established, and the soldiers I have  talked to agree fully with me.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct].    [Reina] What everyone has is the goodwill to help our people  overcome their problems.    [Unidentified speaker] This is Voz de Honduras broadcasting  from the Presidential Palace. We are bringing to you a news  conference by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. Another  question is being asked about internal politics. The Honduran  president met with Liberal Party deputies who strongly  criticized the government and government operations.    [Reporter] How do you react to this? [Words indistinct]    [Reina] I will tell you frankly. I do not think I will go  there at this time. I have talked with them, and the ministers  have been instructed to listen to them and tend to them as best  as possible. Should any such request be made, I would discuss  it with them because the ministers are willing to cooperate.  What they cannot do, however, is give jobs to all active  members recommended by all the deputies, mayors, and leaders. I  think the education minister is excellent; she is doing a very  good job in a tremendously difficult ministry. If the minister  does not have a good team to control the various agencies, the  ministry can get out of hand. This is why I hereby reaffirm my  support for her. This I have already done, both orally and in  writing, so everyone knows that the president of the Republic  backs up his ministers.    [Announcer] This is the news conference held by Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina at the Presidential Palace press  room. He is now leaving for sports activities.    [Reporter] The Honduran president discussed his campaign  pledges. One was missing. He did not mention military service  as one of the pledges that will be fulfilled, Mr. President.    [Reina] I have said I will present the bill to the National  Congress next week. The implementation depends on congressional  approval. I have no authority to approve it, but I can defend  it in Congress.</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Telford and Shropshire (3): Coping with the unexpected - Hazel Duffy finds the real test of the town plan was its adaptability Unrelenting blackness hung over the back-to-back slums of Birmingham and the aptly named Black Country well into the 1960s. The worst conditions prevailed in factories and offices. Then in 1968, Telford - the town was named after the inventive British engineer - was planned as an overspill from the huge West Midlands conurbation. Demographers at the time were predicting that the population of the area would grow. The new town was designed to accommodate this projected growth and to put people in improved surroundings. Although the idea of creating new towns to relieve population in urban areas was unpopular in some quarters, ministers had decided that in the West Midlands some relief had to be provided. While a predominantly rural county, the chosen new town area of Shropshire was far from being a rural paradise of green fields on which young architects could unleash their ambitions. John Madin, architect of the plan, says his first inspection of the area revealed 'mile upon mile of derelict land running from the Severn Gorge to the A5'. This is where the Industrial Revolution was born. Spoil heaps littered the area and he and his partner later discovered 3,000 mine shafts. The task was twofold: to plan for a new town and to reclaim this large tract of derelict land. But the real test of the Madin plan - based originally on the Dawley area, in the south of what is now Telford, and expanded by 1968 to include the area to the north - was whether it could be adapted to the political and economic shifts which lay ahead. The plan had to be strong but flexible. 'A plan which would, as the town was built, accept economical and social changes from then into the 1990s. In the early '60s that seemed a long way off. It seemed as far away and as unrealistic as George Orwell's 1984,' says Mr Madin. In the event, Telford had to be shaped on a smaller population than originally planned. Instead of the forecast 225,000 by the early 1990s the 1991 census puts the population at 119,000 and this is not expected to increase much beyond 140,000 in the next decade. Part of the reason behind the discrepancy in the figures was that families were turning out to be smaller than expected. Also Telford did not attract as much employment as had been foreseen. The Midlands economy - which it was assumed would provide most of the jobs for Telford - did not go on expanding beyond the early 1970s. Existing industry in the Telford area, notably the companies in the GKN complex, shrank. The planner Professor Colin Buchanan, whose report on traffic in towns was published 30 years ago, was more successful in his predictions. Professor Buchanan said roads and other facilities would have to be built to accommodate the growing number of cars and trucks. While, to a large extent, Professor Buchanan was ignored, Telford - the first new town to be planned post Buchanan - shows his influence. The original plan specified a town motorway, linked to the main roads, connecting residential areas with industry and the town centre. A secondary road system connected the residential areas - a group of villages, based on the original villages in the area and supplemented by new clusters - and access to the town centre. Local distributor roads joined up with the inner and outer roads. This concept was expanded to include the larger area five years later. Pedestrians were not to be neglected. Walkways connect the housing clusters with schools, community facilities and transport to the places of work. Green swathes of land have survived between the villages. A park was built in the centre. One vital road link was missing for the first 15 years - the connection with the M6, although Mr Madin says he had told ministers at the outset that Telford must be connected with the new motorway network if it was to succeed. The M54 was opened in 1983. Continued government restrictions on industry expanding into areas other than those of persistent high unemployment was to prove another shackle on the growth of Telford into the 1970s. Those who did move there, however, were greeted with houses and their own small gardens. Tower blocks were discouraged in Telford, in spite of their huge popularity with architects and treasurers in the cities. The first houses were almost all built by the development corporation for rent to standards which were higher than those the private housebuilders could afford to specify. Space was set aside for private housing, however, much of which has since been taken up. Planning in the 1960s assumed that automation was going to allow for more leisure time. The white heat of technology was to be turned to the benefit of everybody, giving them more money and more time to enjoy themselves. In fact, it was unemployment which struck Telford in the 1979-1982 recession. The fall in spending power and the slower than forecast growth in population meant that investors were reluctant to take up the Telford opportunity. This has gradually changed as the town succeeded in persuading the government to designate an enterprise zone within its boundaries and as the development corporation attracted a new and more diversified group of employers from other parts of Britain and from overseas. The town centre has expanded and attracts shoppers from a wide area, although the shopping centre does not look like the one that was originally planned, which specified shops to be built on a canopy, with car parking facilities beneath. Instead, the shops are surrounded by open-air car parks as in out-of-town shopping centres. But, as Telford matures developers may be persuaded to work up improved schemes. Many things did not turn out as planners in the 1960s had envisaged. But Mr Madin, who now runs an international design group, believes that his original plan - dubbed a plan for 'freedom city' in 1969 by the Birmingham Evening Mail - was largely respected by the development corporation. Above all, the plan proved to be flexible enough to cope with the unexpected. And the town is gaining the self-confidence that is to be expected of a 25-year-old.</p>

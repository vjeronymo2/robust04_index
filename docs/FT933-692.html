			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Business and the Law: Gambling on entry to the UK market - European Court No judgments have been delivered by the Community Courts since they returned to work after the summer vacation on 13 September 1993. The first is expected on 7 October. But there have been oral hearings in 12 cases. Last week, there was a hearing in a case which may prove an important test of the Court's interpretation of the legal principles underlying the internal market. The case concerns lotteries and the rights of agents representing large-scale lotteries run by German Lander to provide their services in the UK and to import advertising materials and tickets into the country. Unlike certain small or private lotteries, large-scale lotteries are not expressly permitted by the UK Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976. Importing tickets and advertising materials relating to large-scale lotteries is also prohibited. According to the summary of the interested parties' arguments prepared by French judge, M. Grevisse, the Commission drew attention to its recent report on the EC gambling market. The report (Gambling in the Single Market - Study of the current legal and market situation) estimated the value of the EC gambling market, measured by total stakes, at ECU 46.5bn (Dollars 36bn) in 1989. Lotteries and similar activities accounted for ECU 16.7bn. National lottery markets were dominated by state organised and controlled lotteries, except in the UK. Yet international gambling operators, by using new technologies, are pushing the frontiers of gambling beyond national borders. However, the legal questions raised by this case make it likely that the Court's ruling will be indicative of its approach to the internal market. The key questions concern the permissible exceptions to the rules on free movement of goods and services in the internal market, both trade restrictions expressly exempted by the Treaty and those recognised by the Court's past decisions as justified in the public interest. The first question is whether the rules on trade in goods or those on cross-border services apply. Whatever the answer, similar principles have been applied in the past to permissible exceptions. Eleven member countries have urged the Court to give a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty rules on free movement of goods and services in answer to questions referred by the London Commercial Court in proceedings brought by the Customs and Excise. Italy has not commented. On the other hand, the Commission told the ECJ positive answers must be given to questions concerning the equivalence of the safeguards enforced under German law with those applied in the general field of lotteries, football pools and bingo in the UK. The Commission added there is no justification for UK rules to be allowed to go beyond those already applied to the lotteries in question by way of 'home country control' in Germany. If the ECJ agrees with the Commission, the UK rules will be unlawful. It remains to be seen whether the Court will interpret the Treaty in a manner which will promote rather than delay a genuine single market for business. C-275/92, HM Customs &amp; Excise v Schindler, hearing ECJ FC, 22 September 1993. Pending cases. Recently, the Court has heard argument in cases varying from interpretation of the 1975 directive on waste disposal (C-236/92 Comitato di Coordinamento per la Difesa della Cava et al v Regione Lombardia et al, hearing ECJ FC, 14 September 1993) to consideration of the application of the Treaty rules on free movement of goods to national restrictions on the advertising of non-pharmaceutical products by pharmacists (C-292/92 Hunermund v Landesapothekerkammer Baden-Wurttemberg, hearing ECJ FC, 15 September 1993). In the competition field, the Court of First Instance (CFI) heard an appeal by Cartes Bancaire against the Commission's 1991 decision imposing a fine on the Eurocheque network's Helsinki agreement on charges relating to Eurocheques (Joined Cases T-39/92 and T40/92, Cartes Bancaires 'CB' v Commission, hearing CFI 1CH, 22 September 1993).</p>

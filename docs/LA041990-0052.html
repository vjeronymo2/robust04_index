			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: EARTH DAY: YESTERDAY AND TODAY  </P> <P> The grizzled old man was sitting on the park bench, eating a recycled cheese  sandwich, when a group of youngsters stopped by.  </P> <P> "How old are you, Gramps?" one of them asked.  </P> <P> "Pretty old," the man replied.  </P> <P> "Are you old enough to remember Earth Day?"  </P> <P> "Yup, it was in April 22, 1970, but it seems like yesterday. It's hard to  describe it if you weren't there. Fumes were coming out of the tailpipes of  cars, black smoke was billowing from factory chimneys, and we soon discovered  we had something called acid rain that killed all the fish in the freshwater  lakes."  </P> <P> "Aw," said one of the kids. "No one would be stupid enough to kill all the  fish."  </P> <P> "It was worse than that. People threw anything they wanted into the rivers, and  they flushed garbage and other stuff into the ocean. I saw it myself. We  couldn't even go swimming on the beaches because it wasn't safe."  </P> <P> "Wow," yelled one little boy. "I'm glad that I wasn't alive then."  </P> <P> "Developers built houses over nuclear waste sites, and legitimate companies  hired gangsters to dump poisonous waste material from one end of the country to  the other. Nobody in the government would take responsibility for it. In those  days the average citizen didn't do too well against the lobbyists when they  appealed their case to Washington."  </P> <P> "Not like today, huh, Gramps?" one of the kids laughed.  </P> <P> "That's right. Today the government really worries about its dumps. Before  Earth Day people sprayed insecticide on everything. That's because no one knew  it was bad for kids."  </P> <P> "Have they stopped spraying?"  </P> <P> "No," Gramps told him, "but they now give you time to cover your car with  plastic and crawl into your house. I guess the biggest thing that concerned us  in those days was pesticides running off into the drinking water. The chemical  companies claimed that we had nothing to be afraid of and, to prove it, the  president of a company drank a glass of water on TV."  </P> <P> "They must have been exciting times, Gramps."  </P> <P> "We were pretty wild in those days. We used to throw our bottles into the  street and burn our trash in the back yard and even toss Styrofoam plates and  cups into the ocean."  </P> <P> "We still do that," another boy said.  </P> <P> "Well, you can't expect the population to change its habits in just 20 years.  Our one objective on Earth Day was to prevent the next generation from  inheriting a cesspool. Two decades ago we declared, 'Enough is enough. We have  to make the highway smell like the sea breeze and the sea breeze smell like the  highway.' Of course, everyone was for it even after they found out how much it  would cost."  </P> <P> "So what did you do when you found out how much money was involved, Gramps?"  </P> <P> "We sang a lot -- mostly, 'this land was made for you and me.' "  </P> <P> "Are you sure you're telling us the truth, Gramps?"  </P> <P> "What part do you mean, son?"  </P> <P> "The part where people didn't care what they discarded or where they discarded  it."  </P> <P> "I swear to you it was that way. I know it's hard for you kids to imagine how  different it was compared with how spic and span everything is today.  </P> <P> "It was so bad then that you couldn't see the forests for the rain."  </P></p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Observer: Not so capital Why would an outfit as canny as the Royal Bank of Scotland effectively give away its Capital House investment management operation gratis, and then shell out Pounds 25m for a one-third stake in a new organisation? Out of a sense of relief, it would seem. The beneficiary of this recent largesse, Newton Management, is one of the best in the business. Its average pension fund client last year earned a total return of 37.4 per cent, 8.2 percentage points above the industry average. Contrast Capital House, whose sole institutional client is the RBS pension scheme, and which languishes in the bottom 10 per cent of all pension fund managers on the basis of its performance over the past three years. In June of last year, trustees to the Charterhouse pension schemes - Charterhouse then still being in the RBS stable before the September sale of 90 per cent of the bank to a Franco-German consortium - quietly sacked Capital House and transferred its loyalties to Mercury Asset Management.</p>

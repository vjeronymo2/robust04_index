Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of  the WCDBANR and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council [SLORC] attended the meeting and delivered  an opening address.    In his opening speech, he said today's meeting is the work  committee's first meeting in 1994. He added responsible  personnel of the work committee have held coordination meetings  whenever it is necessary even though the work committee does not  want to hold meetings very often. He continued and said he  coordinated development activities for Kachin Special Region-2,  which are to be implemented by joining hands with the Kachin  Independence Army [KIA]--an armed organization, with the  chairman of the WCDBANR subcommittees. He said it has been  nearly five years since the implementation of the development of  border areas and national races began in May 1989. He noted  that the implementation of development activities in the regions  now have to be expanded for jungle-based organizations who are  going to return to the legal fold. He continued that border  areas and national races development activities are not the sole  responsibility of the Ministry of Development of Border Areas  and National Races and said all the ministries have to carry out  these activities as if they are their main tasks. He said the  implementation of border areas and national races development  activities is actually the fulfillment of the three cardinal  causes. [nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of  national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty].  [passage omitted]    He then added that preparations must be made now to  introduce  for substitution crops for opium in the respective regions.  When this is accomplished, the substitution crops can be  cultivated effectively during opium growing season. That is why  preparations are necessary to ensure the needed supply of seeds,  saplings, machinery, fertilizer, and other equipment. [passage  omitted]    Continuing, he said the state government has been carrying  out border area development activities effectively and with  genuine goodwill. One can see the gradual growth in urban and  rural development when compared to the previous situation. The  jungle-based armed organizations have realized their activities  are not benefiting the country and local native people, and they  also believe that the state government is really working for the  benefit of national races in border areas. That is why, they  are offering to hold peace talks. If the armed insurgencies  subside in various border regions, these regions will become  calm and the state government will be able to carry out more  development activities than what is currently being done.  [passage omitted]    He then added that we should look at the work being carried  out to eradicate narcotic drugs in border areas. The  destruction on 27 October of an old opium refinery and equipment  by local natives near (Aunglankhet), (Khinpunlon) Village Tract,  Kokang region should be hailed and documented. He noted that  the state considers the eradication of narcotic drugs a national  duty. This is the reason the creation of business enterprises,  which will aim to completely eradicate the cultivation of  narcotic drugs, was mentioned in the objectives of the Law on  the Development of Border Areas and National Races. The law was  proclaimed on 13 August 1993. He spoke next about the  eradication of narcotic drugs in border areas. He said the  state has reached an agreement on short- and long-term plans, a  six-year plan in Kokang region and a 10-year plan in Wa region,  with local leaders. That is why, regional work committees must  keep a close eye on the annual reduction in narcotic drugs and  their destruction in their respective regions. [passage omitted]    He concluded his opening speech by saying that one can see  the state leaders' goodwill for national brethren by looking at  the amount spent for the development of national brethren.  [passage omitted]    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said in his closing speech that even  though SLORC intends to carry out development activities in  every state, priority has been given only to the poor states.  The SLORC has realized that national development activities can  only be carried out effectively and ultimately when there is  national solidarity. The SLORC discussed and coordinated the  return of jungle-based armed organizations to the legal fold to  ensure national unity. Due to this invitation, some jungle-based  armed organizations have made contact regarding their return to  the legal fold. Some are holding discussions and coordinating  at the lower level.

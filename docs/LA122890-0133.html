			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> REBOUND? Freedom Bowl ticket sales have declined since 1986 (above) when  hometown UCLA played. The turnout has been even smaller, for 20% of  ticketholders typically do not attend. . . . But organizers think the trend  will be reversed at Saturday's game in Anaheim. About 52,000 tickets had been  sold, including 10,000 donated to local military bases, and officials say  game-day sales could bring the game close to a sellout. Bob Schwartz and Len  Hall  </P></p>

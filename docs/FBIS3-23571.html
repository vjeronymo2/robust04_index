Vodopyanov: "Russia Needs a Proper Navy"]    [Text] During the course of preparations for the Russian  Navy's 300th Anniversary celebration, besides pride for its  glorious many-century history, military seamen are also  experiencing well-grounded concern for the navy's future. It is  already a fact that last year, for the first time in many  decades, not a single ship was laid down at Russia's shipyards  and the completion of ships that they had begun building was  terminated or is being conducted at extremely low rates in the  background of the massive withdrawal of both obsolete combatants  and ships and also those that we could quite well preserve with  proper repair and modernization from the navy's combat strength  -- this causes nothing other than bitterness for people who are  devoted to the sea. How do we explain the situation that has  developed -- is it due only to economic difficulties or, maybe,  it is due to the sum total of other causes as well? Our  correspondent's conversation with Russian Federation First  Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin began  with that question.    [Kokoshin] The Russian Navy's difficult situation is  explained not only by the complexities of the current situation  in Russia and by the political and economic consequences of the  collapse of the USSR, but also by past mistakes in the  construction of the navy when combatants, basing and  ground-based support and maintenance systems were built; that  is, everything that is called infrastructure was not developed  to the proper extent. We can say the same thing about naval  weapons and also about reconnaissance and target designation  systems. Another aspect: Even after their acceptance into the  inventory, as they say, "we spent a lot of time figuring out how  to use" the ships and naturally they could not completely  accomplish their combat missions. What is more, at the present  time the missile cruiser "Petr Velikiy" is being completed at  the Baltiysk Plant. Only presently will all of the weapons  appear on the fourth ship of that design that should have been  installed on the first. The enormous delays with time periods  for the development of the combatants' assemblies and individual  elements and weapons systems are also having an impact. So the  navy is also a victim of the extremely difficult crisis  situation of our economy and, at the same time, of those  problems of ship construction that have accumulated over the  last several decades.    [Vodopyanov] Obviously, the serious situation with housing  and other social support issues which have developed in the  fleets could also be included here?    [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. The trouble is that the ships,  including even the outstanding ones -- were developed and  essentially they forgot about people. This concerns not only the  officers but also the rank and file. And we think that a large  number of accidents in the navy, including cases of suicides,  are associated with the fact that the crews are in the enclosed  area of ship spaces for too long a time and the conditions for  full-fledged rest have not been created for them on shore.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, since we were speaking  about the development of the navy's infrastructure, this is a  logical question: What is currently being done to resolve the  problems which you mentioned?    [Kokoshin] The development of a basing and life-support  system -- that is a long-term program which must be designed for  15-20 years. In the process, we need to proceed from the fact  that the idea for the dispersal of infrastructure basing  facilities for ship task forces that are tasked for operations  in one or several nearby operating areas has become obsolete. A  massive strike, even not by nuclear but by conventional  precision-guided weapons, will destroy practically all of the  facilities, no matter how much we try to separate one from the  other. Therefore, I think the point of view of those experts who  propose locating the fleets at several bases that are united  through life-support technology of ships and weapons and the  utilization of the men and equipment for armed combat at sea is  justified. That concentration of forces provides a colossal  advantage both for the development of the navy's infrastructure  and for the development of normal living conditions for  servicemen and their families.    [Vodopyanov] In the process, obviously we need to proceed  from our state's actual conditions and capabilities?    [Kokoshin] Unquestionably. Unfortunately, only today are we  beginning to really consider money, which you can't say, for  example, about the Americans, Germans or British. They will not  invest their resources until they become convinced that each  dollar, mark, or pound will provide the maximum return. In  Russian history, during the reform period Grand Prince  Konstantin Nikolayevich -- General-Admiral of the Russian Navy  -- and his comrades-in-arms-reformers devoted quite a bit of  attention to the analysis of that which we now call  "cost-effectiveness". Today, each of our commanders, I am  already not talking about the commanders-in-chief, must become  an economist. The navy -- and it is the general customer for its  arms in the person of the commanders of the highest level,  headquarters and other command and control organs, is obliged to  know how to analyze what is more advantageous for it. By way of  illustration -- will it purchase five new destroyers or  modernize ten that are already in the line; lay down a new  nuclear submarine or modernize one that has already recommended  itself well; order a new cruiser or invest money in the  development of the infrastructure and life-support of existing  ships?...    Of course, to do that, we in the Armed Forces need to have  strong economic services and one of our most important missions  is to instill in commanders of all levels a taste for  painstaking analysis of the monetary resources that we have and  in the combat effectiveness of those weapons that we are  purchasing with this money.    [Vodopyanov] However, to do that commanders need to  precisely  know what the Russian Ministry of Defense and you, as first  deputy Minister of Defense, see as the navy's role in the  contemporary conditions; what is the current concept of its  construction? It's no secret that even before the impression has  been formed that current Russian military doctrine has devoted  and devotes inadequate attention to the navy.    [Kokoshin] There has always been a dual attitude toward the  navy in Russia. On the one hand, they loved it with some sort of  special love and Russians I would say have a definite  subconscious craving for the sea. No wonder the periods of its  isolation ended with access to the seas that wash today's  Russia, initially -- in the West and South (the Baltic, Black  and Caspian seas), then -- in the East (the Pacific Ocean). On  the other hand -- due to our geostrategic position, we  traditionally are more a land than a sea power and Russia's  military fate has been decided, as a rule, on land. Of course,  there were critical moments and sea battles, like Tsushima, that  determined the further foreign policy and internal situation of  the Russian state. And yet the outcome of wars: the Patriotic  War of 1812, and the First and Second World Wars -- were  predetermined in the depth of Russian territory. But this  occurred not only due to Russia's natural geographic position  but, it seems to me, due to the ambivalent attitude toward the  navy. It experienced both periods of great enthusiasm and  profound crises. And that alternation was repeated more than  once in Russia's history -- we must not forget that. Recall  that, after Peter the Great, the navy was very rapidly brought  into a deep decline by his successors. Then matters were put  right to a certain extent under Elizabeth Petrovna but we also  cannot say that the navy was in a brilliant situation. It  experienced a golden age during the reign of Catherine the  Great. It is in this period that the names of Senyavin, Greyg,  and Ushakov, whose fame equaled the fame of Rumyantsev and  Suvorov, were heard throughout the entire world. Under Pavel I,  the navy was still maintained but, under Aleksandr I, the navy  once again found itself in a difficult position, they were  involved very little with it and, how paradoxical, but the fact  is that the name of the Naval Minister, the Marquis de Traverse,  was the most hated name for seamen of that time. However,  everything was decided not by him, he was acting only as the  instrument of the upper levels. Although the role of personality  in the navy was always great and its rebirth, at least, of the  Black Sea Fleet, in the first half of the 19th century was  associated first of all with the name of Admiral Lazarev. Later  there was the Crimean War when the navy found itself defenseless  against the enemy's armored steam ships and Russian admirals,  officers and sailors became heroes of the land defense of  Sevastopol. We recall the already mentioned Tsushima and 1918  when a large portion of the Black Sea Fleet was actually sunk...  In general, the Russian Navy had a great, at times tragic,  history and it is more complex than the history of the Armed  Forces as a whole. Yes and in the recent past, during the  1960's, the navy was subjected to a fierce blow when nearly new  ships that had far from exhausted their combat capabilities were  sent to the scrap heap.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, you have quite  legitimately  pointed out that we should not forget history, including the  history of the navy. But is that being taken into account in the  new shipbuilding program?    [Kokoshin] I would not say that we have a new shipbuilding  program in its traditional sense. I think that there should be  an arms development program on the whole where the navy would be  a component. This is not only a question of ships but also of  coastal missile systems, naval aviation and naval infantry...  But the main thing, I repeat -- is the improvement of the basing  system and the repair system. It is this development program  --without a one-sided slant toward shipbuilding -- that we need.  All the more so that this is being dictated by the situation  that has developed as a result of the dismemberment of the  Soviet Union, in the Black and Baltic Seas and in the Caspian  Sea. As for the ships, I, in particular, think that the idea of  creating a relatively small aircraft-carrying ship deserves the  most rapt attention. In general, we need new inspiring ideas  like we need air and the realization of these ideas will allow  us to live for years while saving what we have. Let the navy's  youth have their say here...    [Vodopyanov] But you need to know what criteria will  determine the navy's quantitative and qualitative composition in  order to advance, as you say, the "ideas" of that same navy  youth.    [Kokoshin] Russia certainly needs a powerful modern navy,  without quantitative excesses, but with high parameters of  combat and operational effectiveness; a navy that would be  blended into the integrated military doctrine. Under current  conditions, it is especially important that all Armed Forces  branches and types of troops precisely interact with each other.  Of course, right now there is no optimum in this sphere. As for  the missions being accomplished by the navy, I think that they  are first of all associated with ensuring Russia's security in  certain areas and zones that are adjacent to its territory and  providing reliable nuclear deterrence, along with the Strategic  Missile Forces and strategic long-range aviation. Preservation  of its ocean function based upon certain parameters will be one  of the navy's most important missions, primarily, in the context  of reconnaissance, information gathering, and studying the  hydrologic situation. Among the combat missions -- maintenance  of the stability of strategic nuclear submarines and the  creation of those regimes of the combat service of ships that  would permit us to predominate in the most vulnerable nearby  ocean zones for Russia and also in certain key areas of the  World Ocean in the event of political crises and military  operations.    [Vodopyanov] But what is the basis for accomplishing what  has  been planned? Today much is being said and, it seems to us, in a  substantiated manner about the inadequately thought through  defense industry conversion policy which has brought our  military-industry complex to the point of collapse and to the  loss of its leading positions.    [Kokoshin] I must admit that our conversion policy was not  in  earnest, although efforts were carried out to shift the  military-industrial complex to the output of peaceful  production. But we needed to conduct such a program over the  course of 10-15 years and mandatorily under the condition of the  stability of state rule. We can consider the conversion program  that was proposed within the framework of the old system as only  a conversion palliative. Under conditions when weakened  "civilian" plants "have been attached" to military-industrial  complex enterprises, it could have operated only in the presence  of directive force. And, of course, the conversion policy must  have powerful market stimuli and be built-in to the overall  strategy of economic reform and independent of orders from above.    [Vodopyanov] Andrey Afanasyevich, right now how can you  characterize the state of the industrial complex that supports  the navy's needs?    [Kokoshin] It is very serious. Essentially, right now we are  struggling for the survival of the Armed Forces, including the  navy, and for the preservation of industry, although in those  amounts which would ensure the maintenance of the army and navy  at the required combat readiness. This is an extremely difficult  task. When you say that you need to reduce military orders and  the number of plants, the director's corps of defense  enterprises agrees with that. But as soon as matters directly  affect the directors, they begin "to wiggle out of the  situation": They say, let's reduce the orders for others, but  you don't need to reduce my order. But then again, we have also  been compelled to reduce many developments to the limit, any  further, figuratively speaking, and we'll have to cut to the  bone.    For example, we defined Severodvinsk and Sevmash enterprise  as the center of nuclear submarine building. Now all orders will  go only there. But we need to bring the submarines that are in  the Far East up to readiness. We are finishing some at Nizhniy  Novgorod and large surface ships -- at Kaliningrad and St.  Petersburg...    [Vodopyanov] Does it once again turn out that it is the navy  that is enduring the greatest damage of all of the Armed Forces  branches?    [Kokoshin] That is occurring due to its specific nature, due  to the duration of the shipbuilding cycle and to the fact that  they are entire floating cities in which much of what there is  in the Air Force, the missileers and PVO [Air Defense] is  combined... Therefore, right now those super-powerful weapons  systems are suffering most of all. The specific nature of  current industrial production and the fact that there are no  strict rules that regulate the conduct of first and second level  subcontractors-assemblers -- who are very rapidly shifting to  the output of civilian products for which there is demand -- is  also having an impact. Military orders have become unprofitable  due to the lack of financial resources...    [Vodopyanov] ...As a result, if previously seamen frequently  complained about a number of low tactical-technical parameters  of newly built ships and inadequate standardization of weapons  and combat equipment with which they were equipped. Today, the  navy is more concerned about the reduction of deliveries of not  only new and modern weapons but of even series-produced weapons.  Will it not turn out that the Russian Navy will greet its 300th  Anniversary not only without new ships but also with weapons of  the "era of Ochakov and the conquest of Crimea"?    [Kokoshin] You very legitimately pose that question. I think  that we need to maintain a course toward preserving in the line  even few combat ships but the most modern and actually combat  ready, as you say in the navy -- of the first line. Of course,  these requirements also relate to aviation and to the other  branches of the Armed Forces and especially to the navy. We must  be certain: If ships carry the navy flag and are in the line,  then we can count on them. Furthermore, there must be reserve  ships with reduced levels of combat readiness and with lower  manning than those belonging to the first line. Of course, we  need to equip both these and the others with modern weapons. But  here too there are a large number of obstacles.    [Vodopyanov] Could we dwell on this important aspect in more  detail?    [Kokoshin] In the former USSR, the expenditure mechanism of  the entire weapons life cycle -- from development to scrapping  -- dominated. Frequently the main thing was to report on the  development of a project, say, of a new ship, for which awards  and prizes were given. As it turned out later, the ships,  weapons systems and life-support, rescue systems and  survivability were far from perfect in a number of cases due to  this "reporting". Moreover, the overwhelming majority of weapons  models were developed without designing for modernization. We  are suffering to this day because of that because it is  impossible to install new electronics and acoustics systems and  modern types of antennas on ships of the majority of designs.    But I think that the greatest deficiency in domestic  shipbuilding is the absence of a macro systems approach to the  construction and development of the navy, including basing  infrastructure, when the adjustment of the quantitative and  qualitative composition of the navy of the graphically  heightened requirements of the naval strategy (let's recall  Admiral Gorshkov's "ocean strategy") was implemented in a  strong-willed manner and was frequently dictated not by the navy  but by the decisions of the military-industrial complex. There  was nothing that defined the military shipbuilding strategy -- a  state program that coordinated goals, time periods and  engineering tasks and was the same for all NII's and KB's  [design bureaus], shipbuilding plants, shipyards, and docks. But  those same Americans and Germans, who are somewhat wealthier  than we are, built ships with a long-range sight. A classic  example of the management attitude toward ships are the Iowa  Class Battleships. And right now where are our design 68-bis gun  cruisers which were distinguished by their beautiful ship  architecture and good sea-going qualities?!    [Vodopyanov] Today the navy has lost (primarily due to the  weakly-developed infrastructure of coastal basing) newer ships,  for example, the heavy aircraft-carrying cruisers "Kiev",  "Minsk" and "Novorossiysk", each of which did not serve for 20  years...    [Kokoshin] That is because, as I already said above, that we  were always rushing after quantity while ignoring the  qualitative characteristics of the navy and not paying attention  to the expenditures that especially increase during the  operation of ships and their basing facilities that have not  been perfected. Today we are compelled to consider every ruble  --there is a catastrophic shortage of resources. Under these  conditions, how do we conduct the optimization of expenditures  for the purchase of equipment and weapons, for shipbuilding and  repair, and for NIOKR [scientific research and experimental  design work]? Therefore, in the near future we will not be able  to count on new grandiose projects but we need to resolve more  prosaic issues in order to preserve the maximum of what we have  in the navy today. And the navy's primary mission in the next  2-3 years is -- survival. I will point out, not vegetation, but  survival with the evolutionary accumulation of combat might,  through structural and operational reorganization, being  inspired by a high idea: By the historical greatness of the  Fatherland, and by a consciousness of the need for its Armed  Forces and the navy, in particular. We must not forget that the  navy is also a special instrument of the state through which not  only purely military but also political missions are carried  out. I have in mind showing the Russian flag. I am convinced  that we must continuously carry out the latter and here there is  no place for a bookkeeping approach. A combat ship, especially  -- a pretty one (and Soviet, currently Russian, ships are  praised for their architecture) always causes admiration and  respect. And we need to develop a unique type of philosophy for  the utilization of the navy when the navy, without directly  entering into combat operations but simply cruising off the  coasts or even being beyond the horizon, acts as a powerful  factor of restraint of an aggressor and influences political  "solitaire" along with other measures and techniques.    [Vodopyanov] All the more so that the Russian and Soviet  Navy  has that experience...    [Kokoshin] I have talked a lot with navy veterans who  repeatedly sailed in the Mediterranean Sea and in the Indian and  Pacific oceans. Undoubtedly, in an entire series of cases, our  navy played a very important role when a situation was  stabilized at a comparatively low level of escalation of some  conflict or other by sending a detachment of our ships. No one  is guaranteeing that military threats to Russia's security in  the world will be totally reduced to naught. So we need to be  realists -- we can't get by without a navy that is proper for  Russia.    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHAPMAN'S RALLY FALLS SHORT IN 53-51 LOSS  </P> <P> Rog Middleton had a chance to tie the score for Chapman College in the final  seconds Friday night.  </P> <P> But by the time Middleton controlled a slightly errant pass, he was forced to  take a 18-foot jump shot under pressure from three Cal State Los Angeles  defenders. Middleton, who had been denied the ball most of the game, missed the  shot and Chapman lost a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game, 53-51, at  the Hutton Sports Center.  </P> <P> It was the fourth consecutive victory for Los Angeles (12-10, 5-4). Chapman  (10-12, 2-7) has lost four in a row and six of its past seven games.  </P> <P> Cal State L.A. took a two-point lead with 1 minutes 7 seconds to play and two  seconds left on the 45-second clock when Mike Varos made a short jump shot.  </P> <P> Varos' shot saved the Golden Eagles from a second-half fade that allowed  Chapman to rally after trailing, 29-20, at the half.  </P> <P> A tightly packed zone defense kept the ball away from the Panthers' inside  players, especially Middleton, who scored only five of his team-high 16 points  in the first half. Chapman shot only 34.6% from the field in the first half.  </P> <P> Trailing by 16 with 15:34 seconds remaining, Chapman began a fairly lethargic  rally that cut the Golden Eagles' lead to 11 with eight minutes left.  </P> <P> In the next six minutes, the Panthers went on a 14-3 run, which ended with a  jump shot by Chris Martin to tie the score, 51-51. Martin scored 12 points, all  in the second half.  </P> <P> LaVarr Ball had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Cal State L.A.  </P> <P> In California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball:  </P> <P> Chapman 80, Cal State Los Angeles 77 -- Jennifer Uecke had 18 points, 10  rebounds and eight blocked shots for host Chapman (17-6, 6-3). Julie King had  12 points and Bethel Trice and Melissa Abraham each had 11 for Chapman.  </P> <P> In nonconference men's basketball:  </P> <P> Southern California College 94, Bethany Bible 81 -- Jeff Bickmore scored 19 to  lead host SCC (18-70 to its ninth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> In nonconference baseball:  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton 6, Arizona 1 -- James Popoff (1-1) allowed five hits over  seven innings for Cal State Fullerton (3-3) at Tucson.  </P> <P> Paul Bunch hit a two-run home run, and Rich Gonzales, Tom Manley and Matt  Hattabuagh had two hits each for Fullerton.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary is proposing to add or amend the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Academic Year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 481(d)(2) of the HEA provides a definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to be used for all the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute specifies that in an academic year, a full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student is expected to complete at least twenty-four semester or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trimester hours or thirty-six quarter hours at an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that measures program length in credit hours, or at least nine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundred clock hours at an institution that measures program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length in clock hours. The definition delineates not only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum amount of work that a full-time student enrolled in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undergraduate educational program is expected to complete during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an academic year, but also the minimum period of time over which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the work in any educational program must be completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 specify that this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only applicable with respect to an undergraduate course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study. The Secretary expects that institutions would continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use their own academic standards, within the framework of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program regulations, to determine the amount of work full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> graduate and professional students are expected to complete over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a minimum of thirty weeks of instruction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The minimum time period specified is thirty weeks of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructional time. The Technical Amendments of 1993 further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended section 481 of the HEA definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the Secretary may reduce, for good cause on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-by-case basis, the 30-week minimum to not less than 26 weeks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of instructional time in the case of an institution of higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education that provides a 2-year or 4-year program of instruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which it awards an associate or baccalaureate degree. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has been unable to determine a definition of ``good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause'' that would justify using this authority. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is concerned that regulatory standards for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions would encourage many institutions to seek that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment routinely and this implementation would result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inequitable treatment of Federal student aid recipients from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to institution. Further, the Secretary is concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that widespread implementation would result in increased costs to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs. Therefore, the Secretary has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed specific criteria to implement this technical amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this time. The Secretary requests comments on a definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``good cause'' and ways of implementing this provision through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that address the Secretary's concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has determined that the terms used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> academic year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  must be clarified if the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to be well-understood and applied consistently. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining what constitutes the 30-week period, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would count the period that begins on the first day of classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ends on the last day of classes or examinations. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, if an institution's first day of classes begins on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tuesday, the first week of the academic year would begin on that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tuesday and end the following Monday. The institution would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin counting with the Sunday preceding the first day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that, for purposes of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> week <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be a consecutive seven-day period, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to a five-day or six-day  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> school week <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or seven individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days that are spread out over more than one calendar week. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would facilitate counting and readily accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that start and end on different days of the week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this definition, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> week of instructional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be any week in which at least one day of regularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled instruction, examinations, or preparation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination occurs. The Secretary recognizes that there may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain weeks during an academic year during which fewer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five days of instruction occur. An institution should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited from counting those weeks in its 30-week period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided at least one day of regularly scheduled classes occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in each of those weeks. Further, this proposal would accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative educational programs such as those offered only on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weekends or condensed schedules. At the same time, the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not open the door to abuse, because regardless of the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of days of study that occur in any week, an institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still provide enough instruction for a full-time student to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to earn the minimum number of credit or clock hours needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the definition. Finally, the Secretary would make clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution cannot count, as instructional time, periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consisting purely of noninstructional activities, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orientation, counseling, or vacations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

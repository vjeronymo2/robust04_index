The statement has come in reaction to today's meeting of the  leadership of the ODS, the strongest party in the government  coalition, which confirmed ODS's intention to push for Senate  elections in 81 one-mandate constituencies, although other  coalition parties, including the KDS, prefer a system of 27  three-mandate constituencies.    The KDS is disappointed that the ODS is not willing to  discuss other variants for Senate elections, the statement says.  It adds, however, that regardless its reservations towards the  ODS's stand the "KDS respects the Czech Constitution" and  considers it more important that the Constitution be observed  than that its own model of Senate elections be implemented.    The Senate, an upper house of the Czech Parliament, is  defined in the Constitution but has not yet been filled.</p>

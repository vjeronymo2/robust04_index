			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine warns on coal inquiry MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday that there would be 'uncomfortable conclusions' from his department's inquiry into the market for coal. He told the Commons employment committee, which is investigating the proposed closure of 31 pits, that there would be still no contracts for coal when the existing ones ended in March, apart from a conditional contract signed by Eastern Electricity and PowerGen this week.</p>

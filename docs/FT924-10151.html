			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Management: The proud cleaners of Europe Peter Owen, a private school headmaster, last week asked us to imagine a future Europe in which uneducated young Britons were the waiters, porters, cleaners and lavatory attendants. Owen, headmaster of Rushmoor School, Bedford, and chairman of the Independent Schools Association, is an optimist. There are few signs so far of continental European cities using the British to do their cleaning. The traffic has been the other way. Onyx, a French company, has won 5 per cent of the UK's refuse collection and street-cleaning contracts. As for waiters, a survey published last week by the British Tourist Authority shows that only a third of UK tourist businesses are fully able to serve foreign visitors in their own languages, with restaurants prominent among the monoglots. The headlines do not do full justice to Owen's speech to the schools association's conference in Rouen, France. It is a wide-ranging, common-sense look at Britain's failure to give its children the skills they need. But while pleading for an escape from some traditional British attitudes, he appears imprisoned by at least two others. The first is that there is something demeaning about bringing people their food, cleaning up after them or carrying their luggage to their rooms. The second is that these are jobs for the uneducated. In some continental countries, waiting on tables is seen as a job for professionals. Waiters and porters are expected to speak languages other than their own. Street-cleaning is an increasingly mechanised and sophisticated business. The waiters, porters and cleaners of the future will be those able to benefit from Owen's dream of a better-educated Britain. Our worry about the rest is that they will make their livings from burglary, car theft and dope dealing, rather than the honourable occupations Owen apparently contemplates with such horror.</p>

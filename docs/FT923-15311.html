			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Warburg trims Japanese role SG WARBURG, the UK securities group, is pulling out of making markets in London in Japanese equity warrants, a business which has suffered badly in the wake of the slump in the Tokyo stock market. The move is the latest step in a steady trimming of costs in Warburg's Japanese equity operations, including a reduction in the number of staff employed by 31 to 111 over the past year. Like other brokers, Warburg has been hit by the sharp decline in prices and volume in the stock market which began in early 1990. In the changes announced yesterday, four people in London have lost their jobs and two others are being transferred to other work. Two remaining traders will continue to trade in London but they will not make markets. Warburg will continue to trade warrants in the Tokyo markets. Christopher Purvis, branch manager of Warburg's Tokyo office, said Warburg has been 'refocussing' its Japanese operations. It had pulled out of making markets in warrants in London because the decline in turnover had made the market illiquid. Warburg is the third company to have pulled out of market making in warrants in London. The other companies were Kleinwort Benson of the UK, and Merrill Lynch, the US broking group. About 12 market makers are left, including the Big Four Japanese stockbroking groups and several British and American companies.</p>

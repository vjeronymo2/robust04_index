Entrepreneurs and politicians from a  broad variety of ideological sectors -- including those labeled  center-right and center-left -- no longer doubt that Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has the anti-Lula image  today. Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the  all-powerful Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP),  has said: "His candidacy is perfectly viable. He is competent  and enjoys credibility."    His supporters gleefully say that Cardoso's candidacy has a  center-left profile and is the only one capable of dividing the  left, attracting the center, and appealing to the right. Luiz  Eulalio de Bueno Vidigal Filho, the director-superintendent of  Cobrasma [Brazilian Railway Material Company] -- who is another  business big-shot -- has said: "It will be great if he becomes a  candidate. I will work hard for his nomination."    Cardoso's name is accepted by the elites who do not swallow  the type of socialism imagined by PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has led  all the opinion polls with a 30 percent support for the past six  months.    Entrepreneur Romeu Chap Chap, president of the Brazilian  Association of Shopping Centers, says: "There is no question  that he is the anti-Lula candidate," adding that a correct  implementation of the economic plan "does not depend on him  staying at the ministry."    Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock  Exchange (Bovespa), said: "Cardoso is the anti-Lula. He only  needs to wait for his plan to be consolidated before leaving the  government." Alcides Tapia, president of the Brazilian  Federation of Banks (Febraban), has said that Lula and the PT  are campaigning, and it is only natural for other groups to seek  their own candidates. He added: "Minister Cardoso could be one  of those candidates because he is prepared and has what is  needed to fill the position."    Enthusiastic defenders of the anti-Lula candidacy think the  minister has the basic ingredients to defeat the former Sao  Bernardo do Campo workers leader. He has the image of a new  politician, with credibility, experience, and a clean past.  Lula has the same attributes, they admit, but lacks experience.    Other factors will also weigh in the balance when voters  become polarized for an eventual runoff between Lula and Cardoso.    Gaudencio Torquato, a consultant in electoral campaigns and  a  Political Marketing professor at the University of Sao Paulo  (USP), has said: "Brazilians want change but fear the jump is  longer than they can manage unaided," adding: "Voters fear the  unpredictability and ideas of Lula, which are considered  revolutionary. Voters want change, but this is not the kind  they want. In this field, Cardoso has the advantage."    In Torquato's analysis, Lula would be a clear favorite if  the  race becomes polarized against politicians like Paulo Maluf  (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] or Orestes Quercia (PMDB)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. As a political analyst,  he dares to suggest that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy  will be practically unbeatable in a runoff election against  Lula. He forecasts that result: 70-30 in favor of Cardoso.</p>

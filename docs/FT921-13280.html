			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Prestwick bid backed by council A CONSORTIUM bidding to buy Prestwick airport in Scotland from BAA, formerly the British Airports Authority, is to be offered a loan of up to Pounds 1m on concessionary terms by Strathclyde Regional Council. The consortium, Ayrshire Community Airport Project (Acap), said it hoped shortly to reach agreement with BAA. It said Federal Express, the US cargo airline that uses Prestwick, had an option to take a stake in Acap and put a nominee on its board. Two other companies are interested in acquiring Prestwick, which suffered a drastic fall in passenger traffic after the government removal in March 1990 of its monopoly on transatlantic flights from Scotland. That led several airlines to transfer operations to Glasgow. Last week AAP, a company controlled by Mr Peter Kay, a Scotland-based businessman, submitted a cash offer of Pounds 4.75m to BAA. It said that last August BAA was prepared to sell it the airport, but negotiations lapsed. British Aerospace, which builds aircraft at Prestwick and wants to keep the runway open, is also talking to BAA. Acap is chaired by Mr George Younger, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and Conservative MP for Ayr, and comprises local businessmen and local authorities. On Monday the dominant Labour party group on the regional council agreed that Acap should be offered Pounds 1m over four to five years at 11 per cent interest. A possible outcome, according to backers of Acap, is that BAA would sell Prestwick to BAe, which would then hand over its operation to Acap. Neither BAA or BAe will comment on that. Federal Express would not comment on the claim that it had an option to buy a stake in Acap. It said it would work with whoever the successful bidder was.</p>

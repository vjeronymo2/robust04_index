			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPLICATIONS FEARED IN DRUG EXTRADITIONS  </P> <P> Justice Department officials are now concerned that the process for extraditing  Colombian drug kingpins for trial in the United States could prove much more  complicated and less certain than first indicated by Colombian President  Virgilio Barco Vargas' emergency decree.  </P> <P> Although the top aide to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh insisted Thursday that the  Administration is still optimistic, some law enforcement officials involved in  the extradition effort fear that the new Colombian conditions could hamstring  the process and sap the ability or even the will of Colombian officials to  follow through.  </P> <P> Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's executive assistant, said his "hope and  expectation" is to have the paper work on Eduardo Martinez Romero, accused of  money laundering for the Medellin Cartel, in the hands of Colombian authorities  by the close of business today.  </P> <P> "We are taking everything at face value and have no reason to believe we will  get anything but a positive result," Ross said in an interview. But noting that  Barco's extradition decree is subject to review by the Colombian Supreme Court,  which is free to act any time, he added: "Only time will tell."  </P> <P> Barco issued the decree last week after Colombian drug terrorists assassinated  presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan and a police chief who had campaigned  against cocaine trafficking. The decree provided for extradition of Colombian  drug suspects sought in the United States. However, elaborate fine print  contained in a separate document titled "Lista de los Pasos para Extraditar"  (List of the Steps for Extradition) specified conditions that could pose  serious roadblocks.  </P> <P> Some officials said the conditions raise questions about Colombian leaders'  sincerity in promising firm action against cocaine traffickers.  </P> <P> As examples of the potential hurdles, they noted that each extradition request  now must be approved by the foreign minister, the minister of justice and the  six ministers who make up the national council on dangerous drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Papers Required  </P> <P> Although the United States had pending about 60 U.S. extradition requests for  drug fugitives believed to be in Colombia, the decree required that fresh  documentation be provided for each individual sought for trial here. The  required documentation ranges from fingerprints and photographic identification  to a certified copy of the penal code allegedly violated.  </P> <P> Federal law enforcement authorities said that fingerprints on some of the  suspects wanted may not be available or may have come from intelligence sources  that prevent their being provided to the Colombians.  </P> <P> The procedural conditions also provide that individuals extradited could be  sentenced to no more than 30 years -- a potential problem under stiffened U.S.  drug laws, some of which provide for life sentences without possibility of  parole, one source noted. Suspects apprehended would also be able to appeal the  proceedings, potentially delaying them while the Colombian high court reviews  the process.  </P> <P> "At best, we're taking a wait-and-see attitude," one official said of the  decree. "At worst, you can say we're cynical."  </P> <P> Ross, acknowledging that "the slate is wiped clean" on previously submitted  U.S. extradition requests, said: "We're inventorying and reviewing the old  applications to see what we can salvage."  </P> <P> He described translation of the required papers as "a tedious, time-consuming  and difficult process" but added: "I don't think we have any option but to push  ahead. . . . Obviously, there are no guarantees.  </P> <P> "So far, we think we're in good shape. We're working very hard to get the  documents in shape."  </P> <P> Monica de Greiff, Colombia's minister of justice, said Tuesday that there is "a  50-50 chance" that the Supreme Court or the general prosecutor will void  Barco's decree and bar any extraditions. In 1987, the court threw out  Colombia's formal extradition treaty with the United States, citing legal  flaws.  </P> <P> Ross said that after the Justice Department submits the required documents on  Martinez, it may seek the return of Bernardo Londono Quintero, an alleged  cocaine trade pioneer who was arrested by Colombian authorities Wednesday.  </P> <P> According to Ross, Justice Department officials are trying to ascertain that a  valid warrant exists for Londono Quintero, who is nicknamed "the Diplomat."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Don A. Schanche, in Bogota, Colombia, contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

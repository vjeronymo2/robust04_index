			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source in the Command of the Armed  Forces in democratic Yemen has given a statement saying that a  number of soldiers and officers who surrendered at various  battlefronts and who had been launched by the killer 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to fight against their brothers in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], have affirmed that their  command had misinformed them about the facts on the political  and military situations. For example, they informed them in Bab  al-Mandeb-Kharaz axis that their forces had reached Salah al-Din  camp, while those soldiers and officers at al- Rahidah front and  Karish that their forces had reached Dar Sa'd on the outskirts  of Aden. [sentence as heard] This was not only a deceit and  misleading to these soldiers and officers in order to plunge  them in fierce battles, but was against all reason.    The military source added that scientific military  calculations do not accept this. There was also another fact  which was ignored by the military command in Sanaa. It was that  they were waging an aggressive war, which should be firmly  countered by well-trained forces and by people who do not submit  to any injustice and tyrant. The aggressors were faced with a  brave resistance and incredible steadfastness on the part of the  DRY's forces, which enjoy high morale and rare heroism.    The military source added that the democratic Yemen's Armed  Forces Command in defense of the national and human  responsibility towards the misled elements who were plunged by  the al-Ahmar gang, calls on all these soldiers and officers to  take a brave and reasonable stand and refuse to continue in this  failed war into which they were launched by the family, which is  concerned only to maintain the throne of authority of 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and his adventurous gang. The source expressed  confidence of the Armed Forces of the DRY that these  (?mischievous) elements will take any opportunity to get rid of  the certain death and rid our people and their families of  sadness and concern over their lives to which Sanaa's rulers  give no consideration. The Armed Forces Command of the DRY  affirm that those who will surrender spontaneously will receive  all appreciation and respect from their brothers in blood and  faith and affiliation to the sons of the DRY.</p>

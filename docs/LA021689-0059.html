			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIDEWALK GUN SALE WORRIES PASADENA;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS DON'T WANT CITY TO BECOME HUB FOR ASSAULT RIFLES BANNED IN L.A.  </P> <P> City directors have asked City Atty. Victor Kaleta to investigate what steps  the city can take to avoid becoming a major distribution point for  semiautomatic weapons banned in other cities.  </P> <P> Kaleta said he will look into "a sidewalk sale" of assault rifles held by a Los  Angeles gun store in Pasadena last weekend.  </P> <P> The rifles were put on sale Saturday outside C &amp; J Arms on Foothill  Boulevard by Gun Heaven, a Los Angeles store. Telephone callers to Gun Heaven  heard a recorded message advising them to attend Pasadena's "blow-out sale on  assault rifles."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Callers Advised  </P> <P> John Butler, owner of C &amp; J Arms, said his company's role was "like a  distributor," but he declined to discuss the circumstances of the sale or say  how many rifles had been sold. The recorded message at Gun Heaven on Wednesday  advised callers to go to Pasadena for assault rifles.  </P> <P> Director Rick Cole said he generally opposes gun control at the municipal level  but does not want Pasadena to become "the Hong Kong free-market outlet for  these assault weapons."  </P> <P> Police Chief James Robenson agreed, saying gun legislation should be enacted at  the state level. "Passing a local ordinance is OK," he said, "but it's just  kind of pushing the gun dealers from one community to another."  </P> <P> Robenson said police are trying to determine whether any city laws were  violated by the sidewalk gun sale.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has banned the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons, and  the county is considering a ban in unincorporated areas. Other cities, such as  Bellflower and Compton, either have enacted bans or are considering them.  </P> <P> Cole said it doesn't make much sense for cities to take on what should be a  state responsibility. Not only is it confusing when different rules apply in  each city, he said, but a violation of municipal ordinances is only a  misdemeanor. To make possession or sale of semiautomatic weapons a felony would  require action by the state Legislature.  </P> <P> Cole said that if Pasadena were left as one of the few outlets for  semiautomatic weapons, it would be "a very wrong signal to give out" to the  community. Thus, if the state does not act, he said, Pasadena might have to ban  semiautomatic weapons on its own.  </P> <P> However, Cole said he is not yet convinced that Pasadena is in any real danger  of becoming a major outlet for assault rifles.  </P> <P> Kaleta said he will prepare a report that will cover the sale of weapons in  Pasadena, ordinances that have been enacted in other cities and the legal  challenge to the Los Angeles ordinance filed in court by Colt Industries Inc.,  manufacturer of the AR-15 assault rifle. The company contends that the Los  Angeles ordinance is unconstitutional because it intrudes into an area of  regulation preempted by the state.  </P></p>

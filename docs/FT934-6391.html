			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television Outside the ranks of FT readers (and perhaps even within) there is a weariness with the economy. At budget time financial journalists get very excited about the PSBR, the Crawling Peg, M7 or whatever the latest craze may be, but the public sighs and asks 'Is wine' (or beer or books) 'going to be more expensive or much more expensive?' To jolly us up and make us see the event's significance BBC2 will screen a programme each evening between now and Budget Day in which six members of the public try to decide what the chancellor could do about Britain's Pounds 50bn deficit. In The Red begins at 8.00. The majority of viewers will opt instead for the second episode of David Attenborough's Life In The Freezer (BBC1, 8.00). He strides about the Antarctic, looking like Dr Who in dazzling foul weather kit, delivering his lines in the familiar crouched position from behind various examples of captivating wildlife. Irresistible stuff. Judging from the opening episode last week, Goodnight Sweetheart (BBC1, 8.30) could be another hit for writers Marks and Gran.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  HINTS FROM HELOISE: VEGETABLE OIL IS GOOD DIETER'S SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTER  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I am on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet and have had to give up  all my favorite desserts because of the eggs, butter or shortening used in  cakes, pies and muffins.  </P> <P> I recently read that I can substitute two egg whites for each yolk. What I  would like to know is can I substitute oil for butter or shortening?  </P> <P>  -- P.C., New Haven, Conn.  </P> <P> DEAR P.C.: Yes, you can substitute vegetable oil for butter, margarine or  shortening. You will need to use one-third less vegetable oil. For instance,  substitute two teaspoons of vegetable oil for one tablespoon of solid  shortening. There are a few recipes that you may have to experiment with to get  the best results. A good vegetable oil is your best bet for low cholesterol,  but as you know, oil is not low in fat.  </P> <P> In addition, when substituting two egg whites for a yolk in a recipe, you may  also add one to three teaspoons of vegetable oil for every yolk you omit to  give the recipe a better texture.  </P> <P> A big hug to you for watching out for your health.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here's how to prepare a complete salad, including dressing, in  advance without having it become soggy.  </P> <P> Pour the desired dressing in the bottom of the salad bowl, layer in tomatoes  and vegetables. Last, add the lettuce or spinach leaves. Place prepared salad  in the refrigerator and toss right before serving.  </P> <P>  -- GLENN SCHMIDT, San Antonio, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Each week, it seems a new microwave product comes out, designed  for preparation in the disposable-type tray. As I use each one at home I wash  the tray and store it for later use.  </P> <P> We have a microwave at work in the lunch room. When I take leftovers for lunch  I pack them in various trays, seal them with plastic wrap and heat them as is  on my lunch break. Afterwards, I just throw them away and there is no clean-up  or toting dirty dishes home to be washed.  </P> <P>  -- DIANE FRENCH, Ft. Madison, Iowa  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Do you or any of your readers know how to clean the window in an  oven door? I have tried almost everything, but the window is still dirty!  </P> <P>  -- MRS. HAROLD DOUGAL, Scott, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. DOUGAL: Here is a solution that one of our readers has used for the  last 15 years with great results.  </P> <P> Wipe the glass window down with ammonia and let this set for a few minutes.  Take a plastic ice scraper that is used to remove ice from automobile  windshields and scrape away the goop from the oven window.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I make a batch of my family's favorite chocolate-chip  cookies, I usually make about 25 dozen. In most cases this would take a long  time, but I found a way that has proved to be time-saving.  </P> <P> I use a large melon-ball maker to scoop the cookie dough onto the cookie  sheets. All the cookies come out the same size and are just right for  grandchildren, at weddings and parties.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. RUTH PEACE, Hillsville, Pa.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: You once gave instructions on how to make dish-washing scrubbers  from nylon netting. Could you please repeat these instructions?  </P> <P>  -- PEGGY HATT, Kearney, Neb.  </P> <P> DEAR PEGGY: Sure. First of all, purchase one-half yard (72 inches wide) of  nylon net at your local fabric store. Next, cut three (6-inch wide) strips  across the width of the nylon net. Place these strips one on top of the other  and match the edges. Baste down the middle using sturdy thread or yarn and a  long basting stitch. Tie the two ends of thread together. Wrap the remaining  thread around the middle once, tie and cut off the excess.  </P> <P> Pull one layer of nylon net at a time toward the center where the thread is  tied until you have a round fluffy ball of nylon net.  </P> <P> These are so simple to make and are wonderful for the kitchen, bathroom or  almost anywhere where there is scrubbing to be done.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a problem. I inherited a lot of canned goods that had been  accumulated over the years. Is there some way to tell the dates on canned  goods? We have opened some and found the contents no good. Surely, modern  companies can put legible, intelligible dates on products.  </P> <P> Please help.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. FRANCES JOHNSTON, Garland, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. JOHNSTON: First of all, throw all those canned goods away  immediately. If they have been accumulated over the years, they are definitely  not worth taking a chance with. Canned goods, under the right conditions, can  be stored for up to a year, or longer depending on the contents.  </P> <P> We hope canned food manufacturers will, one day, put legible code dates on all  canned food products. This way we will be able to keep better track of how long  they have been sitting on the shelf.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I found a 12-inch bottle brush to be an ideal cleaning tool for  the lint trap in my clothes dryer. The long handle and curved end also may be  used to clear lint from under or surrounding the trap. Using it has also saved  many a fingertip and fingernail.  </P> <P>  -- JANE S. PETERS, Camp Hill, Pa.  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

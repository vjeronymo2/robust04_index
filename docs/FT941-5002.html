			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / German economy forecast to grow by 1.5% this year Germany's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994, according to a report published today by one of Germany's five key economic institutes. It said strong demand for exports and further investment would help lift the economy out of its worst post-war recession, even though domestic orders might continue to slide. Low wage deals should improve the prospects for economic growth, with lower interest rates helping to counteract their effect on consumer demand. Unemployment was likely to remain constant in 1994 and 1995, falling only in 1996, but a significant fall in the numbers on short-time working was expected before then, the report said. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said in January that the economy would grow by between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent this year, but DIW, another think-tank, said the economy would shrink by 0.5 per cent.

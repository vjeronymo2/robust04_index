			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO PREVENT CHILD DROWNINGS  </P> <P> I have something to tell the crusaders for "Safe Pools": You can't legislate  against stupidity!  </P> <P> Leaving your child alone by a pool for even three seconds is just plain stupid.  No law, fence, or alarm will help you.  </P> <P> If you are careless enough to leave your child alone by a pool without a fence,  you will be careless enough to leave your child alone by a pool with a fence.  </P> <P> It is sad that the children pay the price for their parents' lack of care.  </P> <P> MICHAEL T.

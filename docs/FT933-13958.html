			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Felipe's burden MR FELIPE GONZALEZ may be about to discover the fact of contemporary political life that has plagued Mr John Major over the past year: securing re-election for your party is sometimes only the beginning of a prime minister's problems. As he embarks on his fourth term, this time at the head of a minority Socialist government, the economic and social challenges facing the Spanish leader are greater than at any time in his 11 years in power. The trouble is, the political base from which he intends to try to confront them is as weak as it has ever been. Personal triumph as it undoubtedly was, Mr Gonzalez's convincing election victory last month could soon look a bit hollow. His new government is weakened by the absence of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties, which he spent weeks trying to lure into coalition. They may not bring the new administration down in the near future, but they may carp from the sidelines if the economic medicine it forces on Spain is not to their liking. More worrying is the composition of Mr Gonzalez's new ministerial team. To be sure, he has won himself a relatively free hand by excluding from its ranks the left-wing Socialist party ideologues who have impeded economic reform in the past. He should be able to keep the parliamentary party in check with the assistance of his most capable lieutenant, Mr Carlos Solchaga, who has moved from the economy ministry to become chief Socialist spokesman in parliament. But he still has to face down his opponents at a full-scale party congress in a few months. Mr Gonzalez has paid a price for securing a like-minded but colourless cabinet. The economic team is composed of a party man and a technocrat - respectively, Mr Narcis Serra and Mr Pedro Solbes - with no particularly strong policy convictions. It is not clear that they have either the instincts or the stomach to spearhead a programme of painful surgery and radical reform. The need for both is immediate. With recession curbing tax revenues and sending unemployment - already the severest in the European Community - to new heights of 22 per cent of the workforce and more, the public sector budget deficit is spiralling out of control. Inflation, though currently on the way down, is still higher than that of Spain's EC neighbours, and liable to start rising again unless Mr Gonzalez can secure a wage restraint deal with the trade unions and convince the currency markets that the peseta is not still heavily overvalued. And renewed economic growth, which Spain needs most of all to cut the dole queues, recedes further into the distance the longer the government ploughs on with its dogged attempt to achieve economic convergence with its EC partners. The task of getting the public finances and the macro-economy on an even keel, though, is just the beginning. If convergence is to bring Spain sustainable, non-inflationary growth, it will have to be accompanied by structural reforms more radical than anything Mr Gonzalez has yet seemed ready to contemplate - especially in the labour market. Unless he is prepared for the years of strain that this will place upon his party and his country, he may yet have to consider an alternative course.</p>

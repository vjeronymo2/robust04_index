			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Valeriano Giron; from "The Morning </F> Paper" newscast]    [Text] After participating in the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit of Heads of State and Government, Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina returned to the country very optimistic.  The economic arena was the predominant subject at this meeting  of presidents.    President Reina said that Central America has much to gain  and can even obtain some benefits in keeping with the other  economic blocs that have been formed. He was asked about the  benefits that Honduras and the Central American region, in  particular, can obtain from this meeting and replied:    [Begin Reina recording] Central America's treatment in trade  treaties vis-a-vis the other economic blocs. For example, in  the face of NAFTA, all of Central America is endeavoring to  obtain parity. This means that in the Caribbean Basin and in  Central America we can achieve integration with the area that  encompasses Mexico, the United States, and Canada. That is a  very specific point. Another specific point is the  capitalization of the Central American Bank of Economic  Integration [BCIE] with extraregional partners. This will  permit the bank to dedicate a large amount of funds to our  country's development, affording the treatment that  international law, trade, and integration can provide. It is an  asymmetrical treatment. This means that the same conditions are  not going to be required of all the partners. For example, for  Central American products and Honduran products, particularly,  asymmetry would mean that products that are not strictly of  Honduran origin can leave the country, because part of the raw  materials come from abroad. That asymmetry would help  enormously within the old concept of Central American  development, which is a form of balanced development.    This does not mean that the most developed countries are  going to wait for the less developed. No, the development of  the less developed countries is expedited in order to balance  them all off later in a big push toward development. Those  specific points are very important and very encouraging in our  country's development. [end recording]    President Reina also noted that another important  achievement  was the fact that the BCIE achieved more capitalization through  extraregional partners. Also, he met with Commander Fidel  Castro. We asked him what he discussed with Castro.    [Begin Reina recording] It was strictly a courtesy call. I  was accompanied by four or five persons when receiving him. Our  talks were very general. He was very interested in learning  about Honduras. He recalls that Jose Marti visited Honduras.  He remembers that patriot Gomez was also in Honduras. That  offers us the perspective that we are neighbors of Cuba at a  time when the Inter-American system should resolve that problem.    I had the opportunity to present this on behalf of Central  America. For me the case of Cuba, which has been sanctioned by  the OAS, should be resolved within the OAS. That is the  appropriate forum for resolving this problem. This holds true  especially now that a great Colombian, President Cesar Gaviria,  is now the secretary general-elect of the OAS. He can again  provide a golden era for that continental organization, as was  provided by his illustrious predecessor [Former Colombian  President] Alberto Lleras Camargo.    Let there be no doubt, it was a courtesy visit by a chief of  state to another chief of state on the occasion of a summit.  Second, the solution of the Cuban problem is through the OAS.  Those two points cover your question. [end recording]</p>

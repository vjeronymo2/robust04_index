The interior minister was speaking in Tekirdag, where he  ceremoniously received vehicles donated by private citizens to  the police force. He pointed out that the cross border air  operation was extremely successful. He stressed that certain  circles do not want to see Turkey, which is in a very sensitive  area, grow and develop. No force can divide our country, he  said.    The interior minister stated that everyone living in Turkey  is equal before the law and everyone enjoys the same rights.  There is no discrimination among the citizens, he said, adding  that 200 trillion Turkish lira [approximately $100 million] will  be spent this year in the struggle against terrorism.

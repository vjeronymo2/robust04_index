			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Plan to base mortgage benefit on 'standard' interest rate Ministers are considering a new way of cutting the amount the government spends on helping people on income support to pay their mortgages. Under the plan, mortgage benefit would no longer be based on the interest rates charged by the mortgage lender to the benefit claimant, but would be calculated on a fixed, 'standard' interest rate. The standard rate would probably be set below the point at which the benefit would cover all the mortgage interest owed by the claimant. Previous efforts by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to rein back the Pounds 1.1bn spent annually on mortgage benefit have concentrated on lowering the top limit at which a home loan is eligible for the state payments. While introducing a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 last year and dropping it to Pounds 125,000 this year affected only a few thousand claimants, a standard rate of interest would affect all the half-million or so people who claim mortgage benefit. Such a move might prove an incentive to people to take out private insurance, which covers payments if the mortgage holders lose their jobs, a course the government is keen to encourage. The Department of Social Security estimates that the majority of claimants are paying mortgage interest at rates within a narrow range around 7.5 per cent. Setting a standard rate below that - at say 5 per cent or 6 per cent - would deliver two streams of savings: not only would lower amounts be paid to claimants, but administrative costs would be reduced, with less prospect of the DSS overpaying. A report last October by the National Audit Office said the Benefits Agency had overpaid by Pounds 134m on mortgage interest in 1993-94. Setting a standard rate below that being charged would also signal the government's intention to withdraw gradually from mortgage benefit, again increasing the incentive to people to take out their own insurance. Changes in mortgage rates - such as those already occurring in the wake of Monday's 0.5 percentage point rise in the base rate - are a particular problem in terms of re-calculating payments. Other ideas considered for curtailing spending include reducing the ceiling to Pounds 100,000 or less; making the benefit a loan rather than an outright payment; and extending the 16-week period for which only half the interest due is paid.</p>

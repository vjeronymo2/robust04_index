			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Rise in average earnings still higher than 7% THE UNDERLYING rate of increase in average earnings remained above 7 per cent in January, the Department of Employment will announce today. This is in spite of expectations by some analysts that it would fall below 7 per cent for the first time since the 1960s. The underlying measure adjusts actual earnings for temporary influences such as arrears of pay, variations in the timing of settlements and industrial disputes. The latest figure is a mixed blessing for the economy and the government. Long-term competitiveness within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System requires average earnings to fall to 5 per cent or below. On the other hand, a consumer-led recovery and the 'feel good' factor desired by the government require increases in real earnings to remain high. Earnings remained static last year because of the sharp rise in unemployment. However, according to Goldman Sachs, the US securities house, average earnings for employed workers last year rose by 7.6 per cent. Furthermore, the disposable income of workers with mortgages has increased in real terms by more than 10 per cent this year as a result of cuts in interest rates. The underlying rate of increase in average earnings will fall below 7 per cent and could even reach 6 per cent by the middle of the year, according to Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the research group. Some analysts had expected that the rate of increase in average earnings would fall below 7 per cent in January, in the light of the new trend for pay settlements to average between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. But the underlying rate of increase in average earnings is a year-on-year figure and thus reflects the much higher settlements of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent awarded early last year. The actual increase to December last year, announced last month, was only 6.6 per cent. Two upward pressures on average earnings remain. First, companies tend to shed their less skilled workers first and 'hoard' their better-paid, more highly skilled workers. That creates upward pressure on the pay of those in work. Second, the relatively generous public-sector pay review body settlements, which averaged around 6.5 per cent and will come into effect in April, will keep the overall rate high until then.</p>

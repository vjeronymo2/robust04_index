			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> YANKEES HIT 6 HOMERS AS LEARY STOPS TWINS  </P> <P> Tim Leary has been the New York Yankees' most effective pitcher this season.  But usually, the Yankee batters give him almost no support.  </P> <P> In a throwback to the days of the Bronx Bombers, the Yankees hit six home runs  and gave the hard-working right-hander enough runs for three victories  Wednesday night at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> "I really enjoyed watching those balls sailing over the fence and knowing they  were making it easier for me," Leary said.  </P> <P> In a game marred by a bench-clearing incident, Leary gave up just four hits and  struck out 11 in pitching the Yankees to a 12-0 victory over the Minnesota  Twins.  </P> <P> Leary's record is only 3-4, but this was the seventh time Leary held the  opposition to three runs or fewer. It was his first shutout since 1988 with the  Dodgers.  </P> <P> Although the near-brawl came in the fourth inning when Tim Drummond (0-1)  almost hit Mel Hall in the head with a pitch, it started in the second inning.  </P> <P> After hitting a tremendous home run into the upper deck, some 440 feet away,  Hall took about a minute to trot around the bases. Drummond didn't forget. The  dugouts emptied, but it was a battle of words only.  </P> <P> The Yankees hit only 22 home runs in their first 36 games. But Steve Balboni  hit two home runs, Deion Sanders hit a three-run shot and Roberto Kelly and  Jesse Barfield also hit homers in support of Leary.  </P> <P> Detroit 5, Texas 1 -- Cecil Fielder hit his major league-leading 17th home run,  a two-run shot in the third inning at Detroit, and the Tigers won for the  eighth time in nine games.  </P> <P> Brian DuBois (2-2), struck out seven and gave up seven hits in 6 2/3 innings to  get the victory.  </P> <P> Mike Jeffcoat (0-1), starting in place of injured Nolan Ryan, hit Lloyd Moseby  with two out in the third and Fielder followed with his homer to center field.  </P> <P> Oakland 12, Milwaukee 5 -- Dave Henderson hit two home runs and Rickey  Henderson added a three-run shot as the Athletics trounced the Brewers at  Oakland.  </P> <P> The A's chased Bill Wegman (2-1), who shut them out last week in Milwaukee,  with eight runs in the first 2 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (4-3) pitched seven innings to get the victory for Oakland, which  has snapped a slump with four victories in five games.  </P> <P> Kansas City 4, Boston 1 -- Bret Saberhagen is back in his best form. He  followed up Friday's two-hitter against New York with this seven-hitter at  Boston. He struck out five and didn't walk a batter, improving his record to  3-3.  </P> <P> Steve Jeltz, an .067 hitter, broke a 1-1 tie with a run-scoring single in the  seventh and Willie Wilson singled in two more runs.  </P> <P> Chicago 6, Baltimore 3 -- Dan Pasqua, in the starting lineup for only the 13th  time this season, showed his appreciation with a three-run home run in the  first inning at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Pasqua also hit a solo home run in the seventh to help Eric King win his third  without defeat. King gave up only two hits in six innings, but one was a  three-run home run by Joe Orsulak, his third in two games.  </P> <P> Seattle 4, Cleveland 1 -- Ken Griffey Jr. doubled home two runs in a three-run  first inning and Alvin Davis homered as the Mariners downed the Indians at  Seattle.  </P> <P> Erik Hanson (4-3) held Cleveland to five hits in eight innings while walking  none and striking out nine. Mike Schooler pitched the ninth for his 12th save.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

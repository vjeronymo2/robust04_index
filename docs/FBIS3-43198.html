			<p>According     to recent press reports, the Ukraine's brain drain is  massive and  critical, especially for the nation's nuclear industry.  Both Ukrainian and Western governments hope that the establishment  of an S&amp;T center funded by the West will keep nuclear weapons  specialists busy and at home.     Actual figures for Ukraine's brain drain were given in the UkAS's  monthly bulletin in July 1993. Over the past three years, the  Academy has lost about 17,000 employees or about 20 percent of its  workforce. However, only about 1,000 of these, or 6 percent, were  scientific workers. When 300 scientists went abroad for sabbaticals  of six months or more, 80 percent did not return when the sabbatical  ended. Recruitment levels for the Academy have declined to half that  of pre-independence years (Kiev VISNYK AKADEMIYI NAUK UKRAYINY Jul  93).     Comparable losses have also been experienced by the numerous  engineering centers and R&amp;D enterprises operated by the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences--about 18,000 workers or 15 percent of the work  force. (Kiev VISNYK AKADEMIYI NAUK UKRAYINY Jul 93).     In a recent newspaper article, President of the Ukrainian Academy  of Sciences (UkAS) Boris Paton said that the Ukraine's brain drain  was "massive" and that it is an "unquestionable threat to the  country's national interests" (Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY 14 Dec 93).     It is the Ukraine's nuclear power industry, however, that has  been most seriously affected by the brain drain. Ukraine is facing a  25 percent shortfall in electric power generation this winter  because of fuel shortages at conventional power plants and cannot  afford to close down its nuclear power facilities, which are  responsible for about 40 percent of Ukraine's winter electric power  production. They cost about half as much to operate as conventional  power plants as well (Kiev DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA, 27 Oct 93).  According to Deputy Minister of the Power Industry and  Electrification B.V. Korotya, the situation is "close to critical."  Coal supplies have been exhausted at many power plants and others  are operating at only half capacity. Power plants that burn fuel oil  are now receiving far less than the 20,000 tons per day promised by  the chairman of the Oil and Gas Committee, which is about 9,000 tons  per day less than what they actually need (Kiev Ukrayinske  Telebachennya Television Network, 1900 GMT 24 Nov 93).     Although Ukraine has an urgent need to maintain its nuclear power  facilites, it is experiencing great difficulties in keeping them  staffed.  1,254 employees left their jobs at Ukrainian power plants  during the first nine months of 1993, including 1,100 "highly  skilled professionals," according to a Ukrainian Television Network  broadcast. 400 specialists left key jobs at the Zaporozhye Nuclear  Power Station alone in 1993, emigrating to Russia because they were  dissatisfied with wages and working conditions. Yet, the Zaporozhye  station saved Ukraine over 2 million tons of coal in the third  quarter of 1993 alone (Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel  Network, 2100 GMT 7 Nov 93).     The industry has managed to cope with the losses by reassigning  personnel from facilities where a moratorium on new facilities had  halted construction  or use. That manpower source has now been exhausted, and should  resignations continue, there will be no further reserves to draw  upon (Kiev Ukrayinske Telebachennya Television Network 1900 GMT 01  Dec 93).     Ukraine is also experiencing difficulties in training nuclear  specialists to replace those it has lost. According to Vladimir  Bronnikov, director of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Station, it  takes five to six years to train new operators. Furthermore, because  Ukraine's training facilities are among the best in the former  Soviet Union, its graduates are in very high demand. Nuclear  specialists leave because wages and benefits in Ukraine are not  competitive. (Kiev PRAVDA UKRAINY 3 May 93).     A complaint by Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection  suggests that current training is inadequate and hurried. According  to the Ministry's press service, "personnel at the Chernobyl Nuclear  Power Station, which were completely replaced in 1987-1988, do not  have sufficient experience in dealing with complex or emergency  situations at RBMK reactors. There is no full-scale simulator at  Chernobyl to help train personnel in dealing with emergency  situations" (Kiev UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 4-17 Nov 93),     Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic crisis has made it impossible for  the nation to purchase adequate supplies of conventional fuels, thus  forcing the Supreme Council of Ukraine to lift a moratorium on  building new nuclear electric power stations and putting them into  service. The council was also forced to delay implementation of  legislation mandating the closure of the infamous Chernobyl station,  despite the lobbying of many antinuclear organizations (Kiev  DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 27 Oct 93).     In addition to nuclear power plant workers, Ukraine is having  difficulties keeping nuclear weapons specialists employed. On 25  October, the final decision was adopted to create a Scientific and  Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU) to "ensure the nonproliferation  of technologies and special knowledge associated with weapons of  mass destruction." The center will be funded by the United States,  Canada, and Sweden and will finance projects employing scientists  and engineers who are specialists in nuclear weapons technology.

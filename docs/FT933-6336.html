			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Warsaw devalues zloty 8% POLAND has devalued the zloty by 8 per cent against a basket of currencies of trading partners, in an attempt to boost exports. This represents a 7.5 per cent devaluation against the dollar and 8.5 per cent against the D-Mark, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. The move comes as convertible currency reserves held by the central bank have slipped from Dollars 4.3bn at the beginning of the year to Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.4bn) at present, as the trade deficit in the first six months of the year has grown to Dollars 1.1bn. The monthly 'crawling peg' devaluation rate first introduced in October 1991 is also to be reduced from a monthly 1.8 per cent to 1.6 per cent. Poland's last big devaluation was in February 1992.</p>

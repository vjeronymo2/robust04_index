			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Cuts Payout Estimate: Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines would  receive only between 6.7 cents and 14.3 cents on the dollar if the airline were  to be liquidated, the airline's lawyers revealed in court. The new estimate is  much lower than the 25 cents on the dollar the airline offered earlier this  month. The new figures were revealed as the airline's creditors pressed their  case for the appointment of a trustee to oversee the day-to-day affairs of the  airline, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Time to take stock of the powers that be - World energy chiefs are preparing for their triennial conference On Sunday evening, as Europe awaits the outcome of the French referendum, King Carlos of Spain will be welcoming 4,000 representatives of the energy business to Madrid for the World Energy Congress. This triennial event provides the energy community with an occasion to take stock. Piles of reports, examining every aspect from windmills to nuclear power in the 22nd century have been prepared. For five days, the issues will be debated, and recommendations put forward. But it is already clear that the WEC will have a comforting message for much of the rest of the world. The forecasts that have been prepared for delegates show that energy will be in plentiful supply up to the year 2020 - and beyond. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that there is enough oil for over 40 years, enough gas for over 50, and enough coal and lignite to last for centuries. The WEC has three possible scenarios. The 'reference case' which assumes continuation of present policies foresees world energy consumption going up from 8.7bn tonnes of oil equivalent to 13.3bn in 2020. But if the Third World countries accelerate their economic growth, this would go up to 17.2bn. On the other hand, if pressures to protect the environment intensify, consumption may only rise to 11.2bn. One benign factor is the large scope for increased energy efficiency in the former communist states of east Europe. These forecasts show that the decisive issue in the years ahead will not be the rate of economic activity in the industrial countries (where expanding demand will be offset by greater energy efficiency), but the pace of development in the third world, and the extent to which ecological factors become the dominant global concern. In fact, the third world occupies a leading position in the WEC brief. The report notes that there are still large parts of the world that do not have access to adequate energy supplies. This holds back their economic growth, and also leads to massive waste because people use primitive fuel sources, such as trees. The WEC urges third world countries to institute realistic energy policies, including providing a secure investment environment to attract capital, and allowing energy to trade at free market prices. But it also repeats a call made at its previous meeting in Montreal in 1989 that the energy plight of the third world should be examined by the United Nations. The environment will make itself felt through pressures to reduce carbon emissions and use energy more efficiently. This could have a profound influence on the structure of the energy sector. Actions - such as taxation  -may be taken to check consumption of fossil fuels, and encourage cleaner forms of energy. Policies may be adopted to reduce the energy intensity of production. This should provide a stimulus to new technologies, and greater reliance on renewable forms of energy. However the WEC does not expect any radical shift in the pattern of energy sources up to the year 2020. 'It would be unwise to plan for any dramatic infrastructural change,' it says. Fossil fuels will continue to dominate the picture, though their share will fall a bit. Coal, for example, will go from a 26 per cent share in 1990 to 24 per cent in 2020 and oil from 32 per cent to 28 per cent. But gas will increase its share from 19 per cent to 21 per cent. This means that other forms of energy - nuclear, hydroelectric and renewables - will rise from 24 per cent to 28 per cent. But underlying this slow-changing outlook, the WEC urges policies based on the 'precautionary principle' - the view that actions need to be taken to encourage diversity of supply in primary energy, and advance the introduction of newer, cleaner technologies. The WEC does not rule out the possibility of some future shock, for example the failure of technology to keep global warmingin check, and the resulting need for a massive and urgent switch away from fossil fuels. In particular, the WEC espouses the cause of possibly the most controversial form of energy - nuclear. Its share will rise a bit, from 5 to 6 per cent, the WEC believes, adding: 'Nuclear should be supported through rational re-evaluation of public attitudes, demonstrably safe technology and management, effective and truly open international inspection, and new generations of plant which satisfy these criteria.' If energy is likely to be in plentiful supply in the years ahead, this could, of course, be bad news for the energy industry which always hankers after firmer prices. But there are other challenges facing the business, and these are summed up in a six-point conclusion to the draft report. 'The need to raise energy efficiency, to introduce new technology and fully exploit existing technology, to broaden the primary energy resource base, to expand R&amp;D in these fields, and to tackle environmental problems provide enormous opportunities for the world's energy industry.'</p>

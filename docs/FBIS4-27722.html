			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Russian first  Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets arrived here Monday for a  two-day official visit to Malaysia.    Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar welcomed Soskovets  at  the airport. Deputy Defence Minister Wan Abu Bakar Mohamed is  the minister-in-attendance.    Soskovets, who is accompanied by several senior officials,  is  here to witness the signing of a multi-billion ringgit contract  between Malaysia and Russia for the purchase of 18 MIG-29 air  superiority jet-fighters. The signing will take place Tuesday,  at the Finance Ministry.    Soskovets is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and  Defence Minister Najib Razak.    He will visit the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia  (PORIM), Airod Sdn Bhd [Company Limited], the country's  privatised aircraft inspection, repair and overhaul depot, and a  local telecommunications firm, Sapura Holdings.    Malaysia will buy 18 MIG-29 aircraft, codenamed Fulcrum by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to beef up the  Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) long-term air defence  programmes. The payment for the deal is expected to be made in  hard currency and palm oil.    The signing of the agreement between Malaysian and Russian  officials, to be witnessed by Anwar, Najib and Soskovets, is the  culmination of a year-long negotiations due to the strict  conditions imposed by the Malaysian Government over the purchase  of the aircraft which played a high profile during the Langkawi  International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition in north-  western peninsular, last year.    The RMAF will be the first in the region to fly the Fulcrum,  the twin-engine jet-fighter manufactured by the Mikoyan Design  Bureau, Moscow.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Trade News: ABB to run W Australia power plant THE Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) has been commissioned to develop and operate an ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) coal-fired power station in Western Australia. The 600 MW plant in Collie in the state's south-west region will be the first big privately-funded and owned power station in Australia. Much of the funding is due to be raised through the issue of infrastructure bonds, which attract concessional tax rates. The plant was to have been developed by a syndicate led by Australia's Transfield Group and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. A mandate was awarded in October, but withdrawn in April when Mitsubishi Transfield failed to raise funding at rates that would deliver the promised prices.</p>

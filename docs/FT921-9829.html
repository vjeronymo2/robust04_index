			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs figures check market rally THE scenario was familiar. Midweek, the authorities appeared to hold out hope of another early interest rate cut. By the end of the five trading sessions, nobody was quite so sure. The early excitement centred on remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to a Congressional committee. On Tuesday, the same day the policy-setting Open Market committee was meeting, the Fed chairman seemed to go out of his way to emphasise that the authorities would be willing to lower interest rates further, should the need arise. Stating first that he expected that the amount of 'monetary ease in the pipeline is adequate to turn the economy on the path of sustained recovery'  -a reiteration of his remarks a week earlier - Mr Greenspan now added that the authorities were 'continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way of further monetary ease would be appropriate'. This was enough for bond dealers. Up went prices of Treasury securities and down went yields, although trading remained fairly thin. By the end of the day, the bell-wether long bond had gained almost a full point, to return 7.74 per cent compared with 7.81 per cent a day earlier. But the mood quickly turned more cautious, both ahead of and after publication of the January unemployment figures on Friday. Forecasts for these numbers had shown an abnormally large range - with some pundits predicting that the decline in non-farm payrolls could be as high as 125,000, and others suggesting that payroll employment could increase by as much as 100,000. In the event, the data rolled out at the more bearish end of these predictions. Non-farm payrolls declined by 91,000 and manufacturing employment by 52,000, although the unemployment rate held steady at 7.1 per cent. For bond market optimists, such figures should have been sufficiently discouraging to prompt some signal from the Fed that further easing would, indeed, be forthcoming in the short-term. Yet no signal was forthcoming. So bond prices yo-yoed ambivalently as dealers tried to make sense of the situation. While the stock market fell sharply, the price of the 30-year long bond first moved higher and then ended the day marginally lower, to offer a yield of 7.755 per cent. After all these shenanigans, however, the situation remained little changed for the week overall; seven days earlier, the long bond yield had stood at 7.76 per cent. In the meantime, news from the corporate sector, in the throes of the reporting season, has been mixed. On the plus side, there have been relatively few new horror stories, and a lot of vaguely worded optimism about prospects for the latter half of 1992. Retail sales reports from the large store chains for January also showed unexpected strength, although the comparable period a year ago was extremely weak and promotional activity remains rife. On the minus side, the stream of restructuring announcements (most of which involve job cuts of some description) continues to flow. So what will interest rates do next? Sentiment seems to split between two camps. There is one school of thought which argues that, in the authorities' eyes at least, the effects of December's discount rate cut have not had time to work their way through the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve may be prepared to sit on its hands for a while yet. The more pervasive view - in the bond markets at least - still maintains that any 'real' recovery would be unlikely to arrive until the third quarter at the earliest. If so, runs the argument, the Fed has ample room - and ample reason - to ease again, in the near term. 'It remains our view that interest rates will decline in the near term,' suggested analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette on Friday, for example. The reasons, they suggested, were simple: 'the continued weakness of economic activity, the likelihood of good inflation statistics over the next few months and the likelihood of some further slight easings of monetary policy by the Fed'. As for the week ahead, interest will probably centre on the last two trading days. Thursday sees the publication of the retail sales figures for January; the general consensus here is for a very modest increase once car sales are excluded, perhaps 0.1-0.5 per cent. And on Friday, the producer price index for January should also arrive, with forecasts generally suggesting a small decline overall - a reflection of falling energy prices - or a very modest 0.1 per cent gain in the 'core' rate.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last   1 week  4 wks  12-month  12-month                              Friday    ago    ago    High       Low Fed Funds (weekly average)   3.62     4.50   3.63   11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills   3.82     3.91   3.90    8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills     3.89     4.04   4.00    7.70     3.81 Three-month prime CDs        4.02     4.15   4.07    7.17     4.01 30-day Commercial Paper      3.90     4.05   4.00    7.12     3.90 90-day Commercial Paper      3.92     4.00   3.97    7.02     3.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Last    Change         1 week   4 wk.

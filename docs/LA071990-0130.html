			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO;  </P> <P> 4 TRAFFIC OFFICERS TRAINED TO LOOK FOR TRUCK VIOLATORS  </P> <P> The Montebello Police Department, on the lookout for truck drivers who are  breaking traffic laws, will soon begin special patrols of the city's industrial  areas.  </P> <P> Capt. Michael Kight said four traffic officers recently received training from  the California Highway Patrol in order to crack down on drivers who break the  law by driving trucks on restricted streets or are committing other traffic  violations.  </P> <P> Montebello has several large trucking firms in its industrial area on the south  side of town, and heavy truck traffic has prompted residents to complain about  trucks that emit too much smoke or are disrupting peace and quiet in their  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Kight said the officers will patrol periodically.  </P></p>

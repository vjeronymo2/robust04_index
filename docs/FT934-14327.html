			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Talks fail to end Kashmir shrine siege ARMED Kashmiri separatists besieged the Hazrat Bal shrine in Srinagar for a second day yesterday. Last night the militants and the Indian authorities were still negotiating. In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, crowds of demonstrators yesterday protested in response to a raid by Indian troops on the Moslem shrine. Young men and women shouting anti-Indian slogans marched through the city, Pakistan's state-controlled television reported. The Pakistani government condemned the Indian action and called it a 'grave and provocative action on the holy shrine by Indian forces on fabricated pretexts'. A Foreign Office announcement in Islamabad said: 'This sacrilege committed against the holiest shrine in Kashmir will be deplored by civilised opinion throughout the world.' Meanwhile, some religious leaders are expected to call upon their followers today to hold peaceful demonstrations against the Hazrat Bal incident. Security around Indian diplomats and diplomatic missions was expected to be tightened last night, officials said. The government is also monitoring the security around a small number of Hindu temples, especially in southern Pakistan, which became the target of attack by Moslem demonstrators after last year's demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya, India, by Hindu fanatics. Army reinforcements were sent to the shrine after part of it was set on fire on Saturday afternoon, to ensure that the holy relic, believed to be a lock of the prophet Mohammed's hair, was safe. The militants have demanded the withdrawal of the army from the area, and asked for the curfew to be lifted, so that the shrine, along with the holy relic, can be handed over to the care of the ulema, the Moslem theologians. The government achieved a breakthough yesterday when Mr A K Suri, the inspector general of police, and Mr Wajahat Habibullah, a senior administrative official, established direct contact with the militants inside the mosque. One person was killed in an extended gun battle between militants and the paramilitary after the area was cordoned off on Friday. The security forces have been careful not to storm the mosque and chose to wait it out, since the use of force could lead to bloody repercussions in the valley, where an armed insurgency has been raging since 1989. The Kashmir valley experienced its worst violence in decades in 1963, when the holy relic was stolen. It was later returned. Officials in India's Home Ministry are being particularly cautious about future steps because they do not want to play into the hands of militants, who may use religion to whip up more anti-India frenzy in the valley. 'We know how heavily India paid for Mrs Gandhi's decision to storm the Golden Temple (in Amritsar) in 1984,' said a senior official. 'We cannot afford a similar mistake in Kashmir.' The prospect of Ms Benazir Bhutto becoming Pakistan's next prime minister became more likely yesterday after her nominee, Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani, was elected speaker of the lower house of the Pakistani parliament, the National Assembly.</p>

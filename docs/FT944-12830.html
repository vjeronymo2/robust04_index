			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Two steps forward, one step back - Vanessa Houlder examines why Total Quality Management has been slow to take root in Europe Total Quality Management, one of the most pervasive management doctrines of the 1980s, has lost some of its glamour in recent years. But its central idea - that quality should be applied to every aspect of an organisation - still commands passionate support from its converts. 'Quality is a way of life,' declares Jan Timmer, president of Philips Electronics, the Dutch group. 'Total quality is not a passing business fad but embedded in the permanent principles of human philosophy,' says Louis Schweitzer, president directeur general of Renault, the French car company. These endorsements, made at a European Quality Management Forum in Amsterdam this month, reflect the strength of enthusiasm expressed by exponents of the quality movement. Its advocates are eloquent about its central themes, namely the importance of the customer, the case for empowering employees, the need to view business activities as processes and the goal of continuous improvement. The rhetoric associated with TQM is underpinned by a serious debate. Is Europe once again falling behind on quality? If so, is TQM, which is no longer viewed as a panacea in the US, the best way forward? Europe's take-up of TQM remains well behind that of the US, which adopted TQM in the 1980s, and Japan, where TQM first became entrenched in the 1950s and 1960s. A survey by the European Foundation for Quality Management, the Brussels-based body which organised the Amsterdam conference, found that 30 per cent of European companies claim to have adopted TQM, compared with 55 per cent in North America and 53 per cent in Asia. Even fewer European companies - a mere 5-10 per cent - are actively pursuing TQM, it says. Champions of TQM view these figures with dismay. 'European companies will fall short on quality if they do not participate in TQM,' according to Geert de Raad, the EFQM's secretary general. The European Commission is also concerned. It has proposed a 'European policy for the Promotion of Quality' in a recent white paper. A particular concern for the promoters of TQM is to extend its reach into countries, such as Germany, where it has made little impact, although BASF, Siemens, Grundig and Volkswagen are notable exceptions. 'In Germany where quality has always been established, TQM is not as easily accepted as in many other countries,' says de Raad. The mixed reviews earned by TQM should not necessarily be a deterrent. When the Conference Board, a business membership organisation, reviewed a large number of reports on TQM last year, it concluded that 'progress in this difficult area appears generally positive'. That said, many problems recur in implementing TQM. A particular challenge concerns winning the support of employees, especially in companies where morale is undermined by redundancies or where the top management is seen to lack a 'gut commitment' to quality. Middle managers, in particular, are often unenthusiastic about 'empowering' their subordinates. 'Middle management are going to find it hard to delegate the responsibility when their own jobs depend on meeting budget targets,' says Peter Herriot, director of research at Sundridge Park Management Centre in the UK. Another common criticism of TQM is that it is too inward-looking. An obsession with methodology and standards can distract a company from chasing sales. Excessive red tape can make employees disillusioned. An early quality programme run by Philips Electronics, for instance, failed because of 'an overemphasis on systems and procedures and forms to fill', Timmer explained at this month's Amsterdam gathering. But champions of TQM believe that it should focus the minds of managers on both external and internal factors. The model publicised by the EFQM, for instance, stresses business results, the impact on society, people satisfaction and customer satisfaction, as well as internal issues such as processes, policy, people management and leadership. One of the tasks facing promoters of TQM is how to increase the uptake of total quality in different types of organisation. Its most notable successes have been concentrated in manufacturing companies, primarily in large international companies. All three winners of the European Quality award sponsored by the EFQM have, so far, had foreign parents. The relatively low number of quality accolades won by the service sector in Europe can partly be explained by their tendency to adopt TQM later than manufacturers, many of which were brought into total quality by adopting quality standards. Companies with a strong marketing bias have also moved into TQM relatively late, partly because they found TQM's emphasis on customer satisfaction 'boringly bland', according to John Sharpe, chairman of Birds Eye Wall's. He believes, however, that TQM can help companies address neglected issues. Smaller companies have also tended to be slow to take up TQM, partly because managers may feel too busy to undertake the extra work and partly because they are often more closely in touch with their customers than larger companies. Increasingly, however, they may be under pressure to fall in line with the demands of larger customers. 'Unless suppliers are in tune with the quality demands of their customers they will not be able to meet their demands,' says Clive Capp, managing director of Howard UK, an IT support company that has enthusiastically endorsed TQM. Public-sector organisations are also begining to experiment with TQM. The principles of TQM for non-profit organisations are no different than from any commercial organisation, once they define the nature of their customers and their results, says Ian Raisbeck, director of quality at the Royal Mail. The EFQM is making efforts to bring more small companies and non-profit organisations into its fold. At the same time, it is working on promoting TQM in under-represented countries, notably Germany. The attitude of German companies may be changing, according to the findings of a separate report by the Conference Board. 'As global competition intensifies, German companies are concluding that a narrow definition of product quality is no longer sufficient to ensure success,' it says. Evidence suggests, therefore, that TQM is gradually building up momentum in Europe, although progress remains slow in several sectors and countries. The promoters of TQM have a tough challenge in sustaining interest in TQM in the notoriously fickle marketplace for management concepts. Enthusiasts, such as Schweitzer, are convinced that TQM will not be superseded by other management fads. 'The principles of TQM are a matrix in which many other doctrines fit,' he says. 'The basic principles of total quality are permanent principles of good management.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences Vladimir </F> Belyanov: "There Is No Upsurge in Sight: Enterprise Directors  Appraise the Situation in the National Economy"]    [Text] DELOVOY MIR regularly publishes the results of  monthly surveys of Russian industrial enterprise directors,  conducted by the independent bulletin ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY  BAROMETR [THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC BAROMETER]. The survey's regular  respondents consist of about 150 directors of industrial  enterprises in different regions of Russia. The specificity and  the value of the observation sample is in that it represents the  most typical entities. It consists of medium-sized enterprises  (800-1,200 employees). Naturally, they produce first and  foremost for the domestic market and know the state of it well.    These enterprises do not possess any monopoly privileges.  Although a considerable number of them have gone through the  crucible of privatization (the share of state-owned enterprises  has declined over nine months of 1993 from 52 percent to 30  percent), they have not experienced (so far) any perceptible  effect of it. The respondents' answers are notably uniform. The  spread of opinions is minimal. All of this indicates a  sufficiently high level of competency and precision of the  directors' observations.  <H5>  The Protracted Decline </H5>   What do the directors think about the situation as a whole?    Last time we compared the results of the first six months of  1993 with respective forecasts of the respondents. Now,  following the same pattern, let us look at the data of another  six-month period--April-September 1993 (see Table 1).    Table 1. Some Summary Indicators for April-September 1993 and the Forecast  for March 1994 (in percents)                             September 1993 as % of March      Forecast: March                            1993                              1994 as % of                                                              September 1993                             Forecast made     Actual                            in April 1993   1. Real volume of         99                101             98  output, contract work,  services   2. Number of employees    96                97              97  (including  supernumeraries,  contractors, part-time  employees, etc.)   3. Real volume of         35                49              46  capital investment   4. Average prices of      193               259             239  the output produced   5. Average prices of      233               304             293  purchased products   6. Employees' average     175               260             193  monetary wages      The data in this table show again that the directors'  forecasts are quite precise. They undoubtedly appraise correctly  the trends in the economic situation.    The fact that the directors register a relative stability of  the real volume of production, contract work, and services  (which contradicts official data of the State Committee on  Statistics) is somewhat puzzling. Additional analysis shows that  this is primarily the result of the fact that the respondents  represent medium-sized enterprises. The latter turn out more  stable in the environment of general economic instability than  their largest and smallest colleagues. Actually, this stability  means only, figuratively speaking, running in place. No more  than that.    This time the directors again showed themselves to be both  pessimists and optimists. Over six months, investment at  enterprises has fallen not by a factor of three (as they had  anticipated) but only by half. On the other hand, the directors  just cannot overcome their timidity in judging inflationary  expectations. The real rise in prices considerably exceeded the  directors' forecasts: over six months, prices for enterprises'  output rose by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.9, as forecast);  prices of purchased products--threefold (instead of 2.3, as  forecast); and the price of labor (wages) rose over this period  by a factor of 2.6 (instead of 1.75, as forecast).    On the main subject, the directors' evaluation was entirely  correct: as they had predicted, production is falling slowly or  is in a state of stagnation; investment is declining swiftly;  prices of purchased products are running ahead of selling  prices; wage increases do not keep up with the rate of  inflation, which signals a continuing decline of real income of  workers at industrial (in this case, average, typical)  enterprises.    Such negative stability is revealed by many other indicators  as well.    According to the respondents' monthly appraisals, the degree  of utilization of enterprises' production capacities remained  within the range of 71-74 percent of the level they consider as  normal for the corresponding period (in the first half of the  year the appraisal produced an indicator of 72-78 percent). The  share of enterprises where the degree of production capacity  utilization has increased fluctuated during the third quarter  within the range of 6-13 percent (in the first half of the year,  8-14 percent), while the share of enterprises where this  indicator remained unchanged in the third quarter fluctuated  within the 46-60 percent range (58-66 percent within the first  half of the year). The share of barter deals in enterprises'  turnover remained stable--9 percent. The level of inventories of  unsold products also remained stable as compared to the "normal  level"--86-97 percent (82-99 percent in the first half of the  year) and the backlog of orders--79-83 percent (79-92 percent in  the first half of the year).    At the same time, there are visible signs of the continually  worsening financial situation of enterprises: In September, only  20 percent of the respondents evaluated it as good (in January  there were 4 percent, and in June--1 percent); 64 percent  considered it bad (52 percent in January and 59 percent in  June); and 34 percent appraised it as normal (44 percent in  January and 39 percent in June). The share of enterprises where  the financial conditions of operations have improved measured in  the third quarter as follows: with respect to conditions of  obtaining bank credit--0-2 percent (2-6 percent in the first  half of the year); with respect to the ratio of selling prices  to prices of purchased products--2-3 percent (1-7 percent in the  first half of the year). On the other hand, 24 percent of the  respondents expressed hope that in six months (by March 1994)  their enterprises' financial situation would improve (but in  January 1993, 33 percent of the respondents still had that  hope). Respondent enterprises' debt to banks in September 1993  was 77 percent greater than in March 1993 (in June 1993 it was  57 greater than in December 1992, and in March 1993, 38 percent  greater than in September 1992).    One may consider as a certain indicator of directors'  expectations the answers to the question: "Is a threat of  bankruptcy real for your enterprise within the next one to two  years?" In February 1993, 15 percent of the respondents answered  affirmatively; in May, 23 percent; and in August 1993, 28  percent.    Looking six months ahead, the directors did not find it  expedient to adjust their expectations. They envision March 1994  much the same as compared to September 1993: real volume of  output--98 percent; the number of employees--97 percent; real  volume of capital investment--46 percent; selling prices--239  percent; prices of purchased products--293 percent; and the  average wage--193 percent.    As before, directors persist in the opinion that economic  growth will resume only in five or six years.  <H5>  Such Familiar Reasons </H5>   As before, the respondents were asked to name three out of  12  possible choices among the primary factors holding back the  development of production over the preceding six months. Replies  are summarized in Table 2.    Table 2. What were the primary factor in holding back production at the  enterprises? (as a percentage of the number of respondents)   Possible factors          Time the reply was received                             January       April       July       October                            1993          1993        1993       1993   1.

Other reasons         8             7           3          6      The picture has remained practically unchanged: the  situation  in the sphere of turnover--the situation in financial and  commodity markets--is leading the pack. The only perceptible  trend worth noticing is an increasing weight of financial  problems in 1993: the pressure of insufficient financial means,  and especially the tax burden, has increased.    The influence of the enterprises' own financial factors is  so  great that they seem to be beginning to exert an essentially  antimarket pressure on the economy. The evidence of this is the  strange (from the market standpoint) situation whereby demand  for products and prices for production factors (raw materials,  component parts, semifinished products, labor, transportation,  information services, and so on) have an increasingly  diminishing effect on the producer.    The situation in the labor and investment goods markets  remains one of the lesser concerns for enterprises. The impact  of the privatization process on enterprises is completely  negligible. It looks as if the predominantly monetarist approach  to stimulating a market is beginning to kill the market itself.    Another indication of the causes for the decline are the  answers to another question: What does the enterprise need first  and foremost in order to adapt faster to the current situation?  (see Table 3). In this question, too, the respondents were asked  to choose three out of 12 possible options. The data received in  March and June of 1993 have already been published; the replies  received in August are being published for the first time.    Table 3. What does your enterprise need first and foremost in order to  faster adapt to the current situation (as a percentage of the number of  respondents)   Possible factors        Time the reply was received                           March 1993       June 1993       September 1993   1.

Everything is       3                1               2  fine as is      Of course, the replies to this question add color to the  total picture, make it more graphic: The concentration of  singular factors is much less prominent here.    There are no grounds, however, to change the general  conclusion above. The impact of the monetary factor has  increased, first and foremost as a result of nonpayments on the  part of customers and difficulties in paying debts to suppliers.  The impact of indebtedness to banks has attenuated somewhat,  although, as noted above, the total volume of such debt has  increased. Apparently, this is a relative decrease--the impact  of other factors is stronger.    Quite abnormal is the weakening of influence of such  strictly  market factors as the need to search for new distribution  markets and changing the mix of the output produced.    One could cheer a greater weight of the need to expand  production capacities had it been accompanied by increased  investment and demand for the enterprise's output.  Unfortunately, most likely this reflects the sad fact that the  existing production apparatus is fast becoming obsolete and the  beginning of its decline in absolute terms.    Only two out of 100 directors felt safe to report that  "everything is fine as is."  <H5>  Accent on Production </H5>   In this connection, of unquestionable interest are the  answers to the new question included in the September survey  (see Table 4).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. In your opinion, what is more important now for the Russian economy?|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Possible answers                      |As % of respondents                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1. Stimulate production               |66                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2.

Hard to tell                       |7                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      It is worth noting that there are very few who hesitated to  answer this question. The directors' position was clear:  Two-thirds of them placed emphasis on factors related to  stimulation of production. Of course, this does not mean that  they are against slowing down inflation. It is just that the  people who know the practice of economic life do not believe in  the effectiveness of managing the Russian economy solely through  operations in the monetary market.  <H5>  Investment Needed </H5>   In the investment sphere, the third quarter of 1993 has not  brought any perceptible changes, either. As one could see from  Table 1, the respondents appraised the real volume of capital  investment in September 1993 as 49 percent of the March 1993  level and predicted 46 percent for March 1994. They put the  level of realization of the production plans for April-September  1993 at 54 percent, which is not different from similar  appraisals made in March and June 1993 (53-55 percent). More  than half of the enterprises (52-56 percent) have not purchased  any equipment at all in the third quarter of 1993 (in the first  half of the year this indicator fluctuated between 47 and 57  percent).    Neither was there practically any change with respect to the  reasons causing the decline of investment. In evaluating the  reasons that had been primarily responsible for hampering  investment at the enterprise, the respondents, as before, were  asked to mark no more than three of the reply options listed  (see Table 5). The data in this table, received in January,  March, and June 1993, have already been published, but the  replies received in September are being published for the first  time. The set of questions in the questionnaires has been  changed somewhat, but it does not affect the summary results.    Table 5.

Disruption of    2              ...          ...         ...  needed deliveries  from other  countries  (non-CIS)   14. Low exchange     ...            2            ...         ...  rate of the ruble   15. Other reasons    6              8            3           8      In this respect, too, the causes of the decline have  dramatically shifted into the financial sphere: investment  growth was increasingly hampered by money  barriers--upward-creeping prices of investment goods, interest  rate on credit resources, the growing shortage of ruble means  and the increase in enterprises' aggregate debt. The weight of  impact of these four factors follows the lead of the rising cost  of credit. Other factors clearly do not have any perceptible  influence.    It is probably worth noting the absolutely absurd phenomenon  of an increase in the share of the respondents (from 5 to 12  percent) in whose opinion increased investment is hampered by  existing excess production capacities. In September 1993 about  one-third of the respondents (32 percent) declared the presence  of excess production capacities in relation to the volume of  demand expected within the next 12 months. This was in the  environment of a decline in an absolute volume of production  apparatus (in September 1993 it was 8 percent smaller than a  year ago); in the environment where the share of capital  investment in the total volume of enterprise turnover amounted  in April-September 1993 to only 4 percent, where 13 percent of  existing production capacities had been unprofitable over the  past six months, where 7 percent of currently existing  production capacities most likely would never be used, and where  only 15 percent of credit obtained is being directed into  capital investment.    Thus, the "excess" production capacities undoubtedly merely  represent idled equipment that have ended up being such as a  result of a crisis-induced stoppage of production.  <H3>  Degradation and Primitivization of Economic Structure  Continue </H3>   During the period under consideration, there have been no  serious changes in the investment structure, either (see Table  6).    Table 5. Some indicators of enterprises' capital investment structure over  the past six months (as % of total volume of capital investment)   Possible factors          Time the reply was received                             March 1993       June 1993       September 1993   1. Structure of  financing capital  investment:   a) enterprise's           66               72              65  internal resources  (profit, amortization)   b) outside resources      42               19              28  (credit, proceeds from  issuing stock, etc.)   2. The ratio of  production and  nonproduction (social  and cultural  facilities) capital  investment:   a) production             56               65              60   b) nonproduction          32               30              36   3. Approximate  technological structure  of capital investment  in production:   a) passive elements       42               46              54  (buildings, structures)    b) active elements        46               54              46  (machinery, equipment)   4) Reproduction  structure of capital  investment in  production:   a) expansion of           30               32              33  production capacities   b) replacement of         56               59              65  expended assets,  modernization, repairs      Of course, in the environment of a sharp decline in  investment, one cannot judge reliably the dynamics of its  structure. This conclusion is also supported by fluctuating  numbers in the table above. Still, an increasing share of  investment in passive elements of production assets (an increase  from 42 to 54 percent) and a low share of expenditures on  expansion of production capacities (30-33 percent) evidence a  continuing degradation of the production apparatus and the  accompanying primitivization of the economic structure.  <H5>  Innovation: A Rollback to Primitivism </H5>   The same primitivization processes take place in the sphere  of innovation as well. The June questionnaire contained a number  of questions characterizing the process of innovation at  enterprises.    It turned out that in 1992-1993 almost two-thirds of the  respondent enterprises (65 percent) introduced innovations (new  or improved production or technology). However, also in almost  two-thirds (63 percent) among these innovations, the change  amounted predominantly to changing production rather than  technology. The result was that 26 percent of the products in  the total structure first came on the market in 1992-1993.    The analysis of respondents' replies shows a clear increase  in the elements of primitive methods in introducing innovation:  ninety percent of the respondents indicated that the bulk of the  research and design work with respect to innovations had been  done in-house; only 6 percent said that this work had been  carried by a state research institute, and 4 percent--by private  research organizations. Also, let us not forget that the  respondents do not represent large and major enterprises. This  means that economic realities force even the "mid-level" to  develop "homegrown" research and development capabilities.    Of course, the experience of many foreign companies presents  quite a few examples of highly effective work of small  collectives, who draw in their work on the achievements of  strong basic research concentrated in academies and  universities, which are reasonably well financed by the state  and major companies. But the Russian disintegration of research  and development is taking place in an environment of the  catastrophic decline of the prestige and the impoverishment of  national basic science and the system of higher professional  education.    The editors of ROSSIYSKIY EKONOMICHESKIY BAROMETR asked  whether enterprises attempted to obtain credit for  innovation-related investment projects in 1992-1993. The replies  showed that more than half of all respondents (54 percent) had  attempted to obtain targeted state loans for these projects, but  only one out of four had succeeded. Forty percent of respondents  were bold enough to turn to a commercial bank for help, but only  one out of three got it. As a result, a majority of the  respondents who had introduced innovation had neither a targeted  state loan (85 percent) nor a commercial bank credit (86  percent).    The replies to the same July questionnaire enable us to form  a certain idea of the goals pursued by enterprises in the  process of innovation introduced in 1992-1993 (see Table 7).    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Purpose of innovation                 |% of respondents                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

In October 1993 two-thirds of  the respondents (62 percent) reported that their enterprises  already have been privatized. On average, this has happened nine  months before the survey. Twenty-nine percent of respondents  replied that they were planning to privatize within the current  year; 6 percent did not have such plans; and only 3 percent of  the respondents replied that their enterprises were not subject  to privatization.    The recent nature and incompleteness of the processes make  the evaluation of how the respondents perceive the government's  current economic policy very difficult. Even more so since it is  far too early to make unequivocal conclusions on what kind of  impact privatization has on the economic life of enterprises.    The program that tabulates the survey data enables us to  differentiate replies received from directors of both privatized  and nonprivatized enterprises. We hope to present the results to  DELOVOY MIR readers at a later date.    Right now we will show an updated (as compared to the report  on the results of the first half of 1993) summary of enterprise  directors's replies regarding their attitude toward the current  economic policy of the government (see Tables 8, 9, and 10).  Please note that in the previous report (DELOVOY MIR, 28 August  1993, p. 10) the months in these tables had been moved one  forward (for instance, the March column showed February data,  the June column--May data, and so on).

What has been the result of the economic policy of the government  for your enterprise as compared to other Russian enterprises? (% of  respondents)   Possible answers        Time the reply was received                           February 1993        May 1993         August 1993   1. The enterprise       51                   46               42  lost (or gained less  than others)   2. The enterprises      41                   35               46  "held its ground"   3. The enterprise       8                    20               12  gained (or lost less  than others)      Let us repeat: So far, there is clearly too little data to  produce a reliable judgment with respect to the opinion of  directors of medium-sized Russian enterprises. Also, as the  replies above show, the spread of opinions among the respondents  on this issue is quite considerable.    In August 1993 the share of those who did not understand the  economic policy of the government has increased perceptibly (to  32 percent as compared to 15 percent in May), as well as of  those who do not believe this policy is correct (to 30 percent  as compared to 17 percent in May). At the same time, the share  of those who understand this policy (8 percent) and consider it  correct (2 percent) remained very low.    However, among the same respondents, the share of those who  lost because of implementation of this policy has declined  somewhat (to 42 percent in August as compared to 46 percent in  May and 51 percent in February), and the share of those who  "held their ground" has increased (to 46 percent in August as  compared to 35 percent in May and 41 percent in February).  However, the share of those who believe they have gained was  lower in August (12 percent) than in May (20 percent), but  higher than in February (8 percent).  <H5>  Brief Conclusions </H5>   1. The directors' responses on the results of the third  quarter of 1993 have not brought anything substantially new in  the appraisal of the economic crisis situation. The spectrum of  their opinions showed increasingly clearly the stagnant nature  of the decline.    2. At the same time, as the elements of structural changes  noted above have shown, enterprises are somehow adapting to the  new economic environment. This looks more, however, like a  struggle for survival on the road of increasing primitivization  of production and "relying on internal resources."    3. The results of the third quarter of 1993 survey do not  detect an approaching economic pick-up, which is evidenced first  and foremost by the decline in investment and degradation of the  production apparatus.    4. The directors' appraisals clearly register a progressing  financial crisis. One may also state that a majority of  directors of monitored enterprises lean toward the conclusion  that the search for a way out should go in the direction of  giving priority to stimulation of production and shifting the  accent into this sphere from the monetary policy by itself.    5. Finally, one cannot fail to notice that in their  forecasts  several months ahead, the directors consistently err in their  evaluation of the future financial situation. Such repeated  errors lead us to different generalizations. One could, of  course, accuse the directors corps of a collective lack of  competency. But one may also approach it differently: Do not  these persistent errors reflect a certain artificial nature of  forming the current financial situation, its conflict with the  real state of affairs and the needs of the real Russian economy?  Perhaps those who form the financial policy should look more  attentively at themselves in the collective mirror of directors'  opinions.</p>

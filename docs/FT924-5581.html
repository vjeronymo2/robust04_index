			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Monetary union holds no fears for Caricom: EC's problems provide useful lessons CENTRAL bankers and finance ministers from the Caribbean Community (Caricom) have been watching with great interest the recent difficulties of the European Community's monetary system and its exchange rate mechanism. They see lessons for their own attempts to create a common market by establishing a monetary union with a single currency over the next eight years. Europe's problems appear, if anything, to have confirmed the Caribbean intention to proceed towards a monetary union - but to do it with caution. Despite its flaws, said one central banker, the European experience has shown that any meaningful economic integration must include a monetary union. Caricom's aim is to bring some order to a confusion of currencies and financial policies among its 13 members, whose population totals only 5.5m. Monetary union is also seen by some as an answer to sometimes chronic problems of trade payments. Finding common ground, however, on the policies which will guide them towards such a union could be difficult for governments which, at times, tend to sacrifice regional economic co-operation to narrow parochialism. Under the first phase Barbadian, Trinidadian and East Caribbean dollars will be freely convertible with each other. The three central banks will establish a regional monetary authority to co-ordinate policies, while the governments will pursue common policies leading to a deregulation of wages, prices and trade. Other Caricom members will join the monetary authority after they have met criteria based on their reserves. Eventually, all the currencies will be floated and made freely convertible against each other. In due course the monetary authority will be converted into a regional central bank to administer a common currency. The region already has a functioning monetary union which is being used as a model. The Eastern Caribbean dollar, one of the area's stronger currencies, is used in the seven islands of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, a sub-group of Caricom. Its value is fixed at 2.7 to the US dollar and cannot be changed unilaterally. The Barbados dollar is fixed at 2 to the US dollar, but has been under pressure recently because of shortfalls in the island's fiscal and external accounts, brought on by reduced earnings from tourism and sugar, the pillars of the economy. The Trinidadian currency has remained at 4.25 since 1989. It comes under pressure in line with the state of the international oil market. Trinidad and Tobago's economy is 75 per cent dependent on its oil industry. Integrating the Jamaican and Guyanese currencies could be a test of financial management. Both are floating as part of programmes to deregulate those countries' economies. The Jamaican dollar, floated 15 months ago, tumbled 56 per cent before being revalued by 26 per cent. The Guyanese dollar appears to have found its real parity after plunging 55 per cent when first floated. In the words of a St Lucian official, however, Caricom should not approach the common currency and the establishment of the monetary union with trepidation. 'Although many do not realise it, the community has had a common currency for some time,' he said. 'It is the US dollar. The only problem is that there has never been enough of it around.'</p>

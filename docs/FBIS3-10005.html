Authorities confirmed that  right now 141,000 persons are self-employed. Granma, the  official newspaper, has said "this is not a new situation." The  newspaper affirms that it has been necessary to assign certain  tasks to private individuals in every age.    According to GRANMA, under normal economic conditions, this  type of work does not have to be associated with the acquisition  of wealth or negative things, like deviating resources or  involvement with the black market as occurs now. A new law  approved in September 1993 authorized independent work and  expanded the number of jobs Cubans can perform independently  under the supervision of the state and after paying a fee to  almost 150.    According to a government source consulted by DPA, Cuban  authorities are working on a document which will regulate  violations of the Independent Work Law. It will upgrade official  controls and in this way violations or alterations of the law  will be avoided.    Since the law was approved, many vendors of artisan products  and food have emerged, especially around businesses with  services that are paid for in dollars. The most amazing  services, such as bicycle parking lots, are being offered.  Restaurants, coffee shops, and discotheques, whose services are  invariably paid for in dollars, have also opened.    A clandestine restaurant of the type popularly known as  "Paladares", which had been functioning in the Havana  neighborhood of Vedado for months was closed recently by the  police. They raided the site and detained the owner for a few  hours. This is reportedly the first public case of a clandestine  restaurant being closed by authorities after a state radio  station warned that these establishments would be closed as of  January.</p>

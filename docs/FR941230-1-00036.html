The bonds are private activity bonds under section 141(b) (1) and (2) for the reasons set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .

Private payments not based on debt service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  except that the annual payments required to be made by Corporation X are equal to the fair rental value of the facility and exceed the amount necessary to amortize the principal of and pay the interest on the outstanding bonds. The bonds are private activity bonds for the reasons set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement that Corporation X pay an amount equal to fair market value, which is in excess of the amount necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds, does not affect the status of the bonds as private activity bonds. Similarly, if the present value of the annual payments required to be made by X exceeded 10 percent of the present value of the debt service on the outstanding bonds, the bonds would be private activity bonds under section 141(b) (1) and (2) for the reasons set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . See &sect;1.141&hyph;2(a) and &sect;1.141&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Private lease of portion of building. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) State D and Corporation Y enter into an agreement under which Y will lease for 20 years one floor of a 10-story office building to be constructed by D on land that it will acquire. D will occupy the street level floor and the remaining eight floors of the building. The portion of the costs of acquiring the land and constructing the building that are allocated to the space to be leased by Y is not in excess of 10 percent of the total costs of acquiring the land and constructing the building. These costs, whether attributable to the acquisition of land or the construction of the building, were allocated to leased space in the same proportion that the reasonable rental value of that leased space bears to the reasonable rental value of the entire building. From the facts and circumstances presented, it is determined that that allocation was reasonable. D issues $10 million of bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase land and construct the office building. The arrangement does not, by itself, cause the private business use test to be met because not more than 10 percent of the proceeds is to be used, directly or indirectly, in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person. See &sect;1.141.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If Corporation Y instead leases 2 floors, and the costs allocated to these floors are in excess of 10 percent of D's investment in the land and building, the arrangement causes the private business use test to be met because more than 10 percent of the building is to be used in the trade or business of a nongovernmental person. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Thais take their coup with a pinch of fatalism: Peter Ungphakorn reports on the calm after a bloodless army takeover AT THE weekend, as Thais celebrated their traditional New Year by drenching each other with buckets of water, the country's generals participated in a more sedate ceremony. They visited the former prime minister, General Chatichai Choonhavan, at his home and poured lustral water over his hands, a ritual indicating respect for an elder. And yet these were the same officers who seven weeks ago overthrew General Chatichai, accusing his elected government of naked greed and corruption, of meddling in the affairs of the bureaucracy, of ruling by 'parliamentary dictatorship,' and of covering up a plot to assassinate a senior member of the royal family. General Chatichai himself was only back in Bangkok for a few days to receive the highest royal decoration. He returns this week to London, where the nervous military leadership would prefer him to live for the time being. His assets, along with those of some of his colleagues, are still frozen, as a top-level committee searches for evidence of wrong-doing. 'Foreigners don't understand Thai coups' is a typical Thai comment uttered with amusement, fatalism, or a trace of complaint. It is triggered not only by surprise at such events as took place at the weekend but also by the initial hesitancy of foreign investors and tourists, the queries of non-Thai organisers of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings due to be held in Bangkok in October, and the concern of human rights organisations about Thailand following the bloodless coup of February 23. But Thais, too, can be taken by surprise, as they were on February 23. Thailand was supposed to have progressed out of almost 50 years of on-off military rule. After 11 years without a coup, the army was supposed to be more restrained; its officers were supposed to be more modern in outlook and to have greater respect for the country's maturing political system and, just in case they were not, the growing business community was supposed to be an important counter-force. Whatever the announced reasons, the main cause of the coup was a steadily worsening and irreconcilable rift between the military and the elected government, culminating in General Chatichai's attempt to sack General Sunthorn Kongsompong, armed forces' supreme commander. And it was this same General Sunthorn, now chairman of the National Peace-Keeping Council, as the junta calls itself, who led the top brass to pay their New Year respects to General Chatichai. As the country's political system adjusts to the opposing traditions of military bravado and outward, conflict-avoiding compromise, and to more recent democratic habits, most Thais have hardly been affected by the coup. Many freedoms remain almost unchanged, and those that are curbed should return to normal if elections are held on schedule next year. Despite the continued enforcement of martial law and the short-lived detention of a handful of anti-coup protesters, the main cause of tension in Bangkok has been the chaos brought about by yet another attempt to re-organise the city's one-way traffic system. But Thailand's political system is also facing a change of direction, and some collisions cannot be ruled out. This week's passage of bills to curb public sector unions was achieved without protest because of martial law. The civilian prime minister, Mr Anand Panyarachun, previously a staunch opponent of military dictatorships, has proclaimed that his government will conduct sound economic policy 'transparently.' He has promised to introduce a value added tax despite public opposition and to overhaul an outdated Thai business tax system. He also plans to cut duties on imported raw materials, machine parts and components to reduce costs of Thai exports, and to review income tax rates and a withholding tax on interest earned from bank deposits. Mr Anand, 58, a businessman and former diplomat, is supported by a cabinet of technocrats and businessmen - and only a handful of generals - who are determined to show that they can govern competently, honestly, and independently of the junta, with some accountability and sensitivity to public opinion. Hence, the emphasis on 'transparency'. Despite the complaints about misunderstanding abroad, tourism and investment are picking up, following the Gulf ceasefire. And the national planning agency has increased its forecast of economic growth for this year to 9 per cent, which would keep the Thai economy among the fastest-growing in the world for a fourth year. The National Peace-Keeping Council has retained ultimate political control. It has promised not to interfere, but has a supervisory position over the government and has summary power - shared with the prime minister - including the power to order execution without trial. Half of the newly-appointed National Assembly are serving officers, and many of the rest are close to the military. The swift passage on Monday of two controversial bills depriving state-enterprise unions - the stronger section of Thailand's weak labour movement - of political activity and the right to strike, shows just how amenable the assembly is likely to be. Many analysts predict that the Anand government will find itself in conflict with the military, especially if some of the general's actions lead to a further weakening of democracy, particularly in foreigners' eyes, at a time when Thailand's image abroad is considered to be important if foreign investment and growth are to be sustained. Also likely to be controversial is the drafting of the new constitution which, according to the junta's interim charter, has to be completed with elections held by April next year. The drafting committee appointed on April 4 is charged with devising a document that would discourage vote-buying, a problem that has worsened in recent years. The Thai public shows little attachment to its elected representatives, but the mood might change if the news media were muzzled, if the military were to interfere more in civilian affairs, or if the junta were to take a liking to power. 'If they stay beyond April (next year), there will be trouble,' warns one Thai businessman, who wholeheartedly endorsed the coup.</p>

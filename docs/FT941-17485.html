			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein 'desperate to avoid choice on peace': Major adds to pressure on republicans The British government last night accused Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, of being desperate to avoid a decision on whether to accept the UK-Irish joint declaration on peace in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, sought to increase pressure on republicans by describing their calls for clarification as 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Mr Major's comments overshadowed concern on both sides of the Irish border about calls by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, for 'demilitarisation' in Northern Ireland. Officials in London and Dublin played down Mr Reynolds' remarks, which drew an angry response from unionists and a cautious welcome from Sinn Fein. Downing Street said there was no disagreement with the Irish government. Writing in this morning's edition of the unionist Belfast Newsletter, Mr Major pledged to pursue 'with renewed vigour' the so-called three-stranded talks which began in 1992. Mr Major said that agreement in the talks, which involve constitutional parties in London, Dublin and Belfast, was a 'priority' for 1994. Sinn Fe'in is excluded from the three-stranded process, but Mr Major confirmed that the party would be allowed to take part three months after a cessation of IRA violence. In a passage aimed at the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, Mr Major said suggestions that the joint declaration was a sell-out were 'nonsense'. Unionists reacted angrily to the Irish prime minister's assertion that 'the time has come to start the process of demilitarisation of the Northern conflict'. Mr Reynolds also said both governments should be 'persuaders for a new agreement on the future of the whole island'. Mr Reynolds' remarks were welcomed by Mr Martin McGuinness, a leading member of Sinn Fein, which in the past has used similar language. But hard-line unionists insist that the British government should defend the status quo rather than seek to persuade them of the need for change. Mr Paisley said Mr Reynolds' words made clear that the joint declaration was 'marked with the bloody thumbprints of the IRA'. The Rev Martin Smyth, a senior spokesman for the moderate Ulster Unionist party, said Mr Reynolds' choice of words was 'highly insensitive'. However, he indicated that the UUP was comfortable with the prospect of British troop withdrawals relatively soon after a permanent halt to IRA violence.</p>

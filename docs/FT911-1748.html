			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Merlin International offshoot wound up Bury Retail Parks, a subsidiary of Merlin International Properties, was wound up yesterday on a petition by Security Pacific National Bank. Merlin said yesterday it regretted that the bank had been unwilling to extend the term of the Pounds 6.9m mortgage facility to its subsidiary - which should have been repaid on November 30 - in order that the property could be sold in an orderly manner. The action would have no effect on the trading position of the parent company and its other subsidiaries, the company said. The loan was secured on a completed and fully-leased retail park in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The company said the bank was receiving the full rental income of Pounds 737,334 a year and there were no parent company guarantees.</p>

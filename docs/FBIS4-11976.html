			<p>BFN     [Text] Following his meeting with Maronite Patriarch Mar  Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr in Bkirki yesterday, Minister of State  Jean 'Ubayd spoke about three issues. The first of these deals  with the Christian representation [in state institutions]. He  stressed that there is such representation, as reflected in the  presence of the Franjiyah, Mu'awwad, and Buwayz families. No  one can dispute their patriotism and nationalism, he stressed.    As for the Christian figures living abroad, Minister 'Ubayd  said that Raymond Iddih himself chose to leave and so did  General Michel 'Awn and former President al-Jumayyil. Gen. 'Awn  can return at any time but must do so in accordance with the  law, 'Ubayd added.    Concerning the third issue, Minister 'Ubayd said: I am  against a Muslim state or a Christian state.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik </F> by an unidentified SLOBODNY PIATOK correspondent; place and date  not given: "Foundations of Long-Term Development; From an  Interview on the Goals of Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's  Government"--reprinted from SLOBODNY PIATOK No. 13]    [Text] On what will you place further emphasis of  continuity, SLOBODNY PIATOK No. 13 asked Prime Minister Jozef  Moravcik. [sentence as published]    [Moravcik] On integration. We want to eliminate our lag  within the framework of the Visegrad Four group, especially in  the sphere of security systems, where we have been evidently  assigned the last rank of late or even a place outside the group.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] What course do you intend to pursue in the  economy?    [Moravcik] The previous government can be reproached for  lack of concept. And, even when certain concepts were approved,  poor emphasis was placed on their implementation. The  government was improvising, more or less.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Do you think that in the six months the  interim government has at its disposal you will manage to be  more consistent?    [Moravcik] We want to set a clear program and clear targets  and implement them consistently. We realize that we will not be  able to fulfill any major program in this brief period, but we  want to lay the foundations for long-term development. We  reckon that we have some chances of continuing after the  elections.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Does this mean that the time frame of your  policy will be limited by the election date?    [Moravcik] No. We want to look further ahead, even though,  after the elections, our policy might be represented by  different people than today.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] In which regard would you not want to  follow in the footsteps of the previous government?    [Moravcik] In its improvisation. Even though it is possible  to resolve some burning problem by this method, the  extinguishing of fire in one place, without precise targeting,  can cause a fire elsewhere, which could lead society into a  state of permanent conflict.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] How will the approach of Moravcik's  government to privatization differ from that of Meciar's  government?    [Moravcik] By the depoliticization of privatization.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] What guarantees do you offer that this  depoliticization will be real?    [Moravcik] Control by parliament and more clarity of the  privatization process. It is high time for the principle of  professionalism to assert itself at the ministries. We are not  going to make any changes that would violate this principle.  However, some changes are inevitable in the interest of a good  operation of state administration.    [SLOBODNY PIATOK] Compromise was characteristic of the  opposition's joint course of action against someone. Will it  last until the elections? In this period, it will be necessary  to address a number of practical and urgent social problems, on  which the Christian Democratic Movement and the Party of the  Democratic Left, for example, can have different opinions.    [Moravcik] What is involved is a permanent process of  achieving and renewing consensus? The mechanism is laid down in  the coalition agreement. What determined the formation of the  current government coalition were discussions on practical  problems, on the solution to which we had agreed.</p>

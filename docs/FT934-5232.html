			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Ukraine pressed over N-arms Ukraine came under concentrated US and Russian pressure yesterday to eliminate its nuclear arms and implement in full the US-Soviet Start 1 strategic arms agreement. The pressure grew as foreign ministers from the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) reviewed contentious security issues at their Rome summit meeting. In a speech laced with warnings about the dangers inherent in a slide back to nationalist 'intolerance and xenophobia', Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned that Ukraine's failure to dismantle all strategic nuclear arms 'threatened the minimum level of security in Europe'. The Russian attack followed the decision of the Ukrainian parliament last month to ratify only partial implementation of the Start agreement, applying to only 42 per cent of the 1,600 nuclear warheads left on Ukrainian soil after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Mr Kozyrev's attack on Ukraine's nuclear stance was part of a concerted Russian effort to boost Moscow's credentials as a responsible Eurasian power which fulfils its international obligations and which is worthy of CSCE backing for its own peacekeeping operations in the trans-Caucasus and central Asian regions. Moscow's attempt to win a CSCE seal of approval for CIS peacekeeping operations met resistance from the Baltic states and former Warsaw Pact members such as Poland and Hungary which fear the eventual resurgence of Russia's imperial instincts. But in a clear sign that Washington looks more favourably on Moscow's willingness to assume great power responsibilities than many smaller CSCE states, President Bill Clinton is said to have telephoned Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on Monday to convey US concern at Kiev's delaying tactics over the removal of nuclear weapons. Mr Kravchuk is reported to have made clear that Ukrainians see the nuclear issue as a potential economic bargaining chip as much as a military asset and promised to bring the ratification issue before the new parliament elected in the new year. A decision on CSCE policy towards Russian and CIS peacekeeping missions is unlikely to be taken at this session. But Mr Douglas Hogg, the UK foreign office minister, suggested that ministers and officials should work out a set of criteria for such operations.</p>

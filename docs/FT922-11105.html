			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dares cuts loss to Pounds 28.5m DARES ESTATES, the property company which only published its interim results having secured agreement with its banks a bare four weeks before the December 31 year-end, has reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 28.5m for the year, shaving Pounds 1.96m off last time's Pounds 30.5m. Its banks gave Dares until the end of 1992 to match its interest costs with its rental income, but, in the year under review, the former rose to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.5m) and the latter declined to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 10.9m). Losses on ordinary activities grew to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 3.25m) mainly because of the widening gap between rents and interest. Knocking the pre-tax figure further were exceptional charges of Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 27.2m). As a result of its losses Dares has again passed the preference dividend. Losses per share were 15.76p (19.82p). Post-tax losses were Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 34.9m). Net assets at the year-end were down at Pounds 7.41m (Pounds 40.4m), less than half the called-up share capital - a position that the Companies Act 1985 demands should trigger an extraordinary meeting. During the year the disposal of properties accrued Pounds 79.9m - borrowings were reduced to Pounds 95.3m (Pounds 156.6m).</p>

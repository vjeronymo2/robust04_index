			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: The end is nigh When the Rome government announced 2 1/2 months ago steps to reform Italy's health and pensions systems in the 1995 budget there appeared a glimmer of hope that the country's fortunes might be on the mend. Not least because trade union opposition has demolished Mr Silvio Berlusconi's plans for pensions reform, that hope has now been shown to be an illusion. Rather than stemming the sources of Italian instability during his seven months as prime minister, Mr Berlusconi has proved depressingly adept at exposing new ones. Mr Berlusconi has undermined his own position by refusing to put necessary distance between his office and his business interests, while organised interests have been unwilling to accept the cuts in state hand-outs needed to rescue Italy from a spiral of mounting debt. Mr Berlusconi has been further weakened by the judicial investigations opened last month into his suspected involvement in alleged corruption by his Fininvest business empire, a matter on which he was interviewed by Milan magistrates yesterday. Yet in political terms, whether or not Mr Berlusconi is actually guilty of corruption is now irrelevant, for he has lost the ability to govern. In coming months Italy faces a fresh transition in which, almost certainly, a new, more broadly-based government will try to prevent political and financial disarray from becoming a full-scale crisis. After a difficult summer, Mr Berlusconi has suffered a still sourer autumn. Strains in his coalition have become increasingly evident, while Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement won only 8.6 per cent of the vote in this month's municipal elections. The most serious single blow, however, was the about-turn on pensions, forced by the unions' threat to step up labour stoppages. This has spared Italy serious social unrest, but it means that the 1995 budget, when given parliamentary approval probably in the next fortnight, will be bereft of a crucial measure designed to buttress fiscal credibility. This week's fresh lira fall has underlined the financial markets' nervousness about budgetary policy. Italy's short-term political priority is to pass the 1995 budget, imperfect though it is. After that, the search for a new administration will start in earnest. A new government is most likely to unite a wide spectrum of parties in parliament. It will have no choice but to return to the task of cutting the deficit, and to ensure that the ensuing pain is spread as evenly as possible. Only when a measure of fiscal consolidation is in sight can new elections be countenanced. Unless Italy collectively finds the will to make the right decisions, renewed failure to act will exact, in financial and political terms, an ever higher price.</p>

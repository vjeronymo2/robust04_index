The government will continue to cooperate with friendly  nations and international organizations in solving the issue, he  said in a state of the administration speech delivered at a  plenary session of parliament.    The government expects North Korea not only to permit IAEA  nuclear inspections, but also to come to the dialogue table as  soon as possible to take up the inter-Korean nuclear issue, he  added. He also expressed hope that a humanitarian program would  be launched to ease the pain of separated Korean families by  arranging for reunions.    Stressing that government must be based on law and order, Yi  said the administration would carry out all reform programs on  this basis.    Calling on parliament to enact new electoral legislation  during its current session, he said the government would manage  local elections slated for next year strictly according to the  new law.    To attain peaceful reunification of Korea, the government  will pursue a foreign policy which creates an international  environment conducive to that end, he said.    The government's economic policy will focus on increasing  the  international competitiveness of Korean products to spark a new  economic takeoff.    To cope with the new world trade order established under the  Uruguay Round accord, the government will reform Korea's trade  system and practices so that they suit the new order.    For price stabilization, the government will continue  controlling the prices of 30 basic items, while placing under  surveillance the prices of 140 monopoly and oligopoly items, he  said.    In addition to the 42 trillion won earmarked for investment  in rural industries, 1.5 trillion won will be poured into  agricultural restructuring programs every year over the next  decade to revitalize the sector, which will likely suffer from  farm market opening under the Uruguay Round accord, the prime  minister said.</p>

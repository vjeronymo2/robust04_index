			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME ready for US warehouses to stock copper The London Metal Exchange seems certain to plug a big gap in its international coverage early next year by allowing its warehouses in the US to stock copper. The US is the biggest consumer of copper in the world but it is also the second-largest producer. When the LME's first authorised warehouse was opened there in 1992 copper was excluded because, it was said, the LME did not feel the time was right to challenge the New York Commodity Exchange's copper contract. There was another reason: copper at that time was traded in the LME 'ring' in sterling while Comex copper was traded in dollars and this gave occasional arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However, subsequent turbulence in the currency markets caused a change of heart among most London-based traders, so the copper contract was switched to dollars in July last year. It was obvious then that it would not be very long before the LME put copper into its US warehouses, particularly as its present chairman, Mr Raj Bagri, was determined to enhance the exchange's international status. 'There can be no no-go areas,' he insisted. Mr Bagri said yesterday at a ceremony to mark the LME's move to new premises in Leadenhall Street, in London's financial district, that the question of expanding the warehousing network was 'at the top of the LME's agenda.' He would not say more but traders suggested last night that the topic might be raised at this month's board meeting after which there would have to be a 90 day 'consulting' period before the move to put copper into the US could be confirmed. The LME has spent Pounds 5m to refit its new premises, on which it has a 30-year lease, to produce a trading floor and auxiliary activities to suit its needs exactly. The traditional seats in the 'ring' have been incorporated along with modern communications booths and small offices for members in an area twice as big as the LME's previous home in Plantation House, Fenchurch Street, a short walk away. However, Mr David King, the chief executive, insisted that the LME had no present intention of changing its trading practices. For example, there were no plans to switch to all-day trading from the present methods - an inter-office telephone market and two open-outcry floor sessions. This is little different from the system the exchange used 100 years ago.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A trust for Europe European markets have had a liberated feel to them since the Berlin Wall came down - prices have fluctuated widely, as the graph shows. This could mean big investment opportunities for those who pick their stocks carefully. Which is why Mercury is launching a New Europe unit trust. It will be a special situations-style trust, aiming to stay small in size, and looking for profits via stock picking, rather than asset allocation. It will have the freedom to invest in any European market, including the UK. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 per month via a savings scheme. Front end charge is 5.25 per cent (with a 1 per cent discount during the offer period until April 3), and the annual management charge is 1.5 per cent.</p>

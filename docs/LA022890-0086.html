			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS MAKES EARLY EXIT FROM THE PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The zone press had been the trademark of The Master's College men's basketball  team all season.  </P> <P> The Mustangs had used it to wear down the opposition and win close games all  season.  </P> <P> But Tuesday night, Master's was the victim of a full-court press that matched  its own in tenacity and aggressiveness, and the result was a 97-86 loss to  Southern California College in an NAIA District 3 playoff game in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The inexperience of the Mustangs, who were making their first District 3  postseason appearance with a starting lineup that included a junior and four  sophomores, was obvious. Master's committed 22 turnovers -- 14 in the first  half when the Vanguards forged a 47-40 lead.  </P> <P> "You've got to give them credit," Master's Coach Mel Hankinson said. "They  played very well. But many of the turnovers were unforced. We would have guys  open, but then throw it off a guy's feet. . . . That was our greenness  showing."  </P> <P> No one on Master's looked greener than point guard Damon Greer, the former  Cleveland High standout who transferred from San Jose State last season.  </P> <P> Greer, who entered the game averaging 9.1 points a game, missed his first 12  shots and finished one of 13 for five points.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, your money players try to take over games like this and that's what  happened tonight," Hankinson said. "But I don't think Damon is quite ready to  do that yet."  </P> <P> Greer's lack of offense was not the only factor in the Vanguards' win, however.  Southern California was superb from long range, hitting nine of 15 three-point  shots.  </P> <P> Terry Scruggs, a 6-foot-2 senior guard from Huntsville, Ala., was four of six  from three-point range and scored a game-high 33 points.  </P> <P> Teammates Rick Witmer, Jeff Bickmore and John Mounce added 19, 18 and 16  points, respectively.  </P> <P> Although Master's trailed for most of the game, the Mustangs tied the score on  three occasions in the second half, but each time Southern California repelled  the charge.  </P> <P> Jeff Newton's basket tied the score, 64-64, with 11 minutes 35 seconds left,  but the Vanguards answered with a 9-0 run.  </P> <P> Jason Webster (a team-high 19 points for Master's) was one of three Mustangs to  foul out.  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut envisaged THERE was strong speculation yesterday that the Bundesbank would ease monetary policy next week after the German banking unions accepted a 3.3 per cent pay rise for its members, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's deal followed the recent 3.0 per cent rise for public sector workers, and may have led the Bundesbank to believe that pay deals would remain within a 3 to 4 per cent range. That was one reason why dealers were yesterday more bullish about the prospect of the Bundesbank easing rates at its council meeting next week. Recent calls by the Bundesbank for a speedy conclusion to the solidarity pact have also raised speculation that the German central bank wants to ease rates as soon as possible. The March Euromark contract rose 10 basis points on the day to close at 91.99, a level which assumes that 3-month money on March 15th will be at 8.01 per cent. That assumed that there would be a 30 basis point dip in the cost of 3-month cash in the next fourteen days. French franc futures also enjoyed a rally, with the March contract rising 29 basis points to close at 88.38. This came despite a weaker performance by the French currency and the fact that 3-month French franc interest rates have failed to dip below 12 per cent. Many dealers believe that the council meeting on March 4th is the last chance for the Bundesbank to ease policy before the March contracts expire and the parliamentary elections in France begin. But in spite of yesterday's stronger performance, the pessimists over Bundesbank policy were still out in force yesterday. 'We know what should happen and what needs to happen, but none of us know when it will,' said one dealer last night. Sterling futures were caught up in yesterday's rallies, despite a colossal shortage in the discount market. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.9bn yesterday, but it was removed without the need for late assistance. Three-month money again closed at 6 1/8 per cent. The March short sterling contract rose 8 basis points at one stage, to peak at 94.11, but later fell to a close of 94.04. At this level it is virtually assuming unchanged base rates until after the budget.</p>

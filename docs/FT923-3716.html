			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Howard Smith cuts dividend HOWARD SMITH, the Australian shipping and engineering group, has reduced its annual dividend from 35 cents to 27.5 cents a share after a 62 per cent fall in earnings to ADollars 53.5m (USDollars 38.2m) in the 12 months to June from ADollars 140.5m a year earlier. However, the comparison was distorted by a one-off ADollars 75.4m profit in the previous period on the sale of the group's strategic stake in Coal and Allied Industries. Following this sale, Howard Smith is virtually debt free, with cash reserves of ADollars 100m. Pre-tax earnings were down by 16 per cent to ADollars 81.4m from ADollars 97.4m, on a 15 per cent fall in revenue from ADollars 977.6m to ADollars 832.2m. Mr Penton Sutcliffe, managing director, said the group was looking to expand, but he saw little sign of rapid economic recovery.</p>

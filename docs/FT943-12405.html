			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Fininvest executive admits he paid bribes A senior manager of Fininvest, the media empire owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, yesterday admitted to paying three bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. The admission was made by Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, according to Mr Guido Viola, his lawyer. Mr Sciascia handed himself in for interrogation to Milan magistrates. The payments were made at a time when Mr Berlusconi was still actively in charge of Fininvest, and are certain to embarrass the prime minister. Within the rightwing coalition, Mr Berlusconi was beginning to look isolated yesterday. The populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance declined to condemn the action by the Milan magistrates so soon after the magistrates had forced the government to withdraw a controversial decree on preventive detention. Mr Berlusconi has been strongly criticised by the opposition for failing to understand the conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and that of owner of Fininvest. He was also under fire yesterday for holding a crisis meeting at his Milan villa on Sunday with close members of his government - all former Fininvest employees - as well as with lawyers of his younger brother Paolo and of Mr Sciascia. Mr Paolo Berlusconi is understood to be on a list of people under investigation by Milan magistrates in relation to the Guardia di Finanza affair. An arrest warrant on corruption charges was issued on Saturday for Mr Sciascia, for another member of Fininvest's tax department and for 21 other businessmen and Guardia di Finanza officials. This was part of a broad-ranging inquiry by Milan magistrates into a well-organised procedure among members of the Guardia di Finanza, taking bribes in return for 'friendly' tax assessments and inspections of company balance sheets. According to Mr Viola, his client paid L100m (Pounds 41,350) in two tranches in 1989 relating to the affairs of Videotime, a key Fininvest television production company. A further L100m was paid relating to an inspection of Mediolanum, the group's life insurance company. Mr Sciascia also admitted a L130m payment in 1992 relating to an inspection of Fininvest's Mondadori publishers. He had not been previously charged over this payment. However, he denied a L25m payment relating to the affairs of Telepiu, the pay-TV channel. France's magistrates embark on corruption trail, Page 2 Plea for Craxi jail term, Page 2</p>

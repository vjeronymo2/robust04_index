			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (11): Recovery due after a year of problems - Tax-efficient investments 3, Enterprise zones / For the investor who has a large sum to shield from tax, but has no great need of income, here is a significant advantage THE GREATEST relief from tax lies in enterprise zones. Once the Business Expansion Scheme has disappeared, at the end of this year, they will offer the only serious option for investors with significant sums to shelter from tax. However, that relief is only offered as a compensation for taking a serious risk - investing in commercial property in depressed areas. Promoters of enterprise zone investments have found that the route to success, as with the BES, is to remove as much risk as possible. They have succeeded to an extent. Some enterprise zone deals have been secure, and have sold out quickly in consequence. But the market in collective investments in enterprise zones has been damaged by a series of embarrassments for promoters over the past two years, which have left investors seriously out of pocket. It is impossible to marginalise risk to the same extent as is achieved with the BES. For that reason, it is best for most tax shelterers to take advantage of the BES first, while it still exists, before moving on to dabbling in enterprise zones. The tax advantages are undeniable. As with the BES, you are entitled to relief at your top marginal rate of tax, but without any upper limit, on investments in enterprise zone property. This gives EZs a significant advantage for the serious investor over the the BES, which is limited to Pounds 40,000 a year. Tax relief is available on loans taken out to fund the property, if the interest is paid using rental income. And there is no fixed five-year period. Most serious investors, with large sums to shelter from tax, have no great need of income, so this represents a significant advantage. Special loan deals are often tied up in advance, and offered by enterprise zone sponsors as an integral part of the investment. Zone investment comes in two forms - either direct, or as part of enterprise zone trusts. With a direct investment, you buy an enterprise zone property outright. Unless you are buying only a small unit, this is likely to be expensive. Enterprise zone trusts (EZTs) are syndicated deals which buy a property, and are then split into units for investment. This allows smaller investors to invest in large buildings which might otherwise be beyond their scope. It is also possible to buy into a spread of properties this way, hence reducing risk. For these reasons, trusts have grown in popularity. However, they have one big disadvantage compared with direct investment  - the exit route. No EZT has yet been wound up and its profits realised, so this remains completely untested. In most cases, it is possible for the trust to sell after five years, if unitholders agree. Whether they will agree, given the conflicts of interest which could emerge, and what price they might receive, remain to be seen. Some trusts have, in the past, offered defined exit routes by giving developers options to buy at a fixed price after a fixed period. How should you choose between trusts? According to Ian Pugh, of the Allenbridge Group, the vital factor is a sizeable, secure income stream. If you have this, then you can gear up to make the investment with some confidence. The yield (the rent paid each year expressed as a proportion of the purchase price) is important here. Allenbridge avoided EZTs last year, because the premium (in terms of a lower yield) which developers asked for in return for EZ tax advantages was too great. However, yields are now more in line with the market, according to Pugh, allowing investors some genuine value. Security is harder to legislate for. In an ideal situation, the property is pre-let to a financially strong tenant. In a few cases, EZTs have even bought property for government departments, whose covenants are obviously very secure. In other cases, covenants in force are much weaker. Bankers' guarantees should be available as a fall-back on an EZT, to keep paying a fixed level of rent if pre-arranged tenants default. These will only usually be available for the first few years of the trust's existence, but add significantly to the security. EZTs with financially weak tenants, lacking the security of a bank guarantee, are best avoided. Last year, other problems also bedevilled EZ investors. A disagreement over how the land element in a property purchase (which is not eligible for tax relief) should be valued led to lengthy delays in tax relief being paid by the Inland Revenue. Other schemes had to endure long waits before the Revenue would confirm that they had qualified for tax relief. These factors helped to make last year (1992-93) a disaster for the industry, with only Pounds 43.2m invested in EZTs, compared with about Pounds 160m in both of the two previous tax years. The popularity of BES non-recourse loans did not help. But next year, enterprise zone investment may well make a recovery. Once the BES has disappeared, investors anxious to shelter from tax will have little alternative. But it is vital to examine the security and strength of the underlying property. It never makes sense to make an investment for tax reasons alone.</p>

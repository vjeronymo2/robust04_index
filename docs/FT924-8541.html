			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Peabody sues Costain over Dollars 200m coal mining deal PEABODY Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK conglomerate, has filed a lawsuit in Missouri, seeking to have its proposed Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) purchase of Costain's Australian coal mining business enforced by the US courts. Costain, the UK construction group which initially had agreed to sell the business to Peabody, on Monday announced it had accepted a higher offer from Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Altus has agreed to pay Dollars 245m for the mining business and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property interests which had not been included in the deal with Peabody. Peabody, in a lawsuit filed in the St Louis circuit court, claims that Costain has been guilty of 'bad faith and breach of written obligations.' It asks that Costain be made to abide by the terms of the original agreement, and an injunction placed on the sale to Altus. If specific performance of the agreement is not awarded, it wants damages to be determined at a jury trial. The law suit alleges that the UK construction group granted Peabody exclusive negotiating rights when the initial purchase discussions took place. It says that the agreement specifically provided that 'Costain . . . would not solicit any competing bids and that Costain would use its good faith efforts to consummate the transaction'. The law suit says that Costain ' . . . expressly acknowledged and agreed that money damages would not be an adequate remedy if it breached the agreement,' Exclusive negotiating rights according to Peabody were initially granted until September 21. However, in mid-September, Mr Peter Costain, chief executive of the UK construction group, orally agreed to extend this period as long as good faith negotiations were going on. The company alleges that around October 16, Goldman Sachs, advising Costain, told it that a third party had offered Dollars 210m for the coal operation. Peabody, told Goldman that it had an exclusivity agreement and would not increase its Dollars 200m offer. The third party - subsequently shown to be Altus - was then said to have raised its offer to Dollars 220m, but Peabody again claims to have told Costain that it was acting in bad faith, violating the exclusivity agreement. On October 20, Peabody and Costain signed the Dollars 200m sale agreement. Mr Costain expressed surprise that proceedings were being brought in the US courts given that the original agreement had been with a UK subsidiary of Hanson. He said: 'We remain totally confident of our position that we have acted in the best interests of our shareholders as permitted by the purchase agreement and that we have lived up to all the terms and conditions of the agreement. 'We will therefore vigorously defend our position.'</p>

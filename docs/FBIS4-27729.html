			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat considers  the purchase of 39 former East German warships at $1.1 billion  expensive because the cost could be reduced to $300 million.  The Indonesian Navy's estimate of $300 million for the warships  covers the cost of the warships, which also includes repairs,  voyage expenses, and expenses for port facilities.    During his briefing in Jakarta today, Minister Edi Sudrajat  urged the finance minister to reconsider the current $1.1  billion allocation because previous finance department  allocations for the warships had been based on the Indonesian  Navy's estimates of $300 million. Minister Edi Sudrajat said  the Navy had taken into consideration the age of the warships,  which were constructed for war purposes.</p>

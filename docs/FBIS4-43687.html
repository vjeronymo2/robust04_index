			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/PLO: Talks on Diplomatic </F> Representation Going Well"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 20 -- Talks between the Vatican  and the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the opening of a  PLO mission accredited to the Holy See are going "well," the  PLO's diplomatic representative in Italy Nimr Hammad said here  today.    According to Hammad, the negotiations could be complete and  the first Palestinian representative appointed "within a month."  Currently, the PLO has no representative at the Vatican City,  but Hammad, who is accredited with the rank of delegate-general  in Italy, is responsible for formal relations.    Chatting with reporters on the fringe of a conference of  Palestinian and Israeli scientists and researchers organised by  the Italian National Research Council, both Hammad and Israeli  Ambassador in Rome Avi Pazner voiced optimism over the future of  the Middle Eastern peace process.    Pazner confirmed that negotiations will start shortly on  extending Palestinian autonomy from Gaza and Jericho to other  Israeli-controlled areas. "But Jerusalem is not on the agenda  and will never be divided," he said, as he reported that the  autonomy process was going better than expected.    The Mideastern peace process and the progress towards  Palestinian autonomy had produced "very fine" results, said the  diplomat, adding that the events of recent months represent a  "revolution" for the region.    He was also asked about the Israeli attitude to the presence  in the Berlusconi government of hard-right ministers and deputy  ministers from the National Alliance, whose roots lie in the  neo-fascist Italian Social Movement. "We'll judge by the facts,  what they do and say, not what others say about them," replied  the diplomat, repeating the position taken by Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres when he met his Italian confrere Antonio Martino  in Luxembourg on June 13.    The opening of the conference was also attended by President  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.</p>

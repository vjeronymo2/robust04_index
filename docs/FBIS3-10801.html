In his first news conference with local and foreign  reporters, Frei said he will not emulate his predecessor  Patricio Aylwin, who after his inauguration in March 1990 hinted  to Pinochet that he should resign.    The new Chilean ruler said he will not tamper with the  constitutional provision that establishes the permanence of  military chiefs until 1997. Frei added, however, that he would  promote constitutional reforms to again empower the president to  appoint armed forces chiefs.    Frei emphasized that his relations with the Army and other  defense institutions "will be impersonal" [as received] to  ensure that such bodies also help the country face its great  challenges and embark on a new phase of development.    Frei said that recent Air Force and the Army weapons  purchases are not part of an arms race but the unavoidable  renewal of already obsolete weapons.    The country needs an armed forces that is modern and ready  to  fulfill its mission of defending the country's territorial  sovereignty and security, Frei added. The president said that  weapons expenditures are not contrary to his political goals of  overcoming the extreme poverty that affects more than 1 million  Chileans.    Frei added that the armed forces are absolutely subordinate  to civilian power.</p>

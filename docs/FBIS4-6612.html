			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata will have to carry out political, tax and economic reforms  if he becomes the new premier, departing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Friday [22 April].    "I think political reform has not been completed and there  also are tax and economic reforms" to be accomplished, Hosokawa  told reporters. "We have many problems... but all of us decided  to support him (Hata) and to hold out," he said.    Two weeks after Hosokawa abruptly announced his resignation  over his allegedly shady financial deals, the ruling coalition  officially chose Hata on Friday as its candidate for the  premiership election in the Diet on Monday.    Hosokawa had been under fire over allegations he had raised  funds in dubious ways via a 100 million yen loan from  scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group and  purchase of shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph  and Telephone Corp.    Sadatoshi Ozato, Diet Affairs Committee chairman of the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said the LDP will  continue grilling Hosokawa about his financial deals after he  quits.    The LDP is considering demanding that the Diet summon  Hosokawa after his resignation to testify on his transactions,  Ozato said.    Ozato said suspicions about Hosokawa's finances deepened  when  the premier's aide said Friday that Hosokawa had failed to  report to tax authorities his personal income of 29 million yen  from stock and bond investments during a 10-year period from  1981.    Hosokawa told reporters he had no intention of evading taxes  and simply failed to report the income. He reiterated he will  not resign as a House of Representatives legislator or head of  Japan New Party, saying he is stepping down as premier to take  responsibility for his personal finances.</p>

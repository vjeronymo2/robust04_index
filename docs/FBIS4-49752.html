			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["MOFTEC Regulations on Responding to Lawsuits From Overseas </F> Concerning Antidumping Cases Against Chinese Export Goods"]    [Text] Article 1. In order to safeguard the legitimate  interests of production and export enterprises in our country,  maintain our country's export markets, and accomplish the work  of responding to overseas lawsuits on antidumping cases  involving our exports, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has specially drawn up these  stipulations.       Article 2. When antidumping charges are brought  against Chinese exports, respondents to lawsuits should be:       1. Enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade  and with exported goods (including transshipment) during the  period of investigation to countries or regions which bring  charges against the goods, and       2. Enterprises producing export goods referred to by  section one.       Article 3. All import and export chambers of commerce  or foreign-invested enterprise associations (chambers of  commerce or associations) are responsible for organizing and  coordinating the work of responding to lawsuits on antidumping  cases and should appoint personnel with professional skills to  be in charge.    When only a minority of enterprises produce or export  products accused of being dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or  associations can appoint one unit to be responsible for  organizing and coordinating overseas lawsuits. However,  chambers of commerce or the associations should constantly have  a grip on the progress of the work and open the necessary files.       Article 4. When a certain product is accused of being  dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or associations should  promptly issue notices in GUOJI SHANGBAO, and those who are  going to respond to the charges should immediately inform  departments, commissions, and bureaus of foreign economic  relations and trade (local foreign economic relations and trade  commissions) and chambers of commerce or associations concerned  in their provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, or  cities specially listed in the state plan.       Article 5. Respondents to lawsuits should, in  accordance with the requirements of the questionnaire, provide  data and information on the products concerned during the period  of investigation, such as prices, production quantities,  exports, and production costs, and should appoint special  personnel to be in charge of the work of responding to lawsuits,  checks, and re-examinations.       Article 6. During the response period, respondents  should be subordinate to coordinated arrangements made by the  local foreign economic relations and trade commissions and the  chambers of commerce or associations.       Article 7. Chambers of commerce or associations should  promptly report respondents' names, phone numbers, addresses,  fax numbers, and list of contacts to MOFTEC.       Article 8. Respondents should pay lawyers' fees and  other relevant charges on time in accordance with the percentage  of export goods under investigation during the period of  investigation.       Article 9. Entrusted by respondents, chambers of  commerce or associations are in charge of organizing the work of  responding to overseas lawsuits, and they can also retain  foreign lawyers who understand China's situation and have strong  professional abilities to respond to the lawsuits.       Article 10. The chambers of commerce or associations  can retain domestic lawyers with expertise in handling  antidumping cases to take part in responding to the lawsuits,  such as filling question lists and preparing relevant legal  documents and proofs.       Article 11. If necessary, chambers of commerce or  associations can organize respondents to take part in hearings  or concrete negotiations abroad, but they must solicit opinions  from MOFTEC's antidumping work departments in advance.       Article 12. Respondents can negotiate and sign "price  guarantees" or "suspension agreements" and should  conscientiously implement them. Respondents should constantly  or regularly report the situation of agreement implementation to  chambers of commerce or associations. Chambers of commerce or  associations should supervise and examine agreement  implementation situations.       Article 13. Chambers of commerce or associations  should promptly report to MOFTEC the situation concerning  responses to antidumping suits and existing problems.       Article 14. Chambers of commerce or associations and  respondents should open files on antidumping cases and keep  complete sets of information. They should also keep a watch for  changes in the export situation of every product which has been  investigated. Chamber of commerce or associations should  summarize the situation and report to MOFTEC every six months.       Article 15. Regarding export goods against which, as  shown by evidence, antidumping measures will be implemented, or  goods which have been punished by antidumping practices but can  still be exported, chambers of commerce or associations should,  to prevent any further implementation of antidumping measures,  promptly put forward MOFTEC suggestions to improve export  administration methods, including setting up export quotas or  issuing permits. Chambers of commerce or associations will  submit to MOFTEC a list of enterprises authorized to engage in  foreign trade which have a good grip on export prices and take  the initiative in responding to lawsuits, and MOFTEC will give  priority to them when distributing quotas and issuing permits.       Article 16. Chambers of commerce or associations  should perfect market research work and take necessary measures  to strive to prevent any occurrence of antidumping lawsuits  abroad.       Article 17. When chambers of commerce or associations  are entrusted with the task of responding to overseas lawsuits,  all local foreign economic relations and trade commissions  should be responsible for coordinating, in cooperation with the  chambers of commerce or associations, the work of responding to  antidumping lawsuits in their localities, including urging local  respondents to respond to the lawsuits concerned and pay fees on  time. Under given conditions, all local foreign economic  relations and trade commissions can also be in charge of  organizing responses to antidumping lawsuits. They should also  investigate and grasp the situation in their localities which  leads to the occurrence of antidumping cases, analyze their  impact on export trade, and take appropriate measures.       Article 18. All trade organs accredited to foreign  countries should investigate and grasp antidumping laws and  regulations in the countries where they are staying, as well as  the investigation and adjudication situation in antidumping  cases involving China. Moreover, they should promptly report to  MOFTEC the above-mentioned situations, existing problems, and  opinions for improving trade administration and the work of  responding to lawsuits. Regarding antidumping cases which may  arise or have just arisen, it is necessary to promptly report  them to MOFTEC and the chambers of commerce or associations  concerned. Trade organs accredited to foreign countries can  make suggestions on retaining lawyers and supervising their  pleas. Groups going abroad to respond to lawsuits or take part  in hearings should be guided by trade organs accredited to  foreign countries and should promptly report the work situation  to the latter.       Article 19. MOFTEC is responsible for guiding the work  of responding to antidumping lawsuits, laying down and revising  methods for administering the work of responding to antidumping  lawsuits, and holding consultations with the governments of  importing countries on handling relevant cases so that Chinese  exports are treated fairly.       Article 20. For those companies or enterprises who  know perfectly well that products manufactured by their own  companies or enterprises are facing antidumping charges but  choose not to respond to relevant lawsuits or pay lawyers' fees  and other relevant charges and not to cooperate with the  authorities in lawsuits, chambers of commerce or associations  should promptly report these cases to MOFTEC, and they are  empowered to condemn or issue critical circulars of this  practice.       Article 21. For authorized foreign trade companies or  enterprises who do not promptly respond to lawsuits, do not pay  lawyers' fees or other relevant charges, and do not cooperate  with the authorities in antidumping investigations, we may  circulate notes of criticism against them or abolish all or part  of their rights to apply for export quotas and permits. For  those companies or enterprises which commit serious cases, all  or part of their rights to engage in foreign trade can be  abolished and they can be fined.       Article 22. Relevant articles in these stipulations  also apply to cases of investigation started by foreign  governments in accordance with "anti-subsidy" laws and laws  against "market disruption" and "protectionist measures."       Article 23. MOFTEC assigns its Treaty and Law  Department to be in charge of antidumping work.       Article 24. These regulations are effective from the  day of promulgation.</p>

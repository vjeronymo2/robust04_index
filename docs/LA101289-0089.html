			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> VALLEY BLVD. CONSULTANT  </P> <P> If parts of Valley Boulevard are blighted enough to qualify as redevelopment  project areas, should the city set up a redevelopment district there or leave  expansion to the private sector?  </P> <P> For $6,500, consultant Ralph H. Webb will answer that and other related  questions for the city.  </P> <P> Webb, the former Baldwin Park city manager who resigned under fire in May, was  awarded the Valley Boulevard study contract at an Alhambra Redevelopment Agency  meeting Monday night.  </P> <P> Agency Director Mike Martin said he recommended Webb Public Management Services  of Huntington Beach for the project because of Webb's extensive experience with  redevelopment issues in Baldwin Park.  </P> <P> "We knew he is up on current legislation for establishing new redevelopment  areas," Martin said. Webb was the only consultant the city contacted, Martin  said, describing the selection process as routine for professional services.  </P> <P> If the study indicates that a redevelopment area is justified, Webb will  develop an implementation plan. The total contract, including the preliminary  study, is not to exceed $10,625.  </P> <P> The study is part of a program to guide development along the commercial  corridor. Webb is scheduled to report to the agency in late November.  </P></p>

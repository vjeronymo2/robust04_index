The daming palaces were the imperial quarters and political  offices for 230 years in China's Tang Dynasty (618-907). These  large-scale palace complexes built in the middle period of  Chinese history were of an incomparable splendor.    Local sources said that the Japanese will provide about a  million U.S. dollars for the project, and Chinese and Japanese  archeologists will together hammer out a protective restoration  program.    The sources also revealed that a formal agreement on the  project will be signed when Japanese prime minister Morihiro  Hosokawa pays an official visit to China shortly.    Preparations will be made this year, and the program is to  be  carried out fully next year.    Cheng Andong, secretary of the city Communist Party  Committee, said while meeting UN and Japanese representatives  early this month that the city has been putting special emphasis  on the palaces restoration plan.    Cheng said that the government has designated specific  people  to be in charge of the work and the city has spent more than one  million yuan (about 114,900 U.S. dollars) in recent years on the  greening of land around the palaces and removing unrelated  buildings.</p>

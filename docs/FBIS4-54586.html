			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Military Commanders in Brussels"] </F>   [Excerpts] Brussels--The chiefs of general staff of NATO  member states met with their counterparts from the countries of  the Eastern bloc yesterday to discuss plans connected with the  Partnership for Peace project and participation in peace  missions. [passage omitted]    "Slovakia is interested in participating in tactical and  command and staff exercises of larger dimensions, but not this  year," Slovak Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj,  who represented the Slovak side, told the TA SR correspondent.  For 1994, the Slovak Republic is preparing the exchange of  smaller units, such as platoons and companies, at reciprocal  exercises with other states of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council (NACC). "We cannot afford more, in view of the fact  that only 1 percent of the Defense Ministry budget (that is, 104  million Slovak korunas) has been earmarked for the  implementation of the Partnership for Peace project," General  Humaj noted. Julius Humaj also said that the Slovak Republic  would present the presentation document for the Partnership for  Peace program in May. "This document cannot be prepared in a  few days or weeks," he said, reacting to comments by the NATO  political leadership that the partner countries needed more time  to draft the presentation document than had originally been  expected.    Julius Humaj informed the NACC partners of the readiness of  the Slovak Republic to make available, within the framework of  Partnership for Peace, areas for training as well as training  centers for the preparation of members of peacekeeping missions.</p>

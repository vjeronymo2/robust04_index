			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- An initiative to create a  Euro-Asian union put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev has evoked strong interest among journalists.  However, according to Boris Yeltsin, the idea of the Euro-Asian  Union was not discussed at the CIS summit on Friday since Kazakh  President Nursultan Nazarbayev was not present at the session  because he was unwell and no concrete information on this  problem was available.    According to Kazakh Vice-President Erik Esanbayev [name as  received], who led the Kazakh delegation to the CIS summit, the  idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian Union was suggested by  life itself. "At present, we are watching the response to the  idea made by politicians and the mass media," Esanbayev said,  adding that a comprehensive programme for the formation of the  Euro-Asian Union will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS  summit.    Chairman of the Tajik Parliament, Emomali Rakhmonov,  believes  that the idea of the formation of the Euro-Asian union is a  "good" one, but "the possibilities of the CIS have not been  fully used up yet, which was confirmed once again by signatures  of the Commonwealth presidents put under adopted documents," he  said.    Uzbek President Islam Karimov shares the opinion of the  Tajik  parliament chairman, saying that "the idea of the Euro-Asian  Union does not have any serious foundation whatsoever." He  pointed that it is necessary to persistently carry through the  idea of strengthening the CIS, primarily by enhancing economic  integration and creating an economic union. "Therefore, it  would not be correct to leave the matter of strengthening the  CIS half-finished and put forward a new initiative," Karimov  said.    Asked whether agreements reached by heads of the CIS have  been efficiently fulfilled since the day of the CIS formation,  Yeltsin said that a decision was adopted on Friday to check  whether the discipline of carrying out these agreement was  observed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "'Fatherland and Freedom' Submits </F> Draft Law for a Popular Referendum on Skrunda"]    [Text] Riga, 21 March -- The Saeima [parliament] faction  "Fatherland and Freedom" has submitted a draft law on organizing  a popular referendum on the issue of the continued operation of  the Russian military facility -- Skrunda radar station -- on  Latvian territory.    "Fatherland and Freedom" has drafted this law in light of  its  belief that the final decision on the continued operation of the  Skrunda radar station after 31 August 1994 should be made by the  people of Latvia, and that the signing of the agreement with  Russia should be delayed until the results of the referendum are  calculated.    The draft law presented by "Fatherland and Freedom" says  that  the referendum should be held on 29 May, at the same time as  local government elections, and that all eligible Latvian  citizens should participate. During the referendum, voters  would answer the question: Do you agree or disagree with the  continued operation of the Skrunda radar station after 31 August  1994?    After the referendum, depending on the results, the Saeima  will decide whether or not to conclude the agreement with Russia  on the functioning of the Skrunda radar station, the draft law  envisions. It also says that the decisions of the Cabinet of  Ministers on concluding the agreement with Russia, which provide  for the Skrunda station to continue operations past 31 August  1994, are not valid.    The faction asked to include this issue on the agenda of the  next plenary session, but the Presidium of the Saeima decided to  pass it in the usual procedure to the Juridical Commission,  which will prepare the draft law for examination at the plenary  session. On Thursday [24 March], the deputies will have to make  a decision as to whether the draft law will be rejected or  passed to the Juridical Commission. A special law is necessary  because the Constitution does not provide for the holding of  popular referendums on issues related to international  agreements.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong first quarter at Canadian banks Strong growth in interest income and lower loan-loss provisions propelled first-quarter earnings at Toronto-Dominion Bank to their highest level since early 1990, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The bank, Canada's fifth largest, reported a continuing drop in non-performing loans, but said its real-estate and forestry portfolios remain a concern. Net income climbed to CDollars 168m (USDollars 125m), or 52 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 1m, or a loss of two cents, a year earlier. The quarterly dividend has been raised 1 cent to 20 cents a share. Return on equity was 13.5 per cent, against a negative 0.7 per cent. Total assets grew from CDollars 80.1bn to CDollars 92.4bn. Loan-loss reserves dipped to CDollars 113m from CDollars 150m. National Bank of Canada, the country's sixth-biggest chartered bank, posted a 12 per cent gain in the first quarter, with strong results from its brokerage unit, higher loan volumes and lower provisions, writes Robert Gibbens. Profit was CDollars 50.6m or 27 cents a share for the three months ended January 31, against CDollars 45m or 28 cents a share on fewer shares outstanding a year earlier. Return on average assets was 0.47 per cent against 0.46 per cent, and on average equity 10.4 per cent against 11 per cent. Loan loss provision was CDollars 62.5m against CDollars 75m. Total assets were CDollars 42.6bn, up 2 per cent from a year earlier.</p>

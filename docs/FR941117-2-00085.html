This letter refers to the Justice Department's Proposed Final Judgment in United States of America vs. Microsoft Corporation. I am not certain if this situation is covered. If it is, Microsoft is already violating the principles of the consent decree. If it is not, I believe it should be included as Prohibited Conduct. This is not an isolated case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last week I purchased the developers toolkit for Microsoft's Windows NT 3.5 and discovered that Microsoft has included third party tools to create three dimensional images within software applications free of charge. My product, 3d Graphic Tools, is a tool to create three dimensional images within software applications. The third party tools included in Windows NT 3.5 were obtained or licensed from Silicon Graphics by Microsoft. Further I hear (Microsoft will not cooperate and say one way or the other) that a version of the same third party tools will be included in the upcoming Windows 4.0 release. If this happens my product will be dead, because why would anyone pay for something they already get free? I think Microsoft's intent by selling this ``package'' is to guarantee a market for one software product and squeeze may product (and other competing products) out of this market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I was under the impression (false) that these third party tools would be sold separately. I was an official test site for Windows NT 3.5 and they were not included by Microsoft in the pre-release version of the product in other than an extremely rudimentary form which would have required the purchase of additional tool kits from other sources. 3d Graphic Tools is not unknown to Microsoft, they have two copies in their corporate library which are accessible to any employee. We participate in Microsoft's Add-on Developer Tools Program and advertise in the Companion Products catalogs which are included in Microsoft's product boxes with the Visual Basic and Visual C++. (I have included a copy of the most recent catalog for Visual C++, my advertisement is on page 15). I think this demonstrates that Microsoft is aware of my products. As with other small companies this is my sole product. 3d Graphic Tools has been available since 1992 to Windows developers and to MacIntosh developers since 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please contact me if you need further information regarding this matter.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;Best Regards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mark M.

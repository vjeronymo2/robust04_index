The commenters believed that the sale of the loan to an eligible lender is an unrelated administrative task.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. The Secretary notes that the loan is still in default as long as it is with the guaranty agency, even after the required series of payments are made and the borrower is not eligible for all benefits of the program (e.g., deferment). The Secretary notes that section 428F(a) of the HEA provides that only after the loan has been repurchased by the lender has it been effectively rehabilitated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the proposed regulations should be clarified to state that the borrower who rehabilitates a loan regains full eligibility for deferments and forbearances, even if the borrower previously received a deferment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the borrower should regain full eligibility for deferments. The Secretary notes longstanding Department policy that the deferments with which a maximum period is associated apply to the borrower and not to individual sets of loans and that the borrower will only qualify for the balance of deferment eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 682.405(a)(3) of the regulations has been revised to provide that once the loan is rehabilitated, the borrower regains all benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility the borrower may have under the law from the date of the rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.405(b)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to define ``voluntary payments'' to include payments made on behalf of the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that the borrower must make a good faith effort in making the required consecutive monthly payments to qualify for loan rehabilitation. The Secretary does not believe that payments made by parents or other individuals on behalf of the borrower for purposes of rehabilitating a defaulted loan constitutes a good faith effort on the part of the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters noted that the regulations suggested that a borrower may qualify for loan rehabilitation even if the guaranty agency has obtained a judgment against the borrower for the defaulted loan. The commenters suggested that since the original promissory note is surrendered to the court when there is a judgment on the loan, it would become very difficult to initiate legal proceedings against a rehabilitated borrower who again defaulted on the rehabilitated loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary shares the concerns raised by the commenters. However, the Secretary also believes that a borrower should not lose the opportunity to rehabilitate a defaulted loan due solely to a judgment. Accordingly, the Secretary has modified the regulations to require a borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment has been entered to sign a new promissory note prior to the sale of the loan to an eligible lender. This approach is necessary to make sale of the loan practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has amended &sect;682.405(a) to add a new paragraph (4) to require a borrower against whom the agency has a judgment to enter into a new promissory note.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested that the regulations should allow for the inclusion of utilities and work-related expenses in the listing of necessary expenses for the purpose of determining a reasonable and affordable payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees with the commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations have been revised to include utilities and work-related expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Observer: Brain drain Just think of the comments if the next editor of The Economist or The Spectator were an American. However, the steady drift of British writers stateside has become so commonplace now that it is hardly noticed. Alexander Chancellor, a former editor of The Spectator and founding editor of The Independent magazine, is the latest to join the gravy train. He is joining Tina Brown at The New Yorker and his defection comes only a few weeks after Lynn Barber, another Independent star, announced that she will be a contributing editor of Vanity Fair, Tina Brown's old charge. Barber will continue to write for The Independent, but Andreas Whittam Smith does not disguise his concern at the loss of Chancellor. Given that British film directors are making an increasing mark in Hollywood, can the media exodus from Britain just be explained away by higher salaries?</p>

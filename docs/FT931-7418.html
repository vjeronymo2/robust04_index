			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada seeks 5% staff pay cuts for two years AIR CANADA has asked all its employees to take a 5 per cent pay cut for two years and receive 'share appreciation rights' to compensate. The company's payroll is 19,000, down 3,000 since 1990. The pay cut would save about CDollars 100m (USDollars 80m) over the two years. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada president, said it would make a small operating profit in 1993 and post a final loss, including special charges, of about CDollars 200m. Its immediate objective was to reverse the 1992 decline in yields. Mr Hollis appealed directly to all operating and maintenance employees over the proposed pay cut. But the appeal was immediately rejected by the three biggest unions, which said they had already accepted a one-year freeze.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Raghidah Dirgham in New York, Faysal Makram in </F> Sanaa, Iqbal 'Abdallah in Aden, and Ashraf al-Faqiyy in Cairo:  "Sanaa: The United States Is Interfering in Our Internal  Affairs"]    [Excerpts] The meeting scheduled to take place in Cairo  today between the parties to the Yemeni conflict is facing  difficulties because of the fundamental differences between  these parties. [passage omitted]    In another important development, Sanaa yesterday denied  promising the United States not to storm Aden. A General  People's Congress [GPC] senior official went so far as to say  that the statement issued by the U.S. State Department "is a  flagrant and rejected interference in the internal affairs of  the Yemeni Republic."    In New York, it has been learned that the government of the  Yemen Arab Republic conveyed to Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN  secretary general's envoy, its position on the Cairo meeting  between delegations from Sanaa and Aden to discuss a mechanism  for the supervision of the cease-fire, emphasizing that the  meeting should take the form of indirect talks, not face to  face, should be based on the existing government coalition, and  should not constitute any form of recognition or dealing with  the secessionists. [passage omitted]    In Sanaa, in the first reaction to the U.S. State  Department's recent statement, the Yemeni Government denied  promising the U.S. Administration that the government's armed  forces would not enter Aden. A responsible sources said that  "the Yemeni Government had informed the U.S. and Saudi  Governments that it would postpone the entry of the forces of  legitimacy and unity into Aden in pursuit of the remnants of the  rebel secessionists if the government found a suitable political  solution based on ending the mutiny and holding a dialogue  within the framework of the Yemeni Republic with commitment to  the Constitution and the constitutional legitimacy resulting  from 27 April 1993, as well as noninterference in Yemen's  internal affairs, to end the war and spare blood." [passage  omitted]    'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, head of the General Department and  member of the General Committee of the General People's Congress  [GPC], has stated that the U.S. State Department's statement  came as a surprise and was illogical and the GPC saw it as  flagrant interference in Yemen's internal affairs.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Sanaa yesterday, he said that  the GPC totally rejects the U.S. State Department's statement  and sees it as a flagrant and rejected interference in the  internal affairs of the Yemen Arab Republic, because the current  war in Yemen is a war between the legitimate and constitutional  government forces and a band of secessionists from some  leaderships of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. What the  legitmate forces are doing comes under the constitutional rights  of the Yemeni Republic's Government." [quotation marks as  published]    In conclusion, al-'Ansi said: "The Yemeni Government and the  legitimate forces care more about Aden, its population, and its  installations than the U.S. Administration or anyone else, and  the government forces' entry into Aden does not depend on an  U.S. or non-U.S. permit. It is rather a question of the  government's concern for the lives, properties, and human rights  of the innocent population, and of preserving economic and  public establishments in the city. When the time comes for the  legitimate forces to enter the city in pursuit of the  secessionist remnants, there would be nothing to prevent them  from entering the city any time the military and political  commands decide that the lives of the citizens are safe from any  danger."</p>

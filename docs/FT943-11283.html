			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Private View: Man who gave his life to Churchill - Sir Winston's biographer, Martin Gilbert, talks about his own career Everything is there, wrote one reviewer, including Churchill's laundry list. But it is not true, says Martin Gilbert, the English historian who holds the record for the world's longest biography. 'No laundry lists appear in any of my volumes,' he said. 'It was a funny myth, you see. The reviewer had read in a newspaper cutting something that was true - that when I was going through the Churchill archive for 1934 I found a laundry list from Beirut and this alerted me to the fact that he had been in Beirut, which was not in any other biography.' Martin Gilbert started work on Sir Winston Churchill more than 30 years ago. Recruited by Winston's son, Randolph, he assisted with two volumes of narrative and four of documentation. After Randolph's death, he added six more volumes of biography and nine of documents. The tenth companion volume comes out in November, which will bring the grand total of pages to 22,643 and of words to 9,694,000. And there are six volumes still to come - another three or four years' hard work. Gilbert has just published an entertaining bird's eye view of his literary behemoth, a sort of biographer's autobiography, called In Search of Churchill. But it was in search of Churchill's biographer, a much more enigmatic figure, that I panted up Hampstead Hill in north London. I found him in his word factory, a large study at the back of the house. A fax machine buzzed and clattered in the corner. He seemed cautious but friendly, displaying the mild awkwardness of one who has spent many hours in solitary intellectual confinement. The greatest living expert has his quirks. To devote almost an entire life to the story of another man, however great, might be counted one of them. Another is maps. Ever since he had to study the Schleswig-Holstein question in his schooldays, Gilbert has been fascinated by them. He lists 'drawing maps' as his recreation. It is obvious that Gilbert has suffered: from those who use his material to write hostile biographies of Sir Winston, even more from those who twist the facts to suit their revisionist purposes, and from those who accuse him of publishing millions of words without ever arriving at a real portrait. For a while he evaded my attempts to get him to define his relationship with his subject. Only when I asked if he dreamed about Churchill did he come out of his shell. 'I don't. I don't think I am in any way obsessed by him. But I do get quite agitated if I read something about him which I know to be untrue and somehow to be absurdly untrue, or something very negative which I know to be ridiculous.' Examples, he said, included the assertions that Churchill was a racist, that he was a warmonger, that he was always anti-Soviet, that he was against the miners in the 1926 General Strike. 'Any historical figure is very much at the mercy of current fashion, of a clever, knocking attitude, or of some brilliant misportrayal - as I would see it,' he said. To illustrate, he mentioned a recent biography which quoted the phrase 'war attracts my mind' from one of Churchill's letters to his wife Clementine. This was written after watching German army manoeuvres before the first world war, said Gilbert, who promptly recited the full quotation by heart: 'Much as war attracts me, fascinates my mind by its tremendous combination, I can feel here in the midst of arms more than ever before what vile and utter folly and barbarism it all is.' 'The author must have had the full letter because I published it,' he added. Do you write to the papers? 'No, I don't write to the papers. I'm not his defence lawyer. I'm not defending him in a court of law. I'm not obliged, when some of these controversial books come out, to defend him or express an opinion. 'Indeed there are things in my books which have become the basis of the attacks on him. If that's recognised, it's pleasing. I don't have to feel agitated because people take a different point of view.' Have you left certain things out because they were interesting to voyeurs but not to historians? 'No. Once or twice it was the exact reverse.' He described an occasion during the war when Churchill was drunk and expressing outlandish opinions. 'They were not relevant to the conduct of the war, but I felt I had to bring it in because it is part of him. It took place. It was true.' You have been unusually trusted by your witnesses, I said, especially by people wanting to put the record straight. Did you feel handicapped by their trust? 'Not at all. Sometimes it worked the other way. People confided negative things. It's not that I became the repository of Churchill-lovers. Even within the family there were those with very critical views.' Do you yourself have strong feelings about Churchill? 'I suppose I do. I do feel that some of the things that he fought for and worked for, spent his waking hours trying to do, were important.' That he was a great man? 'That he was a great man. And therefore I do get quite upset if the whole of his life's endeavour is undermined. After all, I've spent quite a lot of my life trying to establish what his life's endeavour was.' So what were Churchill's faults? 'His tremendous lack of sensitivity to the attitudes of others. I deal with that in every government department he had. He would bully, bruise and batter others in his determination to make his point.' General Sir Edward Spears, who knew Churchill during the first world war, saw a different fault. It was, he told Gilbert innocently, that Winston was 'too fond of Jews'. 'One reviewer said that, as a Jew, I had a natural sympathy for the underdog and was therefore overswayed by the fact that Churchill was against dictators and expressed sympathy for victims. I think that's too subtle. After all, you don't have to be Jewish to pay heed to the victims of totalitarianism.' I asked Gilbert if he had, after all, written a history rather than a biography. That could not be true, he replied. It was a 'life in the round', about Churchill's personality, emotions, feelings and motivation as well as the events in which he played a part. It was the biographer's job to bring out such things as Churchill's capacity for alienating people. But it was quite wrong for a biographer to deploy evidence - let alone doctor it - to support his own opinion of his subject. Why did you go to such lengths as to track down the estate agent who sold him Chartwell? Some people would call that obsessive. 'No, no. It's my professional approach really, my academic training.' Gilbert said he learned his methods from A J P Taylor, his tutor at Oxford, a brilliant exploiter of public archives and private diaries. Do you think there is such a thing as the truth? 'Yes, there is historical truth. But if truth is a building it has two things undermining it: one is perspective, and one is the lack of evidence. I do believe there is such a thing as true history, but it's not necessarily tremendously exciting or revelatory. It's not the history of the conspiracy, the secret.' There must have been times, I said, when you wished you had never started. The hardest part, he said, was tracking down those who in the 1930s had kept Churchill supplied with government secrets, allowing him to campaign against appeasement. One thing that kept him going throughout was the false picture being painted by others. In your desire to correct have you not become seen as an apologist? 'People are wrong in saying that somehow I am Churchill's partisan. They are mistaking partisanship which excludes evidence for an attempt to tell the story as it actually was.' But isn't someone who spends 30 years of his life on a biography bound to be partisan? 'I don't think so. He must have certain feelings which encourage him to get to the bottom of it. Suppose I had done Hitler. I can envisage being just as thorough and not coming out as an apologist of Hitler.' In writing such a book, I suggested Gilbert had put himself at the mercy of reviewers since few non-historians would read it. He agreed and talked of a 'Berlin Wall' between a writer and his readers. Some reviewers, he said, 'make you weep with pleasure and delight. With others you think this man is simply not writing about my work.' Whichever the case, readers of the work were greatly outnumbered by readers of reviews. For instance, the historian Philip Ziegler had described the work as 'monocular'. 'It wasn't even ill-meant. It was a phrase, quite a clever phrase. I'm not quite sure what it means but it has that slight pejorative thing. So hundreds of thousands of people will say 'Ah, yes, well, that's Gilbert. He's monocular.' So my portrait in the round, as I believe it to be, somehow doesn't exist in those readers' perceptions.' So you feel you have acquired the opposite label from the one you have earned? 'Yes, but I think you have to step back and say 'I'm not spending my professional life in order to get a good label or run away from a bad one.' It's unfortunate and sometimes it's rather painful but, you know, that's not the object of the exercise.' What will you do next? 'I haven't decided. When I was appointed to succeed Randolph I was about to write the biography of Cripps. But now there is one.' You can pick and choose, can't you? 'I have been so spoilt by archives that I think I could only choose somebody whose archival impact was enormous.' Do you mean Stalin? Gilbert paused. 'No. I think, I'll leave Stalin to friends and colleagues. No. I was thinking of some British figure. But I haven't one in mind.' He smiled. 'All suggestions gratefully received.'</p>

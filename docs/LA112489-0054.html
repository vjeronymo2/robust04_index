			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESEARCHERS ATTACK CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: BACKERS OF THE PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS CITE A NEED FOR UNBIASED  JUDGMENT. BUT ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS SAY THE GUIDELINES WILL DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT  OF DRUGS.  </P> <P> Academic medical researchers are mounting an aggressive campaign against a set  of proposed federal conflict-of-interest rules that they say would  significantly delay the development of drugs and impede progress in critical  scientific research.  </P> <P> The draft regulations were inspired by disclosures that some researchers had  received federal grants to test products in which they had financial interests.  Their dual role raised questions about their ability to perform their work  objectively.  </P> <P> The new guidelines, which would apply to non-governmental scientists who  receive federal grants, would sharply curtail the financial relationships that  have flourished in recent years between researchers and industry. They were  proposed by the National Institutes of Health and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and  Mental Health Administration.  </P> <P> "The measures will be disincentives to maintaining a productive relationship  for the sake of weeding out the relatively few transgressors," said Dr. Douglas  Kelly, associate vice president for biomedical research for the American Assn.  of Medical Colleges. The rules "will only discourage people from coming into  our profession or continuing in it," he added.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a highly regarded AIDS researcher at Harvard University  who has routinely accepted consulting fees from drug companies, says he  believes the regulations could cost the United States the competitive edge it  has long enjoyed in biomedical research.  </P> <P> "If we adopt these rules and the drug companies can't get the advice they need  to get drugs safely and expeditiously evaluated, we'll turn the pharmaceutical  industry over to the Japanese, like many of our other industries," he said.  </P> <P> "Those of us in academic medicine are not interested primarily in money. If we  were, we wouldn't be in academic medicine -- we'd be working directly for drug  companies or doing something else."  </P> <P> Supporters of the measures say they are necessary to preserve the integrity of  medical research and ensure that its outcome is not influenced by financial  motives.  </P> <P> "We have to have a system which supports medical research in a way that  distances the researchers from the immediate pressures of the marketplace,"  said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, the  first medical journal to require its authors to disclose financial holdings in  companies whose drugs are the subject of their research.  </P> <P> "I believe it is very important for our society to be able to count on the  unbiased, uninfluenced, dispassionate scientific judgment of academic  investigators when it comes to biomedical technology," Relman said. "If the  whole academic biomedical enterprise simply becomes a business, society has  lost something essential. What can you absolutely trust?"  </P> <P> The regulations were proposed after revelations that some physicians studying  experimental drugs had held stock or stock options in the companies producing  those drugs. In one case, doctors who tested the experimental heart drug TPA  had held stock or stock options in Genentech, the drug's manufacturer.  </P> <P> In another, it was disclosed that a Harvard Medical School scientist tested an  experimental eye ointment on hundreds of patients between 1984 and 1986 at the  Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The drug, developed as a therapy for dry  eyes, apparently failed to work on most of the subjects. A subsequent inquiry  found that the researcher had allegedly played down the study's negative  findings while at the same time selling his rights to the formula and his stock  in the company he had helped establish to market the ointment.  </P> <P> The National Institutes of Health came under increasing pressure, particularly  from Congress, to develop a system to prevent such abuses. Last June, James B.  Wyngaarden, then the director of the NIH, promised the House Government  Operations subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations that  the NIH would draft guidelines to protect the integrity of the $7 billion in  grants it awards every year.  </P> <P> "These proposed guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology  transfer . . . but rather provide guidance concerning the safeguards needed to  ensure unbiased performance and reporting of research results," the NIH said.  </P> <P> The proposed guidelines, which are open to comments from the public until Dec.  15, would require researchers who receive federal grants to disclose the  sources of all their income. They would forbid researchers and their families  to have personal equity holdings or options in any company that would be  affected by the outcome of their research or that manufactures a product or  equipment being studied in the research project.  </P> <P> The regulations would also prohibit researchers from sharing any information or  products derived from the NIH or Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health  Administration-funded studies with any company with which a conflict exists  until the information or products were made publicly available.  </P> <P> Finally, researchers would be barred from receiving grants from the NIH or the  ADAMHA to evaluate a company's product if the researchers were receiving  honorariums or fees from the company or held a management position with it. The  prohibition might apply -- the regulations are not clear on this -- if the  researcher's financial ties to the company had already been severed at the time  of the research grant.  </P> <P> It is this regulation that many in the academic community and the biotechnology  industry feel would seriously impair medical progress. Few companies, they  argue, have enough in-house expertise to design and launch drug trials, for  example, and private firms must be free to seek the knowledge from the very  best sources.  </P> <P> "This would really cut the critical interactions between the people in academia  -- who know about drug development -- and American industry, which needs their  expertise," said one California researcher who requested anonymity. "I think it  will really hurt the research."  </P> <P> Sam Broder, the director of the National Cancer Institute -- who as a full-time  federal employee is already bound by many of these restrictions -- says the  rules need to be far more flexible than proposed. He says he does not believe  grant recipients should be treated as if they worked for the government  full-time.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can start with the assumption that an industry-academic  collaboration automatically gives a conflict of interest," he said. "It's very  common that the very best people in the country would be sought as consultants  by private companies. This will make it very difficult for companies to seek a  talent pool."  </P> <P> Broder believes that if the current guidelines had been in place, the rapid  development of the AIDS drug AZT -- which reached the U.S. market in record  time -- would have been retarded and possibly blocked.  </P> <P> "AZT required an intimate interaction between the government, the private  sector and academia," he said. "It required a three-way partnership. No one  part would have been able to do it alone."  </P> <P> Harvard University's Schooley was paid by Biogen Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.,  company, to help design a clinical trial for the experimental AIDS therapy CD4.  Biogen had developed the product but did not know how to set up a patient  study. Schooley is now conducting a CD4 trial under an NIH grant.  </P> <P> "Under the new rules, I would either have to not do the studies or not be  involved as a consultant to Biogen in developing those studies," he said. "If I  had to make a choice, I'd probably choose not to be a consultant, because I  want to be involved in the research. But I believe it's much more efficient and  smarter to be with it right from the start. If I chose to do the consulting for  no money, then I might have to generate funds from somewhere else."  </P> <P> But Dr. Leonard Minsky, executive director of the National Coalition for  Universities in the Public Interest, a group founded by Ralph Nader, insists  that when researchers take both public and corporate money, it only "undermines  the dispassionate, objective view that a scientist must have -- unless he is a  saint."  </P> <P> "I don't care who he is," Minsky said. "If he's getting large sums of money  from pharmaceutical houses (with an interest) in drugs he is investigating, he  has a built-in bias. Maybe he's wearing contact lenses and he's forgotten that  he's wearing them -- but he's wearing them."  </P> <P> The American Assn. of Medical Colleges' Kelly, who is former chairman of the  USC School of Medicine's department of anatomy and cell biology, says his  organization is soliciting reactions from its members. He says he expects the  organization to propose an alternative to the NIH guidelines that would give  the researchers' institutions the larger role in policing for conflict of  interest.  </P></p>

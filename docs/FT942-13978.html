			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Tebbit turns on party colleagues Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, took the unprecedented step of using the leftwing Tribune magazine to criticise government and opposition 'machine politicians' who want a European single currency. The leading opponent of the Maastricht treaty on European union overshadowed his own party's attempts to set its agenda in the local and European elections with an attack on federalists in all parties. He said: 'Politics today makes for strange bedfellows. We liberals of the right stand alongside socialists such as Tony Benn, conviction politicians all. 'While machine politicians huddle together in an irreconcilable conflict of interests between their responsibilities to the sovereign people and parliament of this nation and their obligation to the European Union.' A cabinet minister said Lord Tebbit should 'know better than attack his own party during an election campaign'. He described Lord Tebbit's article 'as dangerous nonsense'.</p>

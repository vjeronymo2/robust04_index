			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A YOUNG PRO WHO KNOWS HIS TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Too much performance art falls short as performance craft. That was not a  problem with Robert Longo's "Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes," performed  over the weekend at Royce Hall, UCLA.  </P> <P> Like his paintings and 3-D triptychs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,  Longo's stage pieces have the certainty of composition that one associates with  commercial art. The viewer knows where he is supposed to look, and the artist  knows how much information he wants to give out. Every image is clearly framed  and nothing goes on too long.  </P> <P> There was no Bang! Pow! or Zowie! about "Dream Jumbo." Longo saves that for his  rock videos, also on view at the museum. The flow of images and music was so  smooth at Royce Hall that it wasn't always clear where one piece had ended  (five were seen) and another had begun.  </P> <P> Soothing is not quite the word. But if this is a "disturbing" artist, a word  that seems to be in vogue about Longo, the disturbance is conceptual and after  the fact. In the moment, we are in the hands, if not of a master, of a young  pro who knows the technology.  </P> <P> His tableaux might remind us of Robert Wilson's. (The man on stilts in the last  tableau specifically reminds us of Robert Wilson.) But the attitude toward time  is different. Longo doesn't try to slow down our heartbeat, to take us to the  gate of boredom, beyond which lie the fields of contemplation.  </P> <P> Not too much happened in these pieces, but enough happened. Sometimes there was  even a little story, such as the vignette about the big bald head on the screen  trying to reconnect with its body, which had somehow got loose into the real  world and was running around the stage.  </P> <P> Once reconnected, the little body (Sean Curran) read Puck's curtain speech from  "A Midsummer Night's Dream," the one where Puck asks the audience to "give me  your hands." Two hands on the screen then dealt him a mosquito's fate. A Tom  &amp; Jerry gag that got a nice laugh, and also made a nice little point about  the clout of the screen image these days.  </P> <P> One gathers that this is a major theme with Longo -- the way we are manipulated  by images streaming from the skyscrapers of power and privilege. It is odd to  see AT&amp;T sponsoring such a subversive artist, but this may be because the  subversion is so subtle that it's quite easy to overlook.  </P> <P> The "Marble Fog" sequence, for instance, did a lot with the screen image of the  skyscraper. But it was presented with such appreciation for the mass and line  of the buildings being seen that the sequence could be interpreted as a  celebration of the skyscraper, the cathedral of the 20th Century. Rather than  being oppressed by these images, your reviewer found them quite as handsome as  those of the fields of flowers seen just before. This is not an art that is  going to change the man in the street's opinion of the culture he lives in --  of Johnny Carson as the ultimate talking head, for instance. Longo's art is too  much of a piece with the visual codes of that culture for anyone but an expert  to make out the difference.  </P> <P> But it is well done. "Matrix Mutants," for example, was a fetching sci-fi  diorama set on a nameless planet inhabited by wiggly, squiggly silhouettes.  This was not exactly a Beckett landscape, but there are more ways than one of  conceiving apocalypse. Perhaps we will all turn into Toys by Mattel.  </P> <P> "Red Room" was a beautiful, formal dance piece for Bill T. Jones, working  before a huge swatched red curtain that kept moving in an ocean-like manner,  bellied out by air from backstage. What it meant was up to you, and it didn't  have to mean anything at all.  </P> <P> Another pleasing piece was the opener, "Sound Distance of a Good Man." This  had, from left to right: (A) two shirtless men in a slow-motion wrestling  contest (Jones and Robert Allen); (B) a big black-and-white photograph of a man  looking up into the sun, while a stone lion in the background looked the other  way; (C) a soprano in an evening gown (Peggy Atkinson) singing an aria with  much emphasis on the word "Ave."  </P> <P> A beautiful, living triptych, each frame interesting in itself, and pleasingly  contrasted against the other frames. Two struggling males (struggling to gain  knowledge of each other, you felt, like D. H. Lawrence figures) versus a female  serenely singing the praises of someone else.  </P> <P> The mind could easily play with that for 16 minutes, or could wonder about the  stone lion, or could simply enjoy the spectacle. I don't know how deep Longo  goes as an artist (the closer he comes to having a message, the more it turns  out to be a message you've already heard), but he knows how to space figures on  a stage.  </P> <P> DREAM JUMBO  </P> <P> Robert Longo's theater work, at Royce Hall, UCLA.

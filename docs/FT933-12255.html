			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: A conductor who fell in love with Europe - Andrew Clark profiles Donald Runnicles, a British star who has forged his career abroad WHEN Donald Runnicles lifts his baton to conduct Tannhauser at the Bayreuth Festival on Monday, it will not be without a sense of irony. He is only the third British musician to be invited to conduct at Bayreuth in the festival's 117-year history - but his success owes little to his British origins. Runnicles has made his career almost entirely outside Britain, and seems in no hurry to come back. In spite of his apparent neglect by our orchestras and opera companies, the 39-year-old Scot from Edinburgh says he does not feel like a prophet without honour in his own land. He has received invitations from ENO, Covent Garden and Scottish Opera - but they clashed with other commitments. The truth is that Britain has missed the boat with one of the most gifted conductors of the younger generation. When Runnicles did have time, he was snapped up by continental and American companies who recognised dynamic musicianship when they saw it. He made his Met debut in 1988 with Lulu. He was appointed music director of the San Francisco Opera in 1991. His Bayreuth debut came last year. Next month he conducts Don Giovanni in Munich, followed by The Ring and Salome at the Vienna State Opera. Upcoming are engagements in Berlin, Chicago and Israel, lined up by Columbia Artists Management, the New York agency which manages his career. Runnicles' outstanding assets are his technical control, the personal conviction he brings to every piece of music he conducts, and his intimate understanding of opera, based on practical experience. Energy, passion, theatrical sweep - these are qualities often cited in Runnicles performances. After a Mahler Third Symphony last season in Freiburg, where he has just ended a four-year contract as Generalmusikdirektor, Runnicles was dubbed a 'Mahler Ekstatiker' - pacing the music coherently while living for the moment. Unlike some better-known but less talented contemporaries trumpeted by the recording industry, Runnicles had the good fortune to learn his craft out of the limelight. He studied at Edinburgh University and the London Opera Centre, but instead of waiting for one of the handful of junior conducting posts in Britain to become vacant, he opted to work his way up the German opera house system. His first job was as ballet pianist in Mannheim. Within a year he was on the opera staff, and by the time he left Mannheim nine years later in 1987, he had conducted 40 operas. It was a tough apprenticeship, but it taught him the nuts and bolts of conducting - how to start and stop an orchestra, how to modify a chord by gesticulation, how to pull off a successful performance without rehearsal. 'The advantage of starting off in Germany is the regularity of performance, night after night. It's going into a pit feeling fresh, feeling ill, feeling prepared, feeling slightly terrified, going in knowing there's a new Leonore and meeting her just before the performance. I'm not suggesting a similar situation is not possible in Britain, but in Germany it is an everyday occurence. 'In a house like Mannheim, you are confronted with a huge repertoire - tonight it's Italian, tomorrow German, then French. The younger you are when you start learning these works, the easier they are to absorb. It can sound a bit like a sausage machine, but there are so many challenges - just to find out that you can always do it. The best way to learn conducting is to conduct, but the set-up of opera in Britain means that unless you are a staff conductor with one of the main companies, you don't get enough chances to make conducting second nature.' Although he maintains a strong interest in British music, from Vaughan Williams to David Matthews, Runnicles makes no claims to be 'particularly patriotic', and says his home at the edge of the Black Forest will continue to serve as his European base. In spite of his growing list of guest engagements, he is at heart a company man, and refers to his San Francisco job as a long-term commitment. But he is already being tipped as a future music director in one or other of the big German cities. What is clear is that more frequent British appearances - never mind a London debut - are unlikely in the foreseeable future. He pays tribute to Anthony Whitworth-Jones, Glyndebourne's general administrator, for 'keeping at it' until the right opening appeared - a unanimously praised Don Giovanni at the 1991 festival. And it will be at Glyndebourne that Runnicles next conducts opera in Britain - Queen of Spades in 1995. There are also the makings of a link with the Edinburgh Festival: following his Scottish Chamber Orchestra concert there last year, he will open the 1994 festival with Mahler's Eighth Symphony. Son of the choirmaster and organist at the episcopal church in Morningside, Runnicles says his church background has always been an important influence. 'That's where I learned organ and piano. It's sometimes hard for me to find common ground between this background and conducting a work such as Salome, so sensuous and seductive that it's almost corrupting - I almost feel as if it's a sin to be enjoying it] This was never the music we heard at home. It was me with my radio when I was growing up, listening to Bayreuth broadcasts while the family were downstairs - I wanted to hear it. Ever since, church music has been something terribly sobering and purifying, and at the end of a day I still listen to it. I need that, because this operatic world which I love is just one inflated ego.' The 1993 Bayreuth Festival opens tomorrow with a new production of Tristan und Isolde. Donald Runnicles conducts Tannhauser on July 26, August 1, 7, 14, 18 and 23.</p>

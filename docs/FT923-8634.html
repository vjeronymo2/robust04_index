			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (5) Sir, Abbey National's proposal to revive the UK housing market would encourage a further cycle of house price inflation, as seen in the mid- and late-1980s. This is irresponsible. To prevent the misery and costs of repossessions is another matter, which would be best served by the introduction of a means-tested housing benefit for owner-occupiers. It should be available for a limited period of, say, five years (with a less generous scheme available thereafter) and be financed in total or in part by the phasing-out of mortgage interest tax relief - in conjunction with falling interest rates, I would hope.

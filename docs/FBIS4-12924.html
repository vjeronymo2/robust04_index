			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Toaj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: "Gulf States Discuss </F> Developing Peninsula Shield and Early Warning Network"]    [Excerpts] Abu Dhabi -- Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]  chiefs of staff held a closed meeting in Dubayy yesterday. It  focused on ways of developing and enlarging the Peninsula Shield  Force and linking radar networks in the member states in the  form of an early warning network. The meeting of the GCC chiefs  of staff is considered the first practical step toward  implementing a number of recommendations the GCC defense  ministers made during their meeting in Abu Dhabi last November,  which were referred to the GCC leaders during their December  summit meeting in Riyadh. [passage omitted]    Sources at the GCC General Secretariat say that "the joint  Gulf early warning network which has been agreed will not lead  to a radical change in what already exists in the member states.  This network will amount to a coalition among the radar  networks the Gulf states own at present and what they plan to  own in the future, provided a mechanism is secured to guarantee  a smooth flow and exchange of information among the armed forces  of the member states." The meeting of the chiefs of staff  committee will determine a location for the command of the early  warning network system.    Regarding development of the Peninsula Shield, there is an  agreement to enlarge it, namely by each state allocating units  from its army to join the Peninsula Shield Force whenever  necessary or during joint exercises and maneuvers.    There is also an agreement that the Peninsula Shield Force  command be assumed by turns among the member states, provided  that the headquarters of these forces remains in the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia and that a unified general staff, based in Riyadh,  is formed for these forces.    Regarding financing and armament, each state will contribute  according to the number of units it allocates to the Peninsula  Shield Force.    GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi says that the  recommendations are intended to develop the Peninsula Shield  Force and to make it a deterrent force with an early warning  network in order to guarantee the region's stability and  security.

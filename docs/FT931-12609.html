			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (4): Royal Armouries captured ONE of the Leeds Development Corporation's great coups has been the relocation of the Royal Armouries from the Tower of London, writes Stewart Dalby. The armouries had been there for 900 years and among the items added over the centuries were Henry VIII's battledress and an entire suit of armour for an Indian elephant. Conditions at the Tower were too cramped for a proper display and the need to move the collection was recognised several years ago. Last year, after reading that Sheffield had won the relocation, Mr Stuart Kenny, LDC's development director, phoned the Tower to find that the deal had not been finalised. Together with Leeds City Council, the development agency and private landowners, a financial package was put together to site the museum at the disused Clarence Dock on the River Aire. The museum should be open by 1995 or 1996. It will cost about Pounds 35m and could create 200 jobs. With 1m visitors a year anticipated, the economic benefit to Leeds could be an annual Pounds 30m. Before the Royal Armouries receives its first visitor, the Tetley visitor centre should be under way on a site close to the Clarence Dock. Tetley is the largest brewer in Leeds, with 800 public houses. The project has yet to be given a proper name. To call it a visitor centre rather understates the scale of the scheme which will include a fully-fledged museum of brewing, costing Pounds 6m to build. The museum will be a working one, with craftsmen such as coopers and brewers demonstrating their skills. There will also be an Elizabethan coaching inn, a Georgian gin palace and a Victorian pub. Mr Graham Kershaw, Tetley's company secretary, says: 'We have done our homework and are convinced that there is a demand for this museum.' The company is expecting 250,000 visitors a year. The LDC has been instrumental in building a Pounds 600,000 footbridge across the River Aire from the city centre to both the Tetley museum and the site where the Royal Armouries is to be housed. Unlike Glasgow, Leeds lacks cultural attractions. The Armouries and the visitor centre will be the first steps in developing a larger tourist industry to augment the city's white collar sector and increase the range of non-manual jobs.</p>

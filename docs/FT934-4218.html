			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Five-year shortfall for younger women - Retirement pensions / The Budget and You Women under the age of 38 will have to work an extra five years until the age of 65 before they can claim the state pension. The Budget confirmed the government's intention to equalise state pension ages at age 65. At present women can draw the pension at 60, whereas men have to wait until 65. The change, which does not affect the pension rights of women aged over 44, will be phased in over 10 years between 2010 and 2020. The pension age for women aged between 38 and 43 will depend on where their birthday falls. Younger women who still want to retire at age 60 may need to finance the five-year shortfall in pension benefits. Jim Roberts, pension director at Skandia Life, calculated that a 30-year-old woman would need to invest immediately a single premium of Pounds 6,250 in a personal pension or a company additional voluntary contribution scheme to achieve this. Alternatively, payments of Pounds 45 per month over the next 30 years would provide the same amount of extra pension. The state pension comprises two elements - a flat rate benefit known as the basic state pension (currently Pounds 56.10 per week for a single person and Pounds 89.80 for a married couple) and a pension linked to earnings, known as Serps (the State earnings related pension scheme). Eligibility for both pensions depends on National Insurance contributions which are paid on 'band earnings', that is earnings between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 per week for the current tax year (Pounds 57 and Pounds 430 per week in 1994/95). Changes to the way Serps is calculated, due to take effect for those retiring next century, will hit women since times of low earnings will be taken into consideration and will drag down the value of the pension. Women, who form 90 per cent of the part-time labour force, tend to spend long periods in low-paid employment to fit in with family commitments. To help offset the impact on women's pensions caused by the rise in pension age and changes to Serps, the government has said that it will improve Home Responsibility Protection (HRP) which is claimed by 'carers' (mostly women) of young children and dependent relatives. The number of years women will be able to claim HRP is to be increased from 19 to 22 while the benefit, which currently only builds up an entitlement to the basic state pension, will be extended to cover Serps. The DSS said that from 1999 onwards carers who have just 20 years of earnings on which they have paid full rate National Insurance Contributions, will be entitled to a full Serps pension. There will also be greater flexibility to defer the state pension. However, the phased reduction in the value of Serps from its original target of 25 per cent of average band earnings to 20 per cent will still go ahead after the year 2000. Most European countries have already equalised their state pensions at age 65, or have announced plans to do so. But even before the latest changes kick in, the UK provides one of the lowest pensions in the European Union. The UK pension (basic and Serps combined) is worth a third of national average earnings, compared with two thirds or more in France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Spain.</p>

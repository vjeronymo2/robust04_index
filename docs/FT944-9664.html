			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Gramm, Specter eye White House: Republicans look to 1996 presidential election after last week's congressional victory Leading Republicans have barely savoured the triumph of last week's crushing victory in the US congressional elections before setting their sights on the presidential election in 1996. Small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first states to hold ballots in the 1996 primaries, have been crowded over the last three days with hopeful Republican candidates, as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania formally threw their hats into the ring for their party's presidential nomination. It came as no surprise that Mr Gramm, an abrasively conservative economics professor, should announce that he was filing papers this week with the Federal Election Commission to put the legal structure in place for a campaign. Mr Gramm has made no secret of his plans, and clearly wishes to capitalise on last week's election success, for which, as chairman of the Republican senate campaign committee, he can claim at least partial credit. But Mr Specter's announcement that he is 'exploring' a candidacy is seen as a more quixotic venture - and perhaps a sign that the Republicans' prospects are not so unclouded as they might appear after last week's triumph, which has led many in the party to conclude that President Bill Clinton is destined to follow the last Democrat in the White House as a one-term president. For a moderate such as Mr Specter to run, with minimal hopes of winning, suggests that the party could have trouble remaining united after its tilt to the right in recent years. His candidacy would resemble in some respects that of Mr Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic primaries - a bid to pull his party back towards the centre, more than a realistic quest for the nomination. In his announcement yesterday Mr Specter took aim at 'spoilers' such as Mr Pat Robertson, the conservative Christian leader, and Mr Pat Buchanan, the former Nixon speechwriter whose maverick candidacy so irked former President George Bush in 1992. 'It is important at the outset to focus on the far-right fringe,' Mr Specter said. A host of other Republican hopefuls could enter the lists. Senator Robert Dole, the acid-tongued leader of the new Senate majority, said he would make up his mind by February 15. At least six members of Mr Bush's cabinet - secretary of state James Baker, defence secretary Dick Cheney, labour secretary Lynn Martin, housing secretary Jack Kemp, vice-president Dan Quayle and education secretary Lamar Alexander - are also possible candidates. Of these, Mr Kemp started with the most public esteem but it is Mr Alexander who now appears to have the best position. A former governor of Tennessee, he is not widely known but has built a strong political network, and is likely to win wider support among the 31 Republican governors than other candidates more rooted in Washington. Iowa, which holds party caucuses in January of a presidential election year to decide who to nominate for the presidency, counted for little in 1992 because Senator Tom Harkin, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, was widely expected to sweep his home state. New Hampshire holds the first presidential primary in the country. Both states have in the past provided an important springboard for candidates to raise their national profiles and to attract money for their campaigns in the rest of the country. In 1996, however, California and New York will both hold their primaries much earlier in the process, instead of waiting to the end. Campaign managers believe, therefore, that a serious candidate will need a good organisation and at least Dollars 30m in hand by January 1996.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DRIVE TO BE AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE;  </P> <P> THE STATE MUST KEEP ITS LEAD IN POLLUTION-CONTROL  </P> <P> The California Air Resources Board is in Los Angeles today, taking one last  look at its plan to require virtually all cars sold in California by the year  2000 to run far cleaner than anything now on the road.  </P> <P> Short of some miraculous disclosure that Southern California is no longer the  nation's smog capital -- a most unlikely development -- it should plunge right  ahead.  </P> <P> Certainly nothing that Chairman Jan Sharpless and the eight other board members  heard during Thursday's public hearing argued persuasively that the state  should not -- as is its habit -- lead the nation into a new generation of  pollution-control.  </P> <P> In general, the state board's goals will support the transportation targets of  Southern California's chief smog control agency. The South Coast Air Quality  Management District is implementing the nation's strictest anti-pollution  controls in an effort to wipe the skies clean enough to meet federal  air-quality standards by early in the next century.  </P> <P> One state goal is to have every car sold in California during the model year  2003 meet what the board staff calls "ultra clean" standards. Even before 2003,  a rising percentage of them would have to reduce the key ingredients of smog  that escape from their tailpipes.  </P> <P> The two worst actors in that regard are hydrocarbons (mostly fumes of unburned  gasoline) and nitrogen oxides (a byproduct of any burning of fossil fuels).  Under the plan, the progress in cutting these deadly emissions would be steady  and impressive. For example, by 1996, one of every five new cars on the road  would have to cut hydrocarbon emissions to half of what they were just three  years earlier.  </P> <P> Meeting stricter standards will require a three-way effort. Manufacturers will  have to redesign engines. The oil industry will have to redesign formulas for  refineries that produce fuel for those engines.  </P> <P> The third effort involves the motorist. We would all have to pay more for cars  and fuels. Although nobody even wants to guess how much more, it is encouraging  to note that the board staff says that the Nissan Sentra on the road today  already meets the 1994 hydrocarbon standard. So some are ahead of the game.  </P> <P> The air board also wants somewhere between 2% and 10% of new cars built between  1998 and 2003 to spread absolutely no pollutants around. The only vehicle that  meets that description today is an electric car.  </P> <P> Again, the goal is less radical than it might have sounded 10 years ago.  Southern California Edison Co. and the L. A. Department of Water and Power  already have invested $7 million in a program to build an experimental fleet of  10,000 electric cars over the next several years.  </P> <P> Finally, the board wants higher standards and lower pollution levels for  reformulated fuel to power the cars already on the road.  </P> <P> The enterprise is neither doubt-free nor risk-free. As before, some industry  leaders ask where the new technology will come from and worry that it can't be  done. As before, California has no real choice but to try.  </P></p>

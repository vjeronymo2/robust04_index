			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Confidence in the  president, government, and parliament is stable, according to a  March poll of 885 individuals by the Institute for Public  Opinion Research (IVVM).    The poll showed 69 percent of respondents having confidence  in President Vaclav Havel, the same percentage as in December  1993 and three percent more than in January 1994. Confidence in  the government registered at 57 percent in March, up from 56 in  December and 53 in January.    Only 25 percent expressed confidence in parliament's work;  still that was up from a mere 20 percent in December and 21  percent in January.    The March poll also showed no difference in results between  Bohemia and Moravia, or between cities and the countryside.  Differences showed up between white and blue collar employees:  The former generally expressed higher levels of confidence.    The greatest differences, however, showed up in a breakdown  by respondents' political party affiliation. The greatest  confidence in the president, government, and parliament was  expressed by supporters of the (coalition) Civic Democratic  Party (ODS), with 93, 87 and 44 percent respectively. The least  confidence (23-18-2 percent) was expressed by Left Bloc (LB) and  Communist Party (KSCM) voters.    In between, 77, 77, and 25 percent of voters for the  (coalition) Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) expressed confidence  in the three institutions, while confidence dropped to 44-37-15  percent among voters for the Czech Social Democratic Party  (CSSD).</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Write-downs expected at Chemical Waste CHEMICAL Waste Management, the Illinois-based handler of hazardous waste, is expected this month to announce a restructuring aimed at cutting costs and writing down the values of its underperforming toxic waste incinerators. WMX Technologies (formerly Waste Management), which has a 77 per cent stake in Chemical Waste, earlier this year warned that declines in US government-directed environmental clean-ups were trimming income at the unit and would lead to lower-than-expected earnings in the second quarter. In June, Chemical Waste reported second-quarter profits down to Dollars 22.6m, or 11 cents a share, from Dollars 52.4m, or 26 cents, a year earlier. Analysts say the write-downs may total Dollars 200m, and that restructuring and job losses could trim another Dollars 50m annually in operating expenses. In July, Chemical Waste said it was studying its disposal facilities, and the company this week declined further comment, other than to confirm the review was continuing. Analysts expect the writedowns to be recorded as charges to third-quarter earnings, which will be reported in October. Chemical Waste was a darling of Wall Street as recently as 1991, but is suffering from shrinking demand for its services. The company's share price has fallen from a high of around Dollars 26 in 1991 to a recent low of Dollars 7 3/8 . In New York yesterday, the stock closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 8 1/2 . In June the company said its earnings had plummeted to Dollars 43.8m in the first half, from Dollars 82.3m in the same 1992 period, and that during the period its core businesses had barely broken even. The results dragged WMX's earnings down by about 7 per cent. In August, Chemical Waste's directors voted to suspend Chemical Waste's 20-cent per share dividend, citing 'uncertain market conditions'. The reversal follows a fundamental change in corporate thinking about waste generation. US companies, conscious of high off-site disposal costs and environmental and legal liabilities, are sharply reducing their outputs of hazardous waste - for example, through recycling and conservation. At the same time, clean-ups mandated by the US government's Superfund programme, designed to restore contaminated land, are far fewer than projected, and the Environmental Protection Agency, some sources say, has been slow in issuing expected new definitions of hazardous waste streams. The giant incinerators built to burn toxic wastes have been hardest hit by the trends. Chemical Waste said last week it had abandoned plans, begun in 1987, to build an incinerator in Kettleman Hills, California, where it already operates a hazardous waste landfill. The company also said that existing incinerator capacity was adequate to meet the disposal needs of the western US. The US chemical company Du Pont last month halted plans to build an Dollars 100m incinerator, and other waste handling companies have reported declining volumes. In California, which has a law that encourages companies to reduce incinerable wastes, volumes fell 30 per cent between 1987 and 1990, and continue to decline at a rate of about 10 per cent per year, Chemical Waste says. Across the US, some of the biggest hazardous waste producers have reported waste reductions of 50 per cent or more. As a result, incinerator operators have had to slash prices to attract volume, and margins for all companies have fallen. Chemical's operating margins dropped to 4 per cent in the second quarter, from 25.3 per cent a year ago. Chemical Waste's core businesses are landfilling and incinerating hazardous wastes, which are hauled to its own operations from corporate and municipal sites. It also engages in 'special' clean-up projects, and through its partially-owned subsidiary, Rust International, performs environmental consulting. Mr Vishnu Swarup, senior pollution control analyst for Prudential Securities, believes Chemical Waste's asset writedowns will focus heavily on its three incinerators. Its incinerator at Port Arthur, Texas, underperformed in the first half, and its plant on the south side of Chicago remains out of commission after an explosion two years ago. In addition to the incinerators, Chemical Waste operates seven hazardous waste landfills around the US and employs about 5,000 in North America. Mr James McDonald, securities analyst with the Chicago Corporation, says demand for Chemical's services is likely to remain weak until the government's Superfund programme is reauthorised (legislation is expected in 1994) and hazardous waste standards are more clearly defined.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagano, April 21 KYODO -- Although Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata is likely to become the first prime minister from  Nagano Prefecture, officials of the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympic  Games Organizing Committee (NAOC) are not necessarily happy  about his taking the nation's helm at this juncture.    If Hata, who heads Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  powerhouse of the seven-party ruling coalition, succeeds  departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his term is expected  to be short given the current unstable political situation,  according to political sources.    "We hope Hata will be nominated for the premiership because  that would be a great help toward the Olympics," said an  official who requested anonymity. "But we are afraid he would  not be able to keep his position until the year of the games,"  he said.    The 58-year-old Hata hails from Ueda in the central Japan  prefecture.</p>

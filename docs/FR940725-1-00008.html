			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> B. Netting and Current Risk-Based Capital Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC and the Basle Supervisors' Committee have long recognized the importance and encouraged the use of netting arrangements as a means of improving interbank efficiency and reducing counterparty credit exposure. Netting arrangements are increasingly being used by institutions engaging in rate contracts. Often referred to as master netting contracts, these arrangements typically provide for both payment and close-out netting. Payment netting provisions permit an institution to make payments to a counterparty on a net basis by offsetting payments it is obligated to make with payments it is entitled to receive and, thus, to reduce its costs arising out of payment settlements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Close-out netting provisions permit the netting of credit exposures if a counterparty defaults or upon the occurrence of another event such as insolvency or bankruptcy. If such an event occurs, all outstanding contracts subject to the close-out provisions are terminated and accelerated, and their market values are determined. The positive and negative market values are then netted, or set off, against each other to arrive at a single net exposure to be paid by one party to the other upon final resolution of the default or other event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for close-out netting provisions to reduce counterparty credit risk, by limiting an institution's obligation to the net credit exposure, depends upon the legal enforceability of the netting contract, particularly in insolvency or bankruptcy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this regard, the Basle Accord noted that while close-out netting could reduce credit risk exposure associated with rate contracts, the legal status of close-out netting in many of the G&hyph;10 countries was uncertain and insufficiently developed to support a reduced capital charge for such contracts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There was particular concern that a bank's credit exposure to a counterparty was not reduced if liquidators of a failed counterparty might assert the right to ``cherry-pick,'' that is, demand performance on those contracts that are favorable and reject contracts that are unfavorable to the defaulting party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The primary criterion for determining whether a particular netting contract should be recognized in the risk-based capital framework is the enforceability of that netting contract in insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, the netting contract as well as the individual contracts subject to the netting contract must be legally valid and enforceable under non-insolvency or non-bankruptcy law, as is the case with all contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> While payment netting provisions can reduce costs and the credit risk arising out of daily settlements with a counterparty, such provisions are not relevant to the risk-based capital framework since they do not in any way affect the counterparty's gross obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concern over ``cherry-picking'' led the Basle Supervisors' Committee to limit the recognition of netting in the Basle Accord. The only type of netting that was considered to genuinely reduce counterparty credit risk at the time the Accord was endorsed was netting accomplished by novation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under legally enforceable netting by novation, ``cherry-picking'' cannot occur and, thus, counterparty risk is genuinely reduced. The Accord stated that the Basle Supervisors' Committee would continue to monitor and assess the effectiveness of other forms of netting to determine if close-out netting provisions could be recognized for risk-based capital purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Netting by novation is accomplished under a written bilateral contract providing that any obligation to deliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date. The previously existing contracts are extinguished and a new contract, for the single net amount, is legally substituted for the amalgamated gross obligations. Parties to the novation contract, in effect, offset their obligations to make payments on individual transactions subject to the novation contract with their right to receive payments on other transactions subject to the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC's risk-based capital standards provide for the same treatment of rate contracts as the Basle Accord, but require that banks use the current exposure method. The FDIC, in adopting its standards, generally stated it would work with the Basle Supervisors' Committee in its continuing efforts with regard to the recognition of netting provisions for capital purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Gardening: Chelsea, where small is beautiful - From passion flowers to plastic rocks and beyond, Robin Lane Fox sums up the lessons of the show ENOUGH of the millionaires: what do keen gardeners find they have gained from the Chelsea flower show apart from sore feet? Every year, I use it to build my yearly collection of catalogues from nurseries. I have never ordered a plant on the spot but I have noted, questioned and admired. I have tried to avoid most of the statuary and the outdoor gardens. This year, my enthusiasms began with passion flowers and ended with polystyrene rock. Between the passion and the plastic, there was enough to keep me gardening all year. The passion flowers were symptomatic of a new development and Chelsea's most useful effect. Inside the tent, the holders of the National Collection staged the finest exhibit of this family ever seen in Britain (these national collections are the new life blood of Chelsea and allow us to raise our sights by seeing so much more in families where most of us know only two or three forms). The credit goes to John Vanderplank at Lampley Road, Kingston Seymour, Avon BS21 6X5. His glasshouses will receive visitors from Mondays to Saturdays and his mailing lists of passion flowers range from Pounds 5-10 a plant, including postage. To my amazement, he lists more than 140 varieties, ranging from white to scarlet; even so, he is missing more than half the known passion flowers in the world. There are no hardy surprises, but the half-hardy forms deserve close attention from owners of stylish conservatories or frost-free gardens abroad. Passion flowers will sometimes make big tangles of leaves or bear flowers in preposterous shapes and colours, but there are varieties which Chelsea has propelled high on my list for half-hardy cultivation. This particular National Collection began in 1985 and is maintained by funds from the nursery's sales. The collections are the idea of the conservation movement and now number more than 500 throughout the UK. Their holders have this increasing ability to change our ideas about possible choices in well-known families, and the Royal Horticultural Society is right to give them exhibiting space. In the past three years, my knowledge of anything from Japanese anemones to mahonias has been deepened by such collections on show. At Chelsea, I was pleased to pass from the passion flowers to the erodiums, those charming relations of the wild geraniums. They are superb plants for carpets or edgings in dry, stony soils and I have been enjoying their long-flowering season for more than 30 years. Suddenly, they are becoming fashionable, although their names and hardiness are still chaotic in the trade. The National Collection belongs to a Dr Addyman but the exhibit at Chelsea was staged by RV Roger of Pickering in North Yorkshire, a fine nursery which houses the doctor's stock and knows what a cold winter means. The other great gain at recent Chelseas has been the staging and colour sense of the smaller nurseries. I cannot imagine why Hopleys was denied a gold medal in its anniversary year (although I was surprised to hear comments from the jury that Hopleys' arrangement of colour was not above criticism). It showed a spectacular pink form of Cestrum elegans which would excel even a passion flower in a conservatory. For outdoors, it also had the dark Astrantia Hadspen Blood which has flowers of such a rich, red colour; but its master stroke was a perfect plant of the yellow-flowered wild paeony from the Caucasus, the flowers of which drop within days of opening. Among other smaller nurseries, I left with my first-ever list from the Bluebell at Blackfordby, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, which is particularly strong on good shrubs and trees. It shows and sells the variegated sweet chestnut for only Pounds 18.95 and also lists a new garrya with wine-cloured catkins (Pounds 9.95) and the pterostyrax (Pounds 12.95), which is one of my particular favourites among easy trees with scented flowers. Without the impetus of Chelsea, these small suppliers would go unnoticed. Like the collections, the specialist exhibitors help to raise our standards. For years, I muddled on with ordinary sweet peas and the conventional lupins which we can all grow from a seed packet. I owe to Chelsea my awareness that the ordinary varieties are no longer good enough and that the best are in a different class. The best sweet peas come from the celebrated Brackley family, from which I buy young plants directly off the nursery at Wingrave, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in mid-spring. Its new white Ann Gregg is a wonderful foil for the dark shades of Balmoral, proving that new peas can still be sweet and scented. The judges agreed on the usual gold medal, as they also agreed over the Woodfield brothers' lupins. Here, too, their breeding has changed my notion of the family. Their varieties are best bought as young plants from the nursery just south of Stratford-on-Avon and, if you keep off the greenfly, these new hybrids light up an entire border, out-classing the weary old Russell forms. Perhaps you would rather have a cave or cliff of monumental rock. I have coveted one secretly for years, hollowed into a grotto and available with an optional hermit. The trouble is that transport and siting of huge rocks is beyond all but the most extravagent pockets, although their boldness could do wonders for gardens in rock-free towns. This year, a new age of rock has dawned on me. 'It is better than real - it is super-real,' says its inventor, Rockscapes, of Mill Lane, Godalming, Surrey (tel. 0583-426 550). The new trick involves a backing of light polystyrene faced with a special concrete mix. Colours and roughness can be varied artfully to match huge pseudo-builders to a surrounding wall or nearby house. The sham rock is much lighter to handle and lob into position: it lasts well and will not scratch or splinter, even when waterfalls or plants are added to it. At Chelsea, the technique was used to simulate one of the vast historic gardens of rock laid out by the Pulham family. Elsewhere, Rockscapes has contrived the effect of 'large-scale picturesque' for an imaginative garden owner in Hampstead, north London. The total cost for a romantic landscape of rocky sublimity at the bottom of the garden would probably not exceed Pounds 2,000, but it would allow a natural fantasy which would transform the limits of urban life. It is a brilliant con, perpetrated in the spirit of nature. And as soon as I can think of a sufficiently awesome fragment of alpine scenery, I will - thanks to Chelsea - roll the new rock into place and surpass the greatest rock gardeners of the past.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Management: A last-ditch survival mission - How France's troubled Groupe Bull is being turned around as it prepares for privatisation General Eisenhower, then supreme Allied commander, pondered the future of Europe in this bare room near Versailles. Today it is the boardroom of Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, and Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman and chief executive, does the pondering. There has been much to think about since his appointment 10 months ago. Bull, state-owned and awash with red ink, is in crisis. Its move from a prestigious Paris address in Rue de Malakoff, first to a tower block in the city's financial district and then to this sprawl of tin-roofed sheds at Louveciennes, reflects its straitened circumstances. In the early days of Nato, the Louveciennes complex was the supreme headquarters of the Allied powers in Europe. It has been owned by Bull for years but has been unused until now. When the remaining headquarters staff have moved in, it will save about FFr500m (Pounds 61m) a year. Every franc counts. Bull, which turned over FFr28.25bn last year, has lost some FFr15bn in the past three years and has depended on continued government investment for survival. But the government's patience and that of the competition authorities in Brussels is exhausted. Bull will receive a final tranche of FFr3.1bn this year to clear its debts. Descarpentries, a controversial figure noted for his colourful management theories and his turnround skills - though they are not infallible - was appointed by Gerard Longuet, industry minister, with a mandate to prepare the company for privatisation. At the time, the mission seemed almost impossible. Bull was among the weakest of the traditional full-line computer makers, including IBM and Unisys. They were caught flat-footed by sudden changes in the computer market which promoted the growth of networked small computers at the expense of large machines. Bull and the others found themselves with declining mainframe sales, a cost structure out of line with potential revenues, and short of skill in the technologies needed to compete in the new industry. The company's situation was aggravated by two additional burdens. It had been France's computer champion for years, making the search for new investors politically sensitive. Moreover, years of state ownership had inculcated a stultifying civil service mentality which Descarpentries' predecessors, the analytical Francis Lorentz and the bluff Bernard Pache, seemed unable to counter. Descarpentries seems, however, to have made remarkable progress in a short time. In the first half of the current year losses were more than halved, from FFr1.98m to FFr843m. Now he and his senior managers are talking confidently of making an operating profit for the year as a whole. By the middle of next year, they say, the company will be into net profit. Privatisation is expected to start in November. If their predictions are correct, Bull will become much more attractive as a potential partner for other companies. Brussels, furthermore, will have to accept that the billions of French francs poured into the company in the past few years have been important to the company's restructuring. George McNeil, head of Bull Europe, says it is no mirage: 'We are a different company from six months ago. The culture has changed. Progress has become the norm.' Cynics counter that it is not difficult to transform the short-term financial results of a company in Bull's position. Staff numbers can be cut, and unprofitable operations closed or sold off. Such measures can damage a company's viability, however, making it difficult to return to growth. Critical skills are lost with people made redundant; some operations, although loss-making at the time, may prove essential to future strategy. Descarpentries says he rejected this traditional approach in favour of what he describes as a 'different' turnround technique, which puts what he calls 'tension' on every part of the company by establishing benchmarks against which progress is measured. Staff numbers continue to fall, nevertheless. There are about 29,000 today compared with 33,000 when he arrived. Comparison with other companies suggests the workforce is still too large. Descarpentries' initial analysis told him he could expect a rapid turnround. His diagnosis was that Bull had solid business strengths, loyal customers and a history of sound strategic decisions. But operations, the management structure and reporting systems were weak. He estimated that curing these faults would take 18 months. In the opposite case, where a company is sound operationally but has weak business fundamentals, turnround takes twice as long, he argues. He was encouraged by data showing that the information technology business is growing strongly - 6 or 7 per cent a year - offering rich opportunities in Europe, where computerisation has proceeded more slowly than in the US. The task, then, was to restore Bull to profitability rapidly, and then find ways for it to grow at least as fast as the industry. This includes broadening its equity base - NEC of Japan, IBM of the US and France Telecom already hold stakes - and finding more business partners for its product operations. Two more, Motorola and Tandem Computers of the US, were announced on Friday. Improving Bull's operational capability called for a complete change of management and reporting methods. Three weeks into the job, Descarpentries set about choosing the top 10 managers in Bull (from a list of 25) to form a new executive team to run the company. He chose those whose track record and performance at interview identified them as people who got things done. Many of the existing managers, he thought, placed cleverness above action: 'A lot of the top people came to me without any figures. They knew a lot; their ideas were very conceptual. I did not understand what they told me, but I am sure it was very clever. But they never told me: 'My turnover is this, my profit margin is that.' ' Those who failed to make the top 10 either left the company or settled for lower positions. A key point was that Descarpentries was choosing people, not filling positions. As he admits, at the time he did not know enough about the company to know what kind of structure was required. He reckoned, however, that if he put power in the hands of the best people, the rest would follow. Descarpentries next took his newly appointed executive board to the holiday town of St Malo in the middle of winter for three days and nights of almost continuous talks. He asked them to choose the next 100 top managers to staff the organisation. Only in the last hour of the session, however, did he tell the 10 what positions he wanted them to take in the structure - the objective being to get unbiased views of the abilities of the middle managers under discussion free from pre-emptive strikes on behalf of particular executives. Today, Bull is decentralised and streamlined. There are seven product/service divisions, four geographic networks covering the globe and three corporate functions: organisation, business development and finance. Old Bull hands say the company used to be dominated by the finance department. Today, conventional budgets have all but been scrapped and managers are measured only in terms of progress against the previous month's figures. Only 10 business criteria - revenue, headcount, profit margin and so on - are used for monthly reporting, replacing the thousands of business statistics which used to be collected. Descarpentries says: 'We have changed our financial culture completely. We measure only progress and, at the end of each six-month period, we compare ourselves to the best in the field.' All of this was put in place between November 10 and 13 last year. There is strong pressure to reduce non-salary costs: the move to Louveciennes is an example. In the first half of this year, these costs fell by Dollars 108m (Pounds 70m), which Descarpentries regards as a good start. Salaries and benefits are similarly under pressure, with some salaries frozen. Revenues rose an encouraging 12 per cent at the half-way stage, suggesting Descarpentries is on the right track. The recent history of the computer industry has been full of false dawns, however, and it will take several sets of good results before the sceptics will be convinced that the change is permanent. When asked if Bull's recovery looks real, a senior manager for one of its European rivals shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps, his gesture said, but hopes have been dashed before and this is a fickle business.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER SHOOTS MAN WHO POLICE SAY HAD GUN;  </P> <P> LA COLONIA: THE 60-YEAR-OLD IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. RELATIVES SAY HE WAS  DRINKING AT HOME BUT WAS NOT ARMED WHEN HE WENT OUTSIDE.  </P> <P> A 60-year-old Oxnard man standing in the bushes outside his La Colonia house  was shot three times after aiming a gun at a police officer, Oxnard police said  Friday.  </P> <P> Police shot Ubertino O. Ayala in the arm, chest and leg as a horrified family  member watched. Although police say they recovered a gun at the scene, Ayala's  family contends that he was unarmed.  </P> <P> Ayala was reported in critical condition at St. John's Regional Medical Center  on Friday evening after surgery, a nursing supervisor said.  </P> <P> According to a statement by the Oxnard Police Department, the shooting is being  investigated by the department and by the Ventura County district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Sgt. John Crombach, who was on duty Thursday night, said five police officers  responded after receiving a report on the 911 emergency line about 9:45 p.m.  from an unidentified woman about a man with a weapon.  </P> <P> When police arrived at Ayala's house in the 100 block of Featherstone Street,  Ayala pulled a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Officer Ken Dellinger,  police said. Dellinger warned Ayala in English, "Police! Drop the gun!" but  Ayala walked toward the officer, police said. Dellinger then fired his weapon  at Ayala.  </P> <P> Police refused to elaborate further on the statement and deferred all other  questions to the investigating officials, who were not available Friday.  Crombach said investigators may examine the tape of the 911 call.  </P> <P> According to family members, Ayala, who was slightly drunk after a Thanksgiving  Day celebration with his family, retreated to a corner of his front yard to  urinate behind a bush when he was surprised by the officer.  </P> <P> Ayala, who speaks only Spanish, could not have understood the officer, said  Ramon Ayala, Ubertino Ayala's 30-year-old son.  </P> <P> "He doesn't speak a word of English," he said.  </P> <P> It was the second time in two months that Oxnard police have been involved in a  shooting in the mostly Spanish-speaking La Colonia neighborhood. On Oct. 6,  Oxnard police officers shot and killed a man who had reportedly made threats  against a family.  </P> <P> Heliodoro Rodriguez Montero, 47, was shot by officers after he pointed a gun at  police at least three times, police said. Three officers, who were placed on  leave while the shooting was investigated, have been cleared and have returned  to duty, Crombach said.  </P> <P> Police officials also placed Dellinger on administrative leave.  </P> <P> Crombach described the 50-year-old Dellinger as a veteran officer "with a broad  base of experience," including nearly 20 years on the Oxnard force.  </P> <P> "If Officer Dellinger fired that weapon in self-defense, he certainly felt like  he was being threatened," Crombach said. He acknowledged that communication "is  an inherent problem where you're dealing with an ethnic group with language  barriers."  </P> <P> The shooting triggered an angry response from other family members and several  neighbors who said they knew Ayala as a quiet man who had never had problems  with police.  </P> <P> Ayala's wife, Alicia, said her husband had been drinking and was still slightly  drunk at the time of the shooting. She and her daughter, Celia Zavala, denied  contacting police.  </P> <P> One family member who saw the shooting said police also threatened to shoot  him, even though he was unarmed.  </P> <P> Carlos Zavala, Ayala's son-in-law, said he was at Ayala's house to seek advice  regarding a recent marital separation with Ayala's daughter. He said they had  been talking outside when Ayala excused himself to go to the bathroom and began  walking behind a large bush.  </P> <P> Ayala had just rounded a corner of the house when a police officer appeared on  the other side of a wire fence and began to fire, Zavala said.  </P> <P> Zavala, who said he did not hear any warnings by the officer, said he was  frightened by the gunfire and ran to hide, but the same police officer who shot  Ayala approached him and yelled at Zavala to disarm himself. During the whole  incident, Ayala had nothing in his hands, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he didn't have a pistol in his hands," said Zavala, 30. "They were  about to shoot at me because I had my hand hidden in my shirt." Zavala said he  was unarmed, but his injured right wrist is wrapped in a bulky brace.  </P> <P> On Friday, about 15 family members gathered outside Ayala's hospital room where  he lay unconscious after undergoing six hours of surgery. Some sat in a nearby  waiting room, saying the shooting was unjust.  </P> <P> Jose Ayala, 40, said his father was employed at a mushroom farm and had lived  in California for decades. He said family members are considering legal action  against the Oxnard Police Department.  </P> <P> "We didn't know a thing like this could happen," Jose Ayala said. "We don't  even know why the police were there."  </P> <P> Jose Villasenor, 67, Ayala's next-door neighbor, said he was watching  television when he heard four or five shots outside. When he stepped out to see  what was going on, he found the neighborhood ringed with police officers.  </P> <P> Villasenor, who has lived next to Ayala for 16 years, said he was surprised  that his next-door neighbor had been shot.  </P> <P> "He's a quiet guy. The police have never been to his house," Villasenor said.  "He's never bothered anyone."  </P></p>

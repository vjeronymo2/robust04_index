			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Thai law enforcers should start looking into the  allegations of drug trafficking made against Chat Thai MP  Thanong Siriprichapong, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said  yesterday.    Information provided by US authorities linking Thanong to a  conspiracy to smuggle 45 tones of marijuana into the United  States from 1973-87 constituted grounds for an investigation, he  said.    "With or without US urging, it is the duty of Thai law  eforcement officials to take action. Police have a duty to  investigate alleged wrongdoers -- no matter who they are," the  prime minister said. "In the case in question, there are  adequate grounds for investigation."    House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday said a Chat Thai  urgency  motion asking the House of Representatives to consider taking  action against Thanong had been put on the agenda.    The motion was item 14 on the agenda, but could be brought  forward if MPs wished.    Submitted by Chamnong Phothisaro (Chat Thai-Sisaket), it  asks  the House of Representatives to decide what to do about the  Nakhon Phanom MP, charging that the allegations against him have  affected the credibility of the House.

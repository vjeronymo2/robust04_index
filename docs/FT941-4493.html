			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Forces join S Africa 'homeland' revolt Confusion reigned in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana yesterday as hundreds of police and soldiers revolted against the government along with thousands of looting protesters, celebrating what they believed was the overthrow of President Lucas Mangope. Early this morning, however, there were reports that soldiers loyal to President Mangope had opened fire on protesters in the capital Mmabatho and the town of Mafikeng as troops of the nominally-independent homeland tried to restore order. The president's whereabouts were not known, but there were persistent reports he had fled by helicopter. It was unclear however whether he had left the homeland or was attempting to regroup his forces from his home village. Armed right-wing whites sympathetic to Mr Mangope, who had vowed to keep the homeland independent of a new black South Africa, were reported to be gathering outside the towns, some driving into the capital on what appeared to be military scouting missions. The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi group that has vowed to fight against black rule in South Africa, had said it would send its members to Bophuthatswana to help stave off an African National Congress-led coup in the run up to next month's general election. Mr Mangope is an adamant foe of the ANC and had refused to let Bophuthatswana participate in the April 26-28 poll, which the ANC is expected to win easily. His demise would be a substantial victory for the ANC. South Africa's 'ambassador' in Mmabatho, Tjaart Van der Walt, said last night Mr Mangope had told him he was going to his country residence outside the city. South African officials said Mr Van der Walt had assured them Mr Mangope would be able to regain control, although early this morning this seemed highly uncertain. The violent protests started four days ago when demonstrators demanded the homeland be reincorporated into South Africa and take part in the country's first all-race elections. With a population of slightly more than 2m it is one of 10 black homelands created by Pretoria under its discredited apartheid policy. 'We are free, at last]' shouted one demonstrator outside the campus of the University of Bophuthatswana yesterday. Other protesters waving ANC flags clambered on to police armoured vehicles to embrace those who only moments before had shot volleys of teargas and rubber bullets into the campus. Soldiers and police stood by as thousands of protesters looted and set light to a large shopping complex in the capital Mmabatho, which demonstrators said was owned by a company in which the president held shares. Gunfire filled the streets of the capital and looting went on for several hours, with demonstrators carrying out furniture, computer equipment, kitchenware, televisions and clothing. There were jubilant scenes as police laid down their arms and invited 'comrades' - young ANC students - to climb on to police and army vehicles, including a water cannon which had been used against students. Police and students went to the South African embassy to deliver a petition entitled 'police for peace', addressed to Mr Mangope and demanding that he stop using the police as a political force.

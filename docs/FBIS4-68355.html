			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Text of "Appeal to the President of Russia, B. N. Yeltsin, </F> on Questions of Local Self-Government"]    [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich!    In the last 3-4 months, the heads of administrations of such  major Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok, and Nizhniy  Novgorod have been released from the posts they occupied.    The circumstances of the dismissal were varied, but  everywhere they took place under pressure of the governors of  the oblasts. The standard set of accusations was made against  almost every one: attacks on the oblast administration, the  collapse of Russian statehood, ties with opponents of the  reforms, corruption, repeated flagrant violations of work  duties, and so forth. The same situation is now taking shape in  a number of other cities.    We are very worried that honest, decent people who are truly  supporting the interests of their cities and vigorously  defending the rights of local self-government established by the  Constitution of Russia and guaranteed by your edicts are leaving  the job. Objective examination of the work of the heads of  administrations of the cities did not precede the dismissals and  they did not receive written explanations, and the grounds for  removal were not considered by any commissions, while some were  refused the right to meet personally with the president of  Russia, which your edicts stipulate directly.    Today most of the governors are doing everything possible to  subjugate local self-government to themselves, which directly  contradicts Article 12 and Chapter 8 of the Constitution of  Russia. Those who oppose this are as a result either dismissed  or they resign themselves. One gets the impression that local  self-government is a fiction and the federal authorities do not  need it, although we are certain that local self-government is  objectively an ally of the president of Russia and the central  authorities in the political and economic reform of our country  and in the defense of public interests.    We propose the following to you:    1. Put local self-government under your protection and  supervision.    2. Meet with representatives of unions and associations of  the cities of Russia.    3. Speed up the development of normative enactments to  demarcate the jurisdictions of the organs of state power of the  subjects of the Federation and local self-government.    4. When heads of administrations are released from their  posts, set elections of the heads of local self-government on an  alternative basis.    5. At the petition of heads of administrations who have  been released from their posts, conduct reviews and publish  their results.    Accepted at the meeting of the Union of Cities of the  Northwest of Russia on 9 April 1994, city of Kirov.</p>

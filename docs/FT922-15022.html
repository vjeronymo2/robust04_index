			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup revived as rentals move into black DAWSONGROUP, the com-mercial vehicle sales and hire and fleet truck rentals concern, staged a recovery in the 12 months to December 31 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m replacing a loss of Pounds 392,000. Turnover was down from Pounds 48.3m to Pounds 43.7m, reflecting the closure of Dawsoncar during the first half of 1991; turnover on continuing activities was virtually unchanged. Mr Peter Dawson, chairman, said the trading result represented a respectable achievement in demanding circumstances. Businesses had been loath to invest or enter into long-term commitments and that had resulted in a fall of 23 per cent in new commercial vehicle sales and in poor demand for contract hire. However, the rentals division virtually reversed its 1990 loss of Pounds 993,000 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 982,000. A 24 per cent cut in net interest costs from Pounds 6.72m to Pounds 5.13m and increased rental margins had been factors in the performance. Mr Dawson said that there were some signs that the short term hire fleet utilisation was continuing to improve. Earnings per share were 2.7p (losses of 1.1p. The dividend is unchanged at 1.5p.</p>

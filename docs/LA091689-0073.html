			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS PLAN FOR SALES TAX INCREASE FOR NEW JAILS  </P> <P> Despite warnings that it could hurt ethnic neighborhoods, the state Senate on  Friday passed a controversial measure allowing Los Angeles and five other  financially strapped counties to ask their voters for a half-cent sales tax  hike to pay for new jails.  </P> <P> The bill, by Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), was approved 23 to 11 and then  returned to the Assembly for approval of Senate amendments.  </P> <P> Besides Los Angeles, the measure affects Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino,  Riverside and Humboldt counties.  </P> <P> The proposal prompted emotional debate and parliamentary bickering reminiscent  of the acrimonious fight two years ago to keep a planned state prison out of  East Los Angeles. Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) claimed that without a  special prohibition, the measure will be used by Los Angeles County officials  to add 2,408 more prison beds in the already jail-glutted Chinese and Latino  neighborhoods of his district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critics' Arguments  </P> <P> "Where will they build these jails?" Torres asked. "Right in East LA. Right in  downtown Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Critics have also complained for months that the sales tax increases, which  require only a simple majority of voters in each county to approve, are nothing  but illegal end-runs around Proposition 13 restrictions that call for a  two-thirds majority. A similar sales tax hike, approved by San Diego County  voters in 1988, was held unconstitutional by a Riverside Superior Court judge  in May.  </P> <P> One of the jail tax measure's chief advocates, Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport  Beach), warned Friday that the half-cent increases are desperately needed to  maintain "law and order."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Don't Have a Place'  </P> <P> "We cannot continue to enact laws with mandatory incarceration only to turn  people loose because we don't have a place to put them," she argued.  </P> <P> For Los Angeles alone, the half-cent hike would translate into $388 million  annually for the county, which voted Aug. 29 to expand the men's detention  facility by 2,408 beds. The change would expand capacity to 9,000 beds in a  facility where prisoners are forced to sleep on the floor and even in the  chapel.  </P> <P> Orange County stands to gain $126 million annually from the increase. In  anticipation, county supervisors have approved the construction of a  $700-million central jail near Anaheim Hills.  </P></p>

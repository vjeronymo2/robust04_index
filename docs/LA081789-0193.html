			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WALESA TO FORM EAST BLOC'S 1ST NON-COMMUNIST REGIME;  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY'S EDITOR SEEN AS PREMIER  </P> <P> President Wojciech Jaruzelski agreed today to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa's  plan for a coalition government of Solidarity and two minor political parties  that would make Poland the first Soviet Bloc nation not led by Communists.  </P> <P> The Polish president also agreed to accept a Solidarity member as premier, a  lawmaker said.  </P> <P> Walesa, the Solidarity leader, has stressed that a coalition government would  offer the ministries of defense and interior, which control the army and  internal police, to the Communist Party. This perhaps would ease Soviet fears  about a fissure in the Warsaw Pact military alliance.  </P> <P> Communist Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak, who recently said he would leave office  because he could not form a government in the face of the Solidarity-led  opposition, turned in his resignation today.  </P> <P> Solidarity lawmaker Jacek Kuron, summing up a historic two-hour meeting between  Jaruzelski and leaders of a Walesa's newly forged Parliament coalition, said  the coalition proposed to Jaruzelski three candidates for premier, none of them  Walesa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'In the Nearest Future'  </P> <P> Jaruzelski "said he will grant nomination to one of the Solidarity candidates  in the nearest future," Kuron told lawmakers.  </P> <P> The three candidates are Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek;  Tadeusz Mazowiecki, editor of the labor movement's weekly newspaper, and Kuron,  an activist in the Polish opposition for more than 20 years who has spent nine  years in prison for anti-government activities.  </P> <P> Parliamentary sources said Jaruzelski's choice would be Mazowiecki.  </P> <P> "The president accepted the proposition of Walesa" to form a coalition  government, said Jerzy Jozwiak, head of the Democratic Party, one of the two  parties that recently aligned themselves with Solidarity. He commented after  attending the meeting at which the opposition plan was presented to Jaruzelski.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski, poised to grant enormous control over Poland's destiny to the  Solidarity labor movement he crushed eight years ago, will issue a formal  statement Friday, Jozwiak said.  </P> <P> An official communique issued today said Jaruzelski "declared that he will  urgently consider the presented propositions and conduct appropriate  consultations aimed at the quickest possible appointment of such a government  in the interest of the nation."  </P> <P> The communique did not say who would lead the government, but Walesa has said  the coalition should be based on an alliance of Solidarity, the United Peasant  Party and the Democrats, with a Solidarity member as premier.  </P> <P> Walesa, mobbed by reporters as he returned to his hotel after the meeting,  looked tired and pleased and said the outcome of the meeting was "good."  </P> <P> Walesa said the nomination of the premier is "the president's matter. . . .  Let's respect the president. This matter is in his hands." Walesa said he was  "satisfied with the meeting."  </P> <P> The Soviet press agency Tass, in a report on the Polish developments, said  there is a "positive" chance that a Polish government will quickly be formed  "in which the role of the motivating force would be played by Solidarity."  </P></p>

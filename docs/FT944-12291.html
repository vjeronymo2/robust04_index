			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Guilty of dated thinking Sir, Re Matthew Batstone's article, 'Men on the supermarket shelf' (Management: Marketing and Advertising, October 27), it is not only marketers and advertising executives who are guilty of 1950s thinking. I note that Batstone describes an advertisement as 'showing a man cleaning the kitchen floor for his wife'. Is he not cleaning the floor because it is dirty? Unless he is a guest in his wife's house, it is presumably, his floor also, unless she is about to pop over to his kitchen and help out with a few chores there?

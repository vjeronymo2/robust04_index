			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Church rises 11% despite Canadian difficulties CHURCH &amp; CO, the shoe maker and retailer, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up almost 11 per cent from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.9m for 1992. The improvement comes against a background of 'exceptionally difficult trading conditions', particularly in Canada, the company said. There, turnover increased by 11 per cent while operating losses grew to Pounds 455,000 (Pounds 54,000). Mr John Church, chairman, said: 'The devaluation of sterling will help us because we are so heavily involved in the export game.' The final dividend is held at 9.5p for a maintained total of 12.5p, uncovered by earnings per share of 12p (11.6p). Group turnover increased 5.5 per cent to Pounds 68.9m (Pounds 65.2m) and operating profits were little changed at Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 3.17m). Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.09m. The group said it was pleased with the performance of its UK retail and manufacturing operations. Margins rose to 7.5 per cent (6.2 per cent) and turnover advanced to Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 48.3m). US losses rose to Pounds 88,000 (Pounds 15,000). A Jones &amp; Sons, Church's wholly-owned subsidiary, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 290,000). Turnover increased to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 28.7m). The dividend is again 34.1p, from earnings per share of 37.6p (27.3p).</p>

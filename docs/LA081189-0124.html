Witnesses told investigators that they did not see  Park's brake lights go on before she hit the school van and that she was  traveling up to 40 m.p.h., Lazo said.  </P> <P> Park had told investigators that her brakes had failed when she tried to stop  after seeing the van but that she could not remember the color of the traffic  light after she was leaving Garden Grove Freeway on Monday afternoon, Lazo  said.  </P> <P> Park crashed into the side of the school bus after leaving the off-ramp on  Magnolia Street. The van, which was carrying a teacher and eight children,  overturned on impact and rammed into a truck.  </P> <P> Park and her two children, Angie, 5, and Anni, 4, were taken to UCI Medical  Center in Orange, where they were admitted.

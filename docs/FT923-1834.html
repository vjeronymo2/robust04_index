			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The ERM's future THE SMALL margin in favour of the Maastricht treaty in the French referendum should keep the ERM alive. This is not because ratification of the Maastricht treaty itself, still less smooth progress towards economic and monetary union, have become certain. It is because the French people have demonstrated, however grudgingly, that there remains a majority in favour of European co-operation. On that a two-tier ERM should be able to stand, but it will do so only if the Bundesbank shows a greater commitment to the system than it did last week. Events have confirmed that a semi-fixed exchange rate system has evident weaknesses. The nature of the frailty is also clear. The managers of a currency under severe pressure can never save it on their own. After a certain point, they will run out of reserves. Since operators in the markets know that, they are bound to win any serious battle. The durability of the hugely higher interest rates - 500 per cent overnight in the case of Sweden - that are sometimes needed to defend a frail currency lacks credibility. It is impossible to believe that the government of most countries would be able to endure the ensuing slump. What is believed will be difficult at some time in the future swiftly becomes impossible today. The credibility of the parity depends partly, therefore, on the will of the authorities responsible for the weaker currency to defend it and on the credibility of their commitment to impose whatever interest rates may be required for as long as proves necessary. But the parity depends rather more on the perceived willingness of those responsible for the stronger currency to defend the parity as well. The governments of Italy and the UK failed all these tests. But France - in addition to the other core ERM countries, which includes at least the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg - need not. Nevertheless, the narrowness of the French vote, in addition to the dwindling likelihood of Emu, is bound to shake the market's previous faith in the determination of this and future French governments to defend the parity. The economic conflicts within Europe consequent upon German unification also continue. The ERM may now be more secure than feared last week. But it is far from secure. It now rests overwhelmingly on the Germans to remove these doubts. Should the Bundesbank, fresh from its victories over the Italians and the British, demonstrate that it is absolutely committed to maintaining the present parity for the French franc, regardless of the short-term effect on the German money supply, then that parity will stand. The Bundesbank can never run out of D-Marks, since it is the ultimate producer of that particular piece of paper. If it is not so committed, then no parity can be secure under the pressure that currency markets are now able to exert. This is not just an economic issue, however technocratically the Bundesbank might like to address the matter. It is a political one. Emu or no Emu, Maastricht or no Maastricht, Germany needs friends. The Bundesbank should be more than content with the victories that its determination and events have now delivered. It has obtained the D-Mark appreciation it sought and from that will come some of the disinflation that it has long desired. The principle that the ERM is a system of adjustable exchange rates has been re-established. The Bundesbank is also in an excellent position to resist the imposition of Emu by a German government that has been seriously weakened by its past policy errors. In addition, the EMS has been definitively established in two tiers, with little prospect that the frailer brethren will be allowed to join Emu, should it occur. Enough is enough. France has at least not rejected the alliance with Germany. The Bundesbank would be well advised to rest on its laurels and return the favour.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Antiques amid the cactus hatstands - Lucia van der Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe clean air and visits a furniture showroom A FEW weeks ago when Zeev Aram, the one-time Israeli sailor who for the last 27 years has run London's finest modern furniture showroom, opened the doors on his latest venture - a brand-new furniture shop in Hampstead's Heath Street - Aram fans could hardly believe their eyes. There, beside the Eileen Gray sofa, Shiro Kuramata's curving chest of drawers, Gufram's cactus hatstand, were a pair of solid yew 18th century Windsor chairs, a fine 18th century oak German bureau, a Spanish solid walnut table dating from the early 18th century. For those who over the years have come to regard Zeev Aram as the high priest of modern design and his Covent Garden showroom as its temple it was something of a culture shock, rather like a teetotaller waxing on about the wonders of Claret or Mother Theresa embracing capitalism. Zeev Aram admits it is something of a new departure: 'It is the first time I have had antiques in any of my shops but I hoped that by showing how well good antiques and good modern designs work together I could encourage people to be more adventurous in their own homes.' (Good thinking if you aim to sell modern design to all those Hampstead period houses). 'So often people see modern pieces and are intrigued and interested by them but they are frightened to buy because they say it won't go with the things they already have. I wanted to show them that what really counts is quality - not age. 'Poor quality pieces, whether new or old, will look shoddy beside fine pieces but if you have fine antiques then the sort of modern pieces I sell should enhance them. Besides, it is sterile and depressing to pursue one particular style to the nth degree.' For Zeev Aram quality has always been what his shop is all about. There is many a would-be fan who has been priced out of the shop by Aram's refusal to have any truck with anything not made as finely and well as can be. Nothing he has sold has ever been cheap - though the less well-heeled design fan could go for Alvar Aalto's famous wooden stool at Pounds 56 or a Best &amp; Lloyd classic 1930s light at about Pounds 100. Aram originally meant to become an architect. When he discovered that he was endlessly specifying from the same small range of available modern classics he decided he might as well start importing a wider range himself. His first King's Road shop introduced names and designs that were then unknown in 1960s Britain - Breuer's Wassily chair, Le Corbusier's Gran Confort, Flos's fastidious lighting. The litany of classics brought to the UK by Aram is long and distinguished - from Breuer's chairs in 1964 to Vico Magistretti's latest collection for De Padova of Italy. For those who missed buying some of these when they first became available the prices make heartbreaking reading - Corbusier's chaise-longue, for instance, was about Pounds 190 in 1966 and is Pounds 1,480 today, the Breuer Wassily chair first went on sale in 1964 at Pounds 49 10s. Today it is Pounds 796 while Shiro Kuramata's irregular chest-of-drawers (above) sold for Pounds 1,800 in 1981 and is Pounds 8,500 today. Probably Aram's bravest venture was his decision to take the long-neglected designs of Eileen Gray, an Irish-born designer who worked mostly in France before the war, and to negotiate the manufacture and world-wide licensing of her furniture. He become enthused by an exhibition of her work at the Heinz Gallery. Today, because of his initiative, her furniture sells all over the world and I do not know of a sofa I would rather own than Gray's majestically simple Lota. It cannot have been easy through the years, carving a niche in what is certainly an expensive, corner of the design market but there he still is. Fashions have come, fashions have gone. Blow-up chairs and see-through sofas, folding paper tables and liquorice-coloured lumps of foam have come and gone but Aram Designs is still there, insisting on quality, quality, quality. There are some who might think that Aram's approach to interior design smacks of an over-refined austerity - but his championing of Gufram's cactus hatstand and the Capitello chair prove them wrong. Nobody could ever accuse him of shoddiness or lack of attention to detail. Today his range is wider and more eclectic than ever and his shops at Kean Street, Covent Garden, London WC2 and now at 65 Heath Street, Hampstead, London NW3 are an essential stopping-off point for anybody interested in fine modern design. Even those who cannot afford to buy should not neglect to go and look.</p>

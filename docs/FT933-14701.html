			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dirty tricks cloud the horizon - The issues raising a storm at British Airways' AGM LORD KING of Wartnaby will have a front row seat today to see Sir Colin Marshall, his successor as chairman of British Airways, defend the airline publicly against allegations of 'dirty tricks' on Virgin Atlantic Airways. In his first British Airways annual meeting as merely a VIP he will expect a spirited performance from his protege. He should not be disappointed. Sir Colin will make his account of the Virgin affair a central plank of his speech to the 1,000-plus shareholders crammed into London's Barbican Centre. But Sir Colin's task will not be made easier by some carefully planned questions from the floor. The company has received questions from more than 2,000 shareholders, one third of which relate to the Virgin affair. Although BA has already apologised to Virgin for the campaign, which involved the misuse of computer information on Virgin's passengers - and paid Pounds 600,000 to the airline - it faces further legal action in the UK and Brussels. BA's board has denied involvement in this misuse of passenger information, which was said to have been carried out by junior staff. However its position may be attacked by questions from Mr Brian Basham, who was sacked at the start of the year as public relations adviser to British Airways for his part in the dirty tricks campaign. Mr Basham has submitted four questions to be answered at the annual meeting. In a letter to Sir Colin detailing the questions, he says: 'it remains entirely implausible to me . . . that you could not have known' of the misuse of computer data. Mr Basham has sent copies of this letter to institutional investors in the airline and outlined further charges against Sir Colin. Such accusations are likely to distract from what should have been a triumphant debut for the new chairman. While almost every airline in the world has struggled against recession and overcapacity, the past year has seen BA consolidate its position as the western world's most profitable airline. Sir Colin has taken advantage of this financial strength to push ahead with a plan to create the world's first global airline. Since the last annual meeting, BA has taken a Pounds 198m stake in USAir, and paid Pounds 304m for 25 per cent of Qantas, the Australian carrier. It has bought into TAT, the French regional carrier, into Delta, a German airline, and taken over the loss-making operations of Dan-Air, the UK carrier based at London's Gatwick airport. To pay for it all, BA successfully raised Pounds 442m from its shareholders in a rights issue. On the industrial relations front, the company has overcome strikes by some of its staff with apparently little lasting damage. Sir Colin has also begun to impose his own personality on the business shaped by Lord King, who took it from a mediocre state-owned enterprise into one admired by the world's airline entrepreneurs. Since Lord King left the board in March, allowing Sir Colin to move up from chief executive, two new independent non-executive directors have been appointed. They are Baroness O'Cathain, the managing director of the Barbican Centre, and Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape. With these changes, the British Airways that Lord King constructed during his 11 years in power is beginning to change. But one feature of the company that may not be so easy to alter is the liveliness, even rowdiness, of the airline's annual meetings. Lord King thrived in those meetings, becoming known for his brusque and often witty control of questioners. The quieter Sir Colin may have cause today to search for a similar fund of stage skills.</p>

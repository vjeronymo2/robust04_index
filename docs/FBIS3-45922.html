Although this theory has  been criticized by some people, he has never changed his point  of view. During his inspection tour of the south in early 1992,  he repeatedly stressed, on different occasions, the need to  grasp the opportunity and thus increase China's comprehensive  national strength.    Why has Deng adhered so persistently to the opportunity  theory? According to sources in Beijing, this was the conclusion  Deng drew from his assessment of the world situation. After the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in late  1978, Deng Xiaoping reassessed the world situation then, and  pointed out that although the danger of another world war still  existed, forces for world peace had outgrown the forces for war,  so it was not quite possible that another world war would break  out, and it would be possible to maintain world peace for a  fairly long time to come. According to this conclusion, Deng  corrected Mao Zedong's opinion of the 1960's that another world  war was inevitable and could even break out suddenly, and put  forward a new thesis that peace and development were the two  main themes of the contemporary world. Deng Xiaoping also  adopted the national administrative guideline of focusing  efforts on economic construction on the basis of this  conclusion. In Deng's eyes, a peaceful international  environment did not come easily. The opportunity must not be  let slip, otherwise, it may not come again. So China must grasp  the opportunity and accelerate its development.    Some experts on international affairs in Beijing also agreed  that for China, whose per capita GNP is many times smaller than  the developed nations, it is indeed necessary to make good use  of the current peaceful environment to quicken economic  development. They pointed out that after the end of the Cold  War, in the global sphere, the U.S.-Soviet rivalry for world  hegemony as a factor causing the outbreak of a world war no  longer exists, the world situation is going to ease, and the  occurrence of a major war has become quite impossible. However,  in the regional sphere, the degree of turbulence has been  aggravated. According to a statistical report published by the  World Priority Office [shi jie you xian shi wu suo 0013 3954  0327 0341 0057 0523 2076] on 9 November 1993, 29 wars broke out  in the world in 1992, more than 6 million people were killed in  wars, and total global military expenditure exceeded $600  million. This indicates that the issue of peace has not been  resolved. Moreover, regional unrest in Europe remains, and an  unprecedented arms race is occurring in the Asia- Pacific  region. The world is not as stable as some people expected. On  the contrary, the situation has become more complicated. In  such circumstances, if China fails to grasp the favorable  opportunity to quicken its development, it will certainly regret  it in the future, because such historic opportunities are rare.    According to sources, Deng Xiaoping's idea of "grasping the  opportunity to accelerate development" has profound content. A  nation's rise or decline is contingent on its comprehensive  national strength (mainly its economic strength). Many  developing countries and regions have maintained sustained  economic development over 20 to 30 years. This made Deng  Xiaoping realize that "development is the last word." He said:  "What is the greatest danger China could face? In my view, it  is a situation where China fails to develop its economy, lets  the opportunity slip, and continues to lag behind other nations.  What is the greatest hope of the common people of China? In my  view, it is their demand for quickening reform and opening and  boosting the economy as quickly as possible so that they can  lead better lives." "The final solution to problems lies in  economic development." "If the economy is developed, everything  will be easy to handle." "The settlement of all issues in China  relies on economic development." Recently, he stressed again:  "In the remaining years of the 20th century, the situation will  be favorable to China, so I think that the pace of development  in the next few years should not be slow. Problems should be  solved in the course of development, and development should be  promoted through reforms. We should not be affected by the  criticisms of some foreigners. They do not want to see a  prosperous China. They are not doing well at present and are  failing to sustain their development. This is precisely an  opportunity for us." This shows that Deng's idea about  accelerating development is related to his keen intention to  compete with the developed nations by enhancing China's economy  so that China can be freed from the unfavorable position of  being subjected to pressures and constraints from other nations.    At the same time, while calling for quicker development,  Deng  did not allow people to rush headlong into disorderly action.  He stressed: "Those who are able to develop should not be  obstructed, and localities with favorable conditions should be  allowed to develop as quickly as they can. As long as attention  is paid to efficiency and quality, there is nothing worrying  about the process of developing an outwardly oriented economy."  This shows that although Deng is keen on continuously raising  the economy to a new stage in a few years, he did not call for  an unrealistic growth speed; instead, he requires that  development should be made solidly, steadily, and in a  well-coordinated way to achieve good economic efficiency. It is  wrong to think that Deng only hopes for a high rate of growth  without regard to whether the economy is overheated or whether  the people can endure it.    According to the same sources, in order to further  implement Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "development is the  last word," the top CPC leadership has decided to make concrete  arrangements by pooling their collective wisdom at the second  session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], which is  scheduled to open on 10 March. The keynote of the NPC session  will be the acceleration of reform and opening up, and the  meeting will mainly deal with the following three issues:    First, the issue of reform and development. This year is the  year of reform in China, and economic reform will make major  progress. Measures for reforming the management system in  state- owned enterprises, the banking system, the finance and  taxation system, the investment system, and the foreign trade  system, which are known as the five pillars of the socialist  market economy, will be put into practice so that better  institutional conditions for economic development will be  created. In order to prevent these reform measures from  triggering off another upsurge in inflation which goes beyond  the people's endurance, the authorities will adopt the option of  making gradual and orderly progress and effecting gradual  transition by carrying out the reform measures in phases. On the  other hand, some new ways to develop will also be found in order  to really shift economic development to a path of enhancing  economic efficiency rather than mainly relying on increasing  output value and expanding the scale of investment.    Second, the issue of maintaining political and social  stability. On this issue, the top CPC leadership reached a  consensus of opinion: "Development is the goal, reform is the  driving force, and political and social stability is the  guarantee. It is hoped that development will be made through  reforms, and the people's living standards will be improved  along with economic development. Only then will political and  social stability be maintained, and this will in turn promote  the reforms." As many reform measures will be adopted this  year, more contradictions and more unstable factors may arise.  Therefore, the authorities hold that it is necessary to  discover and resolve problems in good time without delay, and  problems must not pile up because this could trigger a major  crisis. All problems should be solved as soon as they appear.  Work teams should be dispatched to institutions and localities  where many problems exist and cannot be solved. It is necessary  to study forecasting trends and prepare to deal with possible  problems.    Third, the issue of personnel adjustments. The top CPC  leadership has reiterated the need to further streamline the  administrative structure, especially in institutions which are  overstaffed. That is to say, people who do not perform actual  duties or who are incompetent in their work will be relieved of  leading positions.    It is known that as the tasks of reform become more arduous,  some economic experts have proposed that more cadres with  knowledge of economics should be appointed to the State Council  and concerned departments, and some have even proposed that such  cadres should be selected from Shanghai, because Shanghai is  playing a more and more important role in the country as a whole  and is also a place where many talented people gather. People  will see whether the CPC leadership adopts this proposal by  observing personnel appointments at the NPC session in March.</p>

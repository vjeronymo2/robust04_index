			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (1): Frankfurt's role consolidated - Many foreign institutions have boosted their Frankfurt operations. Meanwhile, pressure for reform of the financial system is mounting Last year's decision to site the future European Central Bank in Frankfurt consolidated the city's position as one of Europe's leading financial centres. Despite this decision, few German bankers would dare suggest today that the Frankfurt Finanzplatz will grow in stature to the point where it will become the financial centre for Europe, knocking London off the pedestal which it has traditionally occupied. 'It isn't really a question of eclipsing London,' commented Mr Herbert Jacobi, chief executive of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf-based bank owned by Midland Bank of the UK. 'In the long term, the likelihood is that we will have two strong financial centres for Europe.' Even this prognosis would have sounded hopelessly optimistic a few years ago when the German financial markets were renowned for being small, overregulated and hostile to innovation. 'New ideas would travel their way slowly from Wall Street to the city of London and then across to Amsterdam and Luxembourg before they would finally filter into the German market,' observes one banker. Relative to Germany's standing as Europe's leading industrial power, the country's financial system seemed unsophisticated and underdeveloped. Outsiders gleaned the impression that the big commercial banks, which dominate the German financial markets, were content to leave it this way. The strength of the D-Mark and of the economy were matched by a robust banking sector, quashing any latent calls for reform. 'But there is a growing awareness that if the German financial system wants to become a major player in world markets - to compete effectively in debt and equity markets - it has to adopt international standards on a variety of issues, ranging from rules on insider trading to increased transparency for shareholders,' said the chief executive of the Frankfurt arm of a US investment bank. 'Up until recently I got the distict impression that these sort of things were not taken at all seriously in Germany.' The pressure for reform of the Finanzplatz - embracing the regulatory environment, the structure of the financial markets as well as relations between company management and shareholders - has come from a number of different directions. The factors include: The shock induced by the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based industrial group which came to the brink of bankruptcy in January, has been amplified by the failure of the Jurgen Schneider property group in April this year. In both cases the companies had close relationships with Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. While the Schneider case raised questions about Deutsche's lending procedures, the Metallgesellschaft debacle raised questions about the system of 'corporate governance' prevailing in Germany. Metallgesellschaft is owned by some of the most reputable companies in Germany, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Allianz insurance group and Daimler-Benz. Their representatives sat on Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, formally entrusted with the supervision of management, but they signally failed to see the crisis coming. While German bankers say that what happened at Metallgesellschaft pales into insignicance compared to abundant scandals in the UK and the US since the late 1980s, the affair raised questions about Germany's two-tier board system and the cross-holdings between big German companies, provoking calls for greater transparency in company affairs in order to protect the interests of shareholders at large. A second factor is the German recession combined with the costs of reunifying eastern and western Germany. The government is running a large budget deficit which it intends to eliminate in part via privatisations. Bonn officials recognise that steps must be taken to improve German financial markets in order to ensure that the coming sale of stakes in Lufthansa and Deutsche Telekom can be effected smoothly and at the best price. Germany's equity markets are underdeveloped by international standards: only 6 per cent of German households own shares, compared to more than 20 per cent in the UK and the US. The market capitalisation of German shares equated to about 30 per cent of Germany's GNP at the end of last year, compared to more than 60 per cent in the US and Japan and more than 100 per cent in the UK. There are only 665 listed companies in Germany, compared to more than 2000 in the UK alone. In Germany there have been approximately 200 new issues in the past decade, compared to 180 in the UK last year alone. Germany is now a net importer of capital, rather than an exporter. It imported DM186.5bn of long-term funds last year. As yet, this has had little direct impact on the corporate sector, where companies are relatively liquid and deferring important investment decisions until the upturn in Germany is established. But German companies will have to turn to foreign investors for finance when the upturn is under way, forcing them to adapt themselves to the needs of fund managers in the US, the UK and Asia, who will demand greater financial information than German corporates are ready to disclose. The clearest example of what is likely to develop into a trend is Daimler-Benz's move to obtain a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange last autumn, a precursor to a big rights issue scheduled for later this year. International investors already exert growing influence as owners of German shares. In 1990 - the last time the Bundesbank prepared statistics - they owned 14 per cent of the market. This is almost half the 'free-float' in the shares of Germany's tightly held quoted companies. International competition in the securities markets. London's telephone-based Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System succeeded in gaining significant market share in the turnover of leading German equities. Data on this is imprecise, but Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, said recently that London had a 10 per cent share of trading in Germany's leading shares - a market share which Seifert denounced as 10 per cent too much. Competition is nakedly evident in the battle between the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), London's futures and options exchange, and the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based equivalent. The DTB was set up in 1990 directly to counter the threat that Liffe would drag business in German government securities and related derivatives products to London. Liffe still dominates the market for the key Bund future contract with a 70 per cent market share but the DTB has challenged Liffe on other D-Mark products. In equities, Germany has become conscious that its international competitive position could be threatened by the fragmentation of liquidity between seven separate stock exchanges. The creation of the Deutsche Borse last year was designed to pool investment and technological resources between the exchanges. The government has responded to the above pressures for reform by promoting the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz, Financial Markets Promotion Act. This will make insider dealing a criminal offence and introduce a new regulatory framework for the German securities industry. For its part, the Bundesbank has gradually relaxed its opposition to financial liberation. For example, it allowed the DTB to come into being and more recently it has reduced its minimum reserves requirements - obliging banks to lodge interest-free deposits with the central bank - and relented after years of opposition to money market funds. These measures alone do not make a Finanzplatz: critics argue that the hierarchical structure of the big German banks hinders financial innovation. Moreover, Frankfurt, however convenient a place to live, does not have quite the same draw for international financial executives as London or New York. But the backwardness of the German financial markets in comparison to the size of the economy represents a powerful business argument for being in 'Mainhattan'. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Kleinwort Benson, Mees Pierson and Caisse des Depots are among the many foreign institutions which recently boosted, or have recently announced plans to boost their Frankfurt operations.</p>

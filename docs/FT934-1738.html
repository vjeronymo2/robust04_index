			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Jobless total declines in all regions again The rate at which people are joining the dole queue has slowed considerably since last year, the Department of Employment said yesterday as it revealed the eighth monthly fall in unemployment since January. Last month, after seasonal adjustments, 342,700 joined the unemployment count - compared with 392,900 in November last year - and 378,500 left it, 21,000 fewer than a year earlier. These were just two encouraging indications to emerge from last month's official jobless figures, which showed the unemployment rate falling to 10 per cent, from 10.1 per cent in October, the lowest rate for more than a year. Overall employment rose 86,000 in the third quarter, after a rise of 35,000 in the second. Some analysts cast doubt on the second-quarter figure, pointing out that it depended on a somewhat implausible 75,000 increase in the number of self-employed, a rise that exceeded any quarterly gain in the boom years of the 1980s. But the third-quarter figure looks more genuine. It includes a significant increase in service-sector employment and the first quarterly rise in male employment since the end of 1989. The department added that part-time jobs accounted for most of the increase. Two quarterly rises in manufacturing employment were reversed in the third quarter. The number of people employed in manufacturing industry fell a seasonally adjusted 27,000 in the three months to September, after a rise of 10,000 in the three months to June. In the service sector a 149,000 increase in the third quarter followed a 28,000 rise in the second. As in October, unemployment fell in all regions last month. The rate fell to 9.9 per cent in the south-east, the first time it has fallen below 10 per cent for a year. It remains highest in Northern Ireland, the north and Greater London. The Department of Employment's quarterly labour-force survey was also issued yesterday. It is a sample survey of about 60,000 households designed to capture those people who are unemployed but who do not qualify for benefit and therefore do not appear in the monthly count. This showed that the jobless total, according to the labour force survey definition, was 53,000 higher in the summer than the average monthly number of claimants in June to August. It also showed that between the spring and the summer unemployment rose a seasonally adjusted 26,000, compared with the claimant count's finding of a 14,000 fall. However, between last year's winter survey and the latest summer survey unemployment, according to the labour force survey definition, fell 67,000 while unemployment on the claimant-count measure fell 57,000. Other findings of the survey were that: 24.8m people were in employment between June and August, a fall of 0.1 per cent on the previous quarter. 3.1m people were self-employed, a 0.3 per cent rise since spring. The number of part-time workers rose for the second quarter running. The proportion of people working part-time rose from 20.8 per cent in the spring of 1984 to 24 per cent in the spring of this year. The unemployment rate remains the highest for people aged between 16 and 19.  ---------------------------------------------       UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHEST IN ULSTER  --------------------------------------------- November, seasonally adjusted  --------------------------------------------- Northern Ireland             13.8 percent North                        12.0 percent West Midlands                10.6 percent North-west                   10.4 percent Wales                        10.1 percent Yorks &amp; Humber               10.0 percent South-east                    9.9 percent Scotland                      9.3 percent South-west                    9.3 percent East Midlands                 9.2 percent East Anglia                   8.1 percent UK                           10.0 percent  --------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  ---------------------------------------------</p>

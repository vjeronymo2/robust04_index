			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SOUTHWEST TALKS OF COMBINING WITH BIG EIGHT  </P> <P> The Southwest Conference, fearful that Arkansas might leave it to join the  Southeastern Conference, held a hastily called meeting at the College Football  Association's annual meeting in Dallas and discussed expansion to 16 or 17  teams.  </P> <P> SWC officials discussed the "Big Southwest," an alliance with the Big Eight  Conference, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday.  </P> <P> A Big Eight-Southwest Conference alliance could be a lure to keep Texas and  Texas A&amp;M, if Arkansas decided to leave. The alliance would control two  bowls, the Orange and the Cotton.  </P> <P> Also at the meeting, CFA coaches called on the NFL to reschedule minicamps and  scouting combines later to preclude athletes missing class time. The CFA said  NFL scouts are no longer welcome in film rooms and facilities of the more than  60 CFA member schools until the league becomes more sensitive to the problem.  </P></p>

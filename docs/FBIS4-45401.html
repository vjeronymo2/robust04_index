			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Robi Dutta: "&pound;20m Drugs Seized in Armed </F>  Raid"]    [Text] Armed police and Customs officers seized 80 kg of  heroin, worth about &pound;20 million, in a raid on a house in  London yesterday. It was the biggest haul of heroin this year.    Witnesses said three policemen smashed the door and a window  of a two-story 1940s house in Hendon, northwest London. A  Turkish man and a Briton from Finsbury Park, north London, were  arrested. The raid, by Customs officers, police from the South  East Regional Crime Squad and armed Metropolitan officers,  followed a nine-month surveillance operation.    Customs said the quantity of the drug was unusually high but  it was not known whether it indicated a rising trend in imports.  "The suppliers usually import heroin in a fairly steady stream  of amounts between 20 and 30 kg," a spokesman said.    On Tuesday, Customs officials seized 65 kg of cannabis worth  more than &pound;200,000 from a Cypriot-registered ship, the  Akron Issos, at Hollyhead, Anglesey. The vessel  sailed from Jamaica.</p>

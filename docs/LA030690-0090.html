			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREAT AMERICAN SAYS IT WILL SEEK OUTSIDE HELP TO RAISE CAPITAL;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE ANNOUNCEMENT TRIGGERS REPORTS THAT THE S&amp;L HAS PUT ITSELF UP  FOR SALE.  </P> <P> Great American Bank, the nation's seventh-largest savings and loan, on Monday  sought outside help in raising capital to meet federal standards -- a move  widely interpreted as posting a "for sale" sign on the San Diego institution.  </P> <P> Sources close to Great American said it has already begun discussions with a  number of investors and potential acquirers, including Wells Fargo Bank.  </P> <P> Rumors also were rampant Monday of impending management changes at Great  American. President Roger Lindland denied, however, through a spokesman, that  top-level changes were in the offing.  </P> <P> Great American said in a statement that it would hire an investment banking  firm to help raise the outside capital in order to "accelerate" its plan of  complying with capital adequacy standards set forth in last summer's S&amp;L  rescue bill. Wracked by continuing losses from its problem Arizona commercial  loan portfolio, the 214-branch thrift as of Dec. 31 was deficient in all three  capital adequacy tests instituted by the bill.  </P> <P> Sources close to thrift's board said Great American is looking to raise as much  as $300 million in outside capital through a sale of stock or warrants, a sum  that would enable the S&amp;L to meet all three adequacy tests, as well as  obtain a "buffer" against possible future loan losses.  </P> <P> The yet-to-be-selected investment banking firm "will explore opportunities  relating to capital investment in Great American, which should accelerate the  compliance progress outlined in the bank's capital plan," Great American said  in a statement. But spokesman Brian Luscomb said the S&amp;L was declining  comment on whether it is offering itself for sale.  </P> <P> "This is a prudent decision that we feel is in the best interest of Great  American and its shareholders, customers and employees," said Chairman and  Chief Executive Gordon C. Luce. "We have already received a number of  unsolicited inquiries from potential investors related to Great American."  </P> <P> Gary Gordon, a stock analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said Great  American is "seriously short of capital, so they had to do something. . . .  They either had to shrink assets or do something like this." With $16.1 billion  in assets, Great American is the nation's seventh largest savings and loan.  </P> <P> Wells Fargo declined to comment on a possible acquisition of Great American.  The San Francisco-based bank is known to be interested in expanding its  Southern California retail base, but up to now has stayed away from available  savings and loans, opting instead to purchase a number of smaller community  banks.  </P> <P> Great American's announcement comes four days after it disclosed that its  deficient capital levels are soon likely to fall even lower. In an unusual  statement on Thursday, Great American said its auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche,  had decided to extend its review of problem loans in Arizona and the Southwest.  </P> <P> The audit extension came two weeks after Great American had released an  earnings statement showing fourth-quarter and full-year losses for 1989 of  $59.3 million and $123.9 million, respectively. The extended audit will likely  result in further loan-loss provisions, deeper fourth-quarter and 1989 losses  and thus a further erosion of capital.  </P> <P> Great American declined comment on when the extended audit may be completed or  how large any additional loan-loss provisions may be.  </P> <P> Great American, like other financial institutions, has had its earnings  severely affected over the past two years by losses in its Arizona commercial  loan portfolio. Last year, Great American's loan-loss provisions totaled $221  million, the "great majority" of which were attributable to Arizona.  </P> <P> Last week's announcement of the audit extension, paired with a Friday story in  the Wall Street Journal that said the Office of Thrift Supervision had rejected  Great American's capital compliance plan, sent Great American stock reeling  Friday, with shares closing down $1.625 to $3.75, a 30% one-day drop.  </P> <P> On Monday, the Office of Thrift Supervision and Great American denied the  Journal's report that the capital compliance plan had been rejected. The Office  of Thrift Supervision had simply requested further information, its deputy  district director, Eric Shand, said.  </P> <P> The stock market responded favorably to the Monday announcement as Great  American stock closed up 50 cents a share to $4.25 in New York Stock Exchange  trading.  </P> <P> According to sources, Great American is considering several financing  alternatives including an outright sale of the S&amp;L. Also being considered  is a sale of stock and warrants, giving an investor a minority equity position  now but possibly a controlling interest later.  </P> <P> The sources said the recapitalization process has been stirred up by board  member Ed Wedbush, whose firm, Wedbush Corp., owns 17% of Great American stock.  Last month, Wedbush served notice that he would seek permission from regulators  to take a more active role in management affairs and to possibly raise his  stake in the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Bates contributed to this story.  </P></p>

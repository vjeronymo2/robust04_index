			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: South Korea moves on banking corruption - A look at the government's campaign to reform and modernise the sector IT PROMISES to be a tumultuous year for South Korea's 23 commercial banks as the government prepares extensive reforms to restructure the industry. Banks have already become the first business sector to feel the full impact of the new government's anti-corruption campaign. The presidents of Korea First Bank, Bank of Seoul and BorAm Bank have been forced to resign within the past month for allegedly receiving 'commissions' in return for loans or for other questionable lending practices. Corruption is claimed to be widespread in banking. A recent survey by the Federation of Korean Industries said that 30 per cent of businessmen report that they have had to bribe bank officials to acquire loans. Banks also often require corporate borrowers to make compensating deposits in return for loans. Analysts explain, however, that the corrupt practices are a result of strict government regulations that have prevented the banks from operating efficiently. Banks demand compensating deposits for loans because most of their deposit rates are set by the government at a lower level than those offered by short-term finance companies, making it difficult for banks to attract money. The government also requires the banks to provide as much as half of their loans at below market rates to designated strategic industries. The resulting shortage of capital has encouraged the bribery of bank executives by other borrowers to obtain credit. The state's tight control reflects the prominent role the banks have played in the country's centralised planned economy during the past three decades. Banks were chiefly used to funnel money at favourable rates to industries the government considered vital for economic development. Although the country's financial industry has expanded rapidly to meet growing capital needs, banks have less autonomy than competing finance and investment companies and their management is subject to political influence. Many bank presidents are still appointed by the government, despite the privatisation of most banks in the 1980s. The new government of President Kim Young-sam believes that deregulation of the banking industry will promote more efficient allocation of credit, while reducing corruption, one of the main goals of his administration. Other senior bank executives are likely to be ousted as the government purges corrupt officials and tries to de-politicise the banking sector by encouraging the independent selection of managers. This is considered a crucial step to loosening the close ties between banks and government. More fundamental reforms were promised this week in the government's five-year economic plan. Almost all interest rates are scheduled to be deregulated by 1997. Although this will allow banks to attract more deposits by offering higher rates, it will also harm earnings by narrowing the interest rate spread, which was 2.32 per cent last year. The healthy spread guaranteed under the regulated system contributed to the 28.4 per cent rise in 1992 operating profits for commercial banks, which totaled Won2,596bn (Dollars 3.28bn). Total net profits grew by 12.9 per cent to Won931bn. Korea First had the best earnings performance with Won355bn in operating profits and Won147bn in net earnings. The pace of interest rate de-regulation and other reforms, however, is likely to be dictated by the banks' ability to solve their potentially serious bad-loan problem. Government officials worry that rapid deregulation could threaten the survival of several banks and force the state to rescue them. The banks are saddled with a large number of non-performing loans because they have been forced to give low-interest - and barely profitable - 'policy loans' to industries selected by the government. The extent of the problem is unknown. The Office of Bank Supervision has not released precise figures on bad loans since 1990. Moreover, Korea's lax accounting rules 'permit plenty of scope for the banks to manipulate their accounts' and hide their non-performing assets, according to a recent analysis by the Seoul office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK brokerage. 'Given the limited amount of disclosure, this area is a veritable minefield,' BZW added. It estimates that ratio of non-performing loans averaged 8.8 per cent of total credits for the six largest and oldest city banks - Commercial Bank of Korea, Korea Exchange Bank, Cho Hung Bank, Bank of Seoul, Korea First Bank and Hanil Bank. They account for almost 90 per cent of total estimated bad loans of Won10,200bn. The average bad loan ratio for the 10 provincial banks was 4.6 per cent and 2 per cent for the seven new commercial banks that have been established in the past decade. If these estimates are accurate, the country's biggest banks will have to increase substantially their provisions for loan losses beyond the 2 per cent of total credit now required by the government. They need to raise capital not only to cover bad loans, but also to meet the Bank of International Settlements capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by 1995. Only Shinhan Bank is believed able to fulfil the BIS requirement so far. But raising capital through share issues may be difficult due to the sluggish performance of the Seoul bourse. The government has promised to solve the bad loan problem, although it has offered few remedies. One likely solution is to allow banks to engage in other financial sectors, such as brokerage and investment consultation, to increase turnover and profits. The government is likely to encourage bank mergers by easing rules on ownership that limit individual shareholders to a 8 per cent stake. Mr Park Jae-yoon, the former head of research at the Korea Federation of Banks, predicted last year that Korea will have two or three mega-banks by the end of decade, a development that he described as 'inevitable'. Mr Park is now chief economic adviser to President Kim, and a key architect of country's financial reforms.</p>

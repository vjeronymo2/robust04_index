[Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, good morning.    [Bosson] Good morning.    [Giesbert] You are a minister of everything, aren't you?    [Bosson] Indeed, of parts of daily life and of preparation  for the future.    [Giesbert] We have not heard from you since Christian Blanc,  Air France chairman, a manager, a very courageous man, published  details of his plan last week. What is your first impression?    [Bosson] It is extraordinary that the minister should be in  the limelight when things are going badly. When things are  going well, it is not the case.    [Giesbert] Are you trying to tell us that things are going  well for Air France?    [Bosson] I believe that things are going well with Christian  Blanc.    [Giesbert, interrupting] What about the deficit?    [Bosson] With Christian Blanc appointed by the government at  my suggestion. We have changed our method radically. [passage  omitted]    [Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, would it not be a good idea to  privatize Air France right now, quickly?    [Bosson] One of the things that is far from being on the  agenda is the privatization of Air France. On the contrary,  what is on the agenda...    [Giesbert, interrupting] Why? Why not?    [Bosson] On the contrary, what is...    [Giesbert, interrupting] Why?    [Bosson] Do you know anyone who would be willing to buy an  Air France share in the present state of the company? The real  problem...    [Giesbert, interrupting] I don't understand. You are going  to privatize Bull. It has a huge deficit too.    [Bosson] No, this is irrelevant.    [Giesbert] Bull....    [Bosson, interrupting] I have tried to save the company, to  do it with the men and women at Air France, and not against  them. What is on the agenda is the participation of employees.  [passage omitted] Twenty-five percent of the capital will be  shared by the employees -- 10 percent by all and the rest for  those who will agree to work more and to be paid with shares,  those who will believe in the future of their company and  mobilize the company around its chairman.    [Giesbert] What you are telling me this morning is  interesting, Bernard Bosson, that is: The privatization of Air  France is not on the agenda, it will not take place for a long  time, maybe never.    [Bosson] This seems obvious to me, it is a different issue  altogether. The present issue is to save our national company  so that it is not the only great European company to disappear  or to be bought up. Should our fleet fly under the flag of  British Airways or a U.S. company in the future, I don't think  that it would be a great French victory. This seems obvious to  me. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: JFB raises Pounds 6.25m in MBO and issues trading warning Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering group, is selling a portfolio of companies from its light engineering division to Clearbase, a consortium led by Mr George Hardie, joint managing director and finance director of JFB. JFB also said that problems at Woodbank (UK), a lossmaking light engineering company, were 'considerably more serious than previously expected' and were likely to have an adverse effect on trading in the year to September 30. JFB said the gross proceeds would be Pounds 6.25m cash, representing consideration of Pounds 3.97m and Pounds 2.28m as repayment for inter-company debt. Further payment up to Pounds 500,000 might become due depending on the extent to which Clearbase was able to utilise tax losses being transferred to it. In June, JFB announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 842,000, against profits of Pounds 2.07m, and said there were plans to sell companies in the light engineering division as part of the group's efforts to focus on core activities. Mr Hardie said yesterday that Pounds 2.75m of the funding would come from the management and venture capitalists, with the remainder from Bank of Scotland. Gearing was expected to be about 90 per cent. The post of finance director, would be filled by Mr Tony Edisbury, JFB company secretary. Shareholder approval for the deal will be sought at an extraordinary meeting on September 12. Turnover of the companies being sold amounted to Pounds 21.2m in the year to September 30 for pre-tax profits of Pounds 783,000. JFB's shares closed 3p down at 41p.</p>

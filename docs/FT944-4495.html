			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Oftel aims to police market: Alan Cane says the regulator's consultative paper points to a fresh role for it and new rules The UK has the most liberalised telecommunications market in the world. It also has one of the most complex, with emerging competition encouraged by a raft of regulation designed to give newcomers room to grow in the shadow of British Telecommunications. Yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel, the telecoms regulator, solicits opinions on questions at the heart of the worldwide debate on how best to manage the evolution of telecoms from state-owned monopoly to fully competitive free market. It is inviting responses until the end of next March. A definitive set of proposals is expected to be published in the summer. Few would oppose the need for a measure of regulation after liberalisation. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said yesterday that Britain's tangle of regulation was no accident. He said: 'This burst of regulatory effort is inevitable as the emergence of competition generates new problems and argument for regulators to adjudicate on. 'If we are to ensure that competition does not wither on the vine, abandonment of monopolies and reserved rights must be coupled with the adoption of rules.' The question addressed by the paper is what kind of rules apply in a market such as the UK, where competition is emerging but by no means fully developed. The message from Oftel is that it would like to see itself policing the market for anti-competitive behaviour rather than continuing in its role as a calculator of regulated prices. Mr Cruickshank pointed out, however, that a move towards comprehensive coverage of potential anti-competitive behaviour would work only if the right enforcement mechanisms were in place. BT's prices are capped by a series of formulae which relate its tariffs to the retail prices index. It receives fees, which are closely monitored by the regulator, from competitors for accepting and delivering calls in its role as dominant operator with a network which stretches almost everywhere in the UK. As owner of the network, BT is obliged to provide a universal service at reasonable cost. In practice, it is prevented by Oftel from charging line rental which would reflect the fully allocated costs of providing and maintaining customer connections to the network. BT funds this access deficit through artificially high call charges. When a competitor connects to BT's network to route a call to its destination, the cost of carriage charge does include the cost of providing customers connections. The access deficit contribution is intended to compensate BT for this loss of revenue. Most of its competitors have had part of that fee waived as an encouragement to competition. Interconnection charges to BT can represent between a half and two-thirds of a competing operator's costs. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said earlier this week that he wanted to see freedom from retail price controls from 1997, when the existing regime was reviewed, and an end to preferential support for market newcomers. The Oftel paper, however, suggests that newcomers have to be protected against BT through a modification of the ADC regime. It does, however, raise the possibility that ADC might vanish. The ADC arises out of the universality of BT's network access. Oftel caps BT's line rental charges at RPI plus 2 per cent. As a consequence, BT is forced to subsidise access out of call revenue. Oftel speculates that if the line rental cap were lifted, BT would not raise line rental charges significantly, assuming the existing overall cap on prices remained in force. It says: 'With the overall price cap set at RPI minus 7.5 per cent, the bills of most customers would fall even if BT rebalanced (its line rental and call charges) quite quickly.' The paper also questions the high cost to BT of the universal service obligation, designed to ensure that the isolated and the infirm have economical access to a basic phone service.</p>

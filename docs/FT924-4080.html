			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / EC unions and business join forces EUROPEAN unions and employers' organisations will join forces next week to make representations to Mr John Major, UK prime minister, on boosting growth and reducing unemployment in Europe, writes David Goodhart. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), meeting in London yesterday, complained that unemployment in Europe had reached an 'intolerable peak'. The European Commission is predicting a further substantial increase to an EC-wide rate of unemployment of more than 11 per cent. The ETUC, increasingly disappointed by the slow progress of the EC's social dimension, wants the Edinburgh EC summit to adopt the growth strategy it agreed last July with the main European employers' organisations. That includes a significant reduction of interest rates, a co-ordination of national investment projects in the public and private sectors, and restoring the credibility of convergence through EC-inspired job creation. The ETUC also welcomed the EC's Ecu10bn (Pounds 8.9bn) infrastructure spending plan.</p>

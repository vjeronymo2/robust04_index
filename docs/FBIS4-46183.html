			<p>BFN     [Text] The route suffered by the PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] at the hands of the security forces in recent days has  been admitted by the leader of the organization Abdullah Ocalan.  Ocalan severely warned the members of the organization, saying  that there has been an incredible number of losses.    [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] According to available  information, in his message to PKK field commanders the previous  day Ocalan said that those responsible for the losses will be  punished. Ocalan demanded that those not fighting voluntarily be  dismissed from the organization and called on the PKK to carry  out low-risk operations such as laying mines, sabotage, and road  blocks.    The PKK conducted mine-laying and roadblock operations  yesterday.    In his message, PKK leader Ocalan said that the losses  suffered by the organization in Pulumur and Dogubeyazit are  unacceptably high, and made the following assessment: The field  commanders are misleading me, the information they provide does  not conform with reality.    The PKK suffered huge losses during operations carried out  by  the security forces in the last few months.    In the meantime, the mop-up operation launched by the  security forces on Cudi Mountain is continuing. It is reported  that major losses has been inflicted on the PKK.</p>

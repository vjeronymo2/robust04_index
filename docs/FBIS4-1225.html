			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba] </F>   [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi might be one of two of South Africa's deputy  presidents after the election if he does "reasonably well" in  next week's poll, according to reliable ANC sources. The  sources said Buthelezi, whose party made a sensational  last-minute entry into the election race this week, was being  seriously considered in ANC circles for the position of one of  two executive deputy presidents. The offer would be made to him  in the interests of peace and national unity, especially if he  had a fairly respectable showing in the election.    He would then join National Party leader F.W. de Klerk as  the  country's deputy president, with the ANC forfeiting its right to  appoint the first deputy president -- something to which it will  be automatically entitled to if no more than two parties get  over 20 percent each in the election.    The sources stressed, however, that this was just one of the  options being considered in certain ANC circles, although not  everyone in the organisation's national executive committee  (NEC) was happy about it. The ANC begins a two-day meeting of  its extended NEC today, where the first deputy presidency of the  country and Nelson Mandela's tentative Cabinet will be discussed.    Within the ANC itself, National Chairman Thabo Mbeki and  Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa are the two main candidates,  with each man's supporters lobbying very strongly for their man.  Because of the divisive nature of the designation of a deputy  president, this issue has so far been discussed in hush-hush  tones within the ANC.    Mbeki's supporters, mostly in the ANC Youth League, point to  the fact that he was placed second on the lists which came from  the various regions across the country.    They say the list which saw Ramaphosa leap-frogging to the  second spot had been a result of the national conference  attended by party bosses and therefore did not represent "the  will of the people". Responding to a question at a press  conference in Johannesburg yesterday, Ramaphosa -- like Mbeki a  week ago -- said he and his colleagues in the ANC were not  inclined to talk about themselves and what positions they might  hold in future. He confirmed, however, that the process of  putting together an ANC Cabinet was under way.    The sources said Mbeki, who was "presently the most senior  person in the ANC and commands a lot of respect from all  sectors", was a clear favourite for the job. Another "very  senior and powerful job" had already been earmarked for  Ramaphosa.    However, ANC sources yesterday told THE STAR there was now a  possibility of maverick information and publicity chief Dr Pallo  Jordan becoming a compromise candidate for the first deputy  presidency to avoid a showdown between Ramaphosa and Mbeki.  This would be similar to what happened at the organisation's  July 1991 congress in Durban where Walter Sisulu was elected  deputy president to stave off a potentially divisive battle for  the position between the late Chris Hani and Mbeki.    Approached for comment yesterday, Jordan said: "I have not  heard about it. However, I would not be a compromise candidate  because I am very uncompromising". Asked what his reaction  would be if he were nominated for the position, he said he would  "seriously consider it".</p>

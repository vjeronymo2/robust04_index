			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuerzburg (ddp/ADN) -- "Returns" from the European  Union (EU) to Germany must be "improved", according to Theo  Waigel, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] and finance  minister. At a CSU meeting in preparation for the European  elections, Waigel said today in Wuerzburg that Germany has  fallen from position two to position seven in the EU prosperity  league after unification. The call for an austere budget policy  in Europe and increased returns for Germany is therefore  justifiable.    Waigel once again called for an international Bundeswehr  commitment within the United Nations. Germany has to be  prepared to assume responsibility "in Europe and throughout the  world. We cannot hide any longer," Waigel stressed.</p>

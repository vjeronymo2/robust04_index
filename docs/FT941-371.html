			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Croda advances strongly Shares in Croda International fell 24p to 352p yesterday after the speciality chemicals group reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to Pounds 38.5m in 1993 before a Pounds 10.4m gain on the recent sale of its inks businesses. Mr Michael Valentine, chairman, described it as a 'very good year' with record profits. Profits topped the Pounds 36.4m achieved in 1990 with earnings per share also at a peak of 20.1p, up 31 per cent, before the exceptional. However, the cut in the dividend in 1991 has not been fully restored. It rises by 8.4 per cent to 8.4p, with a final of 5.45p. In 1990 the pay-out was 11p. The main chemicals business, whose products are chiefly based on natural oils, continued to grow strongly with operating profits up 19 per cent to Pounds 36.8m on turnover 13 per cent higher at Pounds 271m. Exports rose by almost a fifth helped by the fall in sterling, with good sales into the difficult personal care market in Germany. Group turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 415m with growth of about 6 per cent excluding exchange rate benefits and acquisitions. Profits from coatings rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 5m, helped by the restructuring of the UK paint business, and cosmetics and toiletries recovered to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 500,000) having been hit by weak European consumer demand in 1992. The inks and graphics supplies business, which Croda sold to Manders for Pounds 26.7m in January, made Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.1m), with the proceeds leavings Croda with gearing of 25 per cent. Mr Keith Hopkins, chief executive, said the current year had started well with 'very strong' sales in Italy and France. 'There has been a certain amount of restocking by customers but it may indicate the start of an underlying recovery.' COMMENT The market reaction might appear harsh given the strength of Croda's recovery. But the shares have had a very strong run and the company threw current year forecasts into confusion by warning that there may not be a repeat of last year's Pounds 2.9m pension credit in the UK. Analysts were also concerned about the continued impact on margins of the rise in the soya bean oil price. But these are minor issues for a company which looks well-placed with its portfolio of natural products, reasonable exposure to the fast-growing east Asian markets and a healthy balance sheet. On forecasts of about Pounds 40m for the current year the shares are on a multiple of less than 17 which looks well-deserved.</p>

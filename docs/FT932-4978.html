			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Steel users condemn US trade cases: 'Unfair' claims of dumping or subsidies blamed for price rise ALLEGED unfair trade cases, filed by the US steel industry against 19 countries, are casting 'a menacing shadow' over the American economy and spurring inflationary price rises, according to US steel users who met in Washington at the weekend to publicise their complaints. Mr John Griffin, president of the American Institute for International Steel, a group of 200 steel traders, said prices had already risen 20 per cent this year and that another increase was expected in July. Last year the big domestic steel producers filed 84 cases, claiming dumping or subsidies. Duties were levied in 72 cases after the US Commerce Department announced initial findings in January affirming the complaints. Final Commerce Department rulings are to be announced on June 22. The International Trade Commission, the country's fair trade watchdog, will then have 45 days to conclude if the subsidised steel has harmed US industry. 'American manufacturers requiring steel products with unique physical and chemical characteristics have trouble finding them in sufficient quantities from domestic suppliers,' Mr Griffin said. 'Infrequent users of steel are unable to place orders.' One of those users is Mr Roy Herman, president of the UNF Leavitt division, UNR Industries, which makes tubing. He said high prices had made the company's products less competitive. 'We are seeing a surge in offerings of foreign-produced tubing, which for the most part, except for Canada, has almost been non-existent over the last few years.' With steel companies raising prices or reducing shipments to maximise sales of higher-value-added products, his company is 'being played like a yo-yo in terms of availability and delivery. . . it is nearly impossible to plan our prod-uction in an efficient manner.' The users say they employ 30 times more US workers than do the steel companies. Under attack from the users, Mr Roland McDonald, a Commerce Department official, insisted that Congress left his department little discretion in administering dumping and countervailing duty cases. 'The US industry is entitled to relief from unfair trade practices,' he said. The department has initiated 34 'suspension agreements,' paving the way for negotiations with 10 countries on pacts providing for monitoring of higher import prices. Mr Joseph Papovich, a deputy US trade representative, said the 'unfair trade' problem must be handled at its core by negotiating a Multilateral Steel Agreement. MSA talks are expected to resume late this month or in early July. The US is insisting that an MSA achieve the following: Eliminate non-tariff barriers and tariffs; End all trade-distorting subsidies; Discipline the use of anti-competitive practices, such as restricted distribution systems; Establish an effective dispute settlement mechanism; Require individual producers to repay any illegal subsidies they receive. David Dodwell, World Trade editor, adds: A broad-ranging inquiry into the effect on the US economy of anti-dumping actions is 'to be reformulated and resubmitted' to the ITC, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said in Paris last week. Controversy was stirred in January this year when Mr Kantor withdrew a request to the ITC for an anti-dumping inquiry made by his predecessor, Mrs Carla Hills, just days before she left office. Mr Kantor insisted in Paris that the request had not been withdrawn but that the letter requesting the inquiry had been called back 'to make the inquiry broader and more comprehensive'.</p>

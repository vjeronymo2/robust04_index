The Secretary does not intend to implement this amendment unless absolutely necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to a severely overfished condition of haddock, cod, and yellowtail flounder, the Council submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP, which was approved January 3, 1994, except for two measures that were disapproved on September 30, 1993. The two disapproved measures were a 5,000-pound (2,268-kg) possession limit for haddock and an exemption to the FMP regulations for winter flounder when fishing in state waters. The 5,000-pound (2,268-kg) possession limit for haddock was disapproved because the Secretary determined it was inadequate to protect haddock stocks on the Georges Bank and in the Gulf of Maine, which are at historically low levels of abundance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An emergency rule was implemented effective from January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994 (59 FR 26, January 3, 1994), that contains the following measures: (1) A possession limit for haddock for all vessels permitted under the multispecies fishery, except scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock; (2) a closure of the Closed Area II to all vessels except scallop dredge vessels and lobster pot vessels from January through May; (3) an expansion of Closed Area II by 20 minutes longitude west and 15 minutes latitude south, along its western and southern boundaries; (4) a suspension of the February through May closure of Closed Area I to all vessels except those using sink gillnet gear; (5) a prohibition on transfer of fish at sea; and (6) a ban on pair trawling in the multispecies fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery was approved on January 3, 1994, and has several measures also contained in the emergency rule. Since Amendment 5 is scheduled for implementation before the current emergency rule expires on April 2, 1994, those measures are not contained in proposed Amendment 6. Measures contained in Amendment 5 that are not contained in proposed Amendment 6 are: (1) An expansion of the size of Closed Area II; (2) a suspension of the closure of Closed Area I to all vessels except vessels using sink gillnet gear; (3) a prohibition on the transfer of fish at sea; and (4) a ban on pair trawling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Amendment 6 contains two measures: (1) A 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit for haddock, for all vessels permitted under the multispecies fishery, except sea scallop dredge vessels which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock, and (2) a closure of Closed Area II to all vessels, except lobster pot vessels and scallop dredge vessels, from January through June, on an annual basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is interested in receiving comments on Amendment 6, the EA and RIR and will consider all public comments before a decision is made whether or not to approve the Amendment. Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 6 will be published within 15 days after the submission of the amendment to the New England Fishery Management Council for its consideration and comment as required under section 304(c)(2)(A)(iii) of the Magnuson Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dated: February 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> David S.

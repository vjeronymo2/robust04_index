			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: BCP's core should draw buyers BCP's strong brand names and dominant market positions should ensure that there is plenty of buyer interest in its core food, beverage and tobacco operations. The division, which last year had revenues of SKr22bn (Dollars 2.78bn) and operating income of SKr1.46bn, is an agglomeration built up by acquisition over many years. Disposal is likely to be through piecemeal sales to Nordic and international groups, say analysts. The Nordic countries constitute BCP's main market, with Sweden accounting for 55 per cent of sales. The company dominates the Swedish beer and soft drinks market, with a 50 per cent share through brands such as Pripps and Ramlosa, while Felix, Abba and Ekstroms Onos are strong brand names on the food side. Analysts say Nordic consumer product companies such as Norway's Orkla and Finland's Huhtamaki may show an interest in parts of BCP's food and drink business, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster market share. However, they expect competition from big continental companies, such as Nestle. The beer segment may see a challenge from Carlsberg. On the tobacco side, Swedish Match Lights, BCP's most international operation, is the world's largest producer of matches and the third-largest manufacturer of disposable lighters. Such a strong global position will almost certainly entice interest from groups such as Philip Morris and Hanson. Swedish Match has a strong position in the domestic market, where it is the leader for matches and cigarettes. BCP's market value is SKr18bn-SKr20bn. Volvo's current 73.6 per cent stake is booked at only SKr5.8bn, suggesting big capital gains. However, sales are unlikely to begin before Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, has completed his bid to mop up the BCP shares which the company does not own. Selling BCP will be easier for Volvo when it has full control.</p>

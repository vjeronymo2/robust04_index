			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (6): All eyes on Gatt outcome - Trade MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, shocked many Australians recently when he declared during a visit to Tokyo that Australia would support Japan rather than the US in any future trade dispute. Mr Keating's statement appeared to be intended to lay the groundwork for Australian trade policy in the event of a collapse of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Officials said the government remained hopeful of a successful conclusion to the talks, and played down suggestions that the statement flagged a big refocusing of Australia's trade and diplomatic efforts. However, Mr Keating was said to be concerned that the US might seek to develop a series of bilateral trade agreements offering preferential access to the recently-negotiated North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) if the multilateral Gatt talks broke down. Given that such an approach could be used to discriminate against Japanese access to the US, the prime minister's unsolicited support for Japan makes a lot of sense. Australia is one of the few developed countries to run a trade surplus with Japan, which is by far its biggest trading partner. Mr Keating's comments also reflect the growing view that Australia's best interests lie in encouraging closer relationships with the dynamic economies of its own region, rather than fostering existing historical links with the US and Europe. More than 60 per cent of Australian exports went to the Asia-Pacific region (excluding the Americas) last year, including 27 per cent of the total to Japan alone. By contrast, North America and the European Community (EC) each took just over 12 per cent. Most forecasters suggest that trade with Asia will continue to grow as a proportion of Australia's total trade, which suggests that Mr Keating's comments amounted to little more than a commonsense observation on where Australia's loyalties would lie in the event of a trade war. However, his statement also reflects concern that Australia's relatively recent claim to be an integral part of the Asia-Pacific region may not be enough to prevent its exclusion from any regional trade bloc which may emerge. For example, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has made clear that Australia and New Zealand would be excluded from his proposed East Asian Economic Caucus, which Malaysia envisages as an expanded version of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). Even if the caucus fails to materialise, there is clearly no role for Australia in the proposed development of a free trade area within Asean  - an idea which is gathering support as the likelihood of a successful Gatt outcome recedes. Australia might be able to sign a bilateral deal offering access to Nafta, but would first have to overcome US resistance to freer trade in agricultural commodities in which Australia has an advantage. Even if the agricultural problem could be overcome, such an agreement would be unlikely to confer a net benefit if access to Asian markets was simultaneously reduced because of Australia's exclusion from an emerging regional trading bloc. This analysis explains why Australia has invested so much diplomatic effort in the formation of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation process (Apec), initiated by Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, in 1990. Apec, which is establishing a permanent secretariat in Singapore, includes Australia, Japan and the two big North American economies, as well as the Asean nations and the three Chinas - Taiwan, Hong Kong and the communist mainland. The key to Canberra's interest in Apec is that the member countries buy about 70 per cent of Australia's exports. However, while Apec members have discussed trade issues, the organisation is not yet a trade bloc, and there are several problem areas which make it hard to see how it could develop into one: The size and diversity of Apec - the things which make it attractive to Australia - mean that negotiations on a comprehensive trade agreement would face the same problems as the Uruguay Round. Agriculture aside, the US and Canada are likely to have conflicting obligations to Nafta, especially if Nafta goes ahead with a series of bilateral trading agreements with third countries. An Asian trade bloc could not succeed without Japanese participation, but Japan clearly has a greater interest in protecting its access to the crucial North American and European consumer goods markets. The lack of cultural economic affinity between Apec members. Australian policymakers have tended to gloss over the cultural issue on the grounds that other Asian nations are as different from each other as they are from Australia. However, Professor Richard Snape, head of the economics department at Monash University, pointed out in a recent report on Australia's trading options that successful regional trading blocs usually exhibit a high degree of geographical proximity and similar levels of per capita gross national product. 'To this list might well be added cultural affinity: there are no examples of successful, substantial trading blocs where there is a marked cultural diversity between the partners. This may reduce the likelihood of any agreement involving Australia and Asian countries being successful,' he said. In spite of these difficulties, the consensus among both policymakers and commentators is that Australia must continue to promote Apec because it is the only mechanism which offers Canberra a seat at the regional table. Professor Nancy Viviani, head of the international politics department at Griffiths University, says Apec's importance to Canberra is hard to overstate. 'The alternative is to be an orphan if the storms come,' she says. Mr Richard Woolcott, who as secretary of the foreign affairs and trade department was one of the authors of current trade policy, says Apec can help Australia prevent the formation of trade blocs from which it is excluded. Nevertheless, the inherent contradictions in Apec make it a poor second best to a successful Gatt outcome, which remains the primary target of government policy. If the talks succeed, Mr Keating can forget about making choices between Japan and the US. If they fail, Australia will not be the only country searching for a safe haven.</p>

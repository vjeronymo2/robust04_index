			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Petrov: "A Necessary Evil With State </F> Support"]    [Text] Every change brings danger and risk. That is the  reason why it must be emphasized internal incertitude is  characteristic of the so-called societies in transition. The  reason for such a prognosis is simple -- in such states, the  most-radical and, in many senses, most-sensitive change comes  about, which is in the titular ownership of the social capital,  which was in the hands of the state in the former socialist  countries. The bright side of the coin of privatization is the  establishment of the market economy, when sound competition has  to be the leading factor in the overall economic progress of the  country. When we speak about sound competition, we will allow  ourselves a small digression in the terminological explanation.  Competition (this comes from Latin, meaning contest, rivalry)  is carried out through supply and demand and the game of prices  on one hand, and the action of the competition forms the market  prices of the goods, following the law on the value of goods  production, on the other hand.    However, the transformation of the social capital, the  famous  "privatization," can and has to be viewed as a necessary evil  that must be overcome with as few tremors as possible.  Otherwise, the transformation itself would be transformed into  a general theft that would leave nothing of the state. In such  circumstances, "sound competition" becomes unimaginable, and  "Madame Mafia," organized criminal, comes onto the scene.  <H5>  Awakening in Darkness </H5>   Recent Interior Ministry information shows that the  increasing number of acts of committing or concealing criminal  acts causing great damage was characteristic of the last year,  as was the receiving and giving of bribes, causing the  appearance of a more serious dilemma on the surface. According  to the information, this kind of detected criminal act, compared  to 1992 and 1993, has increased 107 percent. The figure itself  -- no matter how hard we try to view it as a conditional  correlation -- points to an alarming situation. In order to  avoid the dilemmas -- it is a fact that Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], compared to most  post-communist countries or societies in transition, is  maintaining a high level of security, which should not and must  not make us self-satisfied. Particularly not when we talk about  the economic crime that is increasing in the country.    On the other hand, when we talk about the phenomena of  "bribery" and "corruption," we must stress that they represent  the more difficult forms of economic crime. In keeping with the  way they transpire (most frequently they are done in private, or  through various mediators), they are at the bottom of the list  of proven cases. In other words, the so-called "black" figure  of unrevealed criminal acts is the greatest in this area. As a  matter of fact, there is an opinion that the criminal sphere in  which bribery and corruption belong, the least revealed, is  practically the most widespread in reality. Therefore, it  exists, but due to its character, the difficulty of revealing  and proving it, the absence of a practical strategy for its  detection by state organs, it remains in the dark, that is in  the unrevealed crime range.    If we go back to the introductory views on the high risk of  privatization, with the presumption that the dominance of social  ownership is still reality in Macedonia, on the eve of its own  metamorphosis into private or some other kind of ownership, we  indubitably come to the conclusion that the social property is  the most threatened at this moment. The remolding of the social  capital into private capital reveals numerous hitherto-unknown  forms of economic crime. On the other hand, the methods are  classical -- abuses, bribery, and corruption. Almost overnight,  like mushrooms after rain, new businessmen are appearing --  owners of private or mixed companies who, at the expense of  everybody's or nobody's social ownership, at the expense of the  sleeping and disorganized state, and primarily all at the  expense of the workers who are rapidly approaching the edge of  bare subsistence, make their wealth very quickly.  <H5>  The Robbery of the Century Continues </H5>   As a matter of fact, it is a public secret and a regular  subject of discussion among the common citizens, among those  with a salary or pension of around 100 to 200 German marks a  month, that the state is being robbed blind. For the time  being, there are neither answers nor reactions from those bodies  and services that are there to protect the state. There are no  replies from the legislative or executive bodies that had to  enact and implement the legal basis for preventing the  state-damaging and dangerous events. The most logical  conclusion is that such a situation suits all, particularly  those in power. Except, of course, for the citizen whose bare  existence is put at stake. Thus, the reaction of the common  people is reduced to ordinary gossip about the state or the  ruling power, which, regardless, is continually becoming a  self-serving power. In order not to make this sound like a  radical trade unionist dirge about the difficult fate of the  working people, we shall stick only to the aspect that,  according to the competent state institutions and their  associates, is, especially now, demonstrating such indolence and  indifference, which makes the whole matter look like an  introduction to a kind of totalitarianism.    Parallel to all this, what seen be noticed in Macedonia with  open eyes, conveys to image that the state let go of the reins a  long time ago. It has not just released them, but it is showing  less interest and strength in taking control. It can be seen  that individuals are making money overnight, that taxes are  being avoided, that deals are mostly made in "cash" in order to  avoid the financial institutions, that some companies have the  exclusive right to import and export, given to them for their  beauty (confidentially), that speculative liquidations are  taking place, that the social capital is being sold off for next  to nothing....    In such a situation, the rapid polarization of the citizens  is evident, as well as the growing public discontent with the  striking examples of abuse, machination, and speculation, which  finally leads to a certain institutionalization of the crime.    Claims that the state authority bodies are not involved in  such filthy deals are fairy tales. In brief, no matter how  painful it may be, the ancient scheme of connecting the economic  power with the political power is slowly emerging in the  Republic of Macedonia. This also creates the conditions for the  revival of the connection between the criminal climate and the  state establishment, which represents a basic definition of the  phenomenon -- organized crime.</p>

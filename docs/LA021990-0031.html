			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNSUSPECTING LANDLADY THRUST INTO DRUG WAR;  </P> <P> LANDLADY WAS A CASUALTY OF WAR ON DRUGS  </P> <P> A year and a half ago, Marge Andrews put her La Habra Heights home up for rent.  It was a big place -- $2,500 a month -- with a tennis court and weeping willow  trees. Within days, a tenant had come forward, a Sacramento businessman named  William Black Jr. He signed a six-month lease, and the 61-year-old grandmother  handed him the keys, unaware she had just been drawn into the local war on  drugs.  </P> <P> Three months later, Andrews dropped by her three-bedroom home and found the  aftermath of a three-quarter-ton cocaine raid. The house was deserted, door  locks had been smashed and someone had dug a concrete vault the size of a wine  celler under the bathroom downstairs. Outside, her 50-year-old trees had been  stripped bare.  </P> <P> When she complained, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies told her that a  cadre of Colombian drug dealers had been living in her home, and Black -- a law  enforcement operative -- had set them up for arrest.  </P> <P> Andrews' story illustrates how the cocaine wars in Southern California have  reached even the most tranquil corners of suburbia, thrusting unsuspecting  citizens into the fray. Each year, drug traffickers rent several hundred homes  in Los Angeles County to store cocaine before distribution, said Curt Hazell,  head of the district attorney's major narcotics unit.  </P> <P> The dealers typically are drawn to quiet residential communities like La Habra  Heights because, Hazell said, "their whole M.O. is to be low key."  </P> <P> Although narcotics officers make frequent drug raids -- the sheriff's major  narcotics teams alone conducted 1,426 such raids last year -- damage complaints  from homeowners and tenants are relatively rare.  </P> <P> The county counsel's office estimates that 25 claims a year are filed against  the county for damage done in narcotics raids on homes from South-Central Los  Angeles to Diamond Bar to Malibu. And the county normally pays no more than  $25,000 a year to repair homes where narcotics squads have kicked in doors or  done other damage.  </P> <P> In November, however, Andrews won a settlement of $137,500, one of the largest  such payments by the county in recent years.  </P> <P> Behind the settlement, Andrews said, is a story so bizarre that "when I tell  people about it, they look at me like, 'uh-oh -- Marge has gone round the  bend."  </P> <P> Even for a sting, the raid on Andrews' house had unusual intrigue -- and  ironies. A sheriff's operative rented the house. Two of the narcotics officers  involved in the case are now targets of a larger investigation into alleged  skimming of seized drug money. And a neighbor who allowed deputies to use his  home for surveillance now fears for his life and claims that he was a gunman's  target.  </P> <P> Andrews says no homeowner should become an unwitting participant in the battle  against cocaine cartels.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely against drugs," she said. "But they can't just say, 'Damn the  torpedoes, full speed ahead' and drag innocent citizens along in the wake."  </P> <P> The house sits on an acre and a half of rustic land in the foothills between La  Habra and Whittier. Built in 1958, it was just three months old when the  Andrews family moved in.  </P> <P> "I loved that house. I never wanted to sell it," Andrews said. She raised a son  and a daughter and kept two dogs and a horse there. On a clear day, she said,  you could see Santa Catalina Island. Even when her children left home, she  stayed.  </P> <P> Her son, Calvin Andrews, 38, of San Luis Obispo, said, "After my parents  divorced eight years ago, I tried to get my mother to move many times, but it  was her tie to the past."  </P> <P> But eventually, to be close to her children, Andrews did buy a second home. In  the summer of 1988, she set up housekeeping in the Northern California  community of Fairfield and put a "For Lease" sign outside the house on West  Road.  </P> <P> A man soon contacted Andrews' real estate agent, introducing himself as William  Black.  </P> <P> "He was a very nice young man, in his early 30s, well groomed, curly dark  hair," recalled the agent, former La Habra Heights Mayor Glenda Tuppan.  </P> <P> Black said he was in the janitorial supplies business and was just separating  from his wife, according to Tuppan. He was looking for a house where he could  bring his children.  </P> <P> "There was no reason not to believe him," Tuppan said, adding that one of  Andrews' neighbors had even vouched for Black.  </P> <P> Officials acknowledged later that the neighbor was a longtime friend of the  department who had once donated a battering ram for narcotics raids.  </P> <P> At Andrews' insistence, Tuppan ran a credit check. Black's record consisted of  a checking account with $50,000 in it, an American Express card and a driver's  license that traced back to a post office box.  </P> <P> "Of course, now I know that anybody can get set up with a credit record like  that," Andrews said. But at the time, she said, she had no reason to question  it.  </P> <P> Nor was she suspicious when Black paid her the first three months' rent in  cash. Nor when he mentioned that he would like to trim the trees back from the  tennis court a bit, and that he would not need help from the Andrews' regular  handyman.  </P> <P> On Aug. 18 -- about 2 1/2 weeks after Andrews moved out -- a Colombian named  Diego Venegas was seen carrying a pick and shovel into her house, according to  court affidavits filed by narcotics officers. Soon, the officers said,  neighbors heard jackhammers pounding at night and saw cars coming and going at  all hours.  </P> <P> Surveillance outposts were set up nearby, including the home of the neighbor  who vouched for Black, according to court records and interviews. The view,  Andrews said, was excellent because the trees around her home had been pruned  so severely that "they looked like telephone poles."  </P> <P> When a camper truck arrived at the house Oct. 6, 1988, narcotics officers  watched as the Colombians unloaded about 40 cardboard boxes. A number of  packages resembling kilogram packets of cocaine fell from the boxes, Deputy  Stephen Nichols said in an affidavit.  </P> <P> Hours later, narcotics officers raided the house, seizing 743 kilos, or 1,635  pounds, of cocaine, court records show. Also confiscated were two vehicles, a  cellular phone and a loaded MAC-10 machine gun.  </P> <P> Four Colombians were arrested, and three -- including Venegas, the alleged  ringleader -- pleaded guilty to charges of possession of cocaine for sale. Last  year, they received sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. The fourth  defendant faces trial this spring.  </P> <P> About two weeks after the raid, Andrews dropped by her house to retrieve some  belongings. She was barely into the driveway when she realized that something  was very wrong.  </P> <P> The house "looked dead," she recalled. When she saw the extent of the damage,  she "almost had a heart attack."  </P> <P> Ed Johnson, Andrews' 66-year-old fiance, said sheriff's narcotics Sgt. Ed  Huffman finally explained what had happened at Andrews' house. Contacted by The  Times, Huffman declined to comment. But Johnson said he was told that the house  had been damaged in a raid, that Black was in on the "sting" and that the  Sheriff's Department would pay for the repairs.  </P> <P> But months after his conversation with Huffman, the house remained in disarray,  Johnson said. And Andrews was stuck with a $312.99 electric bill, a $102 phone  bill and a $115 bill for a water softening service -- plus three months of  unpaid rent.  </P> <P> In her claim against the county, Andrews said it would cost $26,500 to repair  and replace the damaged trees. The Colombians had done $18,000 worth of damage  when they built the concrete-lined vault beneath a trap door, she said. Andrews  also contended that $13,781.50 worth of family heirlooms were missing from a  storage shed.  </P> <P> After the claim was rejected by the county, Andrews filed a $952,000 suit  against the Sheriff's Department alleging fraud, theft and breach of contract  related to Black's lease. She also said she received $200,000 less than market  value when she sold her home because she had been forced under state law to  disclose that the house had been the site of a major drug raid.  </P> <P> The county settled the suit for $137,500.  </P> <P> "I can appreciate the sheriff's standpoint. They wanted to see (the  investigation) to its conclusion," Assistant County Counsel S. Robert Ambrose  said. "But there was a lot of destruction, and it was apparently something our  people were aware of . . . for a hell of a long time."  </P> <P> Undersheriff Robert Edmonds said the department agreed to the settlement  because officers were aware damage was being done to the Andrews home and  decided not to alert her. But he would not comment on Black or any role he may  have played in the investigation.  </P> <P> From a law enforcement viewpoint, Deputy Dist. Atty. Hazell said, "it was an  outstanding investigation."  </P> <P> "People are always saying that law enforcement should go after the big guys,"  he said. "Well, you can't go after the big guys by waiting until the stuff  (cocaine) is broken down into rocks and then going after some guy on the  street.  </P> <P> "I can understand she'd rather this had not happened," Hazell acknowledged.  "But it takes extraordinary methods and imaginative methods if you're going to  get the people at the top. And there isn't a significant narcotics case made  that doesn't involve trade-offs and balancing."  </P> <P> But to Andrews, the damage to her home of 31 years went beyond dollars and  cents.  </P> <P> "I lived a lifetime in that house," she said. "And what happened there ruined  it for me. I was frightened to be there after that. It felt like I'd been  raped." In the months since Andrews settled her case, fallout has continued.  The narcotics team that set up the sting has been disbanded along with other  major narcotics crews in the wake of a federal and local corruption  investigation.  </P> <P> Eighteen narcotics officers -- including Nichols, the lead investigator on the  La Habra Heights case, and Deputy Leo M. Newman, who was part of the  surveillance team -- have been suspended amid allegations that they stole  hundreds of thousands of dollars in money seized from drug dealers. The  officers have denied the allegations.  </P> <P> In December, the neighbor who vouched for Black reported that a gunman riddled  his car with bullets as he returned home one night. In an interview with The  Times, the neighbor requested anonymity, saying he is "beyond petrified."  </P> <P> As for the mysterious William Black Jr., he phoned Tuppan after the raid.  </P> <P> She did not ask for an explanation and he did not offer one.  </P> <P> "He just said he wanted to apologize for all the trouble," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: A short while ago, we learned  that Lieutenant General Dr. Samir Farraj, the private physician  of His Majesty King Husayn, has stated that his majesty the king  left the Mayo Clinic medical center in Rochester in the United  States this morning after undergoing extensive medical tests.  The medical tests have shown that his majesty the king is  enjoying good health, and that there are no traces of the  disease which prompted surgery for his majesty the king two  years ago. Consequently, such tests will be conducted once per  year, instead of once every six months, Dr. Farraj added.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BRANDO'S HUG PUT HIM AT EASE  </P> <P> For Matthew Broderick, working with Marlon Brando was the highlight of filming  "The Freshman," which casts him in yet another youth role.  </P> <P> Broderick recalled that he couldn't relax knowing he would meet the superstar.  </P> <P> However, a big hug from Brando and his calm manner put him at ease.  </P> <P> "He's a role model for everybody in the business," said Broderick. "No matter  who they think is their role model, that person probably had Brando as a role  model. All roads lead to Brando."  </P> <P> Broderick stars in the film as a graduate student who gets hustled out of his  possessions as soon as he arrives in New York to attend film school.  </P> <P> Following and catching the thief eventually leads to a meeting with Brando's  character -- a shady guy not unlike his Don Corleone of "The Godfather."  </P> <P> Broderick, 28, admitted he once was bothered by the number of teen-age roles he  was getting. But the quality of the characters has changed his mind.  </P> <P> "I played my own age in Glory," he pointed out. "Eventually, as I age, I'll get  more roles closer to my age."  </P></p>

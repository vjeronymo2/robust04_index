			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by unidentified </F> NEWS reporter in Vienna; date not given: "Klestil: The  Interview"]    [Excerpt] [NEWS] Over the past few days, political  speculations that a positive conclusion of the EC negotiations  will no longer be possible by early March and that the  referendum on Europe might be delayed by almost a year have been  increasing. Is this assessment also a result of your contacts?    [Klestil] First of all, on account of my contacts, I am sure  that Austria is assessed in a particularly positive way in all  EC capitals. We are treated as if we were already fully  integrated. My second assessment is that we achieved an enormous  success before Christmas regarding the question of the  environmental package. It is an Austrian habit to always assess  our successes very modestly -- but a terrific thing happened.  The European Union [EU] adjusted its lower environmental  protection standards to that of Austria's. Thus, small Austria  did not adjust itself to the lower environmental protection  standards, but rather the big EC states adopted our particularly  high environmental standards. This is an incredible success in  the negotiations. If the same concessions are made to us in the  remaining open questions, then the date in March may work out  absolutely.    [NEWS] Do you believe that it is still possible to conclude  the negotiations in March and carry out the referendum in June?    [Klestil] This target date is certainly very important  because, on the one hand, it puts pressure on both sides and, on  the other hand, it forces everyone to work day and night to  achieve this date.    [NEWS] In your opinion, are the negotiations currently  stagnating, or is this pessimism mere tactics?    [Klestil] It is certainly not tactics. There are really  several very important open questions regarding the topics of  agriculture and transit. In March, provincial diet elections  will be held in the provinces that are affected most by these  questions -- for example, Tirol -- which clearly complicates an  objective discussion. But even without the pressure of these  elections, the following would have been valid: The result is  more important than the date.    [NEWS] There is also the attitude that we have to hurry with  our entry because the situation in Russia might jeopardize  Europe's security.    [Klestil] A delay would, of course, be deplorable.  Precisely in view of the speedy change of the political  situation around us, I would prefer all that to be settled in  March. Therefore, both things are very important for me: that  we achieve both the March target and the June referendum with  great commitment and a result in the negotiations that is  convincing and that one can present to the people with  self-confidence. In the next few weeks, all our energy really  has to be aimed at Brussels. The conclusion of the negotiations  in March, a referendum in June, and entry into the European  Community in early 1995 -- this would be the ideal schedule.    [NEWS] In the political scene in Vienna, there is currently  a very decisive question: How much will you personally commit  yourself to the European Community in the election campaign  before the referendum?    [Klestil] First of all, I will have a close look at the  result of the negotiations and exclusively assess it according  to Austria's interests. I will then clearly give my opinion on  this result of the negotiations. I will state my point of view  on this question for or against the European Community. And the  citizen can deduce a guideline from it, if he wants. I will  state my point of view very clearly before the referendum.    [NEWS] In favor of the European Community.    [Klestil] My basic attitude toward the European integration  process is known. I pursued it very consistently over the past  few years.    [NEWS] What will happen if the negotiating teams do not  achieve an agreement by March?    [Klestil] This will be deplorable, but it will not be a  tragedy.    [NEWS] In that case, would you clearly come out in favor of  advanced Nationalrat elections in June so that the referendum  can take place in the autumn and the process of entry will be  accelerated?    [Klestil] It is exclusively the business of the Nationalrat  to decide when the Nationalrat elections will be held. It is  not my task to give advice here, not in public.    [NEWS] And behind the scenes?    [Klestil] When my opinion was asked during my regular  contacts with government members, I always stated it very openly.    [NEWS] That is, the advancement of the Nationalrat elections  to the spring so that a new government can carry out the EC  referendum unburdened in the autumn?    [Klestil] This is certainly a possible variant. However, by  all means, the date by which we have to become an EC member is 1  January 1996. The main decisions on the political future of the  European Union will be made in 1996. Joint security policy,  joint foreign policy, and joint monetary policy will then be  discussed -- all decisive security questions. It is my wish  that Austria will be able to participate in the decisions and  have a say.    [NEWS] We are currently witnessing a race for NATO  membership of the former East Bloc states surrounding us. You  said two years ago that you think that neutrality presently is  outdated, and you were criticized severely for it at that  time....    [Klestil] I said that the State Treaty has to be considered  fulfilled and, therefore, obsolete. Because otherwise there  will be the danger that successor states of the Soviet Union  suddenly will call for their rights as partners of Austria. The  developments that have taken place so far have borne me out.  Referring to neutrality, I said that it has to be adjusted to  the new reality. If you have a look at the threats of today,  which go far beyond the military sphere -- floods of refugees,  drug-related crime, organized crime -- a new way of thinking is  required in the field of security. Neutrality has never been an  end in itself; neutrality serves security -- and if a collective  security system that serves security more than neutrality is  developed in Europe, then one should be able to think about it.

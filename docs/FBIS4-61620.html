			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- Russia's former Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy intends to take part in the presidential  elections and hopes he will be backed by "his" party, Popular  Party Free Russia (PPFR). He confirmed this in an interview  with ITAR-TASS, saying: "If I am nominated, I will run".    Aleksandr Rutskoy admitted that he is no longer related to  the Civic Union coalition, of which he used to be one of the  leaders. Rutskoy explained: "I did not distance myself from the  Civic Union, on the contrary, its leaders have distanced  themselves from me". He added that the latter, particularly  leader of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  Arkadiy Volskiy "betrayed those who was at the sources of the  movement".    As concerns the PPFR, of which he is an honorary chairman,  Rutskoy said that not all of its members "took a firm stand  during the September-October events" (Rutskoy was referring to  armed resistance to President Yeltsin's decision to disband the  parliament in the autumn of 1993) and had to leave the party.  The PPFR is planning to hold a congress this month to consider  the party's new rules and program and "identify positions with a  view to winning the new elections and conduct reforms in the  interests of the people".    As concerns his part in the last autumn events, Aleksandr  Rutskoy confirmed that he continues to think that his actions  were right. "What else could be done, if we acted in conformity  with the laws of the land, in conformity with the constitution".    According to Rutskoy, about 500 people were killed in  October  and not 149 as officially reported.    Responding to a question about his relations with former  parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, Rutskoy said there were  differences between them but they were not of "principled  nature".    The former vice-president said he is now working on several  books. One of them, "The Collapse of a Great Power", will  present an objective analysis of "what happened to us and how we  found our selves in this disgraceful situation". Another book  "will set forth new approaches to state building and economic  reforms, a political program and a new Russian idea as I see it".</p>

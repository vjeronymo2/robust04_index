			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Igor Malashenko, general director of the NTV </F> television company, by Andrey Yevdokimov under the rubric "First  Hand"; date not given: "We Do Not Get Involved in Conspiracies"]    [Text] Moscow-St. Petersburg --[Yevdokimov] Did you know  that the leaders of St. Petersburg TV are explaining the  "stirring up of scandal around St. Petersburg TV and its leaders  as a unique kind of 'smoke screen' for large-scale operations  for commercial structures to seize television broadcasting  networks from NTV." They are saying that NTV is backed by  Israeli capital and the abbreviation NTV, which is well known to  the viewers, means nothing other than "Non-Russian Television."    [Malashenko] I cannot say that we were very disturbed by  Viktor Sergeyevich Pravdyuk's latest statements against us. They  are more a characterization of him personally. If he allows  himself to use as arguments things such as reproaches for  "non-Russian" origin and the domination of Israeli capital, I  can only express my amazement. That people who are proud of  their impeccable credentials as democrats end up with such  extraordinary ease among those who fan the flames of hysteria  regarding the so-called worldwide Jewish conspiracy.  Incidentally, Mr. Pravdyuk's patron, Mikhail Nikiforovich  Poltoranin, has also taken to making such statements recently.    [Yevdokimov] Has NTV made any attempt to seize the  television  broadcasting network of Channel 5?    [Malashenko] As you know, NTV covers the network of Channel  4. And we have no intention of taking any network away from  other television companies. I will tell you that quite  definitely. Although I must note that the problem is much more  complicated than it might seem at first glance. In Russia there  is a complex system of radio relay lines, transmitters, and  various auxiliary services that support television broadcasting.  And no one television company may have any exclusive, fixed  rights to them.    I cannot deny that two oblasts came to us requesting  assistance in switching their broadcasting from St. Petersburg's  Channel 5 to NTV's Channel 4. The reason is that St. Petersburg  TV is not attractive enough and there is delay in paying for the  services of the communications workers. We made no decision  regarding these requests and we will not do anything without  notifying the Ministry of Communications, the Rostelekom  joint-stock company, and other organizations.    As for the GTRK [State Television and Radio Broadcasting  Company] St. Petersburg..., they, of course, have problems of  their own. But the company's leaders are deeply deceived if they  think that these problems can be resolved by administrative  pressure.    I wish to emphasize that NTV is not involved in any  conspiracies and in general we have too many problems of our own  to think too frequently about the leadership of St. Petersburg  television.    [Yevdokimov] Please explain the causes of the conflict  related to the rental of Russian films on our television...    [Malashenko] We buy the rights to rent Russian and foreign  films strictly in keeping with copyright legislation. The  corresponding agreements stipulate the obligations of the  holders of these rights to respond to all claims right down to a  judicial investigation. I must say that I first learned from you  that St. Petersburg TV has certain agreements for films that we  show. I will take the liberty of questioning that--I am too  familiar with the leasing practice of past years, when nobody at  all was interested in the observance of copyrights.    [Yevdokimov] But there is a generally accepted practice for  resolving such disputes. Why can everything not be taken care of  peacefully?    [Malashenko] We have sent a letter about this to St.  Petersburg and it contained similar proposals. But we have  received no answer. Therefore we intend to go to court and  resolve the dispute by purely legal methods.    [Yevdokimov] Can you confirm or deny the version that says  that one of the reasons for the scandal surrounding St.  Petersburg television and its leaders is the backroom activity  at NTV?    [Malashenko] That is absolute baloney! You can use whatever  epithets you like. I think the same mentality is at the bottom  of these absurd accusations. If you believe in an immense,  worldwide conspiracy against the duped people of Russia, there  absolutely must be other, smaller conspiracies as well. It is  very convenient to use such concepts to explain various mishaps  and personal squabbles--the guilty parties are always at hand.</p>

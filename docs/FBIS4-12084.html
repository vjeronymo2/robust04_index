			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by NATIONAL </F> NEWS AGENCY correspondent, Ma'ruf al-Da'uq, in Beirut on 4 April  -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Da'uq] Can you tell us what you discussed with  His Excellency Prime Minister al-Hariri at this lengthy meeting?    [Buwayz] The meeting dealt with several major political  issues, those concerning the regional situation and foreign  policy and those concerning the domestic situation. Lebanon is  undoubtedly coming to a sensitive stage as far as the [peace]  negotiations are concerned, especially in view of the progress  made in the Palestinian-Israeli file and the efforts being made  to boost the negotiations. I believe the Lebanese arena should  be fortified in a way that will enable Lebanon to deal with this  stage using all its resources and capabilities.    Regarding the domestic situation and the political, media,  and security issues, I believe that despite everything, this  stage requires action that will enable Lebanon to get through  this critical stage.    [Al-Da'uq] His beatitude the [Maronite] patriarch, in his  Easter message two days ago, raised the issue of the Christians'  participation and the lack of a balanced treatment of  Christians. What is your view of this and of the patriarch's  message?    [Buwayz] I do not believe anyone is saying he has achieved  his every ambition for Lebanon, be it in relation with national  unity, democracy, or the development of the political system.  The crux of the matter is that this state has not inherited  much. This state has not inherited establishments, only  destruction and ruin. We have many more ambitions for Lebanon.  As for the timing for achieving them, the state undoubtedly  need not rush through each stage, but should make particular,  constant progress toward strengthening national accord, building  the state of institutions and the state of justice, and toward  achieving the accurate, developed, and real representation, not  of individuals, as much as of political ideas.    [Al-Da'uq] Minister, the vanguards of the Palestinian police  started to arrive in the Gaza Strip today. Will the start of  the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement help boost the  negotiations, specifically on the Lebanese-Israeli track?    [Buwayz] The Israeli side's excuse in the previous round of  negotiations was its inability to advance on several fronts and  that the Palestinian file remained open, requiring it to be  focused upon before embarking on other files. It appears now  that this file has made some progress on its principal points.  So we are asking what the next excuse will be. In the previous  round, the Israeli side claimed that the Israeli Government's  domestic position did not allow the adoption of or commitment to  decisive decisions. Now, following the development of this  domestic position and these new alliances we see in the Israeli  domestic arena, we believe there can be no excuses for keeping  the negotiations stalled and futile. We believe there might be  some appropriate climate if the Israeli side really wants to be  serious in the coming stage.    [Al-Da'uq] Minister, have you been told that the U.S.  secretary of state might visit Lebanon during his next tour?    [Buwayz] I believe this tour remains vague; its itinerary  has  not been drawn up.    [Al-Da'uq] Thank you, Minister.</p>

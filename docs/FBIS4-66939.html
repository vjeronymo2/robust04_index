They learned  recently that there was hashish on board the Berceuse, a Belgian  ship coming from Morocco. They also learned that the drugs  would be transshipped at sea onto the Orca, a small fishing  vessel from Zeebrugge. On the night of 23 April, the two ships  were intercepted at sea as the transshipment was taking place.  The crew was caught red-handed, and the cargo and vessels were  seized.

(Warsaw PAP  in English 1848 GMT 26 Apr 94)    Customs officers at Gatwick Airport have been sickened by a  sleazy new tactic adopted by cocaine smugglers. A kilo of the  drug -- worth 72,000 British pounds -- was discovered hidden in  excrement, packed among foodstuffs, apparently brought into  Britain by a Nigerian woman. The find was made after a flight  from Nigeria landed. David Chesters, assistant collector for  Her Majesty's Customs, said: "There was an appalling smell and  the Customs Hall had to be fumigated. This is the first time I  have come across such a tactic. Clearly, they were trying to  fool the sniffer dogs."    Officers at the airport said: "The stench was appalling.  We're used to people swallowing condoms full of cocaine and  waiting for them to pass it through, but this was disgusting."  (London PRESS ASSOCIATION 0350 GMT 28 Apr 94)</p>

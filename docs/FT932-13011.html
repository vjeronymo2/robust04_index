			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Glut of offices remains despite damage FOR THE second time in little more than a year the City has reluctantly begun the gruesome calculations of how an IRA bomb will affect the City's oversupply of office space. Chartered surveyors, agents and property companies were yesterday keenly aware that the City's reputation and attractiveness as an international financial centre has been severely damaged. Already one firm, Wates City, had set up shop within the heart of the Corporation of London to place tenants in vacant properties. But just as the shock waves of the Bishopsgate bombing may have spread further this time, so the short term benefit to the property market may be greater than when the IRA bombed St Mary Axe in April last year. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors estimated yesterday - without the benefit of a tour of the most badly affected area - that tenants occupying 1.1m square feet of office space have been badly affected by the bomb. By comparison, the St Mary Axe bomb led to 300,000 sq ft of additional property being let after two buildings bore the brunt of the attack, according to the property surveyors, Jones Lang Wootton. Mr George Grillon, chairman of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, said yesterday that it was far too early to say how much of the damaged space would be back in service after easy and quick re-glazing efforts by the thousands of glaziers already swarming through the City. But any increase in demand would come against a backdrop of chronic oversupply. Within the boundaries of the City of London there are about 3.5m sq ft of new and unoccupied office premises ready for use and about the same quantity available within older buildings. Extending the survey area marginally to include a broader definition of the City - taking in post codes EC1 to EC4 - there are 5m sq ft of new office space and another 7.5m in older buildings. Additional capacity would also come out of mothballs should the property market show any sign of firming. Other considerations suggest the damage to the City's reputation might have a more enduring impact than the increase in demand. The larger affected companies - such as NatWest and HSBC - have contingency arrangements that mainly involve squeezing into space they already occupy elsewhere in London. Also, lessors have an obligation to return to their original buildings once they are repaired, so any increase in demand would be temporary.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Quest for clues to general election STRATEGISTS from the main political parties were preparing early today for a deep analysis of the results of yesterday's local council elections to assess the prospects for an early general election. Polling in 369 local authorities in all parts of the country apart from Scotland, Northern Ireland and greater London provided the most important test of the post-Thatcher Tory party and the last big test before a decision on election timing must be made. Mr John Major, the prime minister, together with Mr Chris Patten, Conservative party chairman and his advisers, will be examining the results to see whether June remains an option or whether a date in the autumn or next year is now inevitable. Apart from Mr Major's own standing, the polls were regarded as a crucial test for the proposed council tax. Ministers were anxious to discover whether the plan for a property-based local tax had received general approval and had therefore managed to kill local government finance as an issue damaging to the government's electoral prospects. Party analysts were particularly keen to study results from three areas  - the north-west, the west and the east Midlands - where the next election might be won or lost. Each area has a high proportion of Tory-held marginals. Among the councils that Labour had to capture if it is to have any chance of winning the next election were Nottingham City, where the two main parties were level-pegging, with the balance of power held by a Green party member; West Lancashire District, where the Tories were defending a majority of one; and Derby City, where the Conservatives were also battling to retain power. At Gravesham Borough Council in Kent, often regarded as a seat that tends to reflect the parties' national standing, Conservatives and Labour were neck-and-neck, with the casting vote in the hands of the Conservative mayor. Although most of the 28,500 candidates contesting the 12,255 seats at stake accepted that many voters regarded the elections as a dry run for a general election, local issues may have proved decisive in many areas. The Liberal Democrats, more than any other party, have concentrated their resources on local issues and were hoping to repeat the previous pattern of doing much better in local elections than their national opinion poll standing would suggest. Gateway to the future: votes cast in Park ward in Nottingham may help to decide the date of the general election Decision-making process: a vote goes into the box People power: a voter leaves the polling station Voters make a mark in Woking in Surrey: the poll tax crisis in the UK has prompted new interest in local politics</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ni Weiling (0242 0251 7881): "A Year of </F> Implementation of the Center's Emergency Circular on Lightening  Peasant Burdens Leaves Concern About the Good News, With Some  Peasant Burdens in Liaoning Province Still Quite Heavy"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] So how has the job of  lightening peasant burdens actually been implemented in Liaoning  Province?  <H3>  A Year of Conscientious Enforcement Has Brought Countless  Great Achievements </H3>   On 19 November 1993, the State Council Peasant Burden  Enforcement Inspection Group fully affirmed Liaoning Province's  work in lightening peasant burdens.    In 1993, Liaoning has lightened peasant burdens by over 200  million yuan. The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and  Peoples Government have inventoried 98 documents on 113 items  involving peasant burdens; they have published and issued  700,000 copies of the "Regulations on Peasant Responsibility for  Costs and Labor Management," with supervisory organs having  dealt with 28 cadres for discipline violations; Liaoning  Province and all townships have set up committees on lightening  peasant burdens, with many peasants having received "burden  cards"; according to State Council provision, direct payments  by peasants throughout Liaoning of village charges and township  overall planning fees have been kept under 5 percent of the  previous year's per capita net income. Heishan County has  discontinued 410 village mess halls, saving 1.68 million yuan a  year. Peasants report that these actions have provided real  incentives.  <H5>  But Peasant Burdens Remain Quite Heavy in Some Areas </H5>   As to the current existing problems in peasant burdens, I  interviewed Xiao Zuofu [5135 0155 4395], director of the  Liaoning Control and Management Commission on Lightening Peasant  Burdens. Vice Governor Xiao pointed out sharply that: "We are  now again suffering certain setbacks in peasant burdens, the  real root of which is the higher authorities, with beyond-quota  apportionments occurring at times, in which some departments  mandate apportionments through executive orders, while the  leaders of certain other departments give them a free hand. This  needs to be stopped at the source, with investigation and  prosecution of each case, not even a single case going  unpunished, and the disposition results being broadcast in the  media and published in the papers for public viewing."    Good! Just take a look at this example.    On 18 December 1993, I interviewed an office director in the  Shenyang Municipal Government Office on Lightening Peasant  Burdens, who waved a document at me and complained that: "Even  we are being obstructed. Despite our decision to charge peasants  only 2 fen [cents] a KWh for power, the province has issued a  document raising this to 2.5 fen." The units issuing this  document were the "Provincial Pricing Bureau, the Provincial  Agropower Office, and the Provincial Power Industry Bureau."  When I reported this matter to Vice Governor Xiao, he  immediately made a phone call to investigate it, telling me that  "without the approval of the Liaoning Management Committee on  Lightening Peasant Burdens, arbitrary issuing of documents to  raise prices is prohibited."    Such "audaciousness" is not limited to this one case alone!    While the Liaoning Party Committee and Government published  in LIAONING RIBAO on 2 July 1993 its first group of 10 peasant  burdens to be eliminated, one of which was the "charge for  keeping a dog," departments, such as the Anshan Municipal Public  Security Bureau and the Anshan Management Office on the Keeping  of Dogs, still issued an official document in September,  brazenly charging peasants 50 yuan per dog, which one case alone  cost peasants the huge amount of millions of yuan!    Good, that's enough! Any more such details might lead to  concern that I was seizing on these incidents to exaggerate the  matter.    But there are even more infuriating cases.    In Changtu County, 59 percent of the salaries of public  school teachers are actually paid by peasants, meaning that the  over 14 million yuan becomes a peasant burden! And for the whole  city of Tieling, this figure reaches a high of 27.9 million yuan.    And even this is not the whole extent of the problem.    Peasants complain bitterly about tractor fees. I  investigated this matter in the two cities of Shenyang and  Jinzhou, finding that 1,000-2,000 yuan a year has to be paid to  the authorities for one "small four-wheeler," with more than 20  fees, and even an idle tractor requiring the payment of an  eight-month road toll!    The city of Benxi has 3,400 tractors, meaning an extra  annual  expense of over 50 million yuan, which forces peasants who own  tractors to collectively appeal to the authorities for help.  Even worse, peasants in the vicinity of Gaotaizi Township in  Benxi had to pay 5 yuan to drive their tractors across a bridge,  and the same toll again on their return, which ended only after  the toll booth had been repeatedly toppled by the peasants.    A host of mandated press charges weighs heavily on peasants.  I discovered in Shengli Township, Heishan County that the  township was unable to stop the assessed quotas assigned by  various departments, with 803 press subscriptions throughout the  township for 41 newspapers and periodicals, costing over 40,000  yuan. Such burdens are also very much the same for other  townships.    In addition, peasants are also threatened by certain other  hidden peasant burdens:    1. While certain peasant-burden items have been removed in  1993, their staffs and agencies are still not fully dismantled.  While the burden of "timber buying- and selling-agent fees" has  been abolished in the Kuandian Manchu Autonomous County, the 286  personnel in company-installed centers in all villages have  certainly not yet been dismissed.    2. While the center has clearly ordered that peasant burdens  are to be controlled at 5 percent, with no one daring to  overstep this limit, certain poverty-stricken townships have too  many economic problems to cope with, so are forced to raise  money by borrowing from Peter to pay Paul. And how could such  debts not be later put onto peasants heads?    3. Peasants complain bitterly about the public fundraising  problems of the Taizi He [river] dredging project. In the next  four years, the Liaoyang section of the Taizi He will need 25.52  million yuan to be raised, or 18 yuan a year per capita,  amounting to 1.6 percent of peasant burdens; and the Haicheng  section will require an additional 60 million yuan, costing  peasants 20 yuan a year each.    4. Certain townships have persistently high spending on  entertainment, with it being common for donkey carts to come to  collect the empty wine bottles. Might not such extravagant  entertainment be running wild?    And there are 5, 6, 7, etc.    So what does all of this say?    As to resolving the fundraising by all departments, no one  is  willing to "fill up the holes." And the projects that need  stopped or slowed are like stiff-necked "ducks." This is the  concentrated expression of a problem: Some departments are so  blinded by greed and insatiably avaricious that it makes one  boil with anger! In their own selfish interests, they brazenly  exploit their authority to wantonly hold out their hands to the  peasants. Unless such regressive corruption is ruthlessly and  thoroughly punished, its cheating of the peasants will grow even  worse.  <H5>  What Is the Root of the Heavy Peasant Burdens? </H5>   "While the problem of heavy peasant burdens shows up in the  rural areas, it is rooted in all upper-level departments." The  center has sharply pointed out the crux of the matter.    In a document entitled "The Pace of Reform Needs Speeded  Up,"  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out acutely that: The  objective that our reform needs to reach is to develop the  productive forces under the leadership of the party and the  socialist system. Rural reform was necessary to stimulate  peasant initiative. Why did reform have to start in the rural  areas? This is because the rural population makes up 80 percent  of China's population so that, without rural stability, our  overall political situation would be unstable and, unless  peasants overcome their poverty, China will not cast off its  poverty.    Lightening peasant burdens is essentially the major matter  of  stimulating peasant initiative. Today's peasants, as producers  and consumers, are the most important players in China's market  economy, so that their initiative is the most vital element of  the productive forces. Formalistic things among the  abovementioned leading cadres of certain departments, such as  not yet having escaped in their heart of hearts from the  longstanding planned-economy trap, still being accustomed to  issuing the same old orders, going in for grandiose  achievements, and engaging in unrealistic striving for position,  competition, and reaching standards, are precisely the real root  of the heavy peasant burdens! What they lack is exactly the key  line of an objective approach!    No wonder the first group of 46 rural standard reachings  that  were eliminated by Liaoning included those, such as "reaching  toilet standards," "rat-extermination standards," and  "fuel-economy standards." The following jingle is spreading in  the area around Changtu, Liaoning: "Tobacco, big sheds, and  irrigated wheat are the peasants' three scourges." The disaster  is that certain cadres apply or copy mechanically, without  regard for the relation beween market supply and demand,  forcibly raising funds from peasants to start projects. From  this "construction project" and that "reaching of the standard"  to your village raising funds to install a computerized  telephone system, everything is praised, so that my village too  must install one. Such "left" formalistic things that proceed  not from reality have pervasively infiltrated from life to the  system and directly into the bones of certain leading cadres,  thus leading to a onesided emphasis on enlarging and developing  the collective economy at the expense of property-rights  components, and to a unilateral stress on the dominance of the  publicly owned economy to the neglect of the reality of the  coexistence of diversified economic components. How could an  ideological method and workstyle that so distorts reality not  make peasant burdens too heavy?  <H5>  On Daring To Ask the Way </H5>   The basic way to solve the heavy peasant burden will be for  the leading cadres of the abovementioned departments to give  their minds a rest, by genuinely shifting their standpoints from  a planned economy to a socialist market economy, and  conscientiously establishing objective ideological concepts.    As a socialist market economy is one that is governed by law  and order, particular attention needs to be paid to establishing  laws and regulations for the rural economy and peasant assets,  in order to strengthen oversight and inspection mechanisms, so  that peasants dare to face up to their material interests, by  taking a genuine part in the legislative process. It is only in  this way that the laws and regulations to protect and lighten  peasant burdens will be able to lead the way out of the burdens  that infringe on peasant interests!    Whether Liaoning's second undertaking can now rely on taking  off on the two wings of agriculture and industry, by lightening  peasant burdens to stimulate peasant initiative, is of extreme  importance.    As peasant problems are of importance to the national  economy  and the people's livelihood, better lightening peasant burdens  is a top priority for Liaoning's intensification of rural  reform! We can no longer allow man-made problems to make  peasants run our roads carrying such heavy burdens.    This is a demand and a call of history and of the times!</p>

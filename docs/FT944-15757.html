			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Snail's pace at Japan's MoF It has been clear for more than two decades that the rigid compartmentalisation of the Japanese banking system is based on functional divisions that no longer correspond with market reality. Yet the deregulation of the system has been a peculiarly tortured exercise in gradualism, as last week's events demonstrated once again. The decision by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to sanction the plans of five city banks to set up securities subsidiaries is an important step. Yet it amounts to no more than a partial retreat from the restrictions of Article 65 of the Japanese Securities and Exchange Act - the equivalent of the US Glass-Steagall Act, which prevents banks from conducting securities business. While the city banks will now be permitted to underwrite corporate bond issues, their desire to compete in the wider securities area has been frustrated by the lobbying of the securities firms, whose profits have suffered in the aftermath of the bubble economy, and by the conservatism of the MoF's own officials. That is not to say that limited concessions are worthless. In a world where corporations increasingly cut out the banking middleman and go direct to the markets for funds, an entree into the bond markets will be welcome to the city banks, just as it has already been welcomed by the long-term credit banks. But if regulation is to be aligned with market logic in bonds, why not in equities too? Motor for change Of the main forces for financial deregulation in Japan, bad debts are proving a far more potent motor for change than external pressure from the US and elsewhere. Last week, no doubt with a nudge from the MoF, Mitsubishi Bank paid Y200bn (Pounds 1.3bn) for a controlling stake in Nippon Trust, the troubled trust bank that is expected to record the first post-tax loss in Japanese banking history in its current financial year. Mitsubishi has, in compensation, been granted a mandate to explore all those trust bank activities which another recent set of semi-liberalising measures from the MoF has kept off-limits for the city banks as a group. In particular, Mitsubishi will have access to potentially lucrative pension fund management business, which will be a source of envy to its peers. There are plenty of precedents for such a regulatory trade-off. In the US in the 1980s inter-state regulatory boundaries and functional dividing lines between banks and savings and loans were dropped on an ad hoc basis to divert the cost of socialising bank losses away from the federal budget. And in Japan last year Daiwa Bank was given carte blanche to conduct the full range of securities activities in exchange for rescuing the medium-sized broking firm Cosmo Securities. Deficiency of assets If there is a difference in the approach on either side of the Pacific, it is simply that the scale of the down payments on a regulatory exeat in Japan looks exceptionally large. For Mitsubishi Bank Y200bn is not enough to make a significant dent in its capital ratios, but it is still a high price to pay for a trust bank that has a sizeable deficiency of assets against liabilities. Also striking is that liberalisation has not, in Japan, been synonymous with profit. Those foreigners who obtained seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange just in time for the collapse of the Japanese stock market know that the experience can be as expensive as it is liberating. And despite the enormous freedom that Daiwa Bank now enjoys across the financial services markets, it has yet to translate it into a notably superior performance. Given the extent of the bad debt problem in Japanese banking, there will probably be further cases where the MoF is prepared to drop its regulatory guard in the interests of stabilising the system more cheaply. Yet the overall pace of deregulation looks set to remain turgid. That will be a profound relief to the less efficient players in the system. The same applies to bankers in more flexibly regulated financial centres in other countries, since a disproportionate amount of Japanese financial business will continue to be diverted off-shore. It is a remarkable feature of this otherwise profoundly competitive nation that it should offer such generosity to its rivals in an important area of international trade.</p>

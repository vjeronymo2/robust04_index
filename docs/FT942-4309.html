			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: High price to pay for the right to work Sir, In his article, 'Hand-up, not hand-out' (June 7), Joe Rogaly says 'you have to settle for less regulation and less welfare if you want more people in jobs'. This appears to overlook the little matter of money - and it is no little matter, not only to the employers and employees but to the government. If you wish to hire a machine you are free to do so provided you pay 17.5 per cent VAT for the privilege. Hire a human being on the other hand and the freedom comes at a much higher price. Wrapped up in three slices comprising Pay as You Earn and employee's and employer's national insurance contributions the rates may not look too bad. But combine them and express the total tax as a percentage of the net wage and you have a figure which could surely satisfy all but the most grasping of tyrants. For example, at a nominal (or gross) wage of only Pounds 15,000 a year 49.3 per cent of the net wage of Pounds 11,090 is effectively levied by the government as taxation, resulting in the employer having to pay a total of Pounds 16,560. Is it any wonder that, with tax at this sort of level on relatively low incomes, more and more businessmen prefer part-time employees, especially if they are below the tax thresholds? Alternatively, in the case of goods, arrangements can be made to make them abroad; and, in the case of services, the customers can be employed, free of tax, to serve themselves (self-service), or do the work themselves (DIY). How can any hand-up, as suggested by Rogaly, have any more than a cosmetic effect when compared to the 'push-down' consequences of such onerous tax? After all, we are talking about tens of billions of pounds that are being charged for the right to work. This must have, must it not, some effect on the labour market, unless 2 and 2 no longer make 4? J P Read, St Anne's, 8 Turner Drive, London NW11 6TX</p>

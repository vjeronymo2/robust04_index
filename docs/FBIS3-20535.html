			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Tong (6253 0681)] </F>   [Text] [Staff report] Since the advent of the 1990's, the  buildup in the transportation and telecommunications industry  which has played an important role in developing the national  economy has entered a stage of accelerated growth. Since 1993 in  particular, the scope of capital investment and the rate of  growth in many new projects have been heightened, and the  macroeconomic picture looks good. This indicates that the  buildup in China's transportation and telecommunications  industry has made a big leap into another phase.    Large-Scale Capital Investment and Accelerated Growth. By  the end of 1993, investments by state units in the  transportation and communications industry have broken through  the hundred billion yuan mark, while reflecting a more than  one-fold growth, an increase of 44 percentage points over that  for the same period a year ago. The proportion of capital  investment also rose from 16 percent for the same period a year  ago to 21 percent in 1993. Among these, investment in new  projects in basic construction and improvements for the  transportation and telecommunications industry costing more than  5 million yuan each totalled 41.5 billion yuan, also more than  one-fold over outlays for the previous year. Its proportion of  the total capital investment also rose to 20.9 percent from the  14.6 percent figure for the previous period a year ago. The  scope of capital investment and the rapid rate of growth are  unprecedented.    Numerous Completed Projects With Good Macroeconomic  Benefits. Up to the present time, important projects already  completed and placed into operation include the Wujiaba airport  in Kunming, the Gongyi airport in Lhasa, the Tianho airport in  Wuhan, a new passenger terminal in Shenyang, the second phase of  the Da-Qin [Dalian to Qinhuangdao] railway, the Xuan-Hangzhou  [Xuancheng to Hangzhou] dual line, the Jiejiang-Jiangxi dual  line, the Jiao-Zhi dual line, the Bin-Zhou [Haerhbin-Manzhouli]  dual line, the Guang-Mei-Shan [Guangzhou-Meixian-Shantou] line  etc. The 318-kilometer highway from Jinan to Qingdao, built at a  cost of 3.1 billion yuan, is the single largest investment item  in China's highway construction history. Of sound quality  construction, its completion in record time for automobile  travel is highly significant toward furthering economic  development on the Shandong peninsula and stepped-up opening and  exploration of its western part, with circulation of  commodities, construction and exploration of the Shengli  oilfields, and development of the Huang He delta. It has become  an important conduit linking China's interior with its coastal  region. The Qingdao-Jinan highway can accommodate as much as 80  million tons of freight annually, comparable to one and one-half  times that carried on the Jiao-Jinan rail link. Social benefits  derived from this operation are increased by 5 billion yuan  annually. The macroeconomic advantages are outstanding.    Rapid Progress on Current Projects. Ongoing large projects  at present include electrification of the Beijing-Guangzhou  Railroad, construction of the Western Passenger Terminal in  Beijing, the Lan-Xin [Lanzhou to Xinjiang] dual line, the  circumferential highway on Hainan Island, and the first phase of  an engineering project on the bay approaching the port of  Qingdao, the second phase of projects at the port of  Zhangjiagang, and Miaoling at the port of Lianyungang. For the  Beijing-Kowloon Railway that has attracted worldwide attention,  403 kilometers of track have been laid down and completed. By  the end of October, 6.1 billion yuan of investment capital have  been expended, and 94.5 percent of the annual plan has been  completed. Among ongoing projects, 184 kilometers of track has  been laid on the Jing-Heng [Beijing-Hengyang] segment, while 217  kilometer has been laid on the Heng-Shang segment.    An Optimistic Future. Not long ago, the State Council  approved for immediate startup, a series of structural  construction projects for use in transportation and  telecommunications. For example, a capital investment of 3.5  billion yuan to lay down 369 kilometers of track for the  Bao-Cheng [Baoji-Chengdu] dual line, which is an important  transportation channel for southwestern China, has been planned.  A capital investment of 2.5 billion yuan on a project to  electrify the Chengdu-Kunming line, laying tracks on all 1,100  kilometers of its length will, upon completion, improve its  transportation capacity more than three times over its present  level. Furthermore, an overall investment of 2 billion yuan to  lay 251 kilometers of track on a second line traversing southern  Fujian province, as well as a capital investment of 1.6 billion  yuan for building the Fushan-Kaiping highway have been planned.  Construction on these projects foretell another giant step  forward made by China's transportation and telecommunications  industry, and its important effect on furthering economic  development in the national economy.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Swedish premier makes a passionate plea to vote 'Yes' MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday warned that a French vote against European union could contribute to instability in central and eastern Europe. 'This is as important as the years immediately after both world wars,' said Mr Bildt, in an impassioned plea for a French 'Yes' on September 20, issued at a youth meeting of the European Movement - a European lobby group - in southern France. This is the first such appeal in France's Maastricht referendum campaign from a head of government of a country applying to join the European Community. Mr Bildt was invited precisely to drive home to French voters the wider impact of their decision, said Mr Jean Francois Poncet, former French foreign minister and president of the European Movement in France. Political and monetary union in western Europe would provide a stable model as an alternative to countries like Yugoslavia riven by 'the forces of aggressive nationalism,' said Mr Bildt. 'If that alternative is not offered by a European union that works, these forces could well grow in power to the danger of us all.' Until now, the European Community had grown up mainly to serve its own members' needs, from ensuring peace to dismantling trade barriers. External demands would take increasing prominence, so intensifying the need for increased security and foreign policy co-ordination, he argued. It was vital for Sweden to be part of a strong European union, because it did not want to be a 'footnote country.' A French 'No' would harden the small majority of Swedish public opinion currently against EC membership, though Mr Bildt believed opinion would swing back again by the time Sweden holds its own referendum in 1994.</p>

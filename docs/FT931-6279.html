			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Worldwide demand lifts Levi Strauss to new highs LEVI STRAUSS, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, reported record sales and earnings for 1992 and became the first apparel company to exceed Dollars 5bn in annual sales. The company said worldwide consumer demand for its denim jeans and US demand for its casual clothing lines were strong. Levi Strauss Associates, the privately-held parent company of Levi Strauss &amp; Company, reported net sales for the year of Dollars 5.6bn, a 14 per cent increase over the Dollars 4.9bn in 1991. Net income for the year was Dollars 360.8m, up 1 per cent from Dollars 356.6m, despite a Dollars 158m pre-tax stock-option charge in the third quarter. Excluding the charge, net income would have been approximately Dollars 475.8m, an increase of 33 per cent over 1991, the company said. Record revenues and unit sales, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expenses contributed to the income rise, the company said. 'Our results are particularly gratifying during a period of economic uncertainty in many of the markets that we serve worldwide,' said Mr George James, chief financial officer. For the fourth quarter of 1992, Levi unveiled net sales of Dollars 1.6bn, which were up 15 per cent from the same period last year.</p>

Baker III barred a White House aide from delivering  a speech that he viewed as too pessimistic about Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's prospects, the New York Times reported. The move reflects the  caution with which the Bush Administration views the changing Soviet situation.  The speech was to have been delivered in Washington by Robert M. Gates, deputy  national security adviser.  </P></p>

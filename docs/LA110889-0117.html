			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY CENTER SITE OKD BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> A community center will open this month in a troubled Disneyland-area  neighborhood.  </P> <P> The City Council decided Tuesday night to rent a two-bedroom apartment for $820  a month in Jeffrey-Lynne, a five-block apartment area behind the Disneyland  Hotel. The council voted in June to spend $68,000 for the community center,  including hiring a full-time employee to staff it.  </P> <P> For nearly two years, residents of the predominantly Latino area have been  asking for a community center which would distribute information in Spanish  about health care, immigration, jobs and other services.  </P> <P> Opening a community center was one of the recommendations of a $50,000 study of  the neighborhood conducted earlier this year by a Santa Ana social service  agency. The apartment will be rented on a month-to-month basis to "allow the  city to assess the effectiveness . . . without a long-term commitment," said  Christopher K. Jarvi, director of Parks, Recreation and Community Services.  </P></p>

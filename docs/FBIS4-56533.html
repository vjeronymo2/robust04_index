			<p>BFN     [Text] University of Panama business administration  students closed the Transisthmian Highway for one hour today  causing traffic congestion on adjacent roads. The student  leaders reported that Arnulfist Party members threatened them  with firearms because they had blocked the road. From 1030 to  1145 [1530-1645 GMT] students closed the Transisthmian Highway  to demand the inclusion of certain subjects in their curriculum.    [Begin unidentified student recording] We have taken to the  street to protest a series of measures, the administration has  taken against the students. Registration has been closed, there  is no [words indistinct], we have no security at night, there  are no lights, there is no air conditioning, and we need desks  and classrooms. These are problems that the faculty is not  resolving. [end recording]    The student leaders reported that three men and a woman in a  green Mazda with license number 133088, displaying Arnulfista  Party propaganda in support of Legislator Lucas Zarak, took out  weapons and threatened the students if they did not allow them  through.    [Begin unidentified student recording] Occupants of a car  with propaganda flags and posters supporting Mr. Lucas Zarak of  the Arnulfist Party pulled guns on us and told us they were  going to go through anyway, and they threatened all of the  students, even the girls. If it had not been for Public Force  units, they would have fired their guns and wounded students.  [end recording]    Several minutes later, Public Force units asked the students  to end the roadblock, and after the university under secretary  arrived, the students ended the roadblock.</p>

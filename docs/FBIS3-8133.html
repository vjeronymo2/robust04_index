			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 3 (CTK) -- President Michal Kovac  is obliged to call a referendum within 30 days, because  "everyone has to respect the will of the citizens, (as expressed  in the recent referendum petition)" Premier Vladimir Meciar said  on Wednesday at a rally of the governing Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which he is chairman. Meciar  said that the situation in Slovakia was moving towards its  denouement, and that elections "would divide the wheat from the  chaff."    He said the president's refusal to appoint honorable  chairman  of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jozef Prokes as foreign  minister was an expression of lack of confidence in the HZDS,  the SNS, the premier and the whole government (Prokes would  replace the recently resigned Jozef Moravcik). Meciar attacked  President Kovac for not having found time in half a year to  receive him and Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic.  Meciar's announcement that the HZDS would not invite Kovac to  its conference was received with enthusiastic applause by those  present. Michal Kovac was elected president as an HZDS  candidate.    When Meciar read out a "question from the floor" as to  whether it would not be best to join the parliamentary elections  to the presidential ones, the crowd chanted "Dismiss, dismiss."    Meciar then commented on what some opposition politicians  and  foreign commentators had said about the referendum being a  possible threat to Slovakia's membership of the Council of  Europe. He said that Slovakia was observing all the commitments  which membership entailed, and that there was no need to doubt  the membership. The only unsolved question, he said, was that  of the Council of Europe recommendation concerning bilingual  names of towns and villages, but the Hungarian minority deputies  had "spoiled this themselves."    Meciar said his recent journey to China and Thailand had  been  a success, and in a clear reference to Czech President Vaclav  Havel's recent accident in Thailand, said he "had not broken a  rib" there. Just to be certain, however, he had not got into the  bath.    The premier expressed his dissatisfaction at the fact that  Russian Foreign Minister Andrej Kozyrev had not arrived on his  agreed visit to Slovakia on his February journey to the Visegrad  Four countries [the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and  Hungary]. Meciar said the postponement of the visit delayed the  balancing of the trade deficit with Russia, which has reached 15  billion Slovak crowns (about $500,000,000). Meciar added that  Slovakia was asking the Russians for an explanation. (Kozyrev  allegedly canceled his visit because of the instability on the  Slovak political scene.)</p>

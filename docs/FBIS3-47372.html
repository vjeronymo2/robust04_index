Luciano Pettinari, international secretary of the Italian  Party for Communist Refoundation, said the United States is  trying to justify its military threat to North Korea on the  pretext of "preventing" the latter's "nuclear program," but  could convince nobody of it. It is foolish of the United States  to try to force "sanctions" on North Korea through the UN  Security Council, he said, adding:    The point in question is that nuclear warheads aimed at the  North and more than 40,000 U.S. troops present in South Korea  pose a greater threat than a feasibility of North Korea's  "nuclear program".    S.J. Mabulla, chairman of the Scientific and Technical  Association of Tanzania, said that if the United States wants to  save its face as a great power, it had better honestly respond  to talks with the DPRK.    Noting that if the United States truly want a solution to  the  nuclear problem, it must sincerely accede to talks, the Radio  Reloj Nacional of Cuba said that a peaceful solution of the  nuclear problem depends entirely on the attitude of the United  States.    The Swiss paper UNSERE WELT said that the United States  should renounce its policy hostile to the DPRK and the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.</p>

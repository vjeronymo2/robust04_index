			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gaza Strip correspondent 'Amira Hess] </F>   [Text] The Palestinian self-rule appointments were made  without first establishing appropriate mechanisms necessary for  its success. This observation was made yesterday by Hisham  'Abd-al-Razzaq, a senior Fatah official in the Gaza Strip. "I  pity the council members, who are forced to keep promises they  are unable to keep." 'Abd-al-Razzaq was chiefly referring to  the fact that Western countries had pledged donations and loans  to the Palestinians, but have so far failed to make any  payments. "The world only cares when it sees blood. It acts  only when faced with tragic situations. Not only will the  agreement fail, it will become a major atomic bomb if the  economic situation in Gaza does not improve."    'Abd-al-Razzaq said the council's performance and the  success  of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement depended on three conditions:    -- The Israeli labor market must be open to all Palestinians  (and not merely to the 23,000 who had work permits prior to  February).    -- Donation funds should start arriving at once, and the  positions and tasks in the council and the Palestinian  self-rule's institutions should be properly distributed.    -- "All those who gave all they could and devoted themselves  to the Palestinian struggle should be taken into account" when  appointments are made.    A month ago 'Abd-al-Razzaq, who spent about 20 years in  prison, was mentioned as a possible appointment to the Autonomy  Council; this fact was received with great satisfaction in Gaza.    "I learned about my alleged appointment from the media, and  personally, I would prefer not to take on this thankless job,"  he told HA'ARETZ yesterday.    "But the noninclusion of people who were devoted to the  struggle is liable to lead to dire consequence." 'Abd-al-Razzaq  went on: "When a man is bitter, when he sees no reward to his  deeds and sacrifice, he will not settle for personal  disappointment. We are talking here about people who devoted  their lives to the struggle. These people's disappointment will  have a direct impact on the street."    'Abd-al-Razzaq did not answer our question on whether he and  his associates have apprised PLO-Tunis of the importance of  incorporating field activists in the council. "It would be  better for them to reach this conclusion on their own. I cannot  believe they do not understand it," he said.    A delegation of about 20 Israeli Arabs, including Dr. Ahmad  al-Tibi, visited Gaza yesterday. They met with Nasr Yusuf, the  General Security commander, in his office situated in what was  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] division building until two  weeks ago. Yusuf told the visitors: "We cannot say we are  independent yet, but this is our first step to independence."  He called for stronger ties between the two parts of the  Palestinian people -- "those outside (in the territories) and  inside (in Israel)."    Dr. al-Tibi echoed the statement that the agreement was the  fist step toward full independence, adding that "we will always  say that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state."</p>

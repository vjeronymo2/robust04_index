			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPLACING QUAYLE WITH BAKER  </P> <P> The Times article is interesting and insightful but you should not have stopped  just there.  </P> <P> The man who engineered the way for two Presidents, while concurrently placing  himself in a variety of career-advancing government positions, is far too  creative to allow his long-time friend and current President to select as his  first running mate someone who could keep the mantle of supreme power away from  Baker for an additional eight years.  </P> <P> The real thinking, begun long ago -- and by Baker himself -- probably was:  "I've done chief of staff, I've done Treasury, while I'm Vicar of State, I'll  make sure that my last steppingstone to the presidency will be only temporarily  occupied by a disposable VP."  </P> <P> Such a man as President could be an ominous force in the White House. But is  that good, or bad?  </P> <P> LAWRENCE R. GORDON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

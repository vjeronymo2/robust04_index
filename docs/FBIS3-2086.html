More than 98,200 private enterprises began last year,  bringing the total figure to about 268,000, China Business Times  reported.    Private firms' total tax turnover surpassed 29 billion yuan  ($3.33 billion) in 1993, a 43 percent rise over 1992. This  brings more social and economic benefits to the nation.    One new and important development was that private  enterprises began to re-invest more in business expansion.    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which  oversees private enterprises, said their registered capital hit  68.05 billion yuan ($7.82 billion). The average registered  capital for a private business increased last year 80 per cent  from 159,000 yuan ($18,276) in 1992 to 286,000 ($32,870).    And private enterprises with at least 1 million yuan  1$114,900) in registered capital reached 8,784, the paper  reported.    This was a 380 per cent growth in one year.    Meanwhile, 5,302 private enterprises employed 100 to 499  workers and 303 had more than 500 worker. Many private  enterprises have turned toward limited liability systems.    Last year a record 48,580 private companies with limited  liabilities were set up and their registered capital made up 64  percent of the total private enterprises capital.    While vying with State-owned enterprises in the domestic  market 2,000 private firms extended their businesses abroad last  year. earning about 1.58 billion yuan ($181.6 million) in  foreign exchange.    The quality of workers in these plants is also improving as  more university graduates and scientific and technical workers  are looking for jobs in the private market.    Another encouraging development, according to the newspaper,  was that more private enterprise owners have switched their  business focus to scientific and technological advisory services  and the tertiary industry.    Almost 60 percent of last year's 98,000 new private  enterprises are engaged in the tertiary services, especially  those providing high-tech services such as computer technology,  software development and private education services.    Despite the rapid development in the past decade, experts  say, the private economy is only at an infant stage in China and  its strength is still quite limited.</p>

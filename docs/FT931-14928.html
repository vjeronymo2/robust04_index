			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Blue Arrow RARELY THESE days does a clearing bank get the better of the government. However, the Department of Trade and Industry has spent Pounds 2.4m on an image-improvement exercise for NatWest. The DTI yesterday published the report of its second investigation into the bank's role in the Blue Arrow affair. The investigation was prompted in April by a request from NatWest's chairman, Lord Alexander. He had been concerned that the bank's image was being tarnished by allegations that it had concealed documents from the original DTI probe in 1989. These allegations were made during the Blue Arrow trials in 1991 and were widely reported in the press. Mr Tom Frost, then NatWest's chief executive, was the target of particular criticism. However, Lord Alexander was convinced of the bank's innocence. He was totally vindicated yesterday. The DTI inspectors are so dismissive of the allegations that there must be a question of why a full-scale inquiry was needed. The DTI's internal inspectors could surely have satisfied themselves that no second inquiry was needed - and the DTI could have made a statement to that effect. Instead two highly paid lawyers and an accountant were employed by the DTI to carry out a full investigation. The worst judgments that they can make of NatWest was that it was inexperienced in investment banking and inefficient  -which is a case of stating the obvious. On the other hand, the DTI has succeeded in further denting the Bank of England's reputation as a supervisor, which was bruised enough last year by widespread criticism of its supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt international bank. Though yesterday's report makes no direct criticism of the Bank, it demonstrates a lack of aggression in the Bank's work in maintaining the probity and soundness of UK banks. The introduction into the Bank of a new investigations department and a new legal unit, both run by outsiders, has come not a moment too soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Congress of Democratic Movements,  Conacom, calls for solidarity among democrats for a return of  constitutional order. In a communique, Conacom states that what  is immediately necessary is the overthrow of the Jonassaint  government; General Cedras' early retirement, respecting the  signature he put to the Governors Island agreement; and the  return of President Aristide as soon as possible. Among other  strategic actions, Conacom suggests holding meetings between  President Aristide and the representatives of democratic  political organizations for the purpose of expediting the  application of the Governors Island agreement; meetings between  the sectors that signed the New York pact, for the purpose of  studying the pact's clauses; and meetings between  representatives of democratic political organizations and the  nation's various social sectors with a view to obtaining these  sectors' support for these initiatives.    Conacom firmly believes that applying those proposals  courageously and without delay will allow us to spare the  country a catastrophe, while guaranteeing a return to  constitutional order, especially that of President Aristide,  states this Conacom press release.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri with </F> unidentified correspondents on 27 February; place not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Hariri] The most important thing is that the  Lebanese should not be dragged into this plan that is clearly  being supported by foreign hands. We are all one people, one  hand. Whatever pains one area pains another area. God willing,  we will transcend this ordeal and open our eyes so that no one  will deceive us.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Al-Hariri] It is clear [words indistinct] a Christian area  in Kasrawan to cause sectarian strife. However, it is clear  this will not affect the Lebanese. The Lebanese, Muslims and  Christians, are one hand.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]?    [Al-Hariri] The churches and mosques have their sanctity.  During the worst days of the Lebanese war, no such thing  happened. So it is clear that whoever did this thing wanted to  inflict a deep wound. However, the Lebanese with their  willpower and their faith in God and their homeland will not be  dragged into such plans.</p>

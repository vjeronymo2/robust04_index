			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Group 4 to run middle-risk prison Group 4, the security company, increased its strong position in Britain's emerging private prison market by winning the contract to run Buckley Hall prison at Rochdale, Greater Manchester, yesterday. Buckley Hall will house 350 medium-risk category C convicted prisoners, helping to ease pressure on prison spaces in the north-west. Group 4 already runs Wolds prison on Humberside and operates the service escorting prisoners to court in the east midlands and Yorkshire. The contract will be worth Pounds 33m over five years. Group 4's bid, which was not the lowest, was selected over three others from the private sector and a fourth from an in-house public-sector team. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, confirmed that the in-house bid had been 'very good', and Ms Joan Ruddock, shadow home affairs minister, immediately wrote to the government asking why it had been rejected. She said: 'Only last month the Commons public accounts committee discovered that Group 4's running of Wolds was costing Pounds 1m more than its original tender, yet today the government rewards the same private interests.' Mr Lewis said the Prison Service had been spoilt for choice by the bids. Growing experience of tendering to manage prisons was now generating high-quality bids from both the private and public sectors. Buckley Hall, a former junior detention centre, has been rebuilt in less than a year to rehouse adult prisoners - making it Britain's fastest-built jail in modern times. It will open in December, and create 150 full-time jobs. The award of the Buckley Hall contract marks the start of a further phase of market testing of prison management and advancing private-sector involvement. Invitations to tender for two big prisons to be built in Liverpool and south Wales have just gone out. The private sector is being asked to finance, design, build and manage these projects, and private prison operators are linking with construction companies to prepare bids - Group 4 will be bidding in conjunction with Tarmac. The government also plans to ask the private sector to bid to manage some established public prisons; the first one or two prisons selected for this process will be named in the autumn.</p>

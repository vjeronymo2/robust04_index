			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica shares rise sharply on solid earnings SHARES in BankAmerica rose sharply yesterday after the west coast banking group announced solid fourth-quarter earnings and the sale of about Dollars 1.7bn in problem property loans previously owned by Security Pacific, the California bank which merged with BankAmerica last year. The bad loans will be sold to a new company being formed by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and the net after-tax impact of the sale, following accounting adjustments, will reduce BankAmerica's assets by about Dollars 1bn. The bank has, however, decided to buy a Dollars 100m stake in the new company acquiring the loans. The investment, said Mr Raphael Soifer, banking analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, was made 'presumably to capture some upside potential in the assets'. The disposal of the property loans helped reduce the value of problem assets waiting to be sold - the bulk of them Security Pacific assets - from Dollars 5bn at the end of the previous quarter to Dollars 4.2bn. Also, analysts said the transaction with Morgan Stanley probably means BankAmerica will shelve its plans to set up a 'bad bank' - a separate company that would have been created to hold the problem assets until they were sold. Investors welcomed the disposal of the loans and the fourth-quarter earnings, bidding up BankAmerica stock to close at Dollars 53 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, a net gain of Dollars 2 1/8 . BankAmerica's profit of Dollars 473m during the October-December period, which included a Dollars 61m non-recurring charge on merger-related restructuring and other expenses, was virtually unchanged from the previous quarter. The figures were not comparable to the Dollars 285m earned in the same quarter of 1991, a period before the merger with Security Pacific. Total earnings for 1992 reached a record Dollars 1.49bn, against pre-merger profits of Dollars 1.12bn in 1991. Although the results were in line with market expectations, analysts said investors were cheered by the news that the bank's intangible assets, most of it goodwill from Security Pacific, had risen by only Dollars 296m in the quarter.</p>

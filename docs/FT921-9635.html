			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Abu Dhabi may pay Dollars 2.2bn to BCCI creditors CREDITORS IN the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are likely to receive Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 930m) - and possibly up to Dollars 2.2bn - from Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, under a negotiated settlement. This contrasts with the figure of Dollars 4bn which the emirate said it was prepared to pump into BCCI in April 1991, three months before the bank was closed by the Bank of England. On the basis of the bank's current estimated liabilities of about Dollars 10bn, the Abu Dhabi payment would be Dollars 1.7bn. If further liabilities emerged, the emirate would contribute a further 25 cents in the dollar up to a limit on its total involvement of Dollars 2.2bn. Taken together with the remaining Dollars 1.1bn of assets in both of BCCI's banking arms, BCCI SA in Luxembourg and BCCI (Overseas) in Grand Cayman, this would give creditors between Dollars 2.8bn and Dollars 3.3bn, from which they would receive compensation in instalments phased through to 1994. The full terms of the settlement negotiated between Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, and Abu Dhabi emerged yesterday. The agreement will be initialled by both parties, probably at the end of this week. It will then go to the courts in Luxembourg and Grand Cayman, and the High Court in London for final approval. This is expected to take a further eight to 10 weeks to achieve. The approval period will include consultations with creditors, many of whom are expected to criticise Abu Dhabi's contribution as insufficient. Once court approval is granted, the first payment out of the liquidation would be Dollars 300m, to be shared pro rata among creditors. The agreement with the emirate is conditional, however on its being accepted by 70 per cent of the creditors, representing about Dollars 7bn of currently known liabilities. A September 30 deadline has been set for acceptance of the deal, but the period may be extended to November 30. The liquidators settled for the formula deal with Abu Dhabi in preference to risking a lengthy legal battle. In return for the payment, Abu Dhabi would receive a release of claims and promises not to sue. Any creditors unwilling to accept would have no access to the Abu Dhabi contribution. Included in the arrangement is an unusual provision that treats the Abu Dhabi liquidation separately. The deal includes an arrangement allowing Abu Dhabi to pursue claims against third parties. The proportion of assets to liabilities in the Abu Dhabi BCCI branches is said to be the same as in the rest of the bank.</p>

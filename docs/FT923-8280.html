			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Producer price rises slow to 1968 rate THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose in the year to July at the lowest annual rate since 1968. A 0.1 per cent rise in the producer prices index last month brought the year-on-year increase to 3.4 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in June. The index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, has fallen from a peak of 6.2 per cent in April 1991 to July's 3.4 per cent, responding to government attempts to squeeze the upward pressure on prices and reflecting weak domestic demand. Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the economy comes from the rise in the index once volatile food, drink and tobacco prices are excluded. This increased by 0.1 per cent on the month, bringing the year-on-year rise to 2.8 per cent compared with 2.9 per cent in the year to June. The seasonally-adjusted prices of raw materials and fuels used by manufacturing industry were flat in July compared with the previous month, but remained 1.5 per cent down on a year ago. Input prices unadjusted for seasonal factors fell by 0.7 per cent last month compared with June, reflecting depressed commodity prices. The Treasury said falling input prices with stable unit-labour costs would ensure further reductions in the annual rate of producer price inflation over the coming months. On Friday, the retail prices index for July is expected to show a small rise from June's 3.9 per cent before resuming a downward path later this year. Factory gate prices, Page 6</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Argos sales lift underlines bright Christmas trend Argos yesterday became the latest retailer to report strong trading in the crucial Christmas period, with sales up 18 per cent, writes Neil Buckley. With new space accounting for 5 percentage points of the increase, and inflation for about 1 point, Mr Bob Stewart, finance director, said the like-for-like increase for the five weeks to Christmas was about 12 per cent. The catalogue retailer's strong performance helped like-for-like growth in the second half of 1993 rise to 8 per cent, against 5.9 per cent in the first six months. Total sales growth for the year was 10 per cent - above market estimates. Analysts upgraded their profits forecasts for the year from Pounds 79m-Pounds 80m to about Pounds 82m.</p>

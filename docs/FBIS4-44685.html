			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "ESA Reorganizes Manned Flight and Launcher </F> Programs"]    [Text] Paris--The ESA Council at its 112th meeting held  22-23 March approved a reorganization of its manned flight and  launcher programs that was ordered on 15 February. Since that  time, details of the reorganization were worked out by the  agency's director general, Mr. Jean-Marie Luton.    Mr. Jorg Feustel-Buechl will head the manned flight and  microgravity programs, and in that capacity he will be  responsible for all studies on ESA participation in the  international R-Alpha station as well as negotiations with  partners in the project, including the Americans, Russians,  Canadians, Japanese, and the 14 ESA member countries.    Specifically, he will be responsible for the Columbus  laboratory-module program which is to link up with Columbus,  related systems (polar platform, etc.), and vehicles for  transporting crew and cargo (Crew Transport Vehicle, or CTV, and  Automatized Transport Vehicle, ATV), plus the precursor flights  scheduled with the Russians between now and the year 2000. He  will also oversee all technological aspects of the orbital  rendezvous, the future European remote manipulator arm, and the  EVA suits that ESA astronauts will wear, as well as operations  of the European Astronaut Center at Cologne.    Mr. Fredrick Engstrom as launch director has been given  oversight responsibility for the Ariane-5 heavy rocket program,  technologies pertaining thereto, future spin-off launcher  programs, and co-management (with the National Center for Space  Studies) of all ESA utilization of the Guyana Space Center, a  spokesman said.</p>

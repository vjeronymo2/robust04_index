			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING THE SECOND STONE  </P> <P> When a reviewer asserts that a writer's work "is marred by factual errors," he  or she had best scrutinize his or her notes.  </P> <P> In Tom Dardis' piece on my new biography, "Huxley in Hollywood" (Book Review,  Oct. 22), he suggests that I have incorrectly married Bertolt Brecht to  screenwriter Salka Viertel and misdated Weill's "Johnny Johnson."  </P> <P> Actually, I wrote that Brecht used Viertel's garage as a studio, and that the  1936 "Johnny Johnson" was newly topical in 1939. Dardis, who consistently  misspells Viertel's name -- and mine -- should be more careful.  </P> <P> DAVID K. DUNAWAY  </P> <P> ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  </P></p>

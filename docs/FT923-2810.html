			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: French opposition aims to close ranks FRANCE'S divided political opposition yesterday prepared to close ranks in readiness for a widely expected election battle against the ruling Socialists some time after Sunday's vote on European political and monetary union. Mr Philippe Seguin, leader of the anti-Maastricht majority in the Gaullist RPR party, yesterday tendered a rare olive branch to Mr Jacques Chirac, party president, who has put himself out on a limb in the RPR by supporting the treaty. Mr Chirac was the best equipped to tackle the opposition's splits over Europe and had his support as RPR candidate for future French president, said Mr Seguin. Mr Chirac yesterday issued his own appeal for party unity. 'No new majority can be formed from a cartel of the Noes,' he said. 'The UDF-RPR union will tomorrow be the only political force able to bring together the French. Let us be careful to do nothing which might destabilise this force.' Mr Philippe de Villiers, an anti-Maastricht rebel in the centre-right UDF, the Gaullists' allies, added that he would return to the party rank and file after the vote. Mr Seguin's outburst of loyalty to Mr Chirac contrasts with his previous two attempts to oust the RPR leader and suggests that opposition rebels have begun to take seriously the possibility that President Francois Mitterrand might spring a snap general or even presidential election. According to Le Monde newspaper, the French president is debating with officials his possible retirement next January, five years into his current term and the opening date for the single European market, in the event of a Yes vote. This is only the latest twist in weeks of speculation on Mr Mitterrand's future, heightened a few days ago by his entry to hospital for prostate surgery. Senior UDF and RPR officials have agreed to meet after the Sunday vote to prepare the ground for the joint election of a presidential candidate and for a general election campaign. Mr Mitterrand's popularity, at 29 per cent according to a poll by Ipsos a week ago, is well below that of Mr Michel Rocard, the former prime minister adopted by the Socialist party as its 'natural' future presidential candidate. Mr Rocard is well placed to beat any presidential candidate fielded by the right. However, polls suggest that the Socialist party's popularity is low enough for an RPR-UDF alliance to win a general election, even enfeebled by the splits opened up in the opposition by the Maastricht debate. Yet both opposition parties know they need to smooth over their divisions as best they can, given the growing share of protest votes attracted by alternative groups such as the two ecology parties and the National Front, which won a combined 28 per cent in the March regional elections. Neither the UDF nor the RPR have plans for reconciling their internal differences on Europe, despite their leaders' repeated attempts to settle the European problem. Mr Seguin yesterday made light of the internal splits, arguing that they had strengthened the RPR by giving the image of 'a modern political movement with freedom to discuss and vote'. Some RPR members maintain that Mr Chirac need not have split his party over Europe, since he does not have strong personal views on Maastricht. However, Mr Chirac may have calculated that he would have no chance of becoming joint RPR-UDF presidential candidate on an anti-Maastricht ticket, in competition against former French president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the deeply pro-European leader of the UDF. While the UDF rank and file is nearly as divided on Maastricht as the RPR, the centre-right's leadership is united in favour of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

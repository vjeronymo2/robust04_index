The 250-man Army engineering unit named Sangnoksu  (Evergreen) was to fulfill one year of service to July, but  pushed up the withdrawal date due to an early pullout by Western  countries, the ministry said. The decision was also prompted by  a request from the Unosom Command post to relocate the South  Korean unit, it said.    South Korea had dispatched the Army engineering unit in its  first participation in a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The unit  was responsible for road construction linking major cities in  Somalia.    The U.N. Security Council decided last Friday to have the  peacekeeping unit return to such traditional duties as  overseeing humanitarian aid while diminishing the scale of  stationed troops.    The United States announced last October its PKO troopers  would leave Somalia by March 31 this year.    Italy, which has been in charge of security in the area  where  the South Korean unit was stationed, also decided to withdraw by  the same date.</p>

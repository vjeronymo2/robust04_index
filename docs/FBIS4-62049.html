			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "We Have Crossed Threshold of </F> Political Terrorism"]    [Text] The murder of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis  is still the focus of attention of Russian society. For all  that we are now growing used to reports of contract killings,  the crime committed in Khimki looks like a cynical challenge to  the state. A number of politicians assess what has happened as  an act of political terrorism. We asked several deputies to  comment on the story that the parliamentarian's murder was  political.    Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation  Republican Party, "Yabloko" bloc faction:    First of all we must proceed from the fact that it was a  man,  not a deputy, who was killed. Unfortunately some  parliamentarians are using the incident for political purposes.  That is hardly sensible. Especially as it is not yet  completely clear what lies behind this: a political act or a  settling of scores as a result of the dead man's extensive  business activity over the past three years...    Aleksandr Osovtsov, "Russia's Choice" faction:    I am sure that the murder is not political. If some forces  wanted to destabilize the situation in society by killing one of  the deputies, then, bringing to mind only the deceased's good  side, I can say that they could have found more important  figures....    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic  Party  of Russia [LDPR], LDPR faction:    Of course it is a political assassination. It is notable  that it was committed on the eve of May Day. When another 10-20  deputies have been put in their graves we will all understand  and agree.    Father Gleb Yakunin, "Russia's Choice" faction:    The murder is hardly political. Nonetheless the answer may  be learned when the criminal is caught. You say Aleksandr Men  was killed and the killer has not yet been found? But it is not  only in our country but also in the developed countries, where  the law enforcement organs' system works brilliantly, that there  are unsolved crimes. It is a pity that Zhirinovskiy is using  the incident to build up more hysteria for his own benefit.    Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian All-National Union:    The question of the state of the struggle against crime and  the defense of human rights is serious. In addition to the  tragic incident involving Andrey Ayzderdzis there have been many  incidents of attacks on deputies and arson at their apartments.  Now it is a case of expanding political terror and in addition  to ordinary murders there are targeted political crimes. Today  we have found ourselves in a qualitatively new situation -- we  have crossed the threshold of political terrorism. And that is  natural since the entire economic activity of the present  executive power presupposes the formation of a mafioso-criminal  society.    Georgiy Zadonskiy, "Russia's Choice" faction:    The murder of the State Duma deputy is the first tragic case  in the present parliament. Several stories are being worked up  involving personal, professional, domestic, or commercial  motives on the basis of the figure of the victim himself. So  far one thing is clear: It was a premeditated murder.    The incident should serve as grounds for a tough hearing on  questions of crime. There are various levels of crime. And  where organized crime arises there is a threat to the entire  country's national security.    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" bloc and  parliamentary faction:    In our view the problems of crime lie in the economic  situation in which we find ourselves. Judge for yourselves: We  have a production decline of 25 percent and unemployment is just  1 percent. That means that an enormous number of people are  involved in business about which the country has only an  approximate idea. Some people are working in their private plots  but probably most are engaged in illegal or semilegal, criminal,  or semicriminal business. And there is also street crime, crime  by children, with which the country is not concerned at all.  What should we do? The government must earmark a federal  program in the budget and show what it intends to do in this  direction. Our government has still not set out its economic  program in general.</p>

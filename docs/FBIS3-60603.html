			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Kiev Considers Nuclear Missiles </F> Its Gold Reserve"]    [Text] Paris -- Ukraine has been criticized in Rome at the  CSCE meeting, in Brussels at the NATO session, and in Paris at  the parliamentary session of the Western European Union for  deciding to keep its nuclear arsenal.    "I understand [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev's  concern and at the same time am still surprised at the  inconsistency of some of Russia's representatives and the  minister himself," Anatoliy Zlenko, head of Ukraine's foreign  policy department, told me in Paris.    Minister Zlenko reminded me that Ukraine has ratified the  START I Treaty. That is an important first step toward  Ukraine's acquiring the status of a nuclear-free state, but it  is not the last step. Since Ukraine and Russia are two friendly  states it is not in Moscow's interests to exacerbate the  situation.    Zlenko stressed that the disquiet voiced in Kozyrev's  statement over the fact that Ukraine is a nuclear state does not  accord with the facts: "Ukraine is not a nuclear power. It is  the owner of nuclear weapons with a limited opportunity of  putting them to their designated use."    The minister stressed that Ukraine primarily views the  nuclear weapons as a "great material asset" and, on this  premise, is willing to conduct talks and decide their future.  The tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from Ukraine  to Russia last May are valued, according to Anatoliy Zlenko, at  several billion dollars. We are being forced to surrender an  asset that our people created without receiving compensation.    The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department  indicated  that two questions have to be decided. The first is associated  with guaranteeing national security: "Otherwise our people will  not understand us since we will be left alone to face the danger  that exists around Ukraine. Especially since we are constantly  facing territorial claims from both the east and the south."    The second concerns the provision of financial and technical  aid for Kiev -- and this is in the interests of the  international community. The Ukrainian budget does not have the  money to destroy the nuclear weapons. But there is a  comprehensive government program for the destruction of these  weapons. And this program costs over $2.5 billion including the  social requirements.    Kiev also has bones to pick with Moscow. Thus, assessing  Russia's new military doctrine, Anatoliy Zlenko noted that some  of its provisions, primarily the possibility of Russia being the  first to use nuclear weapons, worry the international community,  including Ukraine. Against whom does Moscow intend to use these  weapons? Who is its number one enemy?</p>

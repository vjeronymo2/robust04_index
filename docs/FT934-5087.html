			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Tough stance aims to trim Pounds 780m - Defence Defence plans for the next two years are to be cut by Pounds 780m, a sharper reduction than had been generally expected. By setting a barely changed spending figure for the following year, 1996-97, the government has set the tone for more constrained medium-term funding. Plans for a so-called 'defence cost review' to achieve the necessary savings are expected to be detailed today. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said a 'major study would focus on ways of reducing the cost of support services without affecting operational capability'. The emphasis on efficiency measures rather than front-line cuts is meant to head off the threat of a backbench rebellion. The all-party Commons defence committee, which will question Mr Rifkind today, has warned strongly against further cuts, arguing that they could have 'a serious effect on morale'. Mr Rifkind said the reductions would be made in part through 'lower procurement and employment costs' - a warning of a tougher attitude towards the Ministry of Defence's suppliers and low pay increases for military and civilian personnel. The spending figures are based on the assumption that pay rises will be kept to 1 or 2 per cent a year during the three-year period. Mr Rifkind confirmed that savings would also come from the planned sale of military accommodation to a private-sector housing trust. That measure is expected to bring in up to Pounds 500m. The proposed study into support costs, which is expected to lead to further privatisation, was attacked by Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, as a 'facade'. He repeated Labour's call for a full defence review. The Budget plans are expected to reduce UK defence spending as a proportion of gross domestic product from 3.7 per cent at present to 3 per cent in 1996-97. That would still be above the average for European Nato allies. Defence spending in the next financial year is set at Dollars 23.49bn, close to this year's level but an estimated 3.5 per cent drop in real terms, and Pounds 260m less than previously planned. The budget for 1995-96, Pounds 520m lower than planned at Pounds 22.7bn, will entail a further real-terms fall of 6.8 per cent. An additional 2 per cent reduction in real terms is forecast for the following year. The reductions are expected to bring further cutbacks in military installations including the closure of one of the RAF's two bases in Germany. Thousands more industrial jobs could be threatened in a sector already heavily damaged since the end of the the cold war. In the past two years alone, large defence contractors have announced some 20,000 job cuts. Industry fears that the threat of cutbacks, as well as a lengthy review process, will hold back vital production orders. 'We certainly won't go unscathed,' one leading defence manufacturer commented. All new equipment projects are now expected to be called into question to some degree. British Aerospace insisted yesterday that the Eurofighter 2000, the four-nation venture which is the largest single defence programme, would not be affected. However, when the project comes to the production phase, it is questionable whether the UK will want its planned quota of 250 aircraft. Cuts made earlier this year in the equipment programme included the shelving of plans to buy new air defence missiles, worth at least Pounds 500m, and to equip the RAF with air-launched nuclear missiles, for which a Pounds 1.8bn provision had been made in the MoD's long-term spending plans. Two other large aircraft contracts are overdue and may be affected by the latest spending cuts: a mid-life upgrade for the RAF's Tornado GR1 bombers and the purchase of up to 18 new Sea Harrier jump jets from BAe, worth Pounds 300-Pounds 400m. The navy which has suffered heavy cutbacks, could face yet more. Its fleet of destroyers and frigates is set to be reduced from 39 to 'about 35' and its four new Upholder class diesel-electric submarines, built at a cost of some Pounds 900m, are destined to be sold, leased or mothballed. A new helicopter carrier was ordered, but invitations to tender for the first of two new assault ships for Royal Marine landings have been delayed. A senior executive at one leading navy contractor commented in the run-up to yesterday's Budget: 'I have never seen our client as anxious as now.'</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gleeson ahead 9% but warns of housing market slowdown The revival in the new housing market underpinned a 9 per cent rise, from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 8.91m, in annual pre-tax profits at MJ Gleeson, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property company. Completions in the year to June 30 totalled a record 499 units with the average price increasing by Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 84,500. However, Mr Colin McLellan, finance director, cautioned that the housing market had slowed considerably, particularly in recent weeks. He also warned that margins were likely to come under renewed pressure as the 'fragile state of the market' was further undermined by rising costs from building materials suppliers. He said that so far this year, timber prices had jumped by some 20 per cent, bricks by 5 per cent and steel by 8 per cent. In addition, concrete blocks were in short supply. Trading conditions in the contracting business were 'very tough' and showed little chance of improvement in the forseeable future. The company was increasingly looking overseas and had recently completed a contract on the Kenyan airport project. There was the strong possibility of further work in east Africa, as well as in Europe. The outlook, however, remained cautious. 'It's very difficult to take a short-term view with the housing market up and down as it is, and the contracting business so difficult,' said Mr McLellan. On a more positive note, the recent acquisition of the residential development business of the Portman Building Society had provided a boost to the landbank. Turnover was Pounds 174m (Pounds 168m). Earnings per share edged up from 57.54p to 58.21p and a final dividend of 10.81p is recommended, making a total of 14.16p (12.75p).</p>

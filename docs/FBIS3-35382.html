The talks covered a wide range of bilateral  relations and international and regional issues. The Chinese  side was led by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Mr.  Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali headed  the Pakistan delegation. The Kashmir dispute came under  detailed discussion. Both sides expressed their concern over the  gross human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir and were of  the opinion that tension in the region would further escalate if  a peaceful solution to the problem is not found. Foreign  Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali drew the attention of his Chinese  counterpart to the persistent violations of human rights in the  occupied valley. He said because of the recalcitrant attitude  of India, the foreign secretaries talks could not make any  progress. He said Pakistan would be willing to hold talks with  India only if they were ready to improve the human rights  situation in Kashmir. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali apprised Mr. Qian  of the rationale behind the tabling of the resolution at the  current session of the commission of human rights. He said the  resolution only requested sending a fact-finding mission to the  Indian-held Kashmir. The Chinese vice premier said Pakistan and  China should closely coordinate on the Kashmir issue.    On the question of trade imbalances, China and Pakistan  agreed that efforts should be made to rectify the adverse trade  balance against Pakistan. Experts of the two countries would  consult each other in this regard.    In-depth discussions were also held on issues concerning  security in South Asia and nuclear nonproliferation. China  appreciated Pakistan's principled position on the question of  nuclear nonproliferation. The vice premier underlined the need  for close coordination between China and Pakistan on issues  relating to regional security.    The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister called on the  chairman, Senate, Mr. Wasim Sajjad, in Islamabad today. The  chairman, Senate, briefed the Chinese vice premier about  Pakistan's principled stand on Kashmir and the nuclear  nonproliferation issue. He said it would be quite unreasonable  to sign any nonproliferation treaty unilaterally when India has  a huge nuclear arms buildup. He said Kashmir problem should be  resolved through implementation of UN resolutions.    Mr. Qian Qichen also called on the speaker, National  Assembly, Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, in Islamabad today. The  speaker expressed satisfaction over the traditional and  time-tested friendship between Pakistan and China. The Chinese  vice premier extended an invitation to the speaker, National  Assembly, to visit China at the head of a parliamentary  delegation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to the State </F> Duma in Moscow on 11 January -- recorded]    [Text] Esteemed members of the State Duma! I hope that the  good wishes and salutations from the president of the Russian  Federation will set the tone for the State Duma's work, bring us  all together in a businesslike and constructive mood, and usher  in a work pattern of harmony and cooperation.    I should like to add a few words from myself, on behalf of  the Russian Government. The first day of work of a  fundamentally new parliament elected by the citizens of a  sovereign state provides good grounds for reflecting on the  lessons of the recent past. We have traversed a long and  difficult road together -- the road from declarative sovereignty  and the formal attributes of the independence of Russia to a  state that draws up its own borders and its own armaments and  forces and occupies a worthy place among the world powers. This  is the road of new economic realities which, although encumbered  by a multitude of problems, are already delivering our  fatherland from a topsy-turvy economic world. This is the road  of awareness of the impermissibility of hostility and  confrontation -- the road to the new political realities of this  new year, which are emerging as a result of the people's  approval of the new Constitution and of the elections to the  Federal Assembly. The results of the referendum and elections  are unambiguous on the main point: the citizens of our country  opted a new Russia, for a strong power, for political stability,  for reforms and democracy. The state has acquired a firm legal  foundation, and it is now our common duty to finish building the  edifice of our new Russian Federation statehood.    The government is ready, and will work jointly with the  corps  of deputies in all areas of legislative activity -- and together  we have plenty to do here. That's putting it mildly. To date,  there are about a hundred bills that have been prepared by the  government alone that are ready to be submitted for examination  by the State Duma. They include a civic code for the Russian  Federation, laws on delegated management of property, on  mortgages, on making amendments and additions to taxation  legislation, laws on banks and banking activity, the foundations  of land, labor and housing legislation, and many others.    Esteemed deputies: there are in our native language two  related words which I, as chairman of the government, would like  to exclude from the political style of the executive branch of  power. They are intolerance and impatience. Renouncing the  first means primarily an ability and readiness to hear and  listen -- to hold constructive dialogue with a political  opponent. For this reason, taking account of everything that is  useful and promising in the economic resources of the factions  and other deputies' associations represented in the Federal  Assembly becomes an everyday obligation of the government.  Second -- what it is that the government should renounce ---  impatience, which in striving for quick results has frequently  led us, and still leads us today, to mere outward effects, but  far from always equally effective decisions. The prohibition on  impatience envisages primarily scrupulous work on bringing order  to all the resources of state economic policy. I am convinced  that order in the state economy begins with establishing order  in the work of the government. A presidential decree actually  aimed at this has been signed.    The results of the elections bear out that the limits to  society's patience have to a considerable degree been exhausted.  But it has to be soberly acknowledged that slackening efforts  and attempts to soften the burdens of the crisis by populist  measures will not bring alleviation, but will only drag out this  stage of the development of the crisis and the associated  deprivations. Analysis of the first results of the work that  has been done on the state of the economy and existing problems  enable us to draw an important conclusion. The prerequisites  have arisen for moving on to a new stage of reforms -- the stage  of stabilizing the economy -- when the center of gravity of all  the government's activity shifts to creating favorable  conditions for the work of Russian manufacturers. In order to  implement this task, I shall make every effort to consolidate  the activities of the government, the parliament, and the  Russian Central Bank.    In social policy we are bound to turn the reforms face to  face with the people. Social policy for us means not only  targeted support for the poor, but also granting all citizens  the possibility of having worthy living conditions. We intend  to proceed without sudden and unjustified shifts in policy and  ill-considered shock decisions. We are pondering a certain  adjustment in our program of practical actions. Most of what we  want to do is compatible with the basic principles contained in  the pre-election policy documents of many parties and electoral  blocs. In my view, this provides a real basis for joint work by  the government and parliament. The government expresses  confidence that this work will succeed. We are geared precisely  for this. I hope that this is how it will work out. I wish you  success in your work. Thank you. [applause]</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / ENI to sell majority of Agip and Snam ENI, the state-owned Italian energy and chemicals group, plans eventually to sell more than 50 per cent of the shares in Agip and Snam, its petroleum and natural gas subsidiaries. Selling more than 50 per cent of the companies would be a rare move in the Italian public sector. ENI hopes to raise a minimum of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) by selling the first 10 per cent of shares in Agip before the end of this year. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, said his ambition was to sell more than 50 per cent of both companies. Plans to float both are at an advanced stage, he said. Subject to approval by Italy's new government, an initial public offering could take place before the year-end, with shares being quoted on international stock markets. State-owned companies, even when quoted, remain under strict government control. Only the Sirti cables group, part of the state's telecommunications interests, has more than half of its ordinary shares listed. In this instance, state control is guaranteed through a formal pact between public and private-sector shareholders. Otherwise, listings above the crucial 50 per cent level involve only non-voting savings stock. Analysts say pricing for the flotation of Agip, which last week signed a huge oil and gas deal with the government of Kazakhstan, would be complex. However, an initial 10 per cent stake in the company, which has reserves of around 5bn barrels of oil equivalent, could be worth around Dollars 2bn based on the value of its reserves, priced at Dollars 3 to Dollars 4 a barrel. Mr Cagliari said the aim was to sell an initial 10 per cent to 20 per cent of Agip and Snam. Further dilutions of ENI's stake would come in stages, with the timing depending partly on assurances that no individual shareholder was building up a preponderant position. ENI may have a political battle on its hands to push through its plans. Some politicians have called for a flotation of ENI itself, rather than its subsidiaries, to boost the Italian exchequer. The destination of the proceeds from privatisations could be the single most important issue in determining the timing and nature of flotations, both at ENI and, possibly, Iri, Italy's biggest state holding company.

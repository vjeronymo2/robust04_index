			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Factory boss picked as Ukraine's premier UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday voted overwhelmingly for the appointment of the manager of the world's largest missile factory, Mr Leonid Kuchma, as the country's new prime minister. As head of the Yuzhmash plant in eastern Ukraine, Mr Kuchma is a political unknown. But he was proposed by President Leonid Kravchuk and won the support both of nationalist MPs and the majority ex-communist bloc in the legislature. His appointment represents a victory for Ukraine's increasingly vocal industrial lobby but its implications for Ukraine's faltering economy are unclear. A western diplomat described Mr Kuchma, a spare, white-haired engineer with a reputation as a good manager, as 'a Ukrainian Volsky' - a reference to the leader of the Russian industrial lobby who is seeking to put a brake on Russian economic reform. Fierce criticism of the handling of the Ukrainian economy - which is plagued by inflation of more than 30 per cent a month and a steep fall in industrial production - forced Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine's first prime minister, to resign last month. In a brief policy statement, Mr Kuchma said his goal was to 'transform the post-socialist economy into a market economy'. But, echoing the policy of the previous government, he said that reform must be 'evolutionary' and guided by 'a combination of administrative and market methods'. He suggested that as a transitional step to privatisation all Ukrainian enterprises should be transformed into joint stock companies, in which the government would retain control over the majority of shares. This approach is bound to cause concern among western experts, who have warned that it would only superficially change the form of ownership and would not weaken the government's stranglehold over the economy. The consensus inside parliament yesterday contrasted sharply with violence on its steps as hundreds of police clashed with students demonstrating for new elections and Ukraine's exit from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Two students were taken to hospital and two dozen students and a western cameraman detained by regular and riot police armed with tear gas and rubber truncheons. The parliament, which was elected under restrictive conditions in 1990 and is dominated by ex-communists, is under fierce attack from the student protesters. Two years ago hunger-striking students forced a prime minister to resign. Meanwhile, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said it would concentrate on financial sector reform and privatisation, agriculture, energy, transport and environmental protection in its strategy for Ukraine. Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, said the role of the bank should be to assist the country's commitment to democracy and market economics and encourage Ukraine in its efforts to transform the economy through greater reliance on market forces rather than central planning and state control. A giant Ukrainian military transport plane crashed in a forest near Kiev yesterday, killing all nine crew.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: London coffee futures squeezed higher - Market report A shortage of supplies available for nearby delivery pushed COFFEE prices back towards last week's highs at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The prompt May futures position surged Dollars 99 to Dollars 1,592 a tonne, dragging the July contract to Dollars 1,484, up Dollars 53. High internal demand has squeezed export availability in Brazil, traders explained. The London GOLD price fell Dollars 1 to a fresh 4 1/2 -month low of Dollars 371.80 a troy ounce as the market continued to digest the consequences of a tighter US policy on short-term interest rates, which would tend to benefit the bond market. At the London Metal Exchange most base metals turned lower by the close as technical indicators continued to turn bearish, although COPPER ended slightly higher. ALUMINIUM eased back to test support under Dollars 1,290 a tonne for delivery in three months, despite the fall in March IPAI production. Compiled from Reuter</p>

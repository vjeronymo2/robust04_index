			<p>BFN     [Text] During the upper house Budget Committee session on  13 June, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said the legality of using  nuclear weapons "is not yet outlawed by existing international  laws."    In a statement submitted to the International Court of  Justice [ICJ], Japan dropped the phrase: "the use of nuclear  arms is not necessarily a violation of positive international  law." However, Hata noted the government has not revised its  stance toward the issue.    On the other hand, Hata stressed Japan's policy of opposing  any attempt to use nuclear weapons as a political tool. He  said: "Japan must further promote the three non-nuclear  principles. I have absolutely no intention of adopting policies  to tolerate the use of nuclear arms." These remarks were made  in reply to questions by Upper House Dietman, Shinei Kiyan (of  the Niin Club).    When Councillor Koichiro Ueda (the Japan Communist Party)  asked if the government has any intention to designate the 15  August war memorial day as a national holiday, Hata responded  positively, saying: "The day may be a holiday, or a special day  to pray for peace. It is a good day for everyone to think about  the past."</p>

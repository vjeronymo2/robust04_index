			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> WALK-ON FRESHMAN GUARD MAKING A POINT OF DELIGHTING MULLIGAN, FANS  </P> <P> The strange-but-true saga of Ben Rishwain, walk-on guard and cult hero to the  Bren Center fans, began a year ago in Stockton.  </P> <P> UC Irvine wanted Rishwain badly last season. And the feeling was mutual.  </P> <P> Rishwain, then a scrappy point guard at St. Mary's High School in Stockton, had  heard the recruiting spiel from nearby University of the Pacific and wasn't all  that impressed.  </P> <P> Irvine came calling and piqued Rishwain's interest.  </P> <P> The trouble was, Irvine had just used its last available scholarship on Craig  Marshall, a defensive whiz from Saddleback High.  </P> <P> Coach Bill Mulligan called Rishwain to break the bad news one day and got an  interesting response. Rishwain was still interested. He actually wanted to walk  on. In fact, he turned down a scholarship from the University of New Mexico to  come to Irvine.  </P> <P> Why would an otherwise bright, 16-points-a-game scorer from a high school team  that finished 33-1 want to give up an all-expenses-paid college education?  </P> <P> "I thought I'd have a good chance to play here," Rishwain said. "I didn't want  to stay home. You want to get away when you go to college."  </P> <P> Besides, Mulligan said he will give Rishwain a scholarship as soon as one  becomes available next season.  </P> <P> "I love the kid," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> That, in itself, is something unusual. In his 10 seasons at Irvine, Mulligan  has blasted, bullied and benched his point guards more than once.  </P> <P> Mulligan saying something nice about a point guard?  </P> <P> It probably has something to do with Rishwain's play. The moment he enters the  game to spell starter Rod Palmer, Rishwain is a blur.  </P> <P> He hounds the opposing point guard, waving his hands wildly. It was his  aggressive defensive play that resulted in a broken index finger on his left  hand -- his shooting hand -- against Tennessee Chattanooga Dec. 2.  </P> <P> "I think I was reaching back and hit someone or something," Rishwain said. "I  didn't know it was broken, but suddenly I was dribbling the ball and my finger  felt like it was inside the ball. It felt weird. I knew something was wrong."  </P> <P> He had surgery on his finger and missed five games, but returned Tuesday to  score five points, make four steals and give the Anteaters a big boost in 17  minutes of play against Utah State.  </P> <P> The 1,686 fans, particularly those in the student section Tuesday, cheered his  every move.  </P> <P> "I guess they like the way I play," Rishwain said with a shrug and a smile.  </P> <P> The Anteaters (2-8 overall, 0-1 in Big West play) and their fans sorely missed  his play the five games -- four of them losses -- he missed.  </P> <P> "He really started to come around when he got hurt," Mulligan said. "He's still  a freshman. He still makes mistakes, but some of the older guys are making  mistakes, too.  </P> <P> "He's a winner. He's a mature kid, an unbelievably mature kid."  </P> <P> In four games, Rishwain has been rock-solid. He has made five of seven shots  from the field and averaged three points a game in spot duty.  </P> <P> "I expected a big transition (to the college game)," said Rishwain, who is  5-feet-10. "I expected it to be different. But you realize what the differences  are and you adjust. I just play like I always have."  </P> <P> Which is to say Rishwain has played well.  </P> <P> The only time his inexperience showed was when a former UCI point guard dropped  by the Bren Center during the Christmas break.  </P> <P> It seems Scott Brooks, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, stopped in to see  Mulligan and work out. He wound up working over Rishwain in a scrimmage.  </P> <P> "I thought his confidence was shattered," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Rishwain just laughed and said, "I said to Mulligan, 'He's a pro and I'm a  walk-on.' "  </P> <P> Rishwain is expecting a big homecoming when the Anteaters play Pacific Tuesday  night at Stockton. How big, he's not saying.  </P> <P> "I don't know," he said. "I told them all to buy tickets, though. I can't get  enough passes."  </P> <P> Mulligan continues to be impressed by his freshmen -- Rishwain, Marshall, Dylan  Rigdon and Jeff Von Lutzow.  </P> <P> At one point Tuesday against Utah State, Mulligan had Rishwain, Marshall and  Von Lutzow in the game at once.  </P> <P> "The four freshmen are playing pretty well right now," Mulligan said. "You're  going to see a lot more of them."  </P> <P> Von Lutzow, a 6-9 forward from Charter Oak High School in Covina, led the  freshmen with eight points against Utah State.  </P> <P> In eight games, he's averaging 7.5 points and shooting 54.5% from the field.  </P> <P> "Von Lutzow's going to be a great player," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> There's no secret why Irvine is 2-8 this season. Poor shooting has been the  Anteaters' biggest problem. Going into tonight's game against San Jose State  (7:30 in the Bren Center), the Anteaters are shooting 43.7% from the field and  66.1% from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> "I don't think our defense is getting us beat," Mulligan said after Irvine shot  less than 40% from the field for the second consecutive game. "It's our  offense. We can't put the ball in the hole. We gotta make those free throws.  It's just . . . the ball's gotta go in."  </P> <P> Of the Anteaters' missed free throws against Utah State, center Ricky Butler  said, "There's no excuse for missing free throws."  </P> <P> The men's and women's swimming teams play host to the PICK Systems Invitational  at 9 a.m. Saturday and Sunday at Heritage Park in Irvine.  </P> <P> USC, the second-ranked men's team in the nation, Cal State Long Beach, UC  Riverside and Cal State Northridge are among those expected to compete.  </P> <P> The Irvine men are led by senior Brian Pajer, who recently qualified for his  fourth National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet in the 100- and 200-meter  breaststroke. The women are led by Debbie Babashoff, a distance freestyle  swimmer.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Dean Andrea, the women's basketball coach, was so upset with his team's play in  an 89-45 loss to the University of the Pacific Tuesday, he held an hourlong  postgame practice in Crawford Hall. Irvine is 1-9, which ties the Anteaters'  worst start in history. The Anteaters also were 1-9 in the 1978-79 season.  Irvine plays at UC Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> The UCI Athletic Foundation will hold a tip-off celebration at 6 p.m. Jan. 11  in the Koll Room in the Bren Center to open its fund drive. The Anteaters' NCAA  champion water polo team will be honored. For reservations and tickets to that  night's game against Cal State Long Beach, call 856-5550. . . . Irvine will  play host to a distance runners coaching clinic Jan. 13. The clinic is  sponsored by The Athletics Congress. Registration is at 8:30 a.m. and costs $5.

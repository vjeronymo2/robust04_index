			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Berlin courts curators BERLIN IS booming. Germany has the largest domestic market for art and antiques in the EC. So why is this year's biennial Orangerie art and antiques fair, the most important in the country, such a perplexing mixture of the exceptional and the run of the mill? The Orangerie concept, introduced by the Berlin Association of Art &amp; Antiques Dealers under the direction of Berndt Schultz in 1982, is to invite objects rather than than dealers to exhibit. Submitted works of art are selected, vetted and exhibited chronologically, as if in a museum where every object is for sale. Certainly the Orangerie is a place where museum curators like to shop because the quality as well as authenticity can be tightly controlled. The silver and parcel gilt Baroque centrepiece by the Augsburg goldsmith Melchior Gelb I brought by Albrecht Neuhaus of Wurzburg, for instance, would grace any museum treasury. Indeed its two counterparts are to be found in the Kunsthistorische Museum in Vienna and the Moscow Armoury. Other museum-worthy pieces come from Rainer Zietz of London with a massive Gothic Revival silver presentation cup and stand designed by Schinkel in 1830; Daxel &amp; Marschall of Munich offer a spectacular roll-top desk by the influential German cabinet-maker David Roentgen; and the 180-piece mid 18th century Meissen dinner service displayed by Steinbeck of Aachen. Light from the Orangerie's tall windows plays over its gleaming surfaces. As in previous years, there is marvellous silver, sculpture, ceramics and furniture, including a fine group brought over from Paris, but the general standard of the pictures is lamentable. fair. There is nothing of the stature of Beckmann's 'Journey on a Fish' which was offered in 1991 for DM 6.9m. This year's Orangerie is a pre-eminently a Berlin-orientated event. One reason, no doubt, is that the city's museums now have more money to spend than any other in Germany. Dealers have also been able to draw on the rich resources of Berlin's hinterland cut off since Partition. There is a mass of Berlin porcelain, prospects galore of the city, Berlin iron jewellery, even a woven silk version of the last will and testament of Frederick Wilhelm III. Whatever the quality, the fair, as a result, smacks of provincialism. The works of art that are not Germanic are French, Flemish or English. (Most of the red stickers on opening night were to be found on English silver.) Norbert Pokutta's Canaletto and Sabrina Forster's Castiglione drawing provide a rare and welcome breath of warm, Southern air. In transforming the fair into an international event in 1988 the Berlin art trade took an important step towards re-establishing Berlin's pre-war position as a major European art market. But if the Orangerie is to vie with the Paris and London fairs, its organisers, now a limited company, will have to fight hard to maintain, if not improve, the quality and presentation of objects to ensure the continued support of the best national and international dealers. Orangerie '93 is open daily, 10am-7.30pm, until Sept 26</p>

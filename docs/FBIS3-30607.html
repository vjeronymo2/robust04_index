			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- This morning President  of the Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic received Thorvald  Stoltenberg and David Owen, the cochairmen of the Geneva  conference. As the Serbian president's office has announced,  they discussed the creation of conditions for restoring peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and the stabilization of  the overall situation in the Yugoslav area. It was noted that  the negotiating process has no alternative as the path toward  peace, and that it should not be allowed to suspend the  negotiations before a final peace agreement is reached.    They stressed the close link between lifting the sanctions  against Serbia, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and  finding a peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and pointed  to the forces still opposed to this. They also discussed the  efforts for an overall normalization of relations in the  Yugoslav area, and decided that the normalization of relations  between Serbs and Croats is of great importance in that context.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part  in the talks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The German-Netherlands Corps Within </F> Reach; Agreement on the Command Structure and Organization"]    [Text] Bonn, 21 Apr--Announced last year as a general plan,  the merging of the staff of the German 1st Corps in Muenster  with the Netherlands 1st Corps, stationed up to now in  Apeldoorn, to form a binational German-Netherlands Army corps in  Muenster has progressed to the point that an overall agreement  and an implementation agreement have been completed. The first  of these agreements is to be signed in The Hague on Friday [22  April] by the two defense ministers, Ruehe and Ter Beek, the  second by the German Army chief of staff, Lieutenant General  Bagger, and the supreme commander of the Netherlands ground  forces, Lt. Gen. Couzy.    According to the agreements, the post of the commanding  general, his deputy, the chief of staff, and a few other  high-ranking officers of the joint corps will rotate regularly  between the two armed forces for a period of two to three years.  As first commanding general, the present deputy supreme  commander of the Netherlands ground forces, Major General  Reitsma, will take over command of the corps beginning in  October of this year. The corps will achieve operational  readiness in the course of the next year in its fully integrated  form. The German deputy, however, has yet to be appointed.  <H5>  The Hague Contributes Army Remnants </H5>   A command support brigade will be assigned directly to the  integrated corps staff in Muenster. The staff of the brigade  will be stationed on Netherlands territory, presumably in  Eibergen, near the border with Germany. The Netherlands  Army--which henceforth will no longer have an independent corps  staff, and which will achieve this command level, at least  initially, through the merging with parts of the German  Bundeswehr in the form of the binational corps staff--will  contribute the 1st Division to the new structure together with  the existing corps troops and the Netherlands brigade stationed  in the Lueneburg Heath. Significantly, this integration, in  comparison with the original plan, was strengthened even further  at the suggestion of the Netherlands. This corps merger  represents, de facto, the linking of the remnants of the  dismantled Netherlands Army with a part of the German  Bundeswehr. Belgium is following a similar path with the  assignment of its last Army division to the primarily  German-French Eurocorps.    Germany will assign primarily the 1st Armored Division to  the  binational corps. In the new Army structure, this division  comprises the three armored infantry brigades 1, 19, and 32, all  of which are partially manned. This structure--both on the  Netherlands and on the German side--indicates that the troops of  the joint corps are being assigned to the main defense forces,  which will not grow to their planned authorized defensive  strength until there is an appropriate increase in the partially  manned units.  <H5>  Special Use in Crises </H5>   In normal peacetime, Germany will also assign to the joint  corps the 6th Armored Infantry Division in Schleswig-Holstein  and the 7th Armored Division in Duesseldorf, both of which have  been assigned to the 1st Corps. In case of crises or conflicts,  a different use if foreseen for both units. The 7th Armored  Division, with its two fully manned brigades-the Armored  Instruction Brigade 9 and the Armored Brigade 21--belongs in any  case to the rapid-deployment crisis-reaction forces and as such  forms the principal part of the German contingent for the Allied  Rapid-Reaction Corps, NATO's rapid intervention force under  British command. On the other hand, according to existing plans  the 6th Armored Infantry Division, with its two partially manned  brigades--the Armored Infantry Brigade 7 and the Armored Brigade  18--will continue, for the time being, to be under the command  of the German-Danish Landjut Corps.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Haunted by twin ghosts: Leslie Colitt and Andrew Gowers on how Nazi and communist legacies dominate German politics MR Manfred Stolpe leaned back on the leather seat of his Mercedes limousine as it barrelled along the pot-holed roads of east Germany and proclaimed wistfully: 'Germans have a difficult time with our past.' The prime minister of the German state of Brandenburg, the place where Prussia was born, is feeling more than usually haunted by ghosts from recent and not so recent German history. For the past three months Mr Stolpe, eastern Germany's only home-grown politician of note and the only Social Democrat (SPD) heading a state government there, has been under unrelenting attack for allegedly serving as an informer for the hated Stasi secret police in the former communist state. Then a couple of weeks ago an echo from the Nazi past rang through the Brandenburg parliament when its honorary president, Mr Gustav Just, resigned after it was revealed he participated in a Wehrmacht execution of six Jews in the Ukraine after the Nazi invasion. Now Mr Stolpe's government has been rocked by remarks made by his junior coalition partner, Mr Peter-Michael Diestel, the local Christian Democrat parliamentary leader, that appeared to justify the role of Stasi informers in East Germany as having been 'guarantors of social peace'. Mr Diestel's comments have shocked Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as his CDU party prepares for tomorrow's crucial regional elections in the western German Lander (states) of Baden-Wurttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein. In the eastern parts of the unified Germany, these two different, but still not-quite-conquered German pasts have become the principal weapons of political combat. They are also a focus for economic and social resentment against the west. Mr Stolpe, a modest man with a homespun air, has become philosophical about the trend, just as he is resigned to the probings of a parliamentary commission into his own case . 'We'll have a lot more of this political turbulence over the next couple of years,' he says. The Brandenburg premier has made no bones about his contacts with the secret police. As a senior lay official of the Protestant church, he interceded with the communist regime in humanitarian cases over a period of decades, obtaining the release of thousands of East German prisoners and reuniting families in the west. To do so, he insists, he had to negotiate with the Stasi and thus inadvertently came to be registered as an accomplice. 'The east Germans have a tendency to think as Germans did in 1945,' says Mr Stolpe. 'They are looking for scapegoats. Some people tell me it's a conscious effort at humiliating the east Germans by the west Germans, who have yet to come to terms with the Nazi past.' Whatever the intention, that is turning out to be the effect. Mr Kohl, who had been suspected by some of seeking to turn Mr Stolpe's misfortunes against the SPD at large, has seen the affair blow up in his face after Mr Diestel's remarks. The result, according to many East Germans, is dissension between ordinary 'Ossis' and 'Wessis' greater than before the wall came down. 'The process of growing together again will take years,' says Mr Stolpe. 'The decisive thing will be whether we can create the economic and social conditions where people won't have the feeling that they're losers.' The current disastrous state of the east German economy means such conditions are likely to be absent for a good while. The effective jobless rate in the five eastern Lander of the federal republic is between 30 and 40 per cent - even in Brandenburg, one of the least poor, it is 30 per cent. What is more, Mr Stolpe admits that with wages ratcheting sharply upwards - to 80 per cent of the west German level in some sectors - many more jobs will go. Although the economy has lifted somewhat after its near total collapse last year, self-sustaining improvement is hard to discern, despite an infusion of government funds estimated at DM180bn (Pounds 63bn) this year. The danger, as the Brandenburg premier has often warned, is that over time this will lead to political radicalisation. The tools which extremists could use are already to hand. Says Mr Stolpe as he prepares to board a flight to campaign for his party in Baden-Wurttemberg: 'We Germans are a mad people.' The German government yesterday moved to clear the legal log-jam blocking investment in the former GDR, writes Christopher Parkes. All claims from former owners of businesses, houses, land and other properties, including Jews dispossessed before the war, must be registered before the end of this year, Mr Klaus Kinkel, justice minister, announced in Bonn. Former owners demanding the return of businesses must also present new business plans within four weeks of registering their claims. Unveiling a draft legal amendment, he said he had 'gone as far as constitutionally possible' in his efforts to speed the clearing up over 1m property disputes caused by 40 years of communist mismanagement and Nazi appropriations.</p>

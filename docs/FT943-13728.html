			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (17): Haunting test even for Solomon / A look at land reform Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general of the African National Congress, is probably not overstating the problem in this line from a recent speech on land reform: 'Unless we settle the land question, we do not have a country. If we handle it badly, we tear South Africa to pieces. If we manage it well, we create the foundations of a truly united nation.' Deputy President FW de Klerk recently highlighted land reform as one of the issues which could destroy the government of national unity and anyone with even a passing acquaintance with the issue must recognise that resolving competing interests, meeting basic needs and defusing anger over land will require not only the wisdom of Solomon, but quite a lot of his wealth as well. Apartheid's worst injustices were concentrated in this area. Since 1960, an estimated 3.5m people have been forcibly removed from their homes under various programmes designed to rid white South Africa of blacks. Some 1.2m black farmers have been left with only 17m hectares of often sub-standard land - 13 per cent of the country's total - while 55,000 whites, employing a further 1.1m blacks as labourers, farm 102m hectares. Millions more are simply in need of land for settlement, whether urban or rural. In the former homelands, 83 per cent of black households are estimated to fall below the poverty line, largely the result of land shortage. It is a massive problem. 'If you don't have a land reform programme with some significant effect, it comes back repeatedly to haunt you. People's grievances don't just vanish,' says Mr Derek Hanekom, the newly-appointed minister of land affairs, from the African National Congress. He points out that land reform is central to the Reconstruction and Development Programme which calls for 30 per cent of South Africa's land to be redistributed over five years beginning next year. Mr Hanekom estimates the cost at R2bn a year - although only R92m is allocated for land reform in the present year's budget, which provides only a total of R2.5bn for all the RDP programmes. He outlines the government's goals as: Restitution: a Commission on Restitution of Land Rights and a Land Claims Court will be set up to deal with the claims of forced removals victims. Under the new constitution, people dispossessed of land after 1913 - the year when systematic racial dispossession began in earnest - can claim restitution from the state. Original land may be returned to them or, where this is not feasible, alternative state-owned land or other compensation will be provided. But under the bill of rights, the interests of existing as well as original landowners must be respected. The constitution bars expropriation except for 'public purposes', and requires that 'just and equitable' compensation be paid, taking into account factors such as market value, use of the property and value of investments in it. Mr Hanekom says that only state-owned land and land acquired through the market will be used for this purpose, or for: Redistribution: millions of black South Africans - not just those with historical grievances - lack adequate land for settlement. Their plight has been highlighted by cases of squatters invading privately-owned land near Johannesburg, an invasion which the government condemned. But, as the World Bank points out in a recent policy document on land reform: 'It is essential that an expeditious, transparent and thorough land restoration and redistribution process be implemented as a means of discouraging the landless from resorting to land invasions.' As Mr Geoff Budlender, a land lawyer, puts it: 'Land occupation is the only functioning land claims process in South Africa today.' Until land reform begins in earnest, the threat of invasion will grow. Rural restructuring: 'Restitution entails more than just the acquisition of lost land,' says Mr Hanekom. 'Good planning, the resettlement of people, the provision of infrastructure and services, economic support programmes, sustainable development and, very importantly, community institution building are essential elements of the programme.' Legal and market reforms: tenure rights will be strengthened, and state financial institutions restructured to improve poor people's access to finance. 'We want to remove the impediments, and ensure that those people who are in a position to take advantage of market opportunities are encouraged as much as possible,' Mr Hanekom told the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day recently. Mr Hanekom does not mention reform of agricultural markets - the ministry of agriculture is the responsibility of the opposition National Party - but the government's programme includes measures to stimulate competition in agricultural markets and reduce barriers to entry, as an essential adjunct to land reform. Many questions remain unanswered. How will the beneficiaries be chosen: according to need, or the ability to farm land productively? How will nepotism and corruption be avoided? Where will the money come from? Can the state move quickly enough to stave off the threat of invasion? One fact is clear, however: the present highly unequal pattern of land ownership cannot continue. Other countries with a similar pattern have seen neglect lead to civil disorder and violence. South Africa cannot afford to do the same.</p>

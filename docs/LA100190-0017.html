			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: 'TOOTH': PUPPET SHOW WITH OFFBEAT BITE  </P> <P> Talking clocks, singing socks, sight gags and TV send-ups -- "The Timmy the  Tooth Variety Show," a new live puppet theater production for children at  Burbank's Gypsy Playhouse, holds offbeat appeal for adults as well.  </P> <P> Timmy the Tooth, a congenial bicuspid and show biz enthusiast, along with his  sidekick Ed McBrush-Brush, hosts an assortment of talents, from Dean Thesaurus  ("Don't quit your day job, Dean") to the rock 'n' rollin' New Socks on the  Block, with their hit song, "Burnin' Itch."  </P> <P> Julia Giraffe conducts a "Name That Fruit" segment where the hapless  contestants end up in the blender, a commercial advertises "Ninja Babies" and  Dr. Gum interrupts the proceedings to warn Timmy about a blue, tentacled Cavity  Creep on the loose.  </P> <P> With its obvious mix of Pee Wee Herman and "The Muppet Show" influences, it's  no surprise to learn that writer-puppeteer Kevin Carlson plays Clockey, Floorey  and Conky on "Pee Wee's Playhouse," or that co-writer and puppeteer James  Murray has worked with the late Jim Henson and Disney Productions and on such  shows as "D.C. Follies."  </P> <P> Director Susan Carlson and producer-performer Dina Murray, with extensive  backgrounds in children's theater, have also been involved with Muppet and  Disney productions.  </P> <P> The puppet designs lack originality and there are some timing lags, but the  music and dialogue have professional polish, and Michael Fairman's lighting --  strobe and colors -- is a young crowd pleaser. It's pleasant fun from the  Kidding Around Productions troupe, with one caveat: The small theater is stuffy  on a warm day, despite overhead fans.  </P> <P>  At 3321 W. Olive Ave. in Burbank through Oct. 27, Saturdays at noon and 2 p.m.  $4; (818) 954-9858.  </P></p>

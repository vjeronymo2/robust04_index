			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE LETS REFUGEES HELD IN TEXAS LEAVE  </P> <P> Hundreds of Central American refugees, many of them living for weeks in a South  Texas shantytown, were granted the right to leave Monday after a federal judge  ordered the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to stop refusing them  permission to travel while their asylum applications are being reviewed.  </P> <P> The action, a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Filemon  Vela in Brownsville, was greeted with cheers by an estimated 300 refugees who  had been living in a field without running water or toilets. Their only shelter  often was a piece of heavy plastic propped up by branches cut from nearby  trees. Others stayed in the shell of the gutted Amber Motel in Brownsville,  bathing at a nearby car wash.  </P> <P> In all, nearly 2,000 aliens were believed to be in Brownsville under the INS  travel restriction that took effect Dec. 16.  </P> <P> "One would have to be blind not to recognize that we have a problem," said Vela  in issuing the order, which will remain in effect pending a hearing Thursday,  when he will hear arguments on issuing an indefinite permanent injunction  against the INS.  </P> <P> The INS, meanwhile, defended its policy, saying that it was designed to curb  abuses in the asylum process that has created thousands of backlog cases in  some cities. More than 30,000 Central Americans passed through the southern tip  of Texas last year.  </P> <P> Many of them are Nicaraguans -- about 16,000 since late May -- a huge increase  brought on by the dual collapse of the Contra armies and the Sandinista  economy. The INS position is that most of those now seeking asylum are doing so  for economic reasons, not political ones, and therefore are not eligible for  asylum.  </P> <P> But those who filed the suit that led to Vela's order contended that the INS  action is inhumane, as well as a violation of provisions enacted by Congress in  1980 to ensure fair asylum hearings. Further, they also said it is a policy  that does not conform with federal guidelines that mandate a 30-day notice for  major policy changes. Before the new rule went into effect Dec. 16, a refugee  was allowed to apply for asylum where he or she planned to reside. The  applications can often take months to resolve.  </P> <P> "We are very heartened by the decision," said Robert Rubin of the San Francisco  Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs, one of the organizations that  participated in the suit. "We will vigorously pursue the case. There was  tremendous exhilaration on the part of the refugees. Many of them told me they  were leaving immediately."  </P> <P> The judge's ruling came after he rejected a request from INS lawyer David Ayala  to delay action to give the government a chance to prepare further arguments.  </P> <P> Brownsville, in one of the poorest regions in the United States, began feeling  the pinch of the new INS rule in late December as more and more Central  American refugees crossed the border and registered for asylum. And each one  was told that he was required to stay in the area.  </P> <P> Casa Oscar Romero, long a haven for refugees, quickly filled to its 200-person  capacity, leaving hundreds of impoverished Central Americans to fend for  themselves. Miami, another popular destination for refugees, also began to feel  the pressure of a mounting population and a baseball stadium was transformed  into a makeshift shelter.  </P> <P> Then, on Friday, attorneys working on behalf of the refugees filed suit. The  judge's action Monday came as some refugees faced a further dilemma. The owner  of the land where many are squatting has complained that they are trespassing  on his property.  </P></p>

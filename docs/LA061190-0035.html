			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET FILM BREAKS GLASNOST'S LAST TABOOS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: STANISLAV GOVORUKHIN'S 'THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE' EQUATES RAPE AND MURDER  WITH COMMUNIST PARTY ACTIONS. EVEN GORBACHEV APPROVES.  </P> <P> A film that equates criminals who rape and murder without mercy or regret with  the Communist Party's actions during 72 years is already a sensation before it  opens at Moscow movie theaters.  </P> <P> The new documentary, "This Is No Way to Live," by Stanislav Govorukhin, breaks  most of the last taboos left in the glasnost era.  </P> <P> Govorukhin rolls the tragedies of Communist rule, the humiliation of Soviet  life and his personal indignation at the fate of his country into an indictment  so powerful it would seem that authorities would have to ban the film.  </P> <P> But the authorities have changed.  </P> <P> The Foreign Ministry staged a screening. Moscow City Council deputies have  pledged to bring the movie to cinemas. Govorukhin said President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev himself proclaimed the film "wonderful" after a private viewing.  </P> <P> "For the life of me, I can't understand how Gorbachev could like it," he said,  sounding distressed.  </P> <P> "This Is No Way to Live" begins with graphic scenes of rape and murder in a  style familiar to viewers of Leningrad TV's "600 Seconds," a daily program that  frequently shows grisly crime scenes.  </P> <P> Then it moves into Part 2: "Criminals in Power."  </P> <P> Beginning with the 1918 murder of Czar Nicholas II and other members of the  royal Romanov family, it presents viewers with one Bolshevik crime against the  people after another.  </P> <P> It documents the mass slaughter of the bourgeoisie under Lenin; the  artificially created famines; the tens of millions of deaths and imprisonments  under Stalin; the destruction of churches and liquidation of the priesthood;  the distortion of people's consciousness with ideological propaganda; and the  impoverishment of the vast, rich country through idiotic mismanagement.  </P> <P> The scenes shift next to the "disgusting humiliation" of everyday Soviet life,  with its lines, shortages, poverty and moral bankruptcy, and the crooked bodies  created by such conditions and "70 years of the wrong genetic policy."  </P> <P> "The crimes of Hitler's regime cannot begin to measure up to all this in scale  and cruelty, especially if you consider that it was done against one's own  people," Govorukhin says in the film's narration.  </P> <P> Against footage of the post-World War II Nurnburg trials of Nazi leaders, he  raises the prospect of a similar national trial of Communists. He says the  organizers of a crime should bear the brunt of punishment.  </P> <P> The Moscow News weekly predicted last week that Govorukhin would be accused of  "malice, mockery and painting everything black" by "the very people whom he  proposes for a national trial."  </P> <P> Judging by two preliminary screenings and commentaries beginning to appear in  the Soviet press, however, it is mainly Govorukhin's unrelieved gloom, not his  political views, that upsets audiences.  </P> <P> One viewer at the Foreign Ministry showing remarked that "we all already know  we can't live this way. What we need to know is how we should live."  </P> <P> Govorukhin, a tall, balding man with a deep voice, offered no apologies for his  downbeat views at question-and-answer sessions after the screenings.  </P> <P> "Personally, I'm a pessimist," he said. "I have no basis to think everything  will get better quickly. There's no one in this whole country except absolute  idiots who doesn't think tomorrow will be worse. And when people have no hope,  and God has been taken away from them, what can you expect?"  </P> <P> Govorukhin, well-known as a journalist and director of commercial films, said  he made "This Is No Way to Live" mainly as a "letter to the Supreme Soviet." He  wants wide distribution for the film, but he was most concerned it be seen and  understood by the country's leaders.  </P> <P> Soviet lawmakers already have had several screenings, and chances are most will  see the film as its fame grows. Two of Moscow's biggest cinemas have also  committed themselves to showing it.  </P> <P> Members of the Russian Congress saw the film earlier this week, and its  influence has already been felt on the floor.  </P> <P> A deputy from the Russian town of Saratov quoted Govorukhin from the podium on  Wednesday, saying, "If a country is this rich and the people are this poor,  that's a crime."  </P> <P> Another deputy noted that the film "threw in our face the horrible but honest  truth. We can understand it differently but we all agree: This is no way to  live."  </P> <P> Govorukhin said legislators told him the documentary made conservative deputies  more conservative and radicals more radical, but in all it managed to move the  center slightly toward more reformist views. "If that's so, then it has played  its role," he said.  </P></p>

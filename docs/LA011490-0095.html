			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIAN STARS NO LONGER ON RUN;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: ATHLETES TELL OF THEIR COUNTRY'S REVOLUTION AS THEY PREPARE  FOR MEET AT THE SPORTS ARENA.  </P> <P> With a bright sun streaming in on the warm breakfast room, slicing though dark  clouds outside, talk of cruelty and torture and revolution seemed far removed.  </P> <P> The three Romanian athletes were laughing at their ability to laugh, to find  humor and hope in their experiences during their country's violent 11-day  revolution that ended a day after Christmas. The three -- Paula Ivan, the world  record-holder at one mile, Maricica Puica, former Olympic champion at 3,000  meters, and Violeta Beclea, a rising star at 800 meters -- were having  breakfast Saturday at a Los Angeles hotel. Their odyssey had taken them from  Bucharest -- where the airport, heavily damaged in the fighting, "looked like  Swiss cheese" Puica said -- to Warsaw, to Frankfurt, to London, and, after 23  hours of travel, they had touched down here.  </P> <P> Puica, the eldest and now a coach, had cried when she was greeted by old  friends Friday night. It was like coming out of a dream, she told them.  </P> <P> Now, retelling the horrors of the revolution that overthrew the 24-year regime  of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Puica paused and wondered, "I can't believe that  now we can laugh about it."  </P> <P> It is hard to believe they are even here. Ivan and Beclea are here to run in  the Sunkist Invitational track meet at the Sports Arena Friday night. Ivan in  particular will be chasing the indoor world record for the mile, 4 minutes 18.6  seconds, held by countrywoman Doina Melinte. Ivan ran 4:18.99 last season. Meet  promoter Al Franken is offering $100,000 to the man or woman who can break the  record at his meet.  </P> <P> A big payday, ever the great incentive in amateur sports, is not the greatest  incentive for the Romanians to be here. They are here because they are free to  be here.  </P> <P> And, after months of negotiations and agreements with the Romanian government  and refusals by the government, Puica, Ivan and Beclea are nearly giddy about  their freedom to travel where they wish. They might well have come here without  the meet.  </P> <P> All three live and train in Bucharest and each observed the revolution up  close, while the rest of the world was watching it unfold on the evening news.  Snipers, tanks in the streets and house-to-house fighting helped put sport in  perspective at a time of social upheaval.  </P> <P> "I was scared to death. It was a war," Puica said through interpreter Valdimir  Moraru. Moraru, who lives in Glendale, had been a sports writer in Romania for  15 years before he defected in 1984.  </P> <P> "I had strange and mixed feelings," she said. "Sometimes I felt like I was in  the movies. Then I realized I could get shot. It was a kind of anarchy. Some  civilians got weapons. Also, terrorists changed their clothes and you didn't  know who was who."  </P> <P> What had been horrible fighting, but far removed, became something else on Dec.  21. On that day Romanians were beginning to hear about the massacre of  thousands in Timisoara. Puica, Ivan and Beclea attended a rally with thousands  of people in the Palace Square in Bucharest. Ceausescu addressed the crowd,  which began to boo and shout, 'Give us our dead.'  </P> <P> Never before had Romanians dared to jeer the dictator.  </P> <P> "Then someone came out and said, 'The Minister of Defense has committed  suicide,' " Puica said.  </P> <P> Ivan quickly disagreed, "No, he was shot," she said. "People began to chant,  'Down with Ceausescu.' "  </P> <P> It was at that rally that many Romanians understood that what was happening in  their country had moved from being isolated uprisings and unrest and had  bloomed into a full-scale, bloody revolution. Standing there, in the  electricity of the throng in the Palace Square, Ivan said that everything  suddenly changed.  </P> <P> "At first we were excited," she said of the new-found show of dissent. "Then we  were frightened. It was easy to see that it was a revolution. The fighting  started."  </P> <P> Said Puica: "We were happy, but also scared to death. It was a profound sadness  because people were dying and the number of dead was so many."  </P> <P> Moraru repeated scenes that the women had described in which children had stood  in front of tanks, saying there were not Fascists. "They crushed them like they  were not there," he said. "You cannot imagine. They crushed them like they were  not there."  </P> <P> Puica, who understands some English, shakes her head when she hears this, still  incredulous.  </P> <P> One of the many battles in Bucharest was over control of the state-run  television station. After civilians wrested control from the army, the station  broadcast remarkable hours of a country being born: new leaders talking with  army officers, asking them to lay down their guns, patriots, poets and common  people speaking to the nation. Puica, a national sports hero, asked for time to  speak.  </P> <P> "Someone drove me about half a mile and then people surrounded me and protected  me and walked me to the TV station," she said.  </P> <P> Puica spoke to her people of patriotism and freedom: "I am proud to be a  Romanian and I'm proud of the youth of this country who sacrificed their lives  to give freedom to the people. I did not give blood in the fighting, but I am  going to give blood to the wounded. When I was an active athlete, I had many  offers to defect. But I did not want it. I said, 'If we have to die, let us die  together.' "  </P> <P> That night, after she got home, Puica received a telephoned death threat. "The  man said, 'I saw you on TV. You are going to see what happens to you.' I took  it very seriously," she said.  </P> <P> A byproduct of the seemingly random violence was the way in which it restricted  movement. To venture out to buy bread, Puica said, was to mount a tactical plan  that depended on speed, knowledge of the neighborhood, and not a small amount  of luck. "Nobody put a (gun) to my head. But we knew we could be shot at any  time. At any time."  </P> <P> Without safe modes of transportation, there was uncertainty about the safety of  family members in other parts of the country. Beclea, Puica and her husband,  and Ivan and her husband were together in Bucharest and knew from day to day  that all were safe.  </P> <P> Ivan, however, grew worried about her parents, who lived 18 miles from the  city. An army unit was holding the area and there were reports of fighting.  Ivan and her husband finally drove to the village, through several civilian  checkpoints, and found the family scared, but safe.  </P> <P> Priorities were drastically rearranged. Even for world-class athletes, training  became secondary. It was also unsafe.  </P> <P> "I did go to practice, but I did not know what to do," Beclea said. "I did not  know if I should go or stay inside."  </P> <P> The timing of the revolution ended the holiday spirit.  </P> <P> "Nobody celebrated Christmas," Puica said. "We were happy that we were free but  everybody was thinking of the dead."  </P> <P> Sad, but still defiant. Moraru told of a Romanian Christmas tradition of  preparing an elaborate pork dish. This Christmas, there were no pigs to be  slaughtered. "Houses were hanging banners that said, 'Christmas without the  pig.' You know who the pig is."  </P> <P> New Year's Eve was not festive, despite the fact that the "people" were solidly  in control. Pockets of Ceausescu's security forces were still at large. "People  were afraid of gathering together," Moraru said. "After they executed Ceausescu  on Christmas Day, the security people still fighting sent out flyers, saying,  'Christmas was yours, New Year's Eve will be ours.' There was still some  isolated shooting last Wednesday when they left."  </P> <P> Puica said that the Romanian people were moved by the world-wide response to  their uprising. "We got tremendous, incredible help," she said. "We were  overwhelmed by the response. I was impressed by the French. They were the first  to react and send help. Some French journalist died in the fighting. They were  the first to send food, medicine, milk for the kids. All the countries in  Europe were helping."  </P> <P> Now, sitting comfortably after breakfast, the women were clearly struggling  with mixed emotions. Telling unbelievable stories of torture chambers and  thousands of missing, while knowing it was all over but not forgotten. Sitting  in sunshine while Romania experiences one of its harshest winters on record.  Eating fruit while some Romanians have been without water. So many  contradictions.  </P> <P> Asked which was the greater emotion, the joy of freedom or the sadness of the  cost, Puica said quietly, "Both."  </P> <P> With that, they went quietly to find a place to train, the worst of their  running behind them.  </P></p>

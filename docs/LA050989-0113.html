			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN ORDERED PAN AM BOMBING, W. GERMAN MAGAZINE REPORTS  </P> <P> Iran ordered the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 and paid a Palestinian  terrorist more than $1 million to carry out the bombing, a West German magazine  said Monday.  </P> <P> Munich-based Quick said a bomb was placed aboard the Boeing 747 to avenge the  shooting down of an Iranian civilian jet by the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> It said the Iranians paid Palestinian terrorist Ahmed Jibril $1.3 million to  carry out the attack.  </P> <P> Pan Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259  people aboard and 11 on the ground. British investigators determined that the  plane was downed by a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette recorder.  </P> <P> Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, changed planes in London and  was en route to New York when it exploded.  </P> <P> Quick said the decision to retaliate by attacking the plane was made in Tehran  last summer, shortly after the Iran Air jetliner was downed by the U.S. guided  missile cruiser Vincennes on July 3. The Navy said it mistook the passenger  plane with 290 people aboard for an Iranian fighter jet.  </P> <P> The magazine said the decision to bomb an American plane was made in a "narrow  circle" of close advisers to Iran's leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  </P> <P> The Quick report is the latest of many assigning blame for the disaster.  Officially, authorities in West Germany, Britain and the United States say they  do not know who blew up the aircraft.  </P> <P> Quick reported its information was based on "secret" minutes of the meeting in  Tehran and said a Khomeini aide, Mehdi Karoubi, offered money to the group that  would carry out the attack.  </P> <P> West German authorities are holding two suspected members of Jibril's  Syrian-supported group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command. West German officials say they have no evidence to  link the two men to the Pan Am bombing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Oliver Revell, deputy director of the FBI, was quoted by the  magazine as saying: "Our investigating officials believe the explosive came  onto the plane in Frankfurt. That does not mean that the bomb could not have  been on a connecting flight to Frankfurt. However, we have every reason to  believe that the bomb was taken on by Pan Am in Frankfurt."  </P></p>

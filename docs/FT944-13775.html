			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ScotMet returns to the black Scottish Metropolitan, Scotland's largest property company, yesterday announced a turnround to pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the year to August 15, against losses of Pounds 1.78m. The recovery was underpinned by a 44 per cent reduction in interest costs from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 9m and a Pounds 5.56m gain on the sale of investment properties. Operating profits shrunk to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 17.6m) as net revenue from properties fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 19m) after a Pounds 35.9m net disposal of properties. Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, said the company would improve net revenue by reducing its level of vacant properties. 'We are still running with higher than average voids in the sector,' he said. 'We do not expect a lot of help from the letting market in the next 12 months, but we still expect to reduce the level of vacant properties.' The company also aims to increase its portfolio of Scottish property, particularly in the industrial sector, and further reduce its office property. Gearing fell from 181 per cent to 61 per cent as borrowings were cut from Pounds 144.9m to Pounds 79.2m by the year-end. During the period a rights issue raised Pounds 26.8m net of expenses. A Pounds 13.8m surplus on valuation of investment properties also helped to lift net asset value per share from 81.7p to 99.3p. Earnings per share stood at 8.82p after 2.13p losses last year. A recommended final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2p (1.5p).</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (3): Keeping the drama out of a crisis - Back-up BACK-UP is like insurance, it costs money and is only useful if something goes wrong. Most users accept the need to take back-ups. These should be kept off the premises, in the bank or at the home of a member of staff, so that a physical accident cannot destroy both data on the machine and the back-up. A back-up system should enable a user to re-create his data if a failure occurs. In the case of a complete disaster, such as a fire, everything must be re-created, perhaps on a new machine. Although disk drives (the most common data medium) are reliable, they can fail, and, if they do, data can be lost. In the event of a complete failure, everything may need to be re-constructed, in a partial failure, only the affected information should be restored. When data has been lost through a software or user fault (such as the inadvertent deletion of one or more files), the affected file must be restored, along with any others which might be affected by the change. A computer stores a variety of different types of information: The programs and procedures used to process the data and to operate the machine. 'Fixed' data (such as tabular information) which is seldom updated. More transient data (such as transactions) which are frequently updated. Temporary data. A simple back-up system might take a complete 'picture' of all this data. If an accident happens, the user can recover all the data from the back-up, to re-create conditions at the point that it was made. Any subsequent work would be lost. Complete back-up of all data can take a long time and during the process, no other work is possible. So this form of back-up is only suitable when data does not change often. A more sophisticated system might take long-term copies of items 1 and 2 and then back-up 3 and 4. In the event of a total failure, the user would apply both copies to re-create the whole set of data. In a partial failure, only the transient data would be needed. It might even be possible to recover only the files which have been damaged. Thus, if a tabular file has been corrupted or lost, only that one file need be restored. More intelligent, partial back-up and recovery systems take less time, and can therefore be run more frequently. However, they can be dangerous. For instance, an application system may update more than one file from a single transaction. Entry of a sales order could entail updating both the order and the customer files (the latter to hold the value of outstanding orders for credit control purposes). If an error wipes the order file, and it alone is restored, then the orders since the point of failure are re-entered, customers may appear to have higher order levels than they should. Careful planning is needed to keep back-up strategy consistent with overall data integrity. In a sophisticated system, the partial back-up is supplemented with a transaction logging system which records all transactions since the back-up was taken. In the event of a failure, files are restored from the back-up and the transactions re-applied to re-create the system up to the point of failure. Applications built using database management packages often incorporate this capability. Magnetic tapes are most often used for back-up on larger systems. They are quick to read and write and of a high capacity. Their disadvantage is that the whole tape must be searched to find a particular item. Few PCs (apart from network file servers) have tape drives and diskettes are the most common medium for back-up. However, their capacity is low, and the user must frequently change diskettes. PC users have a poor back-up system provided with MS-DOS, but better systems are available from certain specialist software suppliers. Back-up tapes or diskettes should not just be stacked up in heaps. Users normally have some sort of cycling system. The most common form is 'grandfather, father, son'. Three tapes are kept, the latest wiping the oldest. This may not be sophisticated enough for an accounting system, where the back-up also represents a form of audit trail. There, the user may keep a cycled back-up during the month, then retain a copy of each month end's files for the current year, and five years' worth of year end data. Keeping regular back-up is vitally important because loss of data can be critical to even the smallest organisation. The back-up media should be stored in a different physical location from the main data to provide physical security.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC Arbitrage traders have a mixed reputation among companies, but the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation must be wondering what it can do to encourage them. HSBC's sterling shares are now trading at a 7 per cent discount to the Hong Kong dollar-denominated version. Since the securities carry identical rights in respect of voting and dividends, and are available in London and Hong Kong, the anomaly is puzzling. There are some technical differences in the way the shares trade: the Hong Kong stock exchange uses rolling settlement, for example. But this would hardly account for such a significant discrepancy in price. Another factor may be consistent selling of sterling stock by former Midland Bank shareholders who reluctantly accepted the HSBC offer. Against a background of generally weak trading volume this steady supply of stock could easily depress the sterling share price. Both classes of shares have moved roughly in line with local indices, so indexed funds may be supporting the Hong Kong dollar stock. Fears of a sterling devaluation and hopes for a dollar recovery may also play a part; although the discount has actually widened as the Hong Kong dollar has weakened, and equities are not usually held as a proxy for currency exposure. Whatever the explanation, arbitrage traders have so far been unwilling to close the gap. Thin trading volume of the sterling shares in Hong Kong may be discouraging even bargain-conscious Far Eastern investors from buying the cheaper stock. Meanwhile, the differential is something of an embarrassment. Midland shareholders who accepted HSBC paper under the offer might justifiably feel short-changed. For the rest of the market, arbitrage traders or not, the cheapest route into HSBC is through the sterling stock.</p>

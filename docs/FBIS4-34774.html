			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The branches of  U.S. banks Citibank and Bank of Boston in Haiti closed their  doors today in compliance with a Washington order to broaden  sanctions against the coupist regime.    A Citibank official reported the measure was adopted because  of the White House decision to freeze the funds of Haitian  citizens in U.S. banks, without regard to the currency in which  they are registered. "We are taking necessary steps to obtain  permission to continue operating, however in a limited  capacity... that is why we prefer to close our doors today.  This is not a definitive closing," the source declared.    Haiti's Ministry of Finance and Economy warned that if these  banks do not resume their operations, the government will sue  them to force them to respect Haitian laws.    The closing of the banks (the fourth and fifth largest of  the  nine banks operating in the country) caused discontent among  patrons who are not on the lists of people sanctioned by the  U.S. Government.    Together with the order, which expands on the one issued on  10 June, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a list containing  the names of 250 members of Haiti's political and economic  elite, in addition to the nearly 650 supporters of the coupists.    The government of President William Clinton suspended the  visas and resident status of Haitian senators who appointed  Emile Jonassaint as de facto president.    In response to the U.S. measure, the Interior Ministry  announced this Thursday that all foreign citizens will require a  visa to enter the country, for which they will have to pay $50  upon arriving in Haitian territory.    The Interior Ministry added that the foreigners who reside  in  the Caribbean country must renew their residence permit at the  end of the current fiscal period. Foreigners must also prove  that they have paid their taxes to the Haitian State.    Meanwhile, Army Commander General Raoul Cedras, whose  resignation the U.S. Government demands as a condition to  lifting the blockade, visited military garrisons in  Port-au-Prince to "lift the morale of his troops."    The blockade against Haiti will be more restrictive as of  0900 next Saturday, when American, Air Canada, ALM, and COPA  airlines suspend their services to the Caribbean nation. Only  Air France will maintain its three weekly flights.    As the date approaches, the coupists increase the aggressive  tone of their speeches against the international community and  even participate in voodoo ceremonies to invocate the  "protection of the guardian gods against foreign intervention."    According to political analysts, however, the coupists have  a  less aggressive position than the one they held last October  when they opposed the return of deposed President Jean Bertrand  Aristide although they had signed the Governors Isle Agreement  accepting Aristide's return.    The paramilitary Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front  (FRAPH) canceled a strike it had announced for this Friday.  This contrasts with its patrol operations to oblige people to  respect the strike it decreed last October.    This Thursday, the two most important Haitian labor unions  asked Cedras to resign from his post to ease the return of  constitutional order and the lifting of the penalties that have  negatively affected the population.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hazlewood Foods chooses chief executive Hazlewood Foods, which in June reported severe problems with four of its plants, has promoted Mr John Simons, its finance director, to UK chief executive, writes Roderick Oram. He replaces Mr Chris Ball who resigned when the company revealed that the four acquired, newly built or reorganised plants were running up losses. Mr Simons is succeeded as finance director by Mr Kevin Higginson, the financial controller. Progress had been made with the plants during the summer, Mr Peter Barr, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday. Two should become profitable next month, a third during the second half and the fourth was sold last month. Hazlewood would continue to dispose of non-core businesses, he added. As a result of the problems flagged in June, profits for the first half to September 30 would show 'a very significant shortfall' from a year earlier, he said. The shares rose 9p to 139p.</p>

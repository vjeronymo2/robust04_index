			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Major tries to reassure Gulf allies MR John Major, British prime minister, yesterday sought to reassure the UK's Gulf allies - the US and France - that attacks on Iraq were not intended to break up that country. Speaking in Oman, he said the allied governments were united in strategy against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 'I am quite confident of that,' Mr Major said, in spite of some evidence of tension over recent attacks. Later, Mr Major dined with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. The prime minister was conscious that Oman and Saudi Arabia are concerned about Iran's greater strength as a regional power no longer checked by Iraq. But, in his talks with Sultan Qaboos of Oman, he would have emphasised that allied strikes enforced United Nations resolutions and international law. Mr Major's discussions also covered the Bosnian situation. He played down the chances of UK military intervention to protect Moslems there, saying that helping humanitarian aid and searching for a political settlement were, 'for the time being, the way forward.' He told a news conference that he supported calls for the 400 Palestinians expelled by Israel 'to be returned from whence they came.' President Saddam Hussein held talks with the Iraqi military for a fifth day yesterday, the latest in a series of highly publicised meetings, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Mr Saddam has had seven meetings with military officers, many with the air force. The reason, whether morale boosting or operational planning, was not immediately clear. UN weapons inspectors, reported that their first inspections of the Bill Clinton presidency were proceeding without incident. Mr Maurizio Zifferero, chief nuclear inspector, on his return from inspecting a site in northwestern Iraq said yesterday Baghdad was co-operating thus far.</p>

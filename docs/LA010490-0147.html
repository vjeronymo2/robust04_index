			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO;  </P> <P> $30 ANNUAL FEE ESTABLISHED FOR AMBULANCE, PARAMEDICS  </P> <P> The Montebello City Council has approved a program that will allow residents  and businesses to pay a $30 annual fee to cover ambulance and paramedic  services.  </P> <P> The program, in which residents who want to sign up pay the city $30 and the  city then covers all costs for paramedic and ambulance services, is expected to  be implemented sometime this spring, Councilman William Molinari said.  </P> <P> Molinari said the town's sizable senior citizen community would benefit most  from such a service.  </P> <P> Residents are now paying about $50 for paramedic service and about $250 for  ambulance transport within Montebello city limits, Molinari said.  </P> <P> "Senior citizens are particularly concerned about the expensive costs,"  Molinari said. "This gives them peace of mind. If they need ambulance service  they don't have to worry about the cost."  </P> <P> Because fees have not been determined for low-income and senior residents, it  is unknown how many people will have to sign up in order for the program to  become self-supporting, according to the staff report. It is estimated that  more than 20% of the town's residents paying the standard $30 would join within  a few years, bringing in $137,000 to cover costs.  </P></p>

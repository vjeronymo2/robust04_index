It is designed for executive and  business flights but can be reequipped, without special  additional expenditure, to function as an air ambulance or  training or cargo plane. Its short takeoff and landing means  that it can be used on improvised grass airstrips.    The creation of this aircraft marks the revival of mutually  advantageous economic relations between the two states. A few  days ago at the test range the new aircraft took off with  enviable ease and reaching the required height successfully  passed its first test. Present at the test range were head of  the Georgian state Eduard Shevardnadze, Prime Minister Otar  Patsatsia, and Georgian and foreign journalists.</p>

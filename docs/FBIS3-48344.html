			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  in an article titled "Whither Are They Leading North-South  Relations?" Accuses the South Korean puppets of pursuing  North-South confrontation and war against fellow countrymen in  conspiracy with outside forces, not national unity and  reconciliation, from the beginning of the year.    The author of the article says:    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique makes provocative remarks  from  the beginning of the year over the fiction of "nuclear issue of  the North" and declares that in case the Team Spirit joint  military maneuvers were suspended this year, it would hold  large-scale war exercises combining Ulchi and Focus Lens.    Judging from their words and deeds, there is no doubt that  they will pursue North-South confrontation and resort to  military adventures against the North this year, too.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam opened the rice market of South  Korea in order to curry favour with his U.S. master and hurt  fellow countrymen. Thus, he fully revealed his treacherous  color as a colonial stooge.    The South Korean people have risen up in a struggle to oust  despicable Kim Yong-sam, saying there is nothing to expect from  the puppet who kowtows to his imperialist master, sells off the  country and the nation and tramples down the people's desire for  independence, democracy and reunification.    It is evident that the wretched puppet clique forsaken by  the  people will persistently pursue North-South confrontation and  may resort to military adventures, tailing behind outside  forces, in an attempt to get rid of the crisis.    The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique seeking war against the nation's desire for  peaceful reunification.</p>

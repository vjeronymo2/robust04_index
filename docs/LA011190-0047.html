			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINISTER ORDERED TO REPAY 6 IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> A former Glendale minister accused of illegally charging six immigrants for  residency cards he was unable to produce has been put on probation and ordered  to return thousands of dollars to the victims.  </P> <P> Elie Khoury, 50, pleaded no contest last Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court  to two counts of grand theft. As part of an agreement, a judge dropped two  other charges of grand theft and one count of attempted grand theft and  sentenced him to three years probation.  </P> <P> The judge also ordered Khoury to pay $7,500 in restitution to the six  immigrants on whose behalf the five criminal charges were filed.  </P> <P> "It is good news. Criminals like him, they should pay for what they've done,"  said Faye Garoian, a Lebanese immigrant who with her husband, Kevork, paid  Khoury $2,100 to obtain a green card. "A priest is supposed to be an honest  person. What is religion coming to?"  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Khoury, director of the Kingdom and World Mission of Our Lord  Jesus Christ, posed for three years as an immigration consultant who, for fees  as high as $1,500, falsely promised clients green cards. He then refused to  refund the money to dissatisfied clients, claiming the fees were donations to  his church -- at the time a storefront operation and his home at 1250 S.  Glendale Ave.  </P> <P> The self-styled minister was arrested Dec. 2, 1988, after threatening to have  clients deported or physically harmed if they reported him to authorities, said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard de la Sota.  </P> <P> The criminal charges followed a civil suit filed in late 1988 by the state  attorney general's office, which accused Khoury of bilking as many as 200  families out of an average $1,000 apiece.  </P> <P> The suit, still pending, alleges that Khoury told his clients he had been  authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to collect money for  his services. He had in fact been denied authorization several times, said  Deputy Atty. Gen. Jerry Smilowitz.  </P> <P> Smilowitz said the civil suit asks for a permanent injunction barring Khoury  from providing immigration consulting services for fees, and as much as  $200,000 in restitution and civil penalties.  </P> <P> Khoury's no-contest plea to the criminal charges, although treated like a  guilty plea for sentencing purposes, cannot be used as an admission of guilt in  the civil proceedings. A Superior Court hearing on the civil suit is set for  Jan. 17. Khoury is expected to represent himself.  </P> <P> On June 5, Khoury's probation officer will determine whether he has made a  good-faith effort to pay the $7,500 in restitution ordered by the court. If he  hasn't, he could spend a year in jail, said Larry Rivetz, a Los Angeles County  public defender who represented Khoury last week in court.  </P> <P> Khoury spent almost two months in jail before he was freed on bail in 1989.  Since then, he has moved his church and family to Hollywood. In a telephone  interview, Khoury said that he still holds small services for his family and  friends, but that his facilities and resources are limited.  </P> <P> "We have nothing. We are suffering. We are struggling," he said, adding that  his family is now on welfare.  </P> <P> Khoury said he will graduate in March from a nearby business college -- where  he is studying law enforcement -- and look for a job. During the interview, he  maintained his innocence but pledged to pay the restitution by working or  obtaining a loan. Khoury maintains that his clients donated the money to the  church. He also said that despite the contrary claims of the INS, he expects  the agency to notify him soon that he has been authorized to perform  immigration services.  </P> <P> "Considering the length of probation, I think he'll be able to make  restitution," Rivetz said.  </P> <P> But prosecutors and some of those who were bilked said they expect a long wait  for the return of the money. State investigators never discovered where the  fees collected by Khoury went.  </P> <P> "God only knows," Smilowitz said. "Certainly no pun intended by that. But we've  never been able to locate any active bank accounts or appreciable assets."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to those proposed in today's rule. Such State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, these State regulations will not be deemed as RCRA requirements until the State program modification is submitted to EPA and approved. Of course, States with existing regulations may continue to administer and enforce those regulations as a matter of State law. In addition, in implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with the States under cooperative agreements to minimize duplication of efforts; in many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, rather than take separate actions under Federal authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States that submit their official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date of EPA's regulations are not required to include regulations equivalent to the EPA regulations in their application. However, States must modify their programs by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization 12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standards equivalent to these standards in their application. The requirements States must meet when submitting final authorization applications are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. CERCLA Designation and RQ Adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that meets one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined at 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), pursuant to CERCLA Section 101(14) 42 U.S.C. 9601 (14)(c). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). Therefore, in addition to the K140 listing being proposed today for 40 CFR 261.32 and the U408 listing being proposed for 40 CFR 261.33, entries for K140 and U408 also are being proposed for Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or facility from which a hazardous substance has been released in a quantity that equals or exceeds its RQ must immediately notify the National Response Center of the release (see 40 CFR part 302). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to this reporting requirement under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11004, requires owners or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities. EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given immediately after the release of an RQ or more to the community emergency coordinator of the local emergency planning committee for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the State emergency planning commission of any State likely to be affected by the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The toll free telephone number of the National Response Center is 800&hyph;424&hyph;8802; in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is 202&hyph;267&hyph;2675.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustment of RQs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous wastes newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of one pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. The Agency's methodology for adjusting RQs of individual hazardous substances begins with an evaluation of the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of each hazardous substance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The intrinsic properties examined_called ``primary criteria''_are aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity (oral, dermal, and inhalation), ignitability, reactivity, chronic toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Generally, for each intrinsic property, the Agency ranks hazardous substances on a scale, associating a specific range of values on each scale with an RQ of 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 5000 pounds. The data for each hazardous substance are evaluated using various primary criteria; each hazardous substance may receive several tentative RQ values based on its particular intrinsic properties. The lowest of the tentative RQs becomes the ``primary criteria RQ'' for that substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For more detailed information on this methodology, see the preamble to an RQ adjustment final rule published on August 14, 1989 (54 FR 33426). A different methodology is used to assign adjusted RQs to radionuclides (see 54 FR 22524, May 24, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After the primary criteria RQs are assigned, substances are further evaluated for their susceptibility to certain degradative processes, which are used as secondary adjustment criteria. These natural degradative processes are biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis (BHP). If a hazardous substance, when released into the environment, degrades relatively rapidly to a less hazardous form by one or more of the BHP processes, its RQ (as determined by the primary RQ adjustment criteria) is generally raised one level. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This adjustment is made because the relative potential for harm to public health or welfare or the environment posed by the release of such a substance is reduced by these degradative processes. Conversely, if a hazardous substance degrades to a more hazardous product after its release, the original substance is assigned an RQ equal to the RQ for the more hazardous substance, which may be one or more levels lower than the RQ for the original substance. The downward adjustment is appropriate because the hazard posed by the release of the original substance is increased as a result of BHP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> No RQ level increase based on BHP occurs if the primary criteria RQ is already at its highest possible level (100 pounds for potential carcinogens and 5000 pounds for all other types of hazardous substances except radionuclides). BHP is not applied to radionuclides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

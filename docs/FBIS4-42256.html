			<p>BFN     [Text] According to information received by the Greek  Foreign Ministry, more Greek minority members are being arrested  in Delvine. Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said  today that there is information that the Albanian authorities  are searching for about 14 people. Four of them have already  been arrested.    The Greek Government has addressed a strong warning to  Albania to respect the Greek minority and described the Albanian  actions as a more general policy of intimidation against the  minority with the aim of causing panic and making people flee  their homes. The Greek Government will use every legal means to  protect the Greek minority, the Foreign Ministry spokesman  stressed and described the Albanian Government's actions as  tactics reminiscent of times condemned by the democratic  community.    Along with representations lodged by the Foreign Ministry  with both the [U.S.] State Department and the Albanian Foreign  Ministry, the Greek side has withdrawn its proposal for a  meeting between Greek and Albanian delegations to prepare a new  meeting between their foreign ministers.    Referring to a State Department appraisal that Greek  accusations of Albania's policy toward minority members are  baseless, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said these appraisals  have already been overshadowed by the new arrests in Delvine.    At noon today, Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign  Ministry secretary general, and Yeoryios Angelakis the  ministry's Balkan Affairs Department director, summoned U.S.  Charge d'Affaires James Williams to the Foreign Ministry.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said a short time  ago that, following the arrest of Greeks in Albania, Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a telephone conversation  with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. It will probably  take place today. Venizelos reiterated for the last time that  Greece considers the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations to  depend on respect for the rights of the Greek minority in  Albania. The government spokesman stressed that Greece will  take all the necessary steps with international organizations  and in the capitals of countries that have anything to do with  the issue.</p>

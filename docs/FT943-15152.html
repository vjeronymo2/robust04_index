			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Fokker to receive Fl 1bn cash injection Fokker, the loss-making Dutch aircraft maker, is to receive around Fl 1bn (Pounds 368m) to repair its eroded balance sheet from its majority shareholder, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, and from the Dutch government. The long-awaited refinancing is to consist of a capital injection of more than Fl 600m from Dasa, which bought a 51 per cent stake in Fokker in April 1993. The Dutch government, which has a minority holding in the Netherlands' only aerospace company, will indirectly help Fokker raise an additional Fl 400m by agreeing to approve a 'sale and lease-back' arrangement whereby Fokker plans to sell its aircraft-building technology to Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank. This part of the deal required government approval because the purchase of the patents by Rabobank is designed to reduce the bank's tax bill, depriving state coffers of Fl 400m in revenue. A similar technology lease-back arrangement was struck last year between Rabobank and Philips, the Dutch electronics group, after explicit approval from the Dutch government. In a letter to parliament, Mr Koos Andriessen, economic affairs minister, said details still had to be worked out and approved by the supervisory board of Dasa's parent company, Daimler-Benz, when it meets in November. 'Dasa is prepared to shoulder a substantial part of the burden (of the refinancing),' he said. As part of the financial restructuring, a new company will be set up at arm's length from Fokker to group the company's leasing activities. Customers are increasingly seeking to lease rather than buy Fokker's aircraft, and this puts strains on the company's own balance sheet. Fokker posted a net loss of Fl 460m in 1993 after taking a charge of Fl 275m for the declining value of its stock of unsold aircraft. It has forecast a recovery in the aircraft market in 1996. Until demand for its aircraft increases, Fokker has eliminated thousands of jobs and reduced the output of its two main products, the 50-seater Fokker 50 and the 100-seater Fokker 100.</p>

[Bordon] Hold on a moment. While the situation appeared  tense for a couple of days, I would wait before assuming that we  have found a solution. The Greens' assembly appeared to me to  be very good and Fabio Mussi's speech also seemed very good.  However, I do not think that all the problems have been  resolved and we cannot take our merger for granted on Tuesday [8  February] at the plenary session of the progressive table.  [Bordon stops]    Willer Bordon wants to get a few final details straightened  out. The Democratic Alliance's national coordinator had only  just come out of the cooperative climate of the convention in  Riccione and declared that he was "satisfied" but made it clear  that: "Nonetheless, for us there remain two vital issues cannot  be conceded and to which definitive answers have yet to be  found. Firstly, at the elections we want to put forward the name  of the prime minister or a list of candidates who could lead the  future progressive government. The second point concerns the  composition of the electoral lists.    [Marozzi] Will you continue to support [Prime Minister]  Ciampi's candidacy for prime minister? The Greens do not like  him and neither does Communist Renewal.    [Bordon] We have expressed our preference but we are not  going to stick fanatically to just one person. A group of  candidates could put themselves forward to be prime minister  before the election. However, it is important that we explain  to the voters on what points we oppose the moderates. We must  make it clear before the electorate goes to the polls. For  example, Francesco Rutelli came here today. It is true that he  is the only Green mayor of a large city [Rome] but it is equally  true that Communist Renewal is in the opposition in Rome.  Things like this must not occur.    [Marozzi] What do you not like about the composition of the  electoral lists? Mussi seems to have shown prompt readiness.    [Bordon] That is true, but now we must check what he has  said. There is a risk now of a nasty party division. That is  another gift that we cannot present to the moderates.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - Dean Marsh Dean Marsh, music business solicitor with David Wineman: 'Because my clients are unconventional I get away with more than most lawyers. I like a stylish but informal, faintly Italian look. I have several suits by Oswald Boateng and this green tweed one from Cordings, a shop so traditional it has become trendy. 'My problem was how to stop the suit looking too countrified - I always buy clothes with the overall effect in mind. My girlfriend's sense of style helped choose the shirt. Checks are slightly informal but red is a town colour and the traditional collar and double cuffs are smart. If I go for a drink with clients, this outfit is acceptable in some clubs where a straight City suit would not be. But I wouldn't wear it in court.'</p>

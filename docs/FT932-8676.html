			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / People: Leisure's allure The government been taking its time finding a replacement for William Davis, whose term as chairman of the British Tourist Authority and of the English Tourist Board ended in March. Although Davis's departure was announced in January, no successor has yet emerged. Davis, by contrast, has been quick to find something to fill those moments when he is not running his company Premier Magazines, which publishes titles for British Airways, Rolls Royce and Savoy Hotels. Yesterday, Allied Leisure announced that Davis would become its non-executive chairman - freeing Richard Carr to concentrate on being chief executive. Davis is also a non-executive director of Thomas Cook. While arguably part of the same sector, the Allied Leisure post represents something of a change from the task of persuading foreigners to take their holidays in Britain and the UK tourist industry to improve its offerings. The company's specialities are nightclubs and ten-pin bowling. In 1991-2, the sharp downturn in UK consumer spending forced Allied Leisure's pre-tax profits down 29 per cent to Pounds 2.21m. Its shares, which comfortably outperformed the market in 1990 and 1991, have since languished. Davis had been looking forward to life in the private sector. A former editor of Punch, he was not altogether happy at the BTA, saying he realised he was not cut out for the slow-moving world of the public sector - a view shared by colleagues and by government.</p>

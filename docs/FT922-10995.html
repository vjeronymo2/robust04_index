			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Differences surface at meeting on Ulster THE DIFFERENCES between the aspirations for Northern Ireland of the British and Irish ministers surfaced publicly yesterday - pointing to possible difficulties in the 'round table' talks that are about to start on the political future of the province. Ministers met in London and agreed a three-month gap in the regular Anglo-Irish conferences, allowing cross-party talks to start in Belfast tomorrow. They expressed a 'strong hope' that the talks, which collapsed last July and were revived ahead of the general election, would lead to 'a new beginning' for Northern Ireland in its relations with the UK and Dublin. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, put differing em-phasis on the goals of the talks. Sir Patrick said it had been agreed that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as the majority of those living there wished it. 'Therefore the British government will rise from the (conference) table still holding to that reaffirmation.' He was also realistic in his hopes for the talks - suggesting that he might be content if agreement was reached only on a devolved government. Northern Ireland's population wanted politicians, he said, 'to produce some kind of agreed accommodation that will represent an advance on circumstances which exist in Northern Ireland at the moment'. In contrast, Mr Andrews said Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK was an issue 'that will have to be discussed in the talks'. He pointed out that Unionists wanted to discuss the articles in the Irish constitution that claim the territory of the north. 'If articles two and three of the constitution of our country are up for discussion, is there any reason why other constitutional positions are not up for discussion?' he asked. His comments might heighten Unionist suspicions about the Irish government's motives. Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, accused Dublin of 'a ploy to break down the talks'. His comments are not irreconcilable with Sir Patrick's views. Mr Andrews did not dispute that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement says the province's constitutional position depends on the will of its people. The British and Irish governments announced a Pounds 66.5m upgrading of the Belfast-Dublin railway, a frequent target of terrorist bombings. The European Community will fund 75 per cent of the cost.</p>

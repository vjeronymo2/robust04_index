			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Food sales outstrip other sectors Britain is enjoying a well-fed economic recovery. Yesterday's announcement of a surprise 0.3 per cent fall in retail sales volumes between July and August attracted attention in financial markets. But more detailed, seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed mixed fortunes among different categories of retail outlet. On the basis of three-month figures, which the government considers a better guide to trends, sales by food retailers far outstripped those of other types of retailer and the retail sector as a whole. The Central Statistical Office reported that food retailers increased their sales volumes by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent between June and August compared with the previous three months. Sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail order houses were 0.3 per cent higher and specialist non-food retailers 0.1 per cent lower. Compared with June to August last year volume sales rose 5.4 per cent in the case of food retailers, more than twice the 2.5 per cent year-on-year growth of mixed retail businesses and three times the 1.8 per cent annual sales growth of non-food retailers. Clothing and footwear merchants fared best among the non-food retailers, boosting their volume sales 1.1 per cent in the latest three months compared with March to May and 4.8 per cent compared with June to August last year. Retailers of household goods reported a 0.1 per cent fall in volume sales in the latest three months but growth of 3.4 per cent over the year. The CSO said that other non-food retailers such as jewellers, chemists, tobacconists and booksellers suffered an overall fall of 0.9 per cent in sales volumes in the latest three months and a 1.9 per cent fall compared with June to August last year. The retail sector as a whole expanded its volume sales by 0.6 per cent between June and August compared with March to May and 3.3 per cent compared with the three months to the end of August last year. The Retail Consortium, which says it represents 90 per cent of the retail industry, reported strong year-on-year growth in sales of fresh produce, poultry and fish in August.</p>

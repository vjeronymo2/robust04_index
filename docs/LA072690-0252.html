			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MR. TRANSFER' SAYS HE'S FOUND A HOME IN BERKELEY;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: PERRY KLEIN, COMING OFF A REDSHIRT SEASON, IS READY TO CHALLENGE FOR  CAL QUARTERBACK JOB.  </P> <P> Don't talk about changing schools to Perry Klein these days. He won't hear of  it.  </P> <P> The peripatetic Klein, who earned the nickname "Mr. Transfer" while playing  quarterback for several Southland high schools, claims he has found a permanent  home at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> "I'm there (at Cal) for the duration," Klein said last week from his family's  Malibu home. "There will be no more transferring. I like it there and am very  committed to helping turn the football program around."  </P> <P> Klein is battling for the starting quarterback job, which makes his decision to  return to Cal an easy one.  </P> <P> He was a redshirt as a freshman, and the lack of playing time led him to  thoughts of changing schools. But the arrival of spring ball found Klein  engaged in a battle for starting duties with junior Mike Pawlawski.  </P> <P> With his interest renewed, Mr. Transfer seems content to stay put. At least for  now.  </P> <P> "I know there was a time last year when Perry was feeling a little low," Cal  offensive coordinator Steve Mariucci said. "Then he found a role on the scout  team and he was a new man. Perry came in with high expectations, but he just  had to learn to be patient. There's a lot to learn.  </P> <P> "Believe me, though, Perry has a very bright future here. His picture  eventually will hang alongside all of the other great quarterbacks that have  played here. I have no doubt about that."  </P> <P> Although blessed with much natural talent, Klein has never been a patient  player. His much-publicized prep career led him through a maze of transfers  starting at Santa Monica High, then to Palisades, on to Carson and finally back  to Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Klein led Palisades to the City 3-A Division final his junior year, then helped  guide Carson to the 4-A championship as a senior in 1988. What he did off the  field, however, is what grabbed most of the headlines. The press hounded him  and his parents, Danny and Diana Klein, through most of his senior season,  questioning his transfer habits.  </P> <P> "All of the negative press really never bothered us because we knew what we  were doing," Diana Klein said. "There were some tense moments, of course. One  time a Channel 4 helicopter was flying over our house in Malibu because they  thought we were supposed to be living in Carson. But my husband and I always  just supported what Perry wanted."  </P> <P> Klein attended Palisades as a sophomore and a junior. Since the Dolphins  weren't returning many starters for Klein's senior season, he decided to  transfer to Carson, which annually fields one of the best teams in the City  Section. His parents rented a house in the area, and maintained their Malibu  residence.  </P> <P> The move from Palisades to Carson sparked many hard feelings. Palisades Coach  Jack Epstein said the Klein family abused the transfer rule and made a mockery  of the system. Students and football players at Carson called Klein a rich,  spoiled white kid.  </P> <P> Klein eventually earned a place on the team and made friends. He earned a  scholarship to Cal, making his transfer seem worthwhile.  </P> <P> "I still don't have regrets about what I did," Klein said. "I left Palisades to  make me a better player, and I accomplished that. You have to look out for  yourself in this world. I just wanted to improve my game.  </P> <P> "My only regret is that I didn't stay at Carson."  </P> <P> After his senior football season, Klein transferred to play volleyball at Santa  Monica, where he graduated. When he was chosen as a replacement player for last  summer's Shrine Game, there was a joke about which school Klein would  represent. He chose Carson.  </P> <P> The negative publicity didn't end when Klein graduated. The San Francisco  Chronicle's sports section ran a front-page story on Klein's school-hopping  habits the day he arrived for fall practice at Cal.  </P> <P> "Here I thought I could put that all behind me at Cal, and now everybody on the  team knew who I was and all about my past," Klein said. "A lot of guys were  saying, 'Who is this guy coming in here and stealing the headlines already?'  </P> <P> "Believe me, I don't like being called Mr. Transfer. I find it annoying. A lot  of the people who write about me don't really know the whole story. I guess  since most people haven't seen me play at Cal, they can only write about my  past. I figure once I start playing, they'll forget about my transfers and  write about me as a player."  </P> <P> Saddled with a back injury suffered while playing volleyball over the summer  and sidelined by the incumbency of Troy Taylor, he was redshirted, then played  on the scout team the second half of the season. He impressed the coaches with  his strong arm and quickness.  </P> <P> "No matter what role you give Perry, he goes all out," Mariucci said. "Believe  me, he is no prima donna. Perry is a very confident young man, but he works as  hard or harder than almost anyone else on the team. He expects to be in there  competing for a starting job all of the time, and he'll stop at nothing to get  it."  </P> <P> Klein also was introduced to the weight room. He admitted he never lifted a  weight in high school, which may explain why he was 6-foot-3 and only 170  pounds when he arrived at Cal. He is now 6-3 1/2 and 195 and bench-presses 245  pounds, almost 50 pounds more than a year ago. "I haven't lost any of my speed,  but now I can take those hits a little better," he said.  </P> <P> Klein, though leaving high school with a 3.3 grade-point average, found college  difficult early on. He failed his first midterms in three classes, which added  to his depression over not playing football. He regrouped and finished with a  2.2 GPA, which he improved to 2.4 last semester despite a course load that  included classes in nuclear technology and physics.  </P> <P> "I've learned the importance of academics," Klein said. "I breezed through all  of my classes in high school, but I can't do that here. Getting my degree will  require as much work or more than earning a starting job on the football team.  </P> <P> I know that it's important to have a degree to fall back on since you never  know when your football career will end."  </P> <P> Although home for the summer, Klein hasn't slowed his pace. He is working out  six days a week, following a strict regimen of exercise. He regularly throws  the ball, runs three miles on the beach and lifts weights. He recently began  working out with USC quarterback Todd Marinovich, a close friend. And he's also  enrolled in a math class at Christ College in Irvine.  </P> <P> Klein admits he still has a lot to learn about Cal's offensive system, but  fully expects to be starting in the team's opener Sept. 8 at Wisconsin.  Mariucci said Klein has already beaten out sophomore Mike Beebe and shares the  depth chart's top spot with Pawlawski. Pawlawski played backup to Taylor last  year, but saw limited action and has little varsity experience.  </P> <P> Klein's commitment to earning the starting job has meant a temporary end to a  promising volleyball career. A prep All-American, he had to bypass the  volleyball season this spring to concentrate on football. He said he hopes to  start up again after he establishes his role on the football team.  </P> <P> Cal finished a disappointing 4-7 last year, 2-6 and last place in the Pac-10.  Since Klein prefers playing for winning programs, some may wonder how he will  adjust to the possibility of leading a losing team.  </P> <P> "I knew what I was getting into when I decided to come here," Klein said. "But  building a winner is what excited me most about this place. When people ask me  how it feels to be on a losing team I tell them they don't know what they're  talking about.  </P> <P> "I was part of a rebuilding team at Palisades and that's why I came here. I  like that challenge. I think we'll be very good in a couple of years. It may  not happen until I graduate, but if I can have a hand in the rebuilding process  that will make me happy."  </P></p>

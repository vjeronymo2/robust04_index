			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: SOFIA;  </P> <P> TRUE CONFESSIONS  </P> <P> Todor Zhivkov, the ailing Bulgarian Communist hard-liner awaiting trial for  abuse of power during a 35-year rule that ended last November, is to respond in  Parliament this week to accusations that he brutally repressed opponents and  ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> A parliamentary commission has refused to allow the address to be carried live  on television, ostensibly because of fear Zhivkov will reveal "state secrets."  But the ousted dictator's granddaughter says the new leadership simply fears  they will be implicated in his actions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKEWOOD SEEKS COALITION OF CITIES ON WATER ISSUES  </P> <P> City officials have decided to launch an ambitious effort to give Lakewood and  other Southeast cities more clout with federal, state and local agencies that  have authority over the area's water supplies.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to try to organize a coalition of up  to 20 cities stretching from the Whittier Hills to Long Beach, including  Downey, Bellflower, South Gate, Compton, Paramount, Montebello, Norwalk and  Cerritos.  </P> <P> The coalition is the centerpiece of the city's "water resource management  strategic plan," designed to preserve the quality and supply of its water, 95%  of which comes from wells.  </P> <P> The coalition -- an idea Lakewood must sell to its neighbors in the Los Angeles  County Central Basin -- would represent the cities' interests before the myriad  of public agencies that make decisions about water, such as the federal  Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, and  the Central and West Basin Water Replenishment District.  </P> <P> "This is an issue that relates directly to the quality of life in Southern  California," said James L. Easton, the consultant Lakewood hired last year to  help draw up a plan for safeguarding the city's water.  </P> <P> Lakewood officials already have informally approached a few neighboring cities,  and the response has been positive, said James B. Glancy, the city's director  of water resources. Now that the council has adopted the strategic plan, Glancy  added, the city can formally begin an organizing effort.  </P> <P> In South Gate, the director of public works and engineering, Rollie D. Berry,  said that Lakewood's call for a coalition is an excellent idea. "There's really  no coalition among (the cities) to make their wants and needs heard through a  common voice," Berry said.  </P> <P> South Gate had to close six of its 14 wells because of contamination from  industrial solvents and recently issued $14.7 million worth of bonds to pay for  their cleanup, Berry said.  </P> <P> Lakewood and other cities want to maintain an adequate supply of good water for  their residents, Easton said, but they cannot do that if the supply is  threatened by events that happen along a river bank in Northern California or  in a factory in Monrovia.  </P> <P> "Aquifers don't know city boundaries," said Councilman Marc Titel, referring to  the underground storage areas that move water and toxins miles from their  origins.  </P> <P> It has been determined by state and federal agencies, for example, that ground  water underneath the Central Basin cities is threatened by toxins that were  left in the ground decades ago by industries in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> One of the largest toxic plumes, Easton said in an interview before the City  Council meeting, has collected in the Whittier Narrows at the intersection of  the 605 and 210 freeways, and it will slowly move southward.  </P> <P> "This plume is pointing just like a gun at the Central Basin," said Easton, who  is vice president of Willdan Associates, a statewide engineering and planning  firm. He also is the former executive director of the State Water Resources  Control Board.  </P> <P> The site has been designated for cleanup by the federal government, but that  will cost from $600 million to $800 million, Easton said. The federal  government says it does not have money to pay for the cleanup, but a regional  coalition of cities, he suggested, could begin lobbying federal and state  lawmakers to raise the money.  </P> <P> Lakewood's strategic water plan also calls for lobbying the state and federal  governments to hire more staff in agencies that are responsible for identifying  polluters and prosecuting them.  </P> <P> "Preventing (pollution) is a lot less expensive than cleaning it up," Easton  said.  </P> <P> Another critical element in Lakewood's plan is to encourage the use of  reclaimed water -- sewage water that has been treated and is used for watering  landscaping. Cerritos, Lakewood and several other cities in the Southland  already sell treated water to large users such as school districts and  industrial parks.  </P> <P> The plan also calls for the city to support the construction of the Peripheral  Canal, which would transport water from Northern California rivers to Southern  California.  </P> <P> Lakewood is believed to be the first city in the state to take such an active  stance on water issues, Easton said.  </P> <P> What made the city decide to champion the water issue?  </P> <P> "We asked ourselves the same question," Titel said. "And I guess the answer is  that nobody else is doing it."  </P> <P> Titel, along with Councilman Robert Wagner and City Administrator Howard L.  Chambers, was on the ad hoc committee the City Council set up last year to  study water issues and come up with the strategic plan. The council on Tuesday  converted the ad hoc body to a standing committee.  </P> <P> Lakewood, Titel acknowledged, is a relatively trouble-free community that  prides itself on addressing critical issues before they become big problems.  "Because there aren't a lot of problems, our staff is not fighting fires all  the time. It allows our staff to be creative and think about problems like  this," he said.  </P></p>

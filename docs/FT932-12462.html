			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Inv net asset value boost EDINBURGH Investment Trust, the UK's second largest investment trust, reported net asset value per share of 300.8p at March 31, a record year-end level, against 253.9p a year earlier. Net revenue was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 27.2m (Pounds 24.1m), for earnings per share of 9.25p (8.19p). The figures were helped by the move to increase investment in UK equities, which at the end of the year accounted for 88.6 per cent of funds compared with 62.1 per cent 12 months earlier. They were further boosted by the early payment of dividends following tax changes announced in the 1993 Budget. The final dividend is 5.55p, making a total of 8.4p (8.05p). The managers entered into a loan agreement for Pounds 100m for one year, ending in October 1993.</p>

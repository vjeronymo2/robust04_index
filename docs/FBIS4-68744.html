			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Chubays Will Punish Those </F> Who Have Dodged Privatization"]    [Text] The reversal beginning 1 July of the course of  the privatization policy of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property to the side of the "effective  owner" (previously "the mass stratum of owners" was priority)  will be made difficult if the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property will not be able to guarantee  all the checks shares of state enterprises. The participants in  a two-day meeting of the leaders of regional privatization  organs, organized by the State Committee on the Administrations  of State Property together with the Federal Property Fund, which  concluded yesterday in Moscow, have come to such a conclusion.  It is obvious that the fears of the ideologists of privatization  relative to the prospects of their activity have been aroused by  the fact that until now the strategy of denationalization was  determined exclusively by the political situation.    Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays considers fulfillment of the  task of completing voucher privatization before 1 July 1994 "a  question of the life and death" of his department and its  regional structures. At the meeting of the leaders of  privatization organs he stated that all checks which will  "surface" after the completion of voucher privatization "will be  aimed point-blank at us." These fears are not unfounded.  According to the data of the Fund's chairman, Vladimir Sokolov,  some 48 million more checks "are making their way through the  hands;" moreover, "about 5 percent of them are in secondary  circulation." That is why the work of the privatization organs  will be directed in the immediate future to a sharp increase in  the scale of the exchange of vouchers for the shares of  privatized enterprises as well as to identifying secondary  circulation checks. Otherwise the ideologists of voucher  privatization will be rather vulnerable not only "from the  right" (on the part of the opponents of "handing out state  property dirt-cheap," specifically the mayor of Moscow Yuriy  Luzhkov and the leader of the YABloc Grigoriy Yavlinskiy) and  also "from the left" (on the part of the advocates of  "collective ownership," specifically the communists), since the  social meaning of "people's privatization" will appear to be  under question.    In Chubays' opinion, one of the basic as yet unutilized  reserves in the work of the privatization organs is "the  information-advertising-propaganda component." The vice-premier  intends to rectify this omission by personal example in the very  near future. Within the framework of the "100 days until the end  of check privatization" campaign initiated by the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property, he will  address the inhabitants of the regions through local television  channels and personally explain to them the advantages of  exchanging the checks for the shares of privatized enterprises.    This also will permit Chubays to "make a low-level test-run"  of the basic provisions of the draft of the new state  privatization program, which is directed to the redistribution  of capital (including privatized) in favor of the "rational  owner" (the expression of vice-premier Aleksandr Shokin) and to  enlist "popular support" for subsequent activity. Success would  give Chubays additional trump cards in the struggle to retain  complete control over post-check privatization. For now the  final results of check privatization are unclear. The prospects  for retaining Chubays' department are governed only by the  intellectual potential of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property which has outstripped other  departments in developing a new concept of denationalization.  One has to also take into consideration the policy of the "big  seven," which stimulates the pro-reformer attitudes of Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin. It is obvious that after the endowment of  the head of the Ministry of Economics, Aleksandr Shokin, with  powers regarding coordination of the ideology of the reforms as  well as of negotiations with the West regarding questions not  only of indebtedness but also of loans and investments, not one  of the trump cards will be superfluous for Chubays. Especially  as last week parliamentarians already advanced the idea of  transferring the Federal Property Fund from under the control of  the State Committee on the Administration of State Property to  the Ministry of Economics.    In this situation the State Committee on the Administration  of State Property has basically changed its tactics and intends  to conduct post-check privatization to fit the special features  of the regions and the departments. However, in the State  Committee on the Administration of State Property they will be  unbending with respect to those enterprises which "dodge"  compulsory privatization. In this case the enterprise will be  deprived of all the advantages not only of check (privileges for  the labor collectives) but also of post-check privatization  support (the direction of the funds gained from the sale of  state property to an enterprise's disposal).   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-054-11A>      Potential Opportunities for Attracting Investments in </FIG></p>

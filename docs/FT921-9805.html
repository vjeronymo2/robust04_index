			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Fall in global bank credit reversed THE first-ever fall in the amount of credit provided by the international banking system has been reversed, according to the Bank for International Settlements. However, the latest figures show that renewed growth in net lending by banks has been slow in the face of the slowdown in several big economies. Net new lending in the third quarter of last year rose by Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn), following a fall of Dollars 5bn in the second quarter. But this growth amounted to just 12 per cent of the new lending in the comparable period in 1990. With activity in the international bond markets at about the same level as in the second quarter, the total amount of new finance provided by the global financial system in the three months to last September rose to Dollars 60bn from Dollars 40bn. Equity-linked bonds were the one area of the bond market to experience a sharp decline, thanks to renewed weakness in the Tokyo stock market from late summer. Only Dollars 11.8bn of equity-related bonds were issued, against Dollars 18.6bn in the previous quarter. In the last three months of the year the figure had collapsed to Dollars 4.6bn, BIS said.</p>

This question is the keynote of a debate that has been  going on in Moroccan economic circles since the successful  conclusion of GATT's current Uruguay Round resulted in the  agreement that will be officially signed in Marrakech,  inaugurating an unprecedented new stage of international trade  relations.    Amid the ongoing debate, many warnings have emerged about  negative effects on Morocco's exports and economy from  implementation of the agreement, which aims at reducing trade  barriers; but the official Moroccan agency responsible for  applying the terms of the agreement holds a different view: that  the Moroccan economy is ready for GATT.    Morocco joined the GATT agreement on 17 June 1987, several  years after it began to implement an economic liberalization  policy in 1983 and apply a structural reform program in  coordination with the World Bank and the IMF.    The program involved gradual reduction of customs duties,  which are no longer high, as they were before 1983. Another  effect has been to cancel Schedule C, one of the schedules that  listed imported goods deemed to compete with Moroccan-produced  goods. Until Schedule C was cancelled in 1983 and Schedule A  expanded to represent 78 percent of imported materials,  authorities used to require that an import license be obtained.  They now demand an import license only for 13 percent of  imports, it being understood that the license will ultimately be  repealed, so that the Moroccan market will become open to free  importation.    This change has been accompanied by a gradual reduction in  customs fees. In 1987, these fees were of three kinds: customs  duties, a special fee on importation, and customs revenue stamps.    In January 1988, the 5-percent special fee and the  10-percent  revenue stamp were combined and replaced with a single fee of  12.5 percent, with a few exceptions stipulated in the latest  budget (1994). The law imposed rates of 12.5 percent on  pharmaceutical goods, 10 percent on goods for finishing, and 15  percent on other goods.    The latest budget has set customs duties at 35 percent,  except for some agricultural products to which rates from 40 to  45 percent apply. Government circles consider the reduction to  this level--rates were as high as 400 percent before the reform  program was implemented--a major sign of the economic  liberalization policy and of Morocco's gradual preparation to  enter the stage of implementing the GATT agreement.    To demonstrate that the current changes are no sudden event  for Morocco, these circles note that 90 percent of Morocco's  foreign trade takes place with member nations of the GATT. They  say that, despite allegations in the economic press that GATT  will not safeguard Morocco's economic fabric and that it will  impact Moroccan exports negatively and flood the local market  with imports, the Moroccan authorities have gone through 10  years of reform and economic adaptation. The economy has been  liberalized on the ground that it has achieved a certain level  of development, performance, and competition. When the time came  to approve GATT, Morocco was not required to come down from 400  percent customs protection to 45 percent; the requirements will  be much less. Industry thus will be able to compete.    Since the announcement of a successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round and of a date for the signing of the agreement in  Marrakech, business, media, and semiofficial circles have been  debating the extent to which Morocco will benefit from  implementing the GATT agreement and the extent to which its  terms will affect the local economy.    The positions that have emerged in this debate have proved  to  be personal impressions not based on a practical foundation or  on familiarity with the terms of the agreement or the extent of  the Moroccan economy's compliance with these terms. These  positions have made it clear that their authors have not been  keeping up with the gradual process of customs reductions and  with economic policy goals.    In the face of this situation, the agency addressed  regarding  GATT has come to be the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign  Investments, whereas once there were many addressed. This  ministry has come to be entrusted with the GATT portfolio and  responsibility for giving answers about it to the media and  other bodies.    Here is its view of the issue that AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT raised.  It is followed by the view expressed at a Casablanca meeting on  10 February by exporters' and agriculturalists' associations.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked Driss Taraki, director of the  ministry's Rabat bureau, what effect implementing the GATT  agreement would have on Morocco's domestic economy.    Driss Taraki said that over 90 percent of Morocco's foreign  trade is with GATT members. He added that because Morocco has  joined the agreement, its foreign trade and customs tariff would  become subject to the multilateral agreement's principles and  requirements, especially respect for the most favored nation  principle, national treatment, and not resorting to nontariff  measures to protect national production, such protection being  effected basically through customs duties.    Regarding possible stages of a phased application of the  agreement, what sectors would be affected in the first phase,  and an assessment of these effects, Driss Taraki said that the  answer involved one of the most important focuses of the  multilateral trade negotiations that took place in the Uruguay  Round--market entry. Three sectors were included: industrial  goods, agricultural goods, and textiles.  <H5>  Preferential Treatment </H5>   Tarraki said that the principle of phased application  applies  basically to the agricultural and textile sectors.    He explained that with regard to the farming sector, the  Uruguay Round's second convention stipulated a 36-percent  reduction of total customs tariffs implemented over six years.  However, at the level of domestic support for this sector, the  scheduled reduction would be 20 percent, spread over six years.    Subsidies earmarked for supporting exports would be reduced  by 36 percent, and the quantities supported would be reduced by  21 percent, also over a period of six years.    Tarraki stated that Morocco, as a developing country, would  receive three sorts of preferential treatment:    First, it would be possible to maintain high tariffs on  imports.    Second, the pledged reduction could be implemented over a  period of 10 years, instead of the six years for industrialized  countries. The reduction would be one-third lower than the  obligations of an industrialized country.    Third, Morocco did not pledge to lower support to the  agricultural sector, as this support involved less than 10  percent of agricultural production.  <H5>  Agricultural Products Advantage </H5>   Taraki explained Morocco's competitive strength in the area  of agricultural exports on the basis of high production costs  among Morocco's competitors. This high level is due to the  lowering of support and subsidies to agriculture and farmers by  two-thirds more than Morocco's. This difference between Morocco  and the industrialized countries means that additional  protection is afforded the Moroccan agricultural sector,  increasing the competitive strength of its agricultural exports.    As for the textile trade, it will be incorporated into the  agreement in a three-stage process over a period of 10 years. At  each stage a certain percentage of textile imports will be set,  with a gradual raising of the quotas that the industrialized  countries apply.    Regarding industrial goods, Driss Taraki stated that Morocco  has offered to stabilize customs duties on manufactured products  at a level guaranteeing reasonable and sufficient protection for  its national production.    In return, Morocco will benefit from customs reductions and  the removal of noncustoms restrictions resulting from the  Uruguay Round of negotiations. This will broaden and diversify  the markets for Moroccan exports.    About policies and adaptation measures needed to enable the  local economy to withstand the results of GATT and the resultant  gradual liberalization of the local market, Taraki said:  "Applying the results of GATT requires that one take adaptive  measures to ensure good exploitation of available resources in  this framework and to prepare the various sectors to face  international competition."    He said that Morocco basically is focusing adaptative  measures on strengthening the competitiveness of production. The  government is carefully studying a large number of measures in  this direction, particularly ones related to improving the  environment of companies and exporters and mechanisms to  stimulate exports, diversify competition, lower production  costs, and simplify executive procedures.    On the question of whether the GATT rules will affect trends  of foreign trade among the region's markets and stimulate these  regional markets, Taraki said: "The question can be seen in the  context of recent legal discussions about preferential  agreements and GATT's position on such systems, which could be  considered an exception to the most favored nation principle."    GATT, he said, does not invalidate such preferential  agreements, provided that their provisions conform to those of  GATT, despite some people's belief that GATT would rule out  regional cooperation.    Such agreements, he explained, would have to implement the  terms that GATT gradually introduces into every preferential  agreement, so that they could continue to be applied in  conformity with GATT rules.  <H5>  Six Arab States </H5>   He said that thus far only six Arab states have joined GATT:  Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, Mauritania, and Bahrain. Saudi  Arabia and Jordan have recently applied to join the agreement.    This does not mean there are no bilateral trade agreements  linking the Arab states among themselves--either bilateral  agreements or agreements in which Arab states are party to an  agreement to facilitate and develop trade exchanges concluded  under the Arab League.    Taraki stated that this preferential context has acquired an  incentive coloration allowing for branches of foreign banks and  the principles of openness and publication of budgets and other  things. Summarizing the Moroccan position, Taraki said that the  final treaty of the Uruguay Round embraced the principle of  openness and gradual liberalization of this sector. Morocco, he  said, has instituted reforms of the banking sector. It has  issued a new banking law aimed at flexibility and openness. The  law protects depositors, imposes monitoring of reserves and  assets, and mandates simplified procedures to license foreign  banks to operate in Morocco. The principle of gradually  liberalizing the Moroccan economy over a period of 10 years has  put Morocco in step with the GATT rules.  <H5>  Fears </H5>   As part of the ongoing debate over the effect of  implementing  the agreement on the local economy, we shall summarize the  demands and concerns voiced at a meeting held in Casablanca on  10 February by a group of associations representing Moroccan  exporters of agricultural products.    They expressed fears that a united Europe has designed a  series of measures regulating its relations among its member  nations on the one hand and with other nations on the other hand.    They said that Europe is now working to bring its laws into  conformity with the requirements of liberalized international  trade under the Uruguay agreement. They thought that these  measures would affect Moroccan exports to Europe negatively.  They said that about 220 firms would shut their doors and about  5,000 workers be threatened with unemployment.    They stated that the GATT agreement, of which Morocco is a  member, does not guarantee the preservation of Morocco's  economic fabric. An effort has to be made to shape terms to  strengthen this fabric, so that it can sustain the challenge and  in turn develop the national economy.    The participants issued a communique, saying that they  support government policy in the area of concluding a new  agreement between Morocco and Europe in light of suggestions by  the European Union in the context of the GATT agreement.    At the same time, they demanded that the authorities spare  no  effort to defend agricultural exports and protect the gains  realized in this field in the traditional markets of the  European Union.    They demanded that the coming bilateral agreement between  Morocco and Europe protect the position of Moroccan products in  their traditional European markets. The agreement should help  improve conditions for the entry of Moroccan agricultural  products, which have been suffering for some time from nontariff  barriers that they believe are unjustified--such as the  reference price and the compensatory duty.    From the official position expressed by Driss Taraki and the  position of these associations, it does not appear that the  Moroccan Government will agree to GATT's not guaranteeing  Morocco the preservation of its economic fabric. The government  does not see GATT, as some see it, as a storm that will conquer  everything in its path. Instead, it sees GATT as an agreement  whose terms will be implemented gradually over 10 years, instead  of six years for the industrialized countries. It sees GATT as  protecting its agricultural products when support is lifted from  agricultural products and farmers in the industrialized  countries by two-thirds more than in Morocco.</p>

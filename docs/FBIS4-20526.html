			<p>BFN       [Text] Section D seeks to promote a dynamic and open  external policy. Under this heading are issues like the  management of the Union's external frontier and the completion  of the common commercial policy in the context of the internal  market.    Section E points to an ongoing process of evaluation of the  strategic programme. The annual report on the internal market  is considered as the principal mechanism for this.  <H5>  Standards Upgraded by Strategic Programme </H5>   The strategic programme points to standards as being a key  component in Europe's unified market, vitally important for the  implementation of policy in a wide range of areas.    "European standardization and conformity assessment  instruments are an invaluable tool in the implementation of  other policies, including environment, energy, food quality,  safety at the workplace, and trans-European networks."    The Commission, so as to exploit the potential contribution  of European standardization to the effective functioning of the  internal market, proposes:    -- to undertake a review of the way in which European  standardization could be financed over the medium term. This  will aim to identify ways in which the resources invested by  member states, the Community and the private sector in national  and European standardization can be best harnessed for the  purposes of developing a standardization system which meets the  requirements of European integration.    -- increasing transparency to ensure, for example, that a  wide- ranging public enquiry takes place on the technical merit  of proposals for European standards. The development of  mutually agreed work programmes is another aspect of the overall  approach.    -- standards and research as they ensure the effectiveness  of  European telecommunications. Moreover, the Commission is  beginning to work on the formulation of a Union quality policy  which is due to be finalised by the end of 1994.  <H5>  JRC Future Role Mapped Out </H5>   The Council adopted on 14 January the conclusions on the  role  of the Joint Research Centre (JRC).    This reaffirms the need for the JRC to strengthen its  competitive nature on the basis of a genuine customer/contractor  relationship. Contributing to a Community research policy,  especially in sectors where it has special, if not unique,  skills and in areas where its neutrality is needed for  scientific and technical support for Community policies, is  recognised as important for the JRC.    The Council points to the need to support new ways forward  for the JRC, saying that it should "progressively enter the  competitive arena, generally in networks with other  laboratories, in specific programmes under the framework  programmes to which it can contribute, and for activities  providing scientific and technical support for Community  policies of a kind suitable for that competitive approach. It  emphasizes that funding decisions under the framework research  programmes (1994-1998) should reflect that objective."    It was agreed that the proportion of JRC activities in the  framework programmes to be carried out in the competitive system  should average 24 percent for the EC framework programme and 10  percent for the EAEC [European Atomic Energy Community]  framework programme for the period from 1995 to 1998.    The Council also agreed on a set of guidelines for defining  the JRC's activities, especially regarding its contribution to  the framework research programmes (1994-1998).    It also wants the Commission to submit a progress report on  the implementation of these conclusions to the European  Parliament and the Council in 1996, involving an opinion from  the Board of Governors, allowing the Council to make an  assessment.    The Council also asserts that "the JRC should be a driving  force in improving links between research laboratories and  institutes in all the Community's regions."    The guidelines set out the terms and conditions under which  the JRC will operate up to 1998.    Regarding institutional activities, these will be entirely  funded from the framework programmes. The JRC will also be  involved in institutional RTD [research and technological  development] activities "which contribute to the implementation  of the Union's research policy." This also implies scientific  and technical support in which the Directorates-General will use  the JRC as a service provider.    The Council permits JRC establishments to form networks with  research institutes in any of the member states. They also make  provision for the JRC to engage in competitive activities  outside the framework programmes on behalf of third parties,  including work in the context of member states' RTD programmes.  The JRC will also be able to participate in other Community  activity such as PHARE [Poland-Hungary Actions for Economic  Reconversion], etc.    Regarding budgetary provisions, the JRC will charge  100% of  its costs for its involvement in competitive support activities  in the framework programmes. Within the framework programmes  (1994-1998), the JRC will be provided with an operational budget  of an overall amount of 875 million ECUs (300 million ECUs for  nuclear activities and 575 million ECUs for non-nuclear  activities), which will cover the total funding of its  institutional activities and, in the case of competitive  activities, the costs not covered by shared-cost contracts.    Within the Framework programmes will be two operational  programmes for the JRC, one for nuclear and the other for non-  nuclear activities. Competitive work will begin on 1 January  1995 and proceed in line with the framework programmes  (1994-1998).</p>

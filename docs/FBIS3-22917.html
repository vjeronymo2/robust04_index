Baysa] </F>   [Text] A top military official said yesterday he sees no  direct links between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)  and the Abu Sayaf, a breakaway group of the MNLF.    "There is no sufficient proof to show of a tie-up between  the  Abu Sayaf and the MNLF. On the contrary, the Abu Sayaf is bent  on sabotaging the ongoing peace talks between the MNLF and the  government," Brigadier General Rene S. Dado, AFP [Armed Forces  of the Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) chief, said.    He urged the MNLF to stop giving refuge to Abu Sayaf members  in their camps to express the MNLF disapproval of their acts of  terrorism.    "By doing so, the Abu Sayaf will be completely isolated and  this makes peace-loving and enlightened Muslims happier," Dado  added.    The CRS chief traced the MNLF's generosity to Abu Sayaf  members to old ties among leaders of the two groups.    Dado said the Abu Sayaf has only 120 full-time members, not  1,000 as earlier reported.    He denied reports on the guns smuggled in by the Abu Sayaf  "which could not be confirmed by military units in the area  where the arms landing was supposed to have taken place."    He said the Abu Sayaf has adopted a guerrilla strategy.</p>

As was reported earlier, Alexander Denisov was detained by  Estonia's security police in the city of Johvi due to  unauthorized possession of weapons and staying on Estonia's  territory without appropriate documentation. On Friday leaders  of the organization Russian National Unity appealed to the  Estonian Embassy in Moscow to free Denisov and send him to  Russia. Mari-Ann Rikken pointed out that as the question  concerns a criminal case, the request had been handed over to  the Interior Ministry.    Siigart Holger, deputy general director of the security  police, reported that during the interrogation Denisov, who  formerly lived in Estonia, declared that he fled from Russia  because he was afraid of persecution for participation in the  events of October 3-4 in Moscow. Estonia views Denisov as a  criminal and a trial is now being prepared, said Siigart Holger.</p>

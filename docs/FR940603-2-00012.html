			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed no later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice, interested parties to this proceeding may request a disclosure and/or a hearing. The hearing, if requested, will take place no later than 44 days after publication of this notice. Persons interested in attending the hearing should ascertain with the Department the date and time of the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department will subsequently publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be the rate determined in the final results of review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 59.91 percent, as explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 25, 1993, the CIT in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and Federal-Mogul v. United States, 839 F. Supp. 864 (CIT 1993), determined that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for this order will be 59.91 percent, which was the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation by the Department (55 FR 29244, July 18, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Paul L.

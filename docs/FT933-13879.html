			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Revival of interest in Moroccan investment - Rabat's privatisation programme has underpinned renewed foreign attention MOROCCO's return to the international capital markets earlier this week via a Dollars 25m Euroloan for Omnium North Africain is a clear signal of the revival of investment interest in the country. The deal marks the return, albeit for a modest sum, of Moroccan borrowers to the markets after a 10-year absence following the forced rescheduling of foreign debt in September 1983. The loan for ONA carries no state guarantee. Morocco has caught the attention of foreign institutional investors this year because the price of its outstanding debt has risen from 42 to 65 per cent of its face value. Foreign investment, meanwhile, rose four-fold to Dollars 500m in the five years to 1992 and is expected to increase further in 1993. Today, it represents 21 per cent of all new investment in Morocco and is expected to become an increasingly significant in the years ahead. Morocco's privatisation programme is a key factor encouraging this trend. The programme is now beginning to get into some sort of stride with the acquisition by the Swiss Holderbank group of 51 per cent of Scior, the Moroccan state cement company. This deal is viewed by international bankers and investment funds as a watershed in Morocco's privatisation programme. By the end of 1995, the government plans to sell 112 state companies, worth an estimated Dollars 2bn. A price tag of Dh1.2bn (Dollars 134m) has been put on Scior, so the sales dwarfs that of the CTM international bus company, which was valued at Dh320m and successfully privatised last month. Of the remaining shares, 24 per cent will be sold on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, 10 per cent will go to the regional authorities in Oujda and Fes in north eastern Morocco, where the company's two plants are located, and 30,000 are earmarked for employees. Some 40 per cent of CTM's shares were issued last month and the offer was four times oversubscribed - the shares are currently trading at a 34 per cent premium to issue price. The most interesting feature of that sale was the keen interest shown by Moroccans living abroad, who picked up one-third of the shares on offer. This interest underlines the importance of the Dollars 2.2bn that Moroccan emigres remit home every year and which could prove a significant source of capital for the privatisation programme if the local stock market is developed. A second success story would provide a powerful catalyst for expanding the role of the Casablanca exchange. Only 69 stocks are listed, a handful of which trade every day, usually in tiny quantities. The stock exchange has traditionally been regarded as irrelevant by Moroccan businessmen, who go to their banks or tap private sources of finance, often within their extended family networks. However, privatisation is encouraging the emergence of investment funds like Interfina and Maroc Privatisation. Interfina is owned by three Moroccan banks, the International Finance Corporation and Spain's Banco Exterior. Maroc Privatisation has a majority of French shareholders, which include Societe Marseillaise de Credit, Les Mutuelles du Mans insurance group and Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild. The latter is also present, with Paribas and Royale Marocaine d'Assurances, in Casablanca Finance Group which was set up with a capital of Dh1m. It aims to develop corporate and investment banking and in time emerge as Morocco's first investment bank.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhu Guohong (2612 0948 1347), Fudan University's </F> Population Research Institute: "Population Control Under  Conditions of Market Economy"]    [Excerpt] The transformation from a planned economy to a  market economy and intensification of economic structural  reforms have brought a series of systematic changes in China's  society. These changes affect China's population control in two  respects, one is their influence on the reproductive subjects,  the other their influence on the family planning management  system.    How does a market economy affect population control through  its influence on the reproductive subjects? Establishing a  market economic system involves reforming various current  economic systems ranging from systems of property right,  enterprise and commerce to those of wages, social welfare and  protection and education; all of these are being transformed  from "planned systems" to "market-oriented systems." In the  process of changing to a market system, the family also needs to  adapt to demands of the changing market, i.e. the family is  becoming a production as well as a consumption unit; like the  enterprises, the family unit should also be independent,  responsible for its own profits and losses, and be able to  rationally deploy resources to gain the maximum benefits. In  allocating various resources (including manpower), the family  will focus on input and production, capital as well as analysis  and comparison of returns on capital. Children represent the  family's future manpower resource, so they naturally will be  included in the family's economic calculations. The family needs  to anticipate the children's needs in the changing market  economy, including their numbers and qualities. In the early  stages of the market economy, the manpower requirement for  economic development emphasized mainly quantity, with relatively  low requirement for quality; these circumstances led families to  place a relatively high premium on children in quantitative  terms, creating a conflict between people's desire for  reproduction and the country's need for population control, and  as well increasing the difficulties of population control. In  the economically more backward areas, this was particularly the  case, and there the stronger the demand for manpower in  quantitative terms, the more excess births occurred, which in  turn led to even more stringent population control measures.  This is to say that after a market economic system becomes  established, man no longer considers reproduction as serving the  sole objective of perpetuating the family line, but sees  reproduction mostly as another form of economic behavior to be  considered as part of the family's economic decision-making  process; in that sense, the reproductive subjects play the role  as "economic subjects." When "economic subjects" make a decision  on reproduction, they will consider carefully the child's value  and the cost of raising the child versus his/her projected  benefits; in the early stages of economic development,  particularly when a planned economy is being transformed into a  market economy, this view is detrimental to population control.    A market economy makes the reproductive subjects think more  carefully about the family economy and see child-bearing from  the standpoint of the family's economic future; in the early  period of transformation from one economic system to another,  this tendency can lead to strong demands for more children,  increasing the difficulties toward reaching the population  control goal. This is how the market economy affects population  control through its influence on the reproductive subjects.  Another and even more important aspect is how a market economy  affects population control through its influence on the family  planning management system. To begin with, establishing a market  economic system means that governmental functions need to  undergo basic changes. In a planned economy, government roles  and functions controlled the economy by unifying all aspects of  planning and taking a command role in the national economy, but  under market economic conditions, such government roles and  functions will gradually diminish and disappear; government will  mainly rely on information from the market to indirectly control  and coordinate the market, and government's tactics will also  change from exercise of administrative command to reliance on  economic measures, laws and regulations. The family planning  management system built on the foundation of a planned economy  naturally involved government exercising its role under planned  economic conditions; under market economic conditions, however,  the family planning management system will change, and the  control and coordination functions of management will be  exercised through various economic measures, laws and  regulations. Family planning as a basic policy of China will not  change, but its management system and approaches will change to  accommodate to demands of the market economy.    Moreover, establishing a market economic system implies  changing the organizational system. In a planned economy, the  organizational system consisted of separate sub-systems  operating under an overall system of administrative authorities,  i.e. centralized management going from the Center to the  province-city-prefecture level, then to the counties and  villages. The organization system under market economic  conditions consists of sub-systems of companies, groups and  other organizations in between these two categories, such as  trading centers, accounting firms, etc. including systems of  finance, taxation and statistics. Changes in these sub-systems  will lead to corresponding changes in the family planning  organizational system; that is to say family planning can be one  of the organizational systems in a market economy; and the  former centrally managed family planning system will either  diminish in effectiveness or, after transformation, become more  effective along with other organizational systems. Under  conditions of market economy, we should consider carefully the  question of coordinating family planning work with the work of  other organizational systems.    In addition, the establishment of market economy requires a  series of laws, regulations and policies, and this will mean  revising and changing the current laws and regulations based on  a planned economy, and drafting new ones which will accommodate  and support the market economy. Family planning polices and  regulations are not yet perfected; under conditions of market  economy, we also need to address the question how best to  coordinate and adjust family planning policies and regulations  with those dealing with other aspects of the economy.    Finally, establishing a market economy requires people  changing their thinking and accepting basic principles and  demands of the market of open and fair competition, and freedom  and equality; economic activities will no longer be subject to  government's command control but will obey the market. This will  mean breaking up the pattern of lower-level authorities obeying  the higher-level, which in terms obeys the center; and "red-tag  documents" will diminish in importance. In terms of future  population control, how family planning can be coordinated and  adjusted with the above changes is a serious challenge, and  should be an important agenda item for study.    That the market economy poses a serious and multifaceted  challenge to population control is therefore obvious. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (33): Life uncushioned - Industry's problems BROAD SWATHES of Polish industry are now being squeezed between the hard place of an appreciating currency and the rock of European Community import restrictions, and the collapse of the Comecon market. What is more, privatisation has hardly scratched the surface of Poland's largely obsolete industrial enterprises, and the factors which allowed many to survive bankruptcy are fast running out. There is little question that much industry will either disappear or be radically revamped in the coming months. The most vulnerable are those concerns that relied heavily on the Soviet Union for cheap energy and raw material inputs, and on Soviet and East German markets. At least 200 large factories were dependent on Comecon markets for over 35 per cent of their business. Many in the engineering, electronics and consumer-goods industries - producing goods as diverse as helicopters, light aircraft, grain-dryers, machine tools and industrial plant of various kinds  -have little chance of finding alternative outlets. At the same time, the sharp decline in domestic consumption and investment demand, and increasing competition from imported consumer goods (thanks to virtual abolition of import tariffs and appreciation of the zloty over the last 16 months) have also pushed many large enterprises close to bankruptcy. The Star truck plant, employing 12,000 people, is but one example. This is precisely what the government wants. The harsh truth, told by finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz, is that too many inefficient monopolistic enterprises have been able to keep going by extending inter-factory credits, running down stocks bought at former artificially-cheap prices, shedding labour and taking advantage of the former artificially-low exchange rate to export, even when, as in the Soviet case, the purchaser cannot or will not pay. Most of these cushions no longer exist, and the coming months should see a remorseless weeding out of an industrial structure which, by western standards, is grossly deformed, with too many large, energy-inefficient and labour-intensive industries and too few service, high-technology and consumer industries. A recent study by Professors Jeffrey Sachs and David Lipton showed that the average Polish state-owned industrial enterprise employed 378 people, against 80 in a sample of western economies; while no less than 58 per cent of all such enterprises employed over 1,000 people, against 19 per cent in the west. Nearly 20 per cent of all Polish workers were employed in enterprises employing over 5,000 workers. What this means, in effect, is that many small towns in Poland are virtually company towns, with one or two enterprises acting as the source not only of employment but of all social services, from housing to health and welfare. The social and political consequences of closure are magnified, especially as the severe national housing shortage makes labour mobility difficult. In spite of the difficulties, the present government is adamant that many such enterprises will have to be privatised, restructured or closed, and their assets sold - hopefully, to budding entrepreneurs who can better use of them. If not, it is setting up labour exchanges, job re-training schemes and making the recently introduced unemployment pay system more selective, to concentrate on the worst problem areas. Despite the problems, some Polish enterprises appear to be adapting well to difficult circumstances. The Polar domestic appliances company outside Wroclaw, for example, has found that its former east German competitors are no longer in the market. It raised exports to the west by 30 per cent last year, and intends to keep up the pace, even though at current exchange rates exports are only barely profitable. In Lodz, home of a depressed textile industry, the recently privatised Prochnik enterprise needs 200 extra workers to manufacture garments for the German market, using imported German fabrics. It can't find them, despite an official 60,000 unemployment level in the town. Textile manufacturer RenaKord, a few kilometres away, relies less on cheap labour, and is squeezed by the high price of imported raw materials, EC quotas and US tariffs. Its ancient factories include many recently imported German machines, and it is negotiating with a potential US partner. Up to now, however, Poland has not been very successful in attracting foreign capital for the vital task of industrial re-generation; though the hope is that, with debt re-scheduling agreed and new investment laws and financial institutions, this picture will change. Foreign companies that have taken the plunge and bet on Poland's long-term economic prospects include Asea Brown Boveri, which is modernising the power generating-equipment industry, and Philips, which has taken 51 per cent of Polam, the largest light-bulb company; while Fiat and General Motors have proferred competing plans for large-scale investment in modernising the motor industry. Despite its current difficulties, Poland has a very cheap and relatively well educated workforce, proximity to EC markets and, above all, its own domestic market of nearly 40m hitherto frustrated consumers. It is well placed to absorb the large-scale investment, which is needed not only to bring its industry up to international levels but also to improve the rail, road, telecommunications and other infrastructures.</p>

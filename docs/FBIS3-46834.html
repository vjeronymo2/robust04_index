			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhrinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F> Liberal Democratic Party, by Motohiro Ikeda on 4 January; place  not given]    [Text] Moscow 5 Jan -- Vladimir Zhrinovskiy, leader of the  Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which is an extreme  right wing nationalist party and won big in the recent elections  for Russia's new Federal Assembly, granted an interview to a  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter on 4 January. Regarding the  northern territories, which is a pending issue between Japan and  Russia, he explained his intention to maintain a hard-line  stance, saying that "Russia will never hand over the  territories." On the other hand, he proposed a plan to improve  ties between Japan and Russia through economic and industrial  cooperation, and by mutually allowing people of both countries  to work in both countries. On the new Federal Assembly, which  will start on 11 January, he explained his view that he would  not insist on winning the post of the National Assembly (lower  house) chairmanship, saying that he would deal with the new  Federal Assembly session in a flexible manner. The following  are questions and answers at the interview:    [Ikeda] You were repeatedly making hard-line remarks  regarding the northern territories. Do you still maintain the  same attitude even after the elections?    [Zhrinovskiy] We are not opportunists. We like the Japanese  people. The Kuril islands have been and will continue to be  Russian territory. If Japan wants to jointly develop the  islands, we will welcome it. However, we will never hand over  the territories to Japan. We must not do that. We must not  hand over Karelina to Finland, Kishinev (capital of Moldovia) to  Romania, and Tajikistan to Afghanistan either.    [Ikeda] Are you against the idea of improving ties between  Japan and Russia?    [Zhrinovskiy] We do want to cooperate with Japan by all  means if it wants to have joint economic development with us.  We will buy unlimited number of Mitsubishi, Honda, and Toyota  cars. We can sell airplanes in return. Is it not true that  Japan needs our coal and oil? Moreover, we would like to allow  100,000 Russians to study in Japan and 100,000 Japanese in  Russia.    We will make Japanese language the second mother tongue on  the Kuril islands so that the Japanese people will be able to  freely visit and work there. We should create such an  environment. We want Japan to create an environment in which  Russian people will be able to freely work in Hokkaido. Why do  you have to stick to the territorial issue? If your goal is to  catch fish, then we will catch fish together and eat it together.    [Ikeda] What are you going to demand at the new Federal  Assembly meetings, which will start on 11 January?    [Zhrinovskiy] We won the election. This victory is enough  for me. I will be pleased to accept the post of the lower house  chairman if it is offered to me. However, I will not insist on  it. We are preparing bills, designed to actually improve the  domestic economic situation, for the new assembly session.    [Ikeda] What about the possibility of cooperating with other  parties?    [Zhrinovskiy] Basically, we do not have close ties with  other parties because they are either radical democrats or  leftists. Middle-roaders, like us, should not make compromises  with them. On the contrary, radical political groups, like  them, should make compromises with us. However, we are ready to  cooperate with all forces.    [Ikeda] Some people are talking about relations between the  LDP and the KGB.    [Zhrinovskiy] They are telling complete lies. I was acting  as an interpreter. But, they distorted the story. I am merely  a Russian citizen. They are also saying that my father was a  Jew. It is also lie. Everything they are saying is propaganda  designed to distort what we legitimately won.</p>

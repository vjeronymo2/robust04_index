			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Siebe The reluctance of Siebe's share price to rise with the market after yesterday's full-year results suggests investors are not yet quite convinced that it can deliver strong organic growth in the recovery. That may be a bit grudging after the relatively strong second-half progress in controls which account for three quarters of all sales. Presumably the recession in the European automotive sector which held back the specialist engineering division will not last for ever, while there must be room for fairly rapid margin improvement at the new European acquisitions. Changes in intra-company pricing may have reduced the tax charge, but they make it even harder for outsiders to analyse what is happening to margins. For example, transfer pricing changes may be one reason why margins in North America do not seem fully to reflect recovery there. The best test of Siebe's performance in the current year will thus also be one of the most basic - the extent to which overall sales are driven by organic growth. Despite the second-half improvement, last year's group turnover rose by only 2 per cent before currency changes and acquisitions. Siebe's says it is now more interested in higher market share than margin enhancement. That may say something about the nature of an economic recovery in which prices remain under pressure. Yet Siebe's operating margin which remained high during the recession is already 14.3 per cent. If that cannot be improved much in the recovery, one wonders whether it will again defy gravity when the next downturn hits.</p>

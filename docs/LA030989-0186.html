			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO VOTE ON ASSAULT-WEAPON BAN  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to formerly enact a ban against the sale and  possession of semiautomatic assault rifles tonight, joining almost a dozen  municipalities statewide to enact such laws.  </P> <P> In February, the council unanimously voted to introduce the ordinance. If the  council reaffirms its earlier vote, the ordinance will go into effect in 30  days.  </P> <P> The law, modeled after one adopted in February by Los Angeles, would ban  semiautomatic or carbine rifles, which use detachable ammunition clips of 20  rounds or more.  </P> <P> Violating the ordinance would be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to  $1,000 and a year in jail.  </P></p>

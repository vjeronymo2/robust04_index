Peace Keeping Forces [PKO], may be changed shortly, a  Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday.    The official said the likely refixing has been necessitated  as the function of the U.N. PKO forces there has been reduced  to relief programs only and major Western countries' troops are  set to pull out of the African country shortly.    "In particular, we are discussing with the U.N. Secretariat  and relevant countries on matters related to the security of the  Korean PKO unit since the Italian contingent which has been  supporting the Korean unit in terms of security is to return to  Italy by the end of March," he said.    The official added that despite the planned early withdrawal  of the troops of major Western countries, there is no plan so  far to bring the Korean unit home ahead of schedule.    The Korean engineer unit is supposed to remain in Somalia  through July this year.</p>

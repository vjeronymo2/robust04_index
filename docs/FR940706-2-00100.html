State of Alaska,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Action No. A91&hyph;081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was created to advise the Trustee Council on matters relating to decisions on injury assessment, restoration activities, or other use of natural resources damage recoveries obtained by the governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Trustee Council consists of representatives of the State of Alaska Attorney General; Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game; Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; the Secretary of the Interior; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. Appointment to the Public Advisory Group will be made by the Secretary of the Interior with unanimous approval of the Trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the public at large (5 members) and the following special interests: aquaculture, commercial fishing, commercial tourism, forest products, environmental, conservation, local government, Native landowners, recreation users, sport hunting and fishing, subsistence, and science/academic. Two additional ex officio non-voting members are from the Alaska State House of Representatives and the Alaska State Senate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nominees need to submit the following information to the Trustee Council: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A biographical sketch (education, experience, address, telephone); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Information about the nominee's knowledge of the region, peoples, or principal economic and social activities of the area affected by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill, or expertise in public lands and resource management; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

Any additional relevant information that would assist the Trustee Council in making a recommendation; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A disclosure statement of any potential conflict of interest. Public Advisory Group members and their alternates are chosen to represent a broad range of interests. It is possible that action could be taken by the Public Advisory Group when one or more of the members have a direct personal conflict of interest which would prejudice and call into question the entire public process. To avoid this eventuality and to enable the Trustee Council to choose appropriate individuals as members and/or alternates to members, it is necessary that each nominee provide the following information with their information packet. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, please provide a brief explanation of your answer. A yes will not necessarily preclude any nominee from being appointed to serve on the Public Advisory Group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

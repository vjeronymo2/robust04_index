			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Poland quick on the call Sir, In Andrew Adonis's article on eastern Europe's telecoms ('Call waiting, for the lucky few', August 4) the remarks of the Polish telecommunications minister are cited as an example that 'ideological opposition to privatisation and liberalisation remains strong'. The minister's comments should not have led Mr Adonis to such an erroneous conclusion. All too often western observers expect rapid transformations even in sectors which in the west are still being privatised and liberalised. It should be recalled that AT&amp;T/Bell and BT were broken up and privatised only in the 1980s in countries that are fully fledged market economies. In countries of the European Community, arguments about the permissible extent of breaking down 'natural monopolies' is hardly a dead issue, particularly in Germany. The EC itself does not require de-monopolisation of voice telephony until 1998. With this in mind, Poland's commitment to competition in telecommunications services (the Telecommunications Act of 1990 provides for competition in all services, except international) and ongoing work on liberalising the tariff structure is rather 'fast-paced' compared with the rest of Europe.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolutions of the Sixth National Conference of the Union </F> of Democratic Forces"; place and date not given]    [Text] 1. The only real solution to the deepening  political and economic crisis in the country is to hold early  parliamentary elections.    2. It is impossible in the present parliament to formulate  positive goals for carrying through the reform. The SDS [Union  of Democratic Forces] unequivocally declares that any attempt to  extend the life of the government or to form a new government  within the term of this parliament will lead to irreparable and  disastrous consequences for the country.    3. The SDS links its participation in the work of the  present parliament with the fate of the government. If the  government is retained or altered or a new one formed, the SDS  National Coordinating Council and parliamentary group are to  take immediate actions to provoke early parliamentary elections  -- rallies, marches, demonstrations, a boycott of parliament,  and civil disobedience within the law.    4. When candidates are proposed for seats in the National  Assembly, it is essential to observe the principles of party  political responsibility, eligibility for election, and the  effectiveness of the candidates.    On the basis of the resolutions of the SDS's Fifth National  Conference and the proposals made by the Sixth National  Conference, the National Coordinating Council is to draft, in  collaboration with the local coordinating councils and full SDS  members, mechanisms to ensure that the above principles are  observed in the best possible way and to prevent any new  substitution of the electoral vote.    The following persons may not be proposed in the lists of  SDS  parliamentary candidates, be members of the National  Coordinating Council and municipal councils, or be proposed by  the SDS as mayors and oblast administrators: sons and daughters  of active fighters against fascism and capitalism, of members of  the Politburo or Central Committee of the BCP [Bulgarian  Communist Party], of communist generals and colonels, and of  secretaries of BSP okrug and city committees, or persons who  have applied for membership in the BCP.    5. The following new Paragraph No. 2 is added to Article 1  of the SDS Statute:    The leading political organs of the SDS are the national  conference and the National Coordinating Council, whose  decisions are binding on all SDS structures and institutions.    Sentences two and three in Article 36 of the SDS Statute are  deleted. (Editor's note: "He has the right to postpone the  adoption of decisions by the National Coordinating Council that  have to be implemented by the SDS parliamentary group until they  are discussed by the parliamentary group, until the next meeting  of the National Coordinating Council. In the event of any  differences in views, the decision is adopted following joint  discussion of the issue between the National Coordinating  Council and the SDS parliamentary group.")    6. The aim of the SDS to increase to the maximum its  influence in Bulgarian society and politics remains the leading  trend in its development. The chief criterion governing the  attitude of the SDS to other democratic formations is the idea  of real decommunization of society.</p>

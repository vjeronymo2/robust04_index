			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Polly Peck case shooting arrests Turkish police arrested four men yesterday in connection with the shooting of an executive from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK administrators for Mr Asil Nadir's collapsed Polly Peck conglomerate. Istanbul police held two men suspected of the shooting of Mr David Adams on August 19 in Istanbul, and arrested two more for ordering the shooting. Police caught a 21-year-old youth taking part in another Istanbul shooting on August 25 and tracked down the others after questioning him. Mr Adams, a Briton, is a Coopers management consultant but has no link to the Polly Peck case. Coopers said they believed the real target was Mr Christopher Howell, a partner in the firm and the executive in charge of the Polly Peck case. Mr Howell was beaten up by two Turks on June 7, the night before a Turkish court addressed criminal charges against the Polly Peck administrators resulting from complaints made by Mr Nadir.</p>

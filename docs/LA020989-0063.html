			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NUTRITION, THE EIGHT ESSENTIAL  AMINO ACIDS  </P> <P> The caricature of early man is of a brawny fellow with a huge club, dressed in  animal skins and gnawing on a bone. While it's true that our ancient ancestors  did engage in hunting, we know they were not the carnivores portrayed in  cartoons.  </P> <P> Roots, berries, leaves, nuts, eggs and fruits were staples of their diet. And  such game as they did catch was far leaner than the farm-grown meats we eat  today.  </P> <P> The 20th-Century stereotype of cave men perpetuates the myth that meat is  power. Eating large quantities is linked in many people's minds to surging  growth, bulging muscles and athletic prowess.  </P> <P> To be sure, meat is rich in protein and is a vital nutrient. Carbohydrates,  fats and proteins can all provide us with energy, but only protein has the  capacity to build, repair and maintain the body's tissues, including those in  the kidneys, liver and skin. Proteins are components of enzymes and of certain  hormones, and are needed to make blood cells and infection-fighting antibodies,  as well as for growing hair and nails. Proteins are part of the carpentry that  helps keep the body erect; it is the grout that holds the cells together.  </P> <P> Like other constituents of the body, proteins eventually get used up and must  be replaced. The body constructs its own proteins from those in the foods we  eat. Every animal, vegetable or microbe has special types of proteins, so there  are countless kinds, designed to meet the needs of particular organisms. These  millions of proteins are all formed from only 20 different building blocks --  amino acids -- put together in different ways, just as words are made from the  alphabet or structures from a Lego set.  </P> <P> Our body's task is to take the proteins of other organisms and transform them  into types we can use to repair and maintain our cells. By breaking down the  proteins in foods into their component amino acids, and then reassembling them,  our bodies can manufacture some of the amino acids and from them some of the  proteins. These are called "nonessential" because we do not have to get them  ready-made in foods.  </P> <P> But there are eight amino acids we cannot make from raw materials and that must  be included in our diets. These "essential amino acids" have to be present in  the foods we eat or we will be placed in nutritional jeopardy.  </P> <P> Here's where meat comes in. Animal foods most closely resemble the proteins in  our bodies. They contain all the amino acids in the right proportions, which  makes them "of highest biologic value." A smaller, overall amount of protein of  high biological value will give us the same amount of amino acids (and thus  overall usable protein) as a large amount of a "poor" protein, like those in  plant foods.  </P> <P> Does that mean we should don cave-man clothes and go out hunting for meat?  Absolutely not. While meat certainly provides generous amounts of amino acids,  we don't need to depend exclusively on high-quality proteins (some of which are  laden with fat and/or cholesterol) to meet our amino-acid needs. Habitually, we  eat a variety of foods containing proteins of differing qualities. The daily  Recommended Dietary Allowance is 56 grams (or two ounces) of pure protein for a  man and 46 grams (1.6 ounces) for a non-pregnant, non-nursing woman.  </P> <P> These quotas are not that hard to fill. One cup of milk, for instance, has nine  grams of protein. An ounce of ground beef has seven, an egg has six, and one  tablespoon of peanut butter, four. A woman, then, can get nearly 40% of her  protein requirement from two cups of milk. Add an egg and three ounces of meat,  fish or poultry, and she'll have all the protein she needs for the day.  </P> <P> Many other foods are also good protein sources. A half-cup of oatmeal has three  grams, as does one slice of whole-wheat bread. A cup of spinach has five grams,  a stalk of broccoli six. One medium baked potato has three grams -- and the  quality is impressive too.  </P> <P> A very small amount of protein of high quality that contributes the missing  essential amino acids can be mixed in to upgrade the quality of "poor"  proteins. For instance, cereals are generally low in the amino acid lysine,  whereas milk contains ample amounts. When we pour milk on breakfast cereal, we  create a complete protein.  </P> <P> A meal that supplements rice with beans or combines the two with small portions  of fish, poultry or other meat is an excellent model of this mutual  supplementation of protein.  </P> <P> Simply by virtue of the variety of foods consumed, the typical American diet  provides all the protein -- and thus the essential amino acids -- we require,  and more. So if you eat a varied diet, your protein profile is one thing you  need not worry about.  </P> <P> Don't Depend on Herb Teas as Substitutes for Medical Care  </P> <P> Question: I have a friend who insists that in the interests of my health I  should switch from regular tea and coffee to herb teas. Is this really  necessary?  </P> <P> Answer: From our perspective, a more sensible course might be to use all three  in moderation. While herb teas may convey a sense of the "natural" (though they  are no more so than coffee or tea), the fact is that herbs contain a variety of  compounds that are extracted when the herbs are steeped in hot water. Some of  these compounds are potentially harmful.  </P> <P> Drinking herb teas to avoid the known effects of caffeine may expose  individuals to chemicals about which we know far less. Moreover, herb teas have  not been subjected to animal studies that simulate the effects of drinking tea.  </P> <P> And despite claims of benefit in the popular press, it is never a good idea to  depend on herb teas as substitutes for medical care.  </P> <P> Q: For the most part we eat plain fruit for dessert, but every few weeks I bake  a fruit tart as a special treat. I would prefer to make the crust out of oil  instead of solid shortening, but so far have been unable to find a recipe.  Since I don't have time to experiment on my own, can you help me out?  </P> <P> A: We can. For a simple crust, mix 1 1/3 cups flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup  oil and three tablespoons cold milk. Then mix and roll.  </P> <P> In a study done several years ago, trained panelists found that vegetable oils  produced better flavor and more flakiness than crust made with solid  shortening. No color differences among the crusts were detected, and the only  negative observation was that crusts made with solid shortening shrunk less  than the ones made with vegetable oils.  </P> <P> Q: I have been put on diuretic medication and advised to eat lots of fruits and  vegetables to get extra potassium. Can you provide me with specific information  about how to get good sources into my diet?  </P> <P> A: A large glass of orange juice and a banana sliced over breakfast cereal are  two good ways to build up your potassium intake. But there are many more. Among  the best vegetable sources are winter squash, dandelion and mustard greens, and  cooked kidney beans. Baked potatoes provide generous amounts, and so do sweet  potatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, corn, beets, summer  squash and spinach. In addition to oranges and bananas, fruits that contain the  greatest amounts include cantaloupe, watermelon and grapefruit.  </P> <P> And remember that other fruits and vegetables may not contribute as much, but  they do add to the total. So the advice to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables  of all types really is the key to ensuring that you get your needed potassium,  along with goodly amounts of other vitamins and minerals.  </P></p>

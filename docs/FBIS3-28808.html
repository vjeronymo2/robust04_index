They pointed out that while the GATT talks are  deadlocked, a new forum called World Trade Organization has been  established.    This was disclosed by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas after the  second-day session of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign  ministers in Jakarta today. Alatas noted that there has hardly  been any cooperation among the G-77 member countries during the  seven-year-old Uruguay Round talks. As for the next chairman of  the Nonaligned Movement, Alatas said Nicaragua had officially  submitted its candidacy, but this country needs time to consult  with Latin American countries.</p>

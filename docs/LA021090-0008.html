			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETIMES WE HAVE SILLY TAXES  </P> <P> Here is the picture in all of its Norman Rockwell glow: the sidewalk hot-dog  stand, the earnest scrawl of the sign announcing a sale for the benefit of  buying new school playground equipment. And there, standing next to the  cowlicked, freckle-faced boy selling hot dogs, is the tax man, scooping up his  percentage of the change. What's wrong with this picture?  </P> <P> What's wrong is that this picture bears a remarkable likeness to what really  happens under a foolish California tax law. The State Board of Equalization  ruled recently that school organizations that sell food products as a means of  raising money must pay sales tax. The ruling comes during a time when dwindling  public resources have forced many extracurricular school activities,  particularly athletics, to rely increasingly on fund-raising.  </P> <P> Monterey High in Monterey found itself in that position, with an athletic  department budget that had dwindled from $12,000 in the late 1970s to less than  $5,000 last year. But when the wrestling coach and team sold batches of fried  calamari at the Monterey County Fair to augment the sports budget, they got  slapped with a $1,000 tax bill.  </P> <P> The automatic exemptions once enjoyed by school organizations were lost in the  mid-1980s when the Legislature named many specific organizations, such as the  Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and 4-H Clubs, as exempt. Other school organizations  unknowingly lost their exemptions.  </P> <P> The Board of Equalization plans another hearing next month on the Monterey High  case. In the meantime, Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley) is preparing  needed legislation to clarify the muddled law. Current law could make a school  organization's sales-tax status depend on whether the food sold was hot or  cold, or whether it was sold at a county fair or a playground.  </P> <P> School organizations trying to raise money for civic or charitable endeavors  shouldn't have to split hairs -- or hot dog buns -- over taxes.  </P></p>

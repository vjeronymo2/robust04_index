			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LINKLETTER REDEFINES OLD AGE  </P> <P> Remember those kids who used to tell Art Linkletter the darndest things on TV?  Well, they're older now, but Linkletter says he's still a kid at heart.  </P> <P> When he isn't pitching recliners on television, Linkletter likes to ski, surf  and scuba-dive -- in short, all those fun things that other young guys do.  </P> <P> "There is no definition for old except attitude and mobility," the 78-year-old  Linkletter said. "Attitude tells whether you are old or not. If you are  curious, challenging, doing something, you are not old."  </P> <P> Not that Linkletter denies that he may be getting old.  </P> <P> "I've never had a mid-life crisis, but 80 is daunting," he said. "This is the  only birthday I've looked at with some suspicion. Eighty sounds pretty damn  old."  </P> <P> But it could be that when 80 arrives, Linkletter will be too busy to notice.  </P> <P> The author of 23 books and the star of two of the most beloved shows in  television history, "House Party" and "People Are Funny," is involved in a new  project, making a home video called "How to Be a Great Grandparent."  </P></p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Big energy users seek nuclear cap LARGE ELECTRICITY consumers will today ask Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, to cut their bills by capping the subsidy they pay to the nuclear industry. A group of large customers, including Blue Circle Cement and United Engineering Steel, has already threatened to stop paying the subsidy, which represents 11 per cent of their electricity bills, in April. According to the Major Energy Users Council, some large customers may also refuse to pay the increase in the energy charge, which represents the bulk of their electricity bill. The council is meeting Mr Wakeham in the first of a series of talks intended to resolve the row over the increase in large consumers' bills since the electricity industry was privatised in 1990. Council representatives said yesterday that capping the subsidy was one way of getting bills down to the level enjoyed by their European competitors. Another option was to cut the charges levied by the National Grid Company. The large users indicated that refusing to pay the nuclear levy was primarily a tactic to show they believed that the government, which collects the levy, was to blame for their high bills, rather than the electricity generators. One council representative said the government's decision to create only two electricity generators in England and Wales - National Power and PowerGen - with too much market share, had left large users unable to negotiate competitive prices. 'We all know competition will emerge but the transition needs to be smoothed, and that is the government's responsibility,' he said. Several council members also accused Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, of failing to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because a referral would be damaging to the government in the approach to the election. Mr Peter Rost, council chairman, said Prof Littlechild had suggested alternative ways of helping the large users, including capping the nuclear levy. But the council members said the group was disturbed that the price at which Nuclear Electric was offering power - about 2.6p a unit - was being used by National Power and PowerGen as a benchmark to determine the price at which they would sell electricity to large users.</p>

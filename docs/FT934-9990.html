			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Forward to Tory basics AS BRITISH cabinet ministers prepare for a new session of parliament, they have before them a document from their party leader which urges the virtues of common sense and 'basic' Conservative values. It is described variously as an aide-memoire and an interim manifesto. Mr John Major's tract is in some respects an understandable reaction to the difficulties of governing with a small majority at a time of continuing economic uncertainty. Last week's fevered trimming on rail privatisation, along with revisionism on issues such as police reform, has again put the government in an unflattering light. The prime minister, however, will make a serious mistake if he tries to set his party's compass with reference to the past. Only some of his current difficulties derive from his slender parliamentary majority; others are caused by a lack of belief among ministers over what they are trying to achieve. Nowhere is this more evident than in policies to privatise services and cut the size of the public sector, a field which gave the Thatcher administration of the 1980s much of its cutting edge. Slimming the public sector has not been abandoned as a policy objective but it is being pursued without strategy or vigour. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, has doggedly pressed ahead with rail privatisation but done little to articulate the benefits that will flow from it. The result is that the public fears that privatisation will lead to fare increases and service cuts. Similarly, Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, has failed to inject dynamism into his programme of contracting out civil service work. Last week he revealed a big shortfall in targeted savings. Contractors have accused the civil service of dragging its feet. There have also been cases of the government recoiling from controversial privatisations, notably that of the Post Office. Defensive It is important that this defensive approach is not carried through into the next session of parliament. Decisions will soon be needed on whether to privatise nuclear power, London's buses and the Forestry Commission. There is also unfinished work on gas privatisation. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, must decide whether to break up British Gas. Similarly, work remains to be done on the government's initiative of attracting private capital for public infrastructure projects. Currently, it is moving at a snail's pace. A more radical approach to the civil service is also needed. As well as market-testing Whitehall functions, full privatisation should be more widely explored. Determination If ministers are to get their privatisation initiative back on track, they will need to display four qualities that have been conspicuously lacking in past months. First, determination will be needed to override the forces in favour of maintaining the status quo. There will always be interest groups with well-honed arguments for why things cannot be changed. While these cannot be dismissed, ministers must cut through the special pleading and isolate any genuine public interests that need to be protected. Second, imagination will be needed in refining the details of policy where genuine public interests are at stake. The gas industry is a good example. Ways must be found to combine the benefits of competition while ensuring that the subsequent erosion of cross-subsidies does not lead to higher bills for the poorest customers. Third, pragmatism is required if entrepreneurs are to invest in privatised rail services, contracting-out opportunities or public infrastructure projects. Government inflexibility in defining opportunities has been highlighted as a principal reason why private-sector interest is waning. Finally, better presentation will be needed to convince a doubting public of the virtues, in terms of efficiency and choice, of more competition and a reduced role for the state. It will not be good enough to state blind faith in the power of competitive markets. Ministers will need to articulate practical benefits. All this requires a lead from the top. The perils of governing with a small majority are bad enough. Mr Major should remember that the perils of governing without direction are even worse.</p>

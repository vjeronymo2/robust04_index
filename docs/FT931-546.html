'My instruction to the army to stay out of politics reached every soldier,' he told Italian television in an interview. However, he drew an angry reaction from Nato allies - including the US, Britain, Canada and Norway - when he told the meeting that a decision to suspend troop withdrawals from the Baltic states was still in force.

Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there was understanding for Russia's problems over what he called a 'temporary suspension' and that some countries - including the Baltics - had offered help with housing.

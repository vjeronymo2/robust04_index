"We are faced with a painful episode," Fabbri said, adding:  "The fact remains that the international community and the  United Nations want to make credible and coherent their  willingness to guarantee global order and security, they cannot  avoid the use of force with the aim of peace-making and  providing humanitarian aid."    This, Fabbri said, is "the only way" the UN can maintain the  authority and prestige necessary to keep the growing number of  crisis areas around the world under control.</p>

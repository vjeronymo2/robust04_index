			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marine terminal and carrier exempt agreements are processed administratively without direct Commission review under the 1916 Act and the 1984 Act. The proposed fee for processing such agreements is derived as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,s50,9 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Dollars <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Direct Labor Cost  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $60.23 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indirect Cost  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59.93 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fully Distributed Cost  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 120.16 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Fee  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 120.00  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Tariff and ET Filing Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 8 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1707, requires common carriers and conferences of such common carriers to file with the Commission and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing all rates, charges, classifications, tariff rules and practices for transportation between U.S. and foreign ports and between points on any through route that is established. Section 8 also requires service contracts and their ETs are to be filed by the 1984 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2 of the 1933 Act, 46 U.S.C. 844, requires that every domestic offshore carrier file with the Commission, and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing its rates, fares and charges for or in connection with transportation between all points on its own route, and all points on any through route established in conjunction with other carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under court precedent interpreting the IOAA and OMB Circular A&hyph;25, tariff and ET filings with the Commission appear to be an activity for which fees should be imposed. Moreover, OMB has urged the Commission to establish fees in this area through its passback to the Commission's FY 1995 budget submission for FY 1996. The Federal Communication Commission's (``FCC'') imposition of fees for processing carrier tariffs has been upheld,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Electronics Industries Ass'n v. FCC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 554 F.2d 1109, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1976), as has the ICC's imposition of fees for processing tariffs,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 777 F.2d at 730&hyph;736. The courts in these cases noted that tariff processing benefits tariff filers in helping to maintain rate stability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the shipping public derives benefits from having tariffs filed at the Commission, the courts have concluded that the words ``special benefits'' as used in OMB Circular A&hyph;25 mean that there need only be a special private benefit to an identifiable beneficiary,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FPC v. New England Power Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 415 U.S. at 349&hyph;51, regardless of incidental public benefits,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Cable Television <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 554 F.2d at 1114&hyph;5;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 777 F.2d at 731&hyph;32, and have concluded that ``[i]f the asserted public benefits are the necessary consequence of the agency's provision of the relevant private benefits, then the public benefits are not independent, and the agency would therefore not need to allocate any costs to the public.''  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> &blank;&blank;&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 777 F.2d at 732. Finding that a ``principal function'' of tariff filing is the establishment of rate stability, the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> found the benefit to the shippers and other carriers as ``incidental'' to the ``independent'' rate stability benefit and sufficient to justify the full cost imposition of tariff processing on tariff filers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 777 F.2d at 733&hyph;36. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission precedent and the legislative history of the 1984 Act indicate that ``rate stability'' is one of the purposes of requiring carrier tariffs to be filed at the FMC.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Section 19 Investigation, 1935 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1 U.S.S.B.B. 470, 498&hyph;500 (1935); H.R. Rept. No. 53, Part 1, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 18&hyph;19 (1983). Thus, under the rationale of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Central &amp; Southern <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the collection of the full costs of processing tariff filings at the FMC appears justified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because we recognize that there exists a public benefit from tariff filing in addition to that derived by tariff filers, the Commission invites the industry to comment on to what extent the public benefit of tariff filing is ``independent'' or ``incidental'' to that of tariff filers, and, if ``independent,'' to comment on what proportion of the costs to tariff-filing carriers should be pro-rated to reflect any specific benefit to the general public. Below are the methodologies employed to calculate the cost of tariff and ET filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Developing cost data for assessing a user fee for tariff filing presented unique problems. Unlike other fees, there is no data regarding costs for filing in the Commission's Automated Tariff Filing and Information System (``ATFI''). Because ATFI is a relatively new system, the Commission has had limited experience in estimating the cost of processing each ATFI filing type, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  but has nevertheless distinguished organizational records and ETs as unique elements within the tariff filing system. The Commission creates organizational records for its own administrative purposes, and that cost is included as part of the registration fee under ATFI. See Docket No. 94&hyph;14,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Update of Existing Filing and Service Fees <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , for a discussion on registration fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ATFI system is capable of identifying eight filing ``objects''; organizational record, tariff record, location group, inland rate table, rule, commodity description, tariff line item (``TLI''), and essential term (this last object consists primarily of test). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cost of processing ETs was determined based on a survey of the amount of time the FMC spends reviewing ETs at a point in time. The Commission was able to distinguish ETs from other tariff filings because the amount of time required to process ETs remains relatively constant over time. In contrast, the amount of time devoted to the processing of other tariff filing types tends to vary substantially from individual item to item. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission was able to estimate the total amount of time its staff spends, on average, reviewing tariff filings during a given year: approximately 42,000 hours. This figure was derived by surveying and summing the amount of time the FMC spends reviewing individual tariff filing elements at a point in time, and projecting that amount over a year. Although the total amount of time spent reviewing tariff filing remains relatively stable over time, the amount of time spent reviewing individual elements varies on a daily basis. As a result, it was determined not to estimate the cost of processing tariff filing on an element by element basis, but rather to calculate the cost of tariff filing review based on the more reliable total number of hours spent reviewing tariff filings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

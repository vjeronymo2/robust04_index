			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed MPN/RAY: "`Ultimatum: NATO Will Not Accept </F> Any Compromise,' Says Claes;" as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 10 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister  Claes said Thursday [10 February] that, as announced, NATO will  attack Serbian military positions in Bosnia as soon as the  10-day ultimatum expires if Serbia does not withdraw its  artillery 20 km from Sarajevo.    In an interview with RTL-TVI [Luxembourg Radio and  Television] Television, Mr. Claes added that even partial  withdrawal of the artillery less than 20 km will not weaken NATO  determination to launch air strikes against Serbian positions.    Mr. Claes said that "any change of decision was out of  question."    "This time, they will have to withdraw beyond 20 km or NATO  will implement its plan," Claes added.    "I am convinced that this firm attitude has to be  maintained... this time the Serbs will have to withdraw, so I do  not rule out the possibility of reinforcing the ground troops. I  still believe, however, that like good old Communists, they only  understand harsh language and that military actions will not be  necessary," Mr. Claes said.    Furthermore, Mr. Claes said he totally agreed with the  statement that NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner made on  Wednesday when he called the NATO decision a "historic moment."    "This shows that the Americans and the Europeans are once  more on the same wavelength...this shows that even the Berlin  Wall has fallen, NATO still has an important role to play in the  future," concluded Mr. Claes.</p>

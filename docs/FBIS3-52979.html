Security forces arrested 14 suspected Muslim fundamentalists  in southern Egypt on Sunday charged with involvement in recent  attacks on policemen in Asyut, 380 kilometres (236 miles) south  of Cairo, the AL-AHRAM daily said in its Monday edition.    The detainees included Hamadah Nassar, who heads the  outlawed  al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in Abnub in Asyut province, as well as a  key member of the group's military wing, 'Adil 'Abd-al-Ghani  'Abd-al-Rahim, the official paper said, citing police.    Meanwhile in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria  security forces arrested an Islamic militant as he was preparing  to set fire to a cinema, police said.    Mu'tamid Mahrus was arrested on Sunday after an employee of  the Laila cinema saw him placing a bag under his seat, which was  found to contain three bottles filled with inflammable liquid.    Mahrus, a grocer and known Islamic militant, later admitted  planning to set fire to the cinema during a performance, police  said. [passage omitted]</p>

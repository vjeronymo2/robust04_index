			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Overhaul at SE Banken to split operations into three SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, is splitting its operations into three parts as part of an extensive overhaul of activities. A special division will be set up to house the bank's non-performing loans, following a model adopted by other loss-making Swedish banks. Another division will cover private individuals and small/medium-sized businesses and the third division will be for large companies. Senior management changes and a streamlining of the group's regional structure are also being implemented. A new credit organisation will also be built up. SE Banken said the reorganisation would mean fewer division levels, stronger customer orientation and strengthened credit organisation. Its move follows the contact between the bank and the government about possible state support, which was announced last month. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, group chief executive, said: 'Together with our discussions with the Ministry of Finance concerning the forms of our possible use of government support, the changes we are now introducing are an important step towards reaching the overall goal of emerging from the present crisis as a strong bank, with the best possible chances of regaining profitability and instilling confidence.' He stressed that the group would remain unified, dismissing rumours that it would be split into two separate banks. In the first eight months of 1992 the bank recorded a SKr2.61bn (Dollars 361m) operating loss, with non-performing loans amounting to SKr11.9bn. SE Banken said all non-performing loans above a certain size would be put into the special division, as would pledges, in the form of property and shares, which the bank has taken over. The bank's property company, Diligentia, will be part of this division, which will be chaired by Mr Arne Ogren. Activities in the bank's Sweden division, which will focus on the private market and small/medium-sized companies, will be divided into six regions from the present 10. This division will be headed by Mr Lars Gustafsson, currently head of Treasury operations. It will include some Swedish subsidiaries, trust and securities business and credit and charge card operations. The corporate finance division, which will be headed by Mr Anders Hedenstrom, will cover corporate finance and will lead to increased co-operation between Enskilda and the other functions of SEB International. 'A very effective and highly competent organisation is created in this way, ready to serve large client companies in Sweden and the Nordic countries in competition with international banks,' the bank said. One casualty of the changes will be Mr Rutger Barnekow, who will be leaving his position as group deputy chief executive. SE Banken's announcement contained no word on job cuts, branch closures and disposals which many analysts had expected. Saab Automobile said yesterday it was in the process of selling its car dealership chain, Saab-Ana, in a move which partly reflects the new sales strategy the group has adopted since it became half owned by General Motors of the US. Saab said it no longer needed its own Swedish sales network because most of its dealerships had been amalgamated with those of Opel, part of GM.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Economics: Markets seek evidence of US recovery A RUSH of statistical and survey data this week should enable economists and investors to reappraise the state of the US recovery and establish whether the Wall Street's recent strength is anchored in fundamentals. Markets will be on tenterhooks for Friday's key employment data for August although economists warn that the important non-farm payrolls figure may be inflated by temporary summer hiring. Tomorrow's National Association of Purchasing Managers' survey is expected to point to only moderate output growth as manufacturers approach the autumn, while a slight softening is forecast in today's consumer confidence index. In Europe, attention will focus on France's unemployment report and whether the expected poor outturn will prompt the government of Mr Edouard Balladur to exploit the increased room for manoeuvre in the European Monetary System and ease French monetary conditions. A quiet week is expected in the UK with one bullish indicator: the M0 narrow money figures on Friday are expected to keep growing faster than the government's 0 to 4 per cent monitoring range. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, the financial information company.

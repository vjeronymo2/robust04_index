			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sigute Armonaite: "There May Be No Moratorium"] </F>   [Excerpts] Yesterday, the Nationalists' Union held a press  conference in the Seimas [parliament] building. Journalists  were addressed by Seimas deputy Leonas Milcius and Landowners'  Union Chairman Aloyzas Liaugaudas. [passage omitted]    L. Milcius reminded everyone that the Nationalists' faction  in the Seimas supported the Social Democrats' proposal to  express no-confidence in the government headed by A.  Slezevicius. In his opinion, the government will probably not  be removed, because this initiative might lack votes in the  legislature. However, the discussion on economic issues in the  country might be useful both to the government and the Seimas.    A. Liaugaudas commented on land laws adopted by the Seimas  and claimed that most of them were unjust, because the  suspension of land restoration to real owners was becoming the  second act of land nationalization. He commented on the  statement by the Nationalists, farmers, and landowners on the  moratorium on private land plots [reference to two to three  hectare plots that are being privatized], which was read in the  Seimas last Thursday [7 April].    According to L. Milcius, he was surprised by the reaction of  the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction to this statement.  Some members of the majority faction said that such a text was  insulting to them.    The essence of the moratorium is a protest against the  government's decision to allow the sale of the land of "green  areas" to its current users. This land should primarily be  returned to its true owners.    Both speakers expressed their delight in President A.  Brazauskas' decision to return the land law to the Seimas for  upgrading and correcting its most controversial clause --  Article 21. If the legislature reviews this law and makes some  amendments, the moratorium declared by the three unions may lose  its importance.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Crossroads Oil and Melrose agreement CROSSROADS OIL Group and Melrose Group have entered into an agreement under which Melrose is to invest Pounds 1m and could eventually own up to 47.5 per cent of Crossroads' enlarged capital. Melrose is to subscribe for 5m new shares at 20p each in USM-quoted Crossroads, which in turn is to acquire, in two phases, an interest in joint ventures with Melrose, satisfied in Crossroads shares. The proposals will be put to shareholders at an EGM on July 9. Mr Robert Adair, chairman of Melrose, is to join the Crossroads board as an executive director and Mr Simon Pendock of Crossroads will hold a similar post at Melrose. The London offices of the two companies are to be merged, aiding the Crossroads programme to cut overheads. The subscription proceeds will help accelerate Crossroads' US onshore development drilling programme. For the six months to September 30 Crossroads incurred an unchanged operating loss of Pounds 80,112. The after-tax loss emerged at Pounds 106,903. Profits of Pounds 267,368 last time included exceptional revenue of Pounds 377,142. Crossroads' joint venture investment is calculated on an earn-out basis, under which its stake will be between 20 and 40 per cent, and which could involve the issue of up to 33.9m shares. Crossroads is involved in the onshore development of oil and gas in Louisiana and Texas.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Software sifts factual overload A computer company will today launch a product that would have been the answer to a schoolchild's prayer in the days when grammar was taught seriously - software that can parse an English sentence. Oracle, the US software company, has developed ConText, which it claims can deal with the growing information overload by analysing the content and meaning of the English text it reads. Oracle points out that by 1982, scientific and corporate technical information was doubling every five years. By 1992 this figure was 1.6 years, and between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the information is stored in unstructured text format. The software has a 600,000 word dictionary and up to 1,000 pieces of linguistic data available on each word, Oracle said. It can identify the strongest overall themes in a document and automatically produce summaries. Mr Jerry Held of Oracle said: 'Think of ConText as an electronic assistant able to automatically wade through mountains of textual data, ranging from electronic mail and the daily newspaper to voluminous legal contracts or an electronic version of the Library of Congress, and return information specifically tuned to your needs.' ConText could also become an electronic copytaster - sniffing out stories of interest to a news organisation.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Bogdanov's Julius Caesar - Theatre The English Shakespeare Company is in the midst of what may be its last tour in its present form. Since it was founded under Michael Bogdanov in 1986, it has provided a mixture of the inspired, the perverse and the indifferent. Its Julius Caesar, currently playing at the Shaw Theatre in London, contains the same mixture, though perhaps with less emphasis on the inspired. The women are outstanding: Mandana Jones as Calpurnia, wife of Caesar, and Caroline Harris as Portia, wife of Brutus. They almost succeed in showing that if they had been in charge, the tragedy would never have happened. In the scene where Portia speaks of giving herself a voluntary wound in the thigh to show her constancy, Ms Harris savagely stabs herself in the upper leg. There is also new meaning in Caesar's line: 'Let me have men about me that are fat.' This Caesar, played by David Sterne, is a paunchy figure, certainly not obese, but well-made. Dressed in a camel coat, no tie and a long white evening scarf, he looks a jolly enough fellow, perhaps presiding over a rugby club rather imperial Rome. Terry McGinity's Cassius is very impressive, a genuinely worried man, possibly rightly convinced that Caesar must go. And it is here, as in several other recent productions of the play, that one notices a change in sympathies. Tradition had it that Brutus was the noblest Roman of them all. Cassius was a conspirator with not much to be said for him. Mark Antony was a chancer who emerged as the hero. Modern taste has begun to lean more towards Cassius as the most interesting figure. Certainly in this ESC production, directed by Tim Carroll, Brutus is a very dull man by contrast. Played by Burt Caesar, he seems neither the brightest or the noblest. Alex Hardy's Antony is more of a pop star. When he incites the crowd at Caesar's funeral, he employs deliberate hysteria from the start. There is no gradual build-up. And when he makes his final comment on Caesar at the end of the play, it is almost flip. He tosses off the lines about nature standing up to all the world and saying 'This was a man' as if they had only just occurred to him and will be as quickly forgotten. The production is done effortlessly in modern dress. More puzzling is why the set, designed by Rae Smith, seems to be vaguely South African. It adds nothing to the play, but nor does it particularly detract. The ESC is sponsored by IBM. Next week at the same theatre Bogdanov will present his version of the Faust legend, designed especially for children. Shaw Theatre, NW1. (071) 388 1394</p>

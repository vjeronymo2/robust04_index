			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> O.C. GETS SECOND MALATHION SPRAYING; MORE BEING PLANNED  </P> <P> With the second malathion spraying in Orange County history successfully behind  them, county agricultural officials today were awaiting word from the state on  a schedule for future sprayings in its northern areas.  </P> <P> At about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, three specially equipped helicopters finished  spraying hundreds of gallons of pesticide mix over about a 9-square-mile area  of Orange County that included parts of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials now plan to spray there as many as a dozen times to try  to halt the spread of the crop-destroying pest. The spraying was prompted by  the discovery of a pregnant Mediterranean fruit fly Nov. 17 in a trap set in a  Brea guava tree.  </P> <P> The northern area likely will be sprayed once every three weeks during the next  few months, with spraying coming more frequently as the weather warms in the  spring. A schedule for spraying around the Southland could come from the state  this week, local officials say.  </P> <P> Some residents have questioned assertions by agricultural officials that the  malathion mix poses no health risk. But most elected officials in the affected  area have voiced support for the multi-spraying approach and, unlike Los  Angeles County, no formal opposition has developed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER DOLPHINS  </P> <P> My comments concern the Dec. 6 column of Al Martinez, "Lo, the Endangered  Company."  </P> <P> Apparently, Martinez writes for a satirical effect.  </P> <P> But his obvious lack of understanding of the problem connected with drift nets  is reckless journalism.  </P> <P> What StarKist and Chicken of the Sea have promised not to do is purchase tuna  captured in a particular type of net, purse seine fish nets. This type of net  is used to capture yellowtail tuna, which are attracted to dolphins. Fishermen  seek schools of dolphins knowing yellowtail are present as well, drop a net  that completely surrounds the school of dolphins and yellowtail and then pull  them all on board. The effects on the dolphin and other marine mammals is  fatal.  </P> <P> Although I am not personally a member of any environmental group, I would  certainly advocate for there to be a solid scientific foundation for any  environmentalist claims. Martinez, on the other hand, had the opportunity to  "research" this topic more thoroughly than a call to Bumble Bee.  </P> <P> By not weeding the chaff from the seeds in environmental claims, Martinez takes  an Archie Bunker armchair approach. Very disappointing for a man in your  position, Martinez.  </P> <P> JOHN SHAFFERY  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Banks trail French on costs BRITISH BANKS are the second most efficient in western Europe after the French in terms of their ratio of costs to income, an analysis of human resources in banking says. This is because the cost of employing staff outside Britain is on average 2 1/2 times higher. The study by the financial services analysis company Lafferty Group finds that ratio of cost to income per employee in 1990 was 25.3 per cent in Britain against 22.2 per cent in France. The highest ratio was 41.7 per cent in Switzer-land and 40.1 per cent in Italy. The figures are based on data from 400 of the 500 largest banks in 25 European countries. They provide a benchmark for the year when most European banks were about to embark on cost-reduction programmes to improve staff efficiency after widespread expansion in the late 1980s. However, they also disclose wide differentials in the ratios of income, assets and profits to employees in different countries. Many banks have had trouble controlling overseas operations and several British banks are this week expected to report high bad debts on French subsidiaries. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society achieved one of the lowest ratio of costs to income per employee in Europe at 14 per cent, being beaten only by Ippa Bank in Belgium with 11 per cent. The National Bank of Greece had the highest reported ratio at 70 per cent. German banks were the most efficient in terms of the size of balance sheets compared with number of employees. The average German bank held Ecu10.3m (Pounds 7.77m) in loans per employee, compared with Ecu6.24m in Switzerland and Ecu2.84m in Britain. British banks and building societies had the highest proportion of part-time employees, with Newcastle Building Society having 36.8 per cent part-time workers compared with an average of 10 per cent among European bank employees. All but 2 per cent of UK part-timers were women. Human Resources in European Banking. Lafferty Publications, The Tower, IDA Centre, Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. Pounds 399.</p>

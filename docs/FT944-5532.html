			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Political funding ban urged France should ban companies from funding political parties as part of a crackdown on corruption, a group of experts appointed by conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said yesterday. The panel of three, set up in September amid sleaze scandals in Balladur's centre-right government, recommended that anyone convicted of corruption should be automatically barred from standing for election. The experts also said France should tighten its rules on judicial secrecy, reviving a controversy over how far corruption probes should be hushed up before trial. Mr Balladur said the government would take its time to study the report, which comprises 27 recommendations for 'the moralisation of public life' and is one of several projects on how to stop sleaze, including one from the National Assembly. Mr Balladur's popularity has been dented by the resignation of three cabinet ministers since July over corruption probes, and recent opinion polls showed him trailing behind Socialist European Commission President Jacques Delors in the undeclared race for next year's presidential election.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Nintendo shares no fun in 1994 - Emiko Terazono on reaction to the gamemaker's revised forecasts Nintendo, the Japanese leading video game maker, has had a bad time on the Tokyo stock market over the past seven months. Poor sales in Europe, the strengthening of the yen, the lack of new products and increasing competition have hurt earnings, forcing the company to revise down its initial profits estimates for the business year ended last March. This year the stock has lost 9.5 per cent, in sharp contrast to the Nikkei 225-share index which, in spite of its recent weakness, is still 12.3 per cent to the good. There has been turmoil in video game shares since the Nintendo sell-off started last October, following its downward earnings revision. The revelation that the company would be posting its first earnings decline in a decade with pre-tax profits of Y121bn, against earlier expectations of Y170bn, prompted panic selling of the stock and of other game makers' shares, including Sega Enterprises. Nintendo, hovering around Y9,400 before the announcement, plunged to Y7,000 by the end of the year, while Sega lost 23 per cent over the two months to December. The sharp falls followed a spectacular rise on growth expectations during the late 1980s. 'Nintendo was overbought and is suffering an aftermath,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo. Many investors, too, had not expected the company to be hit by the global recession and by competition in Europe, where it faced increasing competition from Sega. Nintendo was also slow in responding to consumer demand in quality graphics, and fell behind Sega in introducing 16-bit high quality video game hardware. The unexpected appreciation of the yen has also hurt profits, since the company exports all of its products for the US markets from Japan. Company officials have hinted that the rise in the yen during the first quarter of this year may have done further damage. For the current year, analysts are pessimistic. Nintendo wants to concentrate its resources on joint product development of a 64-bit machine with Silicon Graphics, the US computer company, and will not join the race with Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, the consumer electronics companies, and Sega all introducing new 32-bit products this autumn. Over the long term Nintendo may regain its innovative reputation due to high-tech advances from Silicon Graphics. But in the short term its failure to bridge the new product gap between now and next year is expected to undermine its status as the industry leader. For investors, Sega may now be the pick of the video games industry. To minimise currency risks and cut costs, the company has shifted 50 per cent of its production to Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, and is able to subsidise its earnings with income from its arcade business. 'At the moment, Sega seems to be looking best for Christmas,' says Mr Joseph Osha, an analyst at Baring Securities.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY STOCK UP AS TAKEOVER RUMORS SPREAD  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. stock rose sharply Wednesday amid speculation that the  entertainment kingdom might be the next takeover target of Paramount  Communications Inc.  </P> <P> Burbank-based Disney would not comment other than to say it had no information  to explain the rise.  </P> <P> The stock, up more than $7 at one point from Tuesday's close, finished up  $5.375 at $109.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> A group led by Sid Bass, one of the Ft. Worth family of investors, owns about  16% of Disney's shares, but that holding has been described as long term and  amicable. There was no comment from the Bass group Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Bass family in 1984 spent $333 million and took a 25% share of Disney's  stock to help the company ward off hostile takeover attempts by financiers Saul  Steinberg of New York and Irwin A. Jacobs of Minneapolis.  </P> <P> However, there has been market speculation that the Bass group might sell its  holdings to Paramount, which on Monday dropped its $12.2-billion hostile bid  for Time Inc.  </P> <P> New York-based Paramount, which built itself into a media and entertainment  conglomerate largely through acquisitions, indicated Monday that it would  pursue other acquisitions or ventures after losing a Delaware court battle  seeking to block Time's purchase of Warner Communications Inc.  </P></p>

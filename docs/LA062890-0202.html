			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4 PEOPLE HELD, $1.5 MILLION SEIZED IN DRUG RAID;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE CASH WAS FOUND IN A SAFE UNDER THE PATIO OF A HOUSE IN ORANGE. THE  FOUR ARE SUSPECTED OF LEADING A NATIONWIDE RING SELLING CRACK COCAINE AND PCP.  </P> <P> Four people suspected of leading a major crack cocaine and PCP distribution  ring are in custody after federal agents raided a house in Orange and seized  more than $1.5 million in suspected drug profits from a safe buried beneath a  patio there, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Agents discovered the safe, authorities said, when they smashed through the  cement patio during the raid of the split-level house in the 800 block of South  Yorba Street. The house is believed to be owned and used by members of one of  the nation's biggest drug trafficking organizations, authorities said.  </P> <P> Patrick Johnson, 27, of Orange, who authorities said owns the house and who  they believe is the ringleader of the organization, was arrested. He was  charged with drug trafficking and conspiracy Monday in U.S. District Court in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The others arrested in connection with the case and charged in the federal  complaint were identified only as Tyrone Hall, Derek Burkes and Oscar Mellado.  </P> <P> All four remain in federal custody in Los Angeles pending the outcome of a  detention hearing to determine whether they will be held without bail.  </P> <P> Seven other men are named in the complaint, but they have not been apprehended.  </P> <P> Authorities also searched two other properties over the weekend in which  Johnson has an interest.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Monica Bachner described the ring as a "significant source  of cocaine and PCP distribution throughout the country."  </P> <P> The ring was reportedly based in Compton and distributed 500 kilograms of  cocaine, 100 gallons of phencyclidine (known as PCP) and between 10 and 15  kilograms of heroin a month, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District  Court in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The organization includes members of the Compton-based Crips street gang, court  documents say.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Johnson allegedly established the organization in  1983 and extended its business nationwide to include major cities such as  Washington, Detroit, Honolulu and Dallas.  </P> <P> Johnson, according to information provided by an unnamed federal informant,  owns many commercial and rental properties in California, among them a  construction company, an auto body shop and a liquor store. According to court  papers, the informant also said Johnson owns a ranch in San Bernardino and that  he once manufactured PCP there.  </P> <P> According to an affidavit filed by Drug Enforcement Administration Agent  Phillip E. Jefferson, Johnson laundered money, allegedly with the assistance of  an individual who operates a real estate company that Johnson owns, by  purchasing, renovating and reselling residential properties.  </P> <P> The affidavit says that Johnson told the informant that he would receive  multikilogram shipments of cocaine from Colombian suppliers in Texas and would  then arrange to have those delivered to other cities.  </P> <P> The informant, according to the affidavit, also claims to have been present at  an apartment in Carson when Johnson and others suspected of being members of  the organization received a package of several million dollars in cash from  local drug distributors.  </P> <P> If convicted of the drug trafficking and conspiracy charges, the four men could  face maximum terms of life in prison without possibility of parole, authorities  said.  </P></p>

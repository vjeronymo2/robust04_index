			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (6): Haven across the Irish Sea - Dublin ANYONE who has journeyed across the Irish Sea in one of the frequent storms that blow there, can appreciate how this stretch of turbulent water truly separates Ireland from mainland Europe. Even the strongest of stomachs can be put to the test by the heaving deck of a rolling car ferry, battering its way through white-crested walls of water to the haven of Dublin port. An easier passage has been found though for billions of pounds of funds which have encountered a financial haven lying within the legislative and physical boundaries of the EC. It lies just upriver from Dublin port in a large complex of new, glass-fronted buildings and is known as the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). A relative newcomer to Ireland, the offshore financial services industry has flourished like a hybrid seed landing on well-prepared soil. Since 1990, when the first new IFSC office block opened at the derelict docklands site, more than 150 offshore financial services companies have been established in Dublin, and another 80 are in the pipeline. Some 1,300 people are employed in the sector, a figure which is expected to rise to more than 3,000. Activities include corporate and group treasury management, fund management, captive insurance and reinsurance, asset financing and management, and foreign exchange dealing. A 10 per cent corporate tax rate until 2005 approved by the European Commission, tax write-offs on infrastructure investment, rent allowances, the availability of skilled labour, state-of-the-art telecommunications and a flexible legislative environment have all been factors in encouraging some of the biggest names in the corporate and financial services world to establish offshore operations in Dublin. Mr Ray Pillai, the director of IBM's international treasury services company in Dublin, which organises long and short-term finance for the parent, said: 'The low tax rate was just one of the reasons for setting up our group treasury here. Our principal intent was to establish an in-house banking operation, but we wanted to find a place where we could have the flexibility to add on other services such as captive insurance or fund management as appendages to the core operation. Belgium rather than Ireland would have provided the lowest tax environment, but the licences issued in Ireland allow us flexibility and to operate with other parties outside of the group. For instance, if we wanted to finance a joint venture we could do so out of Ireland. The tax regime is a bonus.' According to Mr Brendan Logue, the manager of the financial services programme at the Industrial Development Authority(IDA) which is responsible for the overseas marketing of the IFSC, more than 300 offshore financial services companies have so far received certification to operate out of Dublin. A problem facing the IFSC's further growth, however, and which could also affect existing operations, is a shortage of office space. The Customs House Dock Development Authority, which is licencing the property development side of the IFSC, has approved the construction of 1m square feet of office space at the centre, of which the first stage comprising 450,000 square feet has been completed. This is now 95 per cent occupied by 30 companies. The Authority says that the second phase to build the remainder, is due to be completed by 1997 and should be sufficient to house the remaining companies which have licences and which are scattered around the capital. The negotiations have been stalled, however, for the past 12 months. Under the terms of the offshore licences, the remaining 270 companies must move into the IFSC out of their temporary accommodation, or risk losing their tax concessions. The problem is that since the IFSC development work began, office rents in Dublin have dropped considerably from the IPounds 29.50 per square foot that is the going rate at the IFSC. According to commercial property agents in Dublin, average office rents in the capital are now as low as IPounds 10-15. They say that those companies operating outside of the IFSC are concerned about the high rents being asked at the IFSC, the long leases involved which are between 25 and 35 years, and the high fit-out costs at the high-tech IFSC which in many cases are surplus to many of the smaller companies' requirements. The second phase of the IFSC development has been planned to offer a slightly lower rental rate of IPounds 25 per square foot, but the developers say that they cannot afford to finance it if they cannot be guaranteed minimum 25-year leases with their tenants. Mr Kilian O'Higgins, of Sherry Fitzgerald, one of the largest commercial property agents in Dublin, said: 'Many of these financial services companies want the option to be able to leave when their tax incentives run out. It is a mobile business and they don't want to be locked into long leases.' The government has been leaning on the larger and longer established firms with licences to move into the IFSC, or to sign up leases for the second phase development. A government spokesman said that the pressure will continue and that revocation of licences 'is an option that could be used, but we would rather not have to exercise it. We hope that this is a matter that can be negotiated between the tenants and the developers'. However, all the new leases signed so far of a pre-letting programme for the second phase are for 25 years. Mr Keith Hazley, the general manager of Gaiacorp Ireland, the currency trading subsidiary of a Danish company Gaia Trust, which moved to Dublin from the Cayman Islands two years ago, said: 'We are a small but expanding company. The problem with the IFSC is that it is simply not economic at the current rates being asked, to move there and take on surplus space to allow for future growth of the company. There are so many uncertainties for us to move there.' He said that the company would not pull out of Dublin though 'unless we were forced to do so'. He like others also complained of the lack of ancillary facilities at the IFSC such as parking, restaurants and pubs, which would make it more attractive for staff to work there. These are due to be built under the phase two development, which remains stalled. According to one finance manager working at the IFSC: 'The buildings themselves are very modern and well equipped, but outside there are very few facilities close at hand such as restaurants or pubs. There have been a lot of promises, but nothing, literally nothing has materialised.' So unless a compromise can be reached, allowing companies to take shorter leases at the IFSC, or by offering additional incentives for them to move in there from cheaper office space elsewhere in Dublin, some doubt must remain whether the IFSC can grow much further.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       GLOBAL VIEW OF INVESTMENT FUNDS                           (as at December 31, 1991)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Number of funds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Total    Equity    Bond    Others     Total net   Average                       funds     funds                assets   fund size                        (%)       (%)      (%)    (Dollars m) (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US           3,423      36       41       23      1,346.595       393 Europe       8,775      23       37       40        902.275       103 Japan        5,371      67       33                 328.636        61 Australia      577      40        5       55         46.785        81 Canada         482      51       15       34         42.078        87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             18,628                                2,666.369       143  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FEFSI  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Lorries turning Interim figures from Volvo, Renault and Daf yesterday confirmed that life in the European truck industry remains grim. For Daf grim may be too small a word. The company's sales are skewed towards the UK, where the truck market fell first and hardest; Daf manufactures lowish volumes across a wide range of commercial vehicles, failing to gain the economies of scale enjoyed by larger rivals. As a result a string of losses has eroded the company's capital base. With a moth-eaten balance sheet, Daf clearly needs a capital injection, but does anyone else need Daf? Any potential investor needs to calculate carefully. If the UK truck market has finally bottomed and recovers in 1993, a buyer could get a good slice of European sales for a song. But if the recession drags on for two more years, the weight of Daf's debts will prove heavy. A further difficulty for any partner is that while Daf's operations could be tightened up, substantial savings will only come from reducing the development cost of the next generation of models. Of possible European partners, only Daimler-Benz, MAN and Scania appear to be in a position to act. Despite possible competition problems, Daimler is by far the most likely candidate. Any interested Japanese or American investor would face the problem of entering a market with excess capacity through buying one of the weaker players. Daf shareholders should not rejoice too quickly. If no deal is struck, the company faces the threat of asphyxiation in the medium term - though in the last resort the Dutch government may help out. However, an equity injection would dilute existing holdings, and while that may be preferable to slow strangulation, it is hard to see the shares rising much from here.</p>

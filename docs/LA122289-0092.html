			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> L.A. artist Matthew Thomas paints flat, matte rectangles in the neutral tones  of geometric abstraction and then selectively textures surfaces with materials  like mud, clay, poured wax and sand added to acrylic paint. In "Essential  Ground," two panels abut to make a vertical abstract color field composition.  The upper, rust-toned panel has a gritty finish that looks like the earth's  ridged and bumpy topography seen from a great distance. In the lower panel,  Thomas uses what looks like blanched clay that's been mixed with paint, applied  in varying thicknesses and then allowed to dry and crack to create the  appearance of a parched riverbed viewed at very close range.  </P> <P> In the three paneled piece, "Plane Landscape," an uninflected black field  implies some vast cosmic space with the help of diagrammatic lines of the sort  used by astronomers to chart the heavens. The neighboring panel in neutral  beige has the faintest suggestion of pitted ridging and calls up an aerial view  of an arid valley. The final panel uses ground-up, then painted-on porcelain  clay to reproduce the brittle surface of a cracked stoneware artifact or a  fragment of desert architecture fissured by time.

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: US retailers show improvement TWO bankrupt US retailers, Ames Department Stores and California's Carter Hawley Hale, have reported results for the quarter ended January 1992 showing some improvement in their operations. Carter said it made a Dollars 36.2m profit before interest expenses, reorganisation costs and other non-operating items, in the 13 weeks ended February 1, compared with a Dollars 16m profit last time. Sales were Dollars 693.3m against Dollars 753.3m. However, Dollars 113.9m for reorganisation costs meant that the net loss widened from Dollars 72.7m to Dollars 102.3m. At Ames, there was a small after-tax profit of Dollars 8.1m in the three months to January 25, compared with last time's Dollars 26.8m deficit - the first since it filed for bankruptcy protection in April 1990. The company had sales of Dollars 816.4m, against Dollars 945.8m in the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, at R. H. Macy, the New York-based retailer which also filed for Chapter 11 earlier this year, control of the company's board is in the process of reverting from 'inside' managers to 'outside' directors. Macy was subject to a Dollars 3.5bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, and managers held a majority of board positions prior to the bankruptcy. However, a spokesman for the company said that a clause in the buy-out agreement specified that board control would revert to outside investors if bankruptcy occurred - and procedure had, accordingly, been put into effect. Alexander's, another ailing New York department store group, declined to comment in a response to an inquiry by the New York Stock Exchange on a sudden rise in its shares.</p>

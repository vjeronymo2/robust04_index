			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: Early changes to rules unlikely ANY new rules for the life insurance industry are likely to be a long way off even though the Office of Fair Trading has given its views about encouraging competition. Moreover, recent pronouncements from the Treasury, the Securities and Investments Board and the insurance industry suggest there is far more willingness by all parties to introduce a better disclosure regime.

Those rules include disclosure of how many pence per pound each company's total expenses will reduce final pay-outs by, and rules covering disclosure of each sales agent's status. The Association of British Insurers and other industry groups are preparing to lobby strongly for the Treasury to reject the OFT report.

'We are quite willing to listen to representations from all interested parties,' it said. 'But obviously the Treasury wishes to make its own assessments.' Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, has publicly called for improved investor protection in the industry. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was hopeful that the industry would accept the proposed new regime. 'I do believe that there is a new feeling in the industry,' he said. 'It is starting to feel that the public is losing confidence in the product.'</p>

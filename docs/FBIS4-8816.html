			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Document published on 9 April 1994 by the Democratic </F> Convention of Romania: "Manifesto for the Salvation of Romania"]    [Text] Romania can still be rescued from the crisis into  which it has been pushed by an incapable and corrupt government.    We have discovered that the principal enemy of the country  is  the current political power itself. We consider ourselves  entitled to fight, using all legal and democratic means, to  salvage our nation.    To that end the Democratic Convention of Romania proposes a  number of simple and efficient measures:    1. A severe and righteous justice should put an end to  plundering and corruption and punish all those who have become  rich in unlawful ways.    2. Local authorities should be granted the resources and  legal framework needed to administer our everyday life  successfully. At least 18 percent of the taxes we pay should be  allocated directly to local administration bodies so they can  use the money in the interest and under the control of the  citizens.    3. The villagers' farms should be strengthened by granting  them inexpensive loans to buy seeds, fertilizers, and  agricultural machines. By such measures the well-being of both  the farmers and the country is ensured. Agricultural taxes  should be immediately discontinued, while the handing out of  land ownership certificates should be ended within six months,  the land property bill should be improved, and abuse and  injustice eliminated.    4. Jobs should be ensured by making investments and by  privatization. Taxes should be reduced to stimulate private  business. There is an absolute need for political credibility  and a simple and flexible legal framework to encourage  investments.    5. The youth of this country should find their place in  society, which should ensure them living quarters and access to  jobs. The current parliament session should urgently pass the  education bill in accordance with the recommendations of the  Council of Europe and ensure funds at least three time larger  than the current funds for that domain, so that we can reach the  level attained in neighboring countries.    6. Real protection of the unemployed and the socially  disadvantaged should be ensured.    7. Budget resources should be ensured for health and culture  so as to salvage the biological and spiritual being of our  nation.    8. The defense of the country should be strengthened by  ensuring the dignity, training, and equipment of the armed  forces, integrating them within Euro-Atlantic structures and  halting the drift toward other spheres of influence.    All the aforementioned measures are at hand; by implementing  them Romania could be salvaged from poverty and despair.  Romania must be saved NOW! [capitalization as published]</p>

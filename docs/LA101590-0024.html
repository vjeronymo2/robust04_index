			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> CARL ST. CLAIR, JOHN WILLIAMS OPEN BRIT FEST  </P> <P> A stage full of musical performers, a program featuring a passel of star names,  an audience dressed to the teeth and an elegant pops concert were the main  ingredients:  </P> <P> The British Arts Festival, a fortnight's worth of music, related to -- but  ostensibly distinct from -- simultaneous retail and community celebrations of  things British, began with a genuinely gala concert in Segerstrom Hall at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center on Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony, led by both its new music director, Carl St. Clair, and  guest conductor John Williams, gave the first salvo in this two-week festival,  a symphonic program consisting mostly of bonbons, but bonbons of high quality.  </P> <P> It was a happy event -- preceded by a reception, followed by a dinner, both  optional to the festive audience of 2,500 gathered in the Center -- given over  largely to strong performances of short pieces.  </P> <P> At its jolliest moment, host Lynn Redgrave joined English baritone John  Shirley-Quirk, conductor St. Clair and the orchestra in reciting three  too-brief excerpts from Walton's "Facade."  </P> <P> These quickies, expertly guided by the attentive new music director, ought to  serve as a down payment on a full performance of the work, perhaps on an  occasion when money needs to be raised.  </P> <P> Other high points of the evening also came in the post-intermission: when  Williams led a rousing but unstrident reading of "Jupiter" from Holst's "The  Planets"; when St. Clair conducted a touching and transparent performance of  "Nimrod" from Elgar's "Enigma" Variations; when Williams closed the program  proper with a real novelty, Peter Maxwell Davies' "An Orkney Wedding, With  Sunrise," complete with bagpipe soloist.  </P> <P> The rest was never less than pleasant, despite occasional fluffs from the  brass, and usually authoritative.  </P> <P> Two national anthems began the evening, two nationalistic encores ("Scotland  the Brave" -- kilts there were at this event -- and "Land of Hope and Glory")  ended it.  </P> <P> Williams led a lush reading of his own music from "Jane Eyre." St. Clair  conducted the Pacific Symphony and the huge Pacific Chorale in an excerpt from  Walton's "Belshazzar's Feast" and another from Williams' score to the film  "Empire of the Sun." Shirley-Quirk sang Papageno's aria from "Zauberflote" and  one of Vaughan Williams' "Five Mystical Songs" with orchestra and chorale.  </P> <P> And the new season seems in full swing.  </P></p>

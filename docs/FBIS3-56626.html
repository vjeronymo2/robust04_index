Russian capital Moscow is the most prominent place for this  meeting. Azerbaijan's ambassador to Russia Ramiz Rizayev also  did not excluded the possibility of the meeting.    Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov told  the press in Baku recently, that "Armenian party's approach to  this meeting is of a non-constructive character".    To his mind, serious documents have to be prepared to be  signed by the end of the meeting. Gasanov said that the  Armenian side neither proposes such documents, nor accepts  Azerbaijan's proposals.    Touching upon the recent interview of Robert Kocharyan, the  leader of Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian  TV, Gasanov said, that "this interview again proved that the  Republic of Armenia arms Nagorno-Karabakh separatist fighters.  It has become clear, that Armenian side tries to solve the  conflict by all means forcibly".    Such position, Mr. Gasanov considers, cannot be the basis  for  the negotiation process on regulation of the conflict.</p>

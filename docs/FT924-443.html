			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / The people who have no word for recession GERMANS seem to be either unmoved by the threat of recession, or simply unaware of what is going on, according to opinion polls just published. While more than 65 per cent of the population say they are optimistic about prospects in 1993, almost 40 per cent admit that they do not know the meaning of the word 'scepticism'. The term is a new national favourite among headline writers and glum newsreaders who daily are obliged to present ever-blacker economic and political stories. The discoveries were made by the respected Wickert opinion poll institute. It asked more than 3,000 people how they felt about the new year because it has put the same question for the past 40 years. It asked a similar number if they understood what Skepsis was because the pollsters wanted to check whether the word was suitable for inclusion in their mood-monitoring exercises. Around 65 per cent of west Germans got it right. But only 58 per cent of easterners understood - perhaps understandably, since they have just emerged from a regime under which such subversive notions were not allowed. Misinterpretation was rife in both sides of the country. Those willing to have a stab, rather than shrug, declared that scepticism was either a sickness, a girl's name, a type of vegetable or, revealingly, 'an expression for great hope, joy or confidence'. The less entertaining but equally surprising results of the exploration of German expectations, showed the optimism quotient well above the 40-year average of 60 per cent and only one percentage point down on the result last year when most signs still pointed to continuing economic well-being. Even now, a good 40 per cent of the population apparently does not believe the Bundesbank, the government, economists or the media which for the past few months have warned almost daily of recession or, in the Bundesbank's words, a slowdown. Nor does this carefree proportion seem to have been affected by the job losses announced this year. Some 15 per cent still believe the economy will grow more strongly than in 1992, while a further 30 per cent reckon on no change. However, the poll also revealed that many have heard and accept the warnings of the Bundesbank about pay. An optimistic 29 per cent expect their income to increase, 53 per cent foresee no change, while the rest are braced for a pay cut. According to Wickert's records, optimism last peaked in the poll taken in December 1968, when 72 per cent said they were looking forward hopefully. The mood proved justified. After 5.7 per cent real growth in the year of the sample, the economy expanded by 7.5 per cent in 1969, the highest figure in 10 years. Popular feelings were also a powerful indicator in 1981, when real growth was only 0.1 per cent, and when only 41 per cent claimed to be optimistic. The next year gross national product fell for the first time in seven years.</p>

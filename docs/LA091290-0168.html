			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL NOTES;  </P> <P> LAWRENCE TAYLOR WINS NFC DEFENSIVE HONORS  </P> <P> Lawrence Taylor, who reported to the New York Giants just four days before last  Sunday's game with the Philadelphia Eagles, today was named the NFC Defensive  Player of the Week.  </P> <P> Anthony Dilweg of Green Bay, David Fulcher of Cincinnati and Sammie Smith of  Miami also earned the NFL's first-week honors.  </P> <P> Taylor, who held out for 55 days, had seven tackles, including three sacks, and  forced a fumble in New York's 27-20 win over Philadelphia, its first over the  Eagles after four straight losses. It was the fourth time since 1988 that  Taylor has won NFC defensive honors.  </P> <P> Dilweg, making his first start at quarterback for Green Bay in place of Don  Majkowski, who held out until late last week, won NFC offensive honors. He  completed 20 of 32 passes for 248 yards and three touchdowns in a 36-24 win  over the Rams.  </P> <P> Fulcher was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week. He tackled Ken O'Brien for  a safety, then intercepted his final pass in the Bengals' 25-20 win over the  New York Jets.  </P> <P> Smith, the AFC Offensive Player of the Week, rushed for 159 yards on 23 carries  and scored twice as Miami beat New England, 27-24.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Delton Hall, who started Sunday's season opener,  has been placed on the injured reserve list because of a partially torn tendon  in his left knee.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, linebacker Greg Lloyd was admitted today to a hospital with the  stomach flu. It is not known how long he will be sidelined, the team said.  </P> <P> Defensive end Eric Williams joined the Washington Redskins today with parting  shots at the Lions organization that traded him after six years in Detroit.  </P> <P> "They're definitely not a class organization at all" Williams said after  passing a physical examination for Washington.  </P> <P> Williams ended a holdout with Detroit only last week and was traded to the  Redskins on Tuesday for veteran running back James Wilder and a fourth-round  draft choice.  </P></p>

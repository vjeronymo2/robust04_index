			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Artur Maskin: "Rockets Again Compel the West To </F> Reckon With Russia"]    [Text] As in the days of the Cold War, the subject of  rockets is filled with lack of agreement. According to scanty  information obtained by the REUTER news agency, the  Russian-American joint enterprise Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy  International has concluded large-scale agreements on commercial  launches of communications satellites with the European radio  and television company Societe Europeenne des Satellites and a  certain American telecommunications firm. Representatives of the  cofounding firms of the joint enterprise confirmed signing of  the agreements at a press conference in San Francisco (held  during the night hours of Wednesday-Thursday, according to  Moscow time), but the terms of the agreements remain secret for  the time being.    According to the REUTER agency, the agreements specifically  envisage several launches of the Proton launch vehicle (one  launch of Proton usually costs a foreign client $40 million-$60  million). The first launch is scheduled to take place in 1995.    Today it is definitively clear that no participant in the  world market of commercial space launches can ignore Russia's  presence in this market. The aerospace joint enterprise  Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy International, established last year,  presently controls about a third of this market, whose capacity  amounts to $1.5 billion-$1.8 billion. The statements of the  founders made at the press conference in San Francisco stood out  for their confident, optimistic tone and confirmed the opinion  of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts who last spring assessed the  potential income of Russian aerospace firms at half a billion  dollars (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 7 April 1993).    "This is truly an outstanding achievement," stated Albert  Smith, vice president of the space systems division of the major  American corporation Lockheed, referring to the activity of the  aerospace joint enterprise. Mr. Smith had every justification to  make such a statement. As of today, the joint enterprise has  already concluded contracts amounting to $600 million for the  launch of communications satellites. True, the shares of  participation of Lockheed, the State Space Scientific Production  Center imeni M.V. Khrunichev (SSSPC), and the Energiya  Scientific Production Association in the joint venture are not  being divulged, but in any event Russia will not be a loser.  SSSPC president Anatoliy Kiselev called the joint enterprise an  example of mutually advantageous Russian-American cooperation  and emphasized: "We are talking about the cooperation of equal  partners."    This seizure of position on the world market is being  secured  for the partners primarily by the Proton launch vehicles,  produced by the imeni Khrunichev plant. Mr. Kiselev reminded  journalists that these rockets brought great benefits to the  Soviet military-industrial complex in their time. Today SSSPC is  using them to lift the commercial satellites of  telecommunications and radio and television broadcasting  companies into orbit. Specifically, Proton launch vehicles will  be put into operation for the international project Iridium,  valued at $4 billion, whose chief investor is the American  telecommunications corporation Motorola. The Center imeni  Khrunichev also has its own package of shares in this project.    An additional stimulus to the development of SSSPC is the  January decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 13 January) of the Russian  Government, affording the center unprecedented rights in the  establishment of the Russian state space program and the right  to conclude independent contracts on the use of the Proton  launch vehicle to effect commercial launches of foreign  satellites. Forcing out a number of competing Russian  organizations (including Glavkosmos) as a result, the Center  imeni Khrunichev now has a good opportunity to fight with its  foreign competitors, the most famous of which are China's space  department ("Long March" rockets) and the European consortium  Ariane (Ariane-4 rockets). The Proton surpasses its competitors  with respect to the "price/throw weight" criterion. In addition,  one of the chief problems of Russian producers has begun to lose  its topicality--the importing of Western high-technology  satellites used to be restricted by COCOM [Coordinating  Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] prohibitions. For  Russian firms it is extremely important that protectionism be  definitively relegated to the past and that the determination of  launch quotas be "entrusted" to the free market.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Adams steps up pressure for talks Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has stepped up his efforts to force the pace of the Northern Ireland peace process. He sent a letter to Mr John Major setting out his agenda for talks between the British government and Sinn Fein, David Owen and John Murray Brown write. He said he had written to the prime minister to ensure there was 'no confusion or time lost over arranging such matters as delegations, venues and times'. He added: 'All of these issues can and should be sorted out now.' Downing Street yesterday confirmed that Mr Major had received the letter but officials were not sure whether he had had time to study it. They said the government would move ahead with talks 'at the pace it determined to be correct'. Ministers have said a preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein would begin before Christmas if the IRA ceasefire, now nearly three months old, held. Talks with loyalist political representatives would start soon afterwards. Mr Adams told Downing Street that the Sinn Fein team in the talks would be led by Mr Martin McGuinness, a vice-president. He said that the ground to be covered should include 'demilitarisation and other issues'. A week ago Mr Adams accused the government of dragging its feet on efforts to forge a lasting settlement in the province. Yesterday Mr Pat Doherty, another Sinn Fein vice-president, speaking at Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, called on both London and Dublin to convene all-party talks to find a settlement. Fine Gael, the Irish republic's main opposition party, said explosives and guns had to be decommissioned before full political talks involving Sinn Fein could start.</p>

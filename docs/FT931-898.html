			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A question of confidence EARLIER THIS week the results of a Gallup poll suggested that only 18 per cent of the British people thought that the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, was doing a good job. It is tempting to conclude, on that basis, that he must be doing a great deal that is right. But if his intention in the Budget was to inspire enough confidence to underpin a solid economic recovery, the conclusion has to be mixed. Mr Lamont's case for deferring rises in taxation until 1994-95 was that by delaying the increased flow of revenue into the exchequer's coffers, he would allow the recovery to take a firm hold. There might, perhaps, have been something in this hypothesis if the proposed tax increases were levied on the kind of consumption goods that people could be relied on to buy sooner, in anticipation of higher taxes. But the controversial increase in VAT on fuel and power gives a bigger incentive to emigrate than to bring forward spending decisions: no one turns up the heat to escape next year's tax increase. The more likely response of the British public to Mr Lamont's deferred shock therapy may be to batten down the financial hatches before the fiscal onslaught next year. The chancellor has thus been left, potentially, with the worst of both worlds. The verdict of Gallup hints that confidence remains fragile, while the markets still worry about the jump in the public sector borrowing requirement before fiscal stringency makes its mark on the figures. It follows from all this that the recent sprinkling of modestly encouraging statistics has to be treated with considerable care. The improvement in retail spending figures might not survive such a Budget; and the sharp upturn in new mortgage figures remains, as yet, a one-month phenomenon. The surprise fall in the unemployment figures continues, meantime, to baffle officials and economists one week after the event. Escape route That said, the incipient recovery, unlike most of its postwar predecessors will not - indeed, should not - be consumer driven. The only plausible escape route from the present recession is one which is led by manufacturing output and exports. The upturn will thus look and feel unfamiliar, and will no doubt confound the forecasters once again. Consider the obvious potential sources of demand in the upturn. Clearly the public finances will not permit the government to drive the recovery. A senior Treasury mandarin told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday that the Budget tax increases might not be enough to eliminate the structural element of the fiscal deficit. So that's official. Nor is the consumer in a position to spend as in earlier recoveries. Personal sector debt more than doubled in the 1980s as a percentage of disposable income. While the cuts in interest rates since last September have reduced the debt-servicing burden and helped reduce the rate of fall in house prices, it is far from clear that the Budget Red Book's optimism about a possible rise in prices and turnover later this year is justified. Housing slump The ratio of house prices to earnings is admittedly back below its average for the past 25 years. But the relationship may have reflected a speculative demand for houses that no longer exists in a market where many owners have negative equity in their homes. Equally important, the peculiar British practice of lending up to 100 per cent of value on the security of houses relies on the readiness of insurance companies to provide cover for the top slice of the loan. Insurance companies that have incurred heavy losses in housing are now obliged to demand more realistic premiums. That suggests that home buyers may have to save for longer to put down larger deposits in future. The housing market may thus play a smaller role in this recovery in the past, although the damper on demand will be less noticeable in the north, where the housing market was less frenetic. And unlike the early 1980s, there are no credit controls to remove to provide an alternative expansionary impetus. The only plausible motor for recovery, then, is output. And here the Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of industrial trends offers encouraging straws in the wind. Manufacturing industry's order books are at their best levels since mid-1990 and manufacturers expect to increase output over the next four months. After the devaluation of sterling last autumn, that is just as it should be. The snag, as CBI director general Mr Howard Davies has pointed out, is that the continental European economy is in the doldrums. Until the Bundesbank reduces interest rates significantly, a European upturn will prove elusive. But with German output contracting sharply, there is a growing expectation that rates will come down decisively in the second half of the year. In due course the British may find themselves with a recovery that derives its strength from the economy north of Watford. For once, the regions may have their day.</p>

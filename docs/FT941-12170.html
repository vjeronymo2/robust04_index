			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Bank mortgage lending falls 14% Mortgage lending by leading British banks fell 14 per cent in December, although gross mortgage loans were at a record Pounds 19.3bn for last year as a whole, figures released yesterday by the British Bankers' Association show. The association said gross mortgage lending was Pounds 1.36bn in December, compared with Pounds 1.58bn the previous month. There was a sharper fall in the seasonally adjusted figures for net lending, which dropped from Pounds 871m in November to Pounds 733m in December. The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders in the UK. Figures produced earlier this month by the Building Societies Association showed that societies' gross mortgage advances totalled Pounds 31.5bn in 1993 as a whole, and Pounds 8.1bn for the final three months of the year. The fourth quarter figure for leading British banks' gross mortgage lending was Pounds 4.6bn. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said there had been a 'deceleration' in banks' mortgage lending recently, only part of which was seasonal. He added, however, that the rise of 16 per cent in gross mortgage lending figures for 1993 compared with 1992 'probably represents their largest annual market share'. That judgment appears borne out by a comparison of net lending figures for banks and societies. Net building society advances last year were Pounds 9.4bn, compared with Pounds 13.5bn in 1992. Net lending by the leading banks rose from almost Pounds 7bn in 1992 to just over Pounds 9bn.</p>

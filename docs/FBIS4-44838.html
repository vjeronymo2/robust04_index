			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aerospatiale: Qualification for a </F> Cryotechnical Tank for the Ariane 5"]    [Text] GIE Cryospace (a joint venture made up of Air  Liquide and Aerospatiale) has recently obtained qualification  for a large tank for the main cryotechnical (EPC) stage of the  Ariane 5. This structure is made up of two compartments, one  for liquid oxygen (LOx) and the other, for liquid hydrogen  (LH2). Qualification was obtained by executing a burst type  rupture test. Rated flight pressure for the tank are 4.8 bars  for the LOx compartment and 2.4 bars for the LH2 compartment.  For the test, internal loads were simulated by pressurized  nitrogen and local external stress by hydraulic actuators.  Testing was done in a pit 30 meters deep and 9 meters in  diameter, at the Cryospace premises at Les Mureaux during the  night of 16 to 17 February. Pressures reached during rupture  complied perfectly with anticipations. Nearly 700 measuring  probes were placed on the structure, which, during the test,  swells by several centimeters in height and several tens of  centimeters in breadth. The rupture test was done using a tank  identical to the flight model, except for the hydrogen  compartment, which was shortened. Results will enable  specialist from Cryospace and Aerospatiale, industrial architect  and stage builder of the Ariane 5 to validate structural skin  covering dimensions to determine safety margins adapted to  flight pressures and fine tune computational modules for future  tanks.

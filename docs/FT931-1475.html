			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barratt makes 92% surge to Pounds 4.8m SIR LAWRIE Barratt, brought out of retirement 21 months ago to rescue Britain's third largest housebuilder, yesterday proposed to increase the company's output by almost two- thirds during the next three years. Barratt Developments, which announced a 92 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 2.5m) in the six months to December 31, said there were clear signs that the UK market was beginning to revive after four years of recession. The company wants to increase the number of homes it builds from 5,000 in the current year to 8,000 by 1998. It said it would finance expansion from within its own resources, without resorting to a rights issue and keeping gearing to less than 50 per cent. Since Sir Lawrie returned in July 1991, the company has cut net debt from Pounds 255m to just Pounds 81m at the end of December, including off-balance sheet borrowings. This was equivalent to 44 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 184m. The biggest contribution to the first half profits improvement was reduced interest payments, which fell from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 4m. Of this about Pounds 1.1m was due to lower interest rates and Pounds 4.8m to reduced debt. Sir Lawrie said that net reservations had risen by about 15 per cent compared with the first three months of last year. This was despite the fact that Barratt was operating from considerably fewer sites than a year earlier. UK profits rose from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 7.5m, despite the number of houses sold dipping from 2,128 to 2,017. Group turnover fell from Pounds 209.7m to Pounds 174m, of which the UK accounted for Pounds 164m (Pounds 190m). The US incurred a Pounds 2.7m loss in the first half with the group continuing to experience problems in a depressed Californian market. The group was seeking to get better value out of its Californian operations by introducing similar management to those which had turned round the UK business, Sir Lawrie said . The interim dividend is restored at 1p. Earnings per share increased from 1.4p to 2p. COMMENT Barratt shares, which have had a good run recently, fell 3p to 133p yesterday. There was some disappointment that the housing recovery, reported by other housebuilders, was not more in evidence and some brokers downgraded profit expectations for the full year. The group will also need to step up its land holdings of 13,500 plots with planning permission to about 16,000 if it is to meet its three year sales target. Sir Lawrie and chief executive Frank Eaton, however, have done a tremendous job in turning round the UK business. But the shares are on a prospective multiple of more than 17 on forecast profits of Pounds 18m and have probably run their course for the time being.</p>

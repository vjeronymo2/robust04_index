According to news release from Geneva available here, the  spokesman said the NATO's shotdown of four of the six aircraft  over central Bosnia early this morning was clearly authorized by  UN Security Council Resolution 816, which was aimed at ensuring  compliance with the ban "proportionate to the specific  circumstances and the nature of the flights."    "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be  used  by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to  negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"  he said.    According to the information director of the UN Protection  Force in the Former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), the NATO planes were  patrolling the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia when the incident  occurred. It was the first time that NATO warplanes have taken  this action since the "no-fly" zone was declared in October 1992.    The Unprofor said the NATO aircraft encountered six Galeb  aircraft. They challenged them and warned them twice that they  were flying in violation of the Security Council resolution on  the issue.</p>

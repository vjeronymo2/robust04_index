			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RETAILERS POST AN AVERAGE 5.7% JULY SALES GAIN  </P> <P> The nation's big retailers today posted an average 5.7% gain in July, but the  sales growth failed to impress analysts, who expect increasingly tight times in  the retailing industry for the rest of the year.  </P> <P> Promotions to move out summer merchandise gave most of the boost to business.  </P> <P> An index of 17 leading chains compiled by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. indicated  that sales rose 5.7% in July from a year earlier, little different from June's  5.8% year-to-year gain.  </P> <P> Several nationwide general merchandisers posted results that fell short of the  industry average.  </P> <P> No. 1 Sears, Roebuck and Co. said its sales in the four weeks ended Aug. 4 rose  3.7% from a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year moved 3.1%  higher.  </P> <P> Same-store results are widely regarded as the best indicator of a retailer's  performance. Tallies that include new stores can be inflated because business  frequently is busier immediately after an opening than it ends up being over  time.  </P> <P> Second-ranked K mart Corp. reported its July sales rose 12.1%. But on a  comparable store basis, sales grew a more modest 2.2%.  </P> <P> One of the standouts, as usual, was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which posted a 21%  increase in July. Its same-store sales grew 8%.  </P> <P> Several specialty apparel retailers also outperformed the industry. The Gap  Inc., for instance, said its July sales jumped 36%. Sales at stores open a year  or longer rose 28%.  </P> <P> J. C. Penney Co. said its July sales rose 3.2%. Same-store sales grew 2%.  </P> <P> Dayton Hudson Corp. said its sales grew 16.4%, while same-store sales were up  4.4%.  </P> <P> May Department Stores Co. said its sales grew 9.8%. Comparable store sales rose  4.4%.  </P> <P> Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc. said its sales grew 19% to $348.9  million.  </P></p>

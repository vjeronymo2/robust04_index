			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / The private sector that is driving China What type of economic regime prevails in China today? Nobody seems to be quite sure. The language in which the government describes itself, articulates policy and looks to the past and future is that of a communist country. Yet it is obviously not the same kind of system as has come to such a sudden end in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. It is not just that it has proved more durable and successful, growing at 9 per cent a year in the 1980s. It has adopted many features of a market economy that used to be thought inconsistent with communism. In particular, it is in the process of developing a capital market when many economists a generation ago would have argued that a defining characteristic of communism is the absence - indeed the suppression - of a capital market. In the labour market one finds the same apparent contradictions. A basic tenet of communism was that no one could sell the product of another man's labour. Yet Chinese farmers in the countryside and private entrepreneurs in the cities are now hiring workers, albeit with state controls on the numbers of labourers an undertaking may hire. As the problem of unemployment emerges with reform of state-owned enterprises, these controls on private employment are increasingly being relaxed. This is in fact part of the single biggest change in the Chinese economy over the past decade: the rapid growth of small-scale township and village enterprises (TVEs) producing consumer goods both for the domestic market and for export. Whatever the ownership arrangement (nominally collective ownership), their management is almost entirely independent of government. The scale of change is evident in all directions: a meteoric exports increase has converted China into a major surplus country in the past decade, with former state monopolies facing growing market competition and declining profit margins. Between 1979 and 1989 the state had become a much smaller factor in the economy. Its share of total industrial output fell from 77 percent to 55 per cent. In terms of GDP the state, as distinct from the private and collective sectors, accounted for some 35 per cent of the output of goods and services  -just above the government share in several European countries. Another change is the devolution of control over financial resources from the centre to the provinces, enterprises and, above all, to households, whose savings have increased dramatically. Where central government had formerly to generate forced savings through low wages, price control and compulsory profit remittances in order to finance new infrastructure and heavy industry, now it is unable to balance its budget and has to borrow to cover its deficit. The state has allowed local governments to retain larger funds without any assurance that they will take over responsibility for meeting the economy's rapidly growing capital requirements, which are increasingly met from household savings that now represent 70 per cent of total savings. A country that relies on household savings to provide 70 per cent of the finance of new investment is very different from one in which taxation is the source of nearly all new capital accumulation. True, the banks are mostly government-owned and can direct capital in directions officially determined. But they have obligations to depositors who are free to withdraw funds. So there may be hesitancy, as there would be in the west, over converting liquid funds into long-term investments in real assets. The government has sought to overcome this problem by issuing three to five-year bonds, but this may not meet the requirements of savers who are liable to encounter sudden needs to realise their funds and would welcome a bond market for that purpose. Other savers may be disposed to seek more risky and remunerative investments in the form of shares. And here, too, there is evidence of an eagerness of Chinese savers to participate in a newly developing market. The increasing use of a market system has been evident in the opening of the economy to trade. At the end of the 1980s the annual trade surplus was running at USDollars 8bn and China's foreign exchange reserves had grown by early 1992 to USDollars 46bn - not far short of its foreign debt of USDollars 53bn. One of the most autarchic countries in the world changed into one of the most open, with exports as high as 17 per cent of GDP. China, with a more limited reform agenda than the Commonwealth of Independent States and eastern Europe, has alone among any former or current centrally planned economy successfully transformed a shortage economy into one of excess aggregate supply. In a number of respects, its economic system in its structure and use of markets is much more favourable than that of the CIS and eastern Europe to a successful transition to a full market system - if and when the political decision is made to do so.

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Management: Management (The Growing Business): Pricing policy pays off Two years ago Megatech Software, a distributor of other people's computer software, was in steep decline. The recession had slashed demand for its products and staff numbers had been cut from 15 to four. Largely due to an aggressive pricing policy, Megatech has since established itself as number two in the accountancy software market with a system of its own design. Theo van Dort, founder and managing director of the Wandsworth, south London-based company, had a computing rather than an accounting background. But his experience of using accounts in his own business and of 'anglicising' American accounting systems gave him the background to devise TAS Books. The system and its handbook or 'tutorial' were intended to be readily understandable by the small business owner. A feature of the programme is the ease with which changes can be made if an incorrect figure has been entered. Despite an enthusiastic reception by the computer press TAS Books sold painfully slowly in the first few months after its launch in August 1991. 'At a price of Pounds 399 we were only giving away demo copies,' says Charles Francis, sales and marketing manager. In desperation Van Dort cut the price to Pounds 99. Advertised as a Pounds 399 system with Pounds 300 off, TAS Books began to pick up sales, from 200 in November to 300 in December and 500 in January 1992. The price was attractive but some accountants were still cautious about auditing accounts produced on the system because of its novelty. To overcome this resistance, Van Dort obtained the recommendation of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for his system last June. Sales resumed their upward trend and have since held at between 800 and 1,000 a month. Megatech currently ranks second in the accounting packages market alongside larger, long-established companies. It took a 17 per cent share in the first quarter of 1993 after Sage with 56 per cent and before Pegasus with 7.5 per cent, according to Romtec, an independent company which compiles market data. Megatech's sales were Pounds 1.2m last year, pre-tax profits Pounds 100,000 and staff numbers have risen to 20. User support can be a significant cost in the computer business. A clearly written manual keeps down the number of customer inquiries but Megatech's five-strong support staff still handle between 650 and 1,000 inquiries a week. Megatech has held its price at Pounds 99, opting to take a smaller margin on high volumes, and selling by mail order. Customers are more confident than a few years ago about buying software through the post and the low price encourages buyers to take a chance. Waverers are encouraged by a 30-day money-back guarantee. Van Dort says his low-priced package has expanded the market place and not prompted retaliation from his rivals. Since there are no dealers to promote the package Megatech spends a lot on advertising - Pounds 250,000 a year at current rates. The combination of a low price, an innovative product and attention to customer service has brought the company through. Megatech's decision to slash its price, while reminding customers that its package was originally being sold for much more, appears to have paid off. But selling on price alone to gain market share can be a dangerous strategy, warns John Winkler of Winkler Marketing, a consultancy. While Megatech's main rivals have not responded by slashing their prices, in other markets price cuts have triggered price wars which has damaged the entire industry. Once a low-price policy has been adopted it is difficult to change. Van Dort acknowledges that he is now unable to raise the price of TAS Books although new, more highly priced products are planned. Surveys have shown that many companies going into liquidation have previously attempted price cuts, Winkler points out. It is relative product quality which builds substantial long-term market share, not price cutting, says Winkler. Virgin Airlines is known as a low-price operator but takes pains to provide a high-quality service, he notes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief Justice Yong Pung How has released his written  judgment for dismissing the appeal by American student Michael  Fay. The chief justice noted the appeal had rested on two  grounds. The first ground of appeal is that the district judge  erred in deciding that paint was regarded as an indelible  substance under the Vandalism Act. Chief Justice Yong said the  act indicates plainly the parliament's intention that all acts  of vandalism committed with paint be punished with caning.  There is no evidence anywhere to subject all such acts of  vandalism to this sort of test of indelibility, which Fay's  counsel had suggested.    The chief justice said the law clearly states an act of  vandalism committed with paint, whether with one type or  another, attracts a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the  cane.    On the second ground of appeal, Fay's counsel had said the  district judge should have called for pre-sentence probation  report. Chief Justice Yong said the court had been given the  discretion to decide rehabilitation for young offenders when  balancing the concerns of society. He is satisfied the district  judge had fully considered all mitigating factors listed by  Fay's counsel, including his youth and plea of guilt.</p>

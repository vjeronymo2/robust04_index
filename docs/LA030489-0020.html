			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURST PIPE SOAKS BONAVENTURE LOBBY  </P> <P> All those ponds in the four floors of the lobby complex of the Bonaventure  Hotel in downtown Los Angeles came in handy early Friday when a water pipe  burst and cold water gushed out over lobby floors. Hotel workers with mops  sloshed much of the water into the ponds and pushed the rest out onto Flower  Street.  </P> <P> Fifteen firefighters used their "jaws of life" lifesaving tool, usually used  for prying human victims out of wrecks, to finally stop the flooding by  pinching the 1 1/2-inch chilled water pipe closed after nearly two hours.  </P> <P> No guests were forced to leave their rooms. Hotel officials said there was  "only a few thousand dollars" damage to several retail shops and restaurants  and most were back in operation by nightfall. T'Boli, a fourth-floor Filipino  restaurant, sustained minor carpet damage.  </P> <P> Assistant Manager Doug Dreher said faulty soldering may have caused the pipe  rupture.  </P></p>

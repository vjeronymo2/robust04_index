			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Pollution pledge at risk THE environment may have to take second place in the government's review of energy policy, which has been prompted by the recent controversy about coal pit closures. Ministers admit that the UK's commitment to reducing harmful emissions, which was signed by Mr John Major at the Rio summit only last June, is incompatible with trying to save more of the coal industry. In common with other EC countries, the UK has pledged to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000. That, though, was based on the assumption that the power generation industry would steadily switch from coal to gas. If the review leads to a new emphasis on coal, environmental regulations would require heavy investment in desulphurisation and other clean-up equipment at power stations. That would not reduce carbon emissions. The result is that coal-fired power generation would have more costs heaped on it at a time when it needs to cut costs to become more competitive. The nuclear power industry, which will be included in the review, took steps yesterday to highlight its environmental qualifications. The British Nuclear Forum, which represents nuclear power operators and suppliers, said the absence of emissions from nuclear power stations made it a 'natural partner' for coal. Professor Peter Jones, a consultant to the forum, said a mixture of coal and nuclear power would leave more room for coal within the emission constraints than a mix of coal and natural gas, both of which produce carbon dioxide. The forum's campaign is designed to persuade ministers not to scale down nuclear power in order to encourage market share for coal. Prof Jones said the cost of generating electricity from nuclear's long-established stations where costs had been written down was among the cheapest in the country. If nuclear was replaced by either coal or gas, that would push up electricity bills. It would also produce huge plant decommissioning costs that would have to be absorbed either by the consumer or the taxpayer. Nevertheless, the view at the Department of Trade and Industry, where the review is being conducted, is that it will be difficult to save more than a few collieries and coal jobs. Although the government has several options for raising coal consumption, many of them involve government intervention or have undesirable knock-on effects in other sectors of the energy industry. DTI sources emphasise that the review is being launched 'with an open mind', but it will not lead to an increase in the coal market from the 40m tonnes at present projected to the 60m needed to save large numbers of jobs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks denote recorded passages] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and his extensive  entourage have arrived in Beijing, but had an easy start to the  visit.    [Correspondent] In addition to China the trip also includes  Hong Kong and Macao. This is the largest group ever to travel  with the prime minister, with more than 60 businessmen -- a trip  of great economic significance. Cavaco Silva returns to China  seven years after the signing of the Macao Joint Declaration in  Beijing. The accord has contributed to the stability of the  territory, according to the Chinese ambassador to Portugal:    [PRC ambassador in Mandarin with Portuguese subtitles] "The  two governments have enjoyed good cooperation during the  implementation of the Joint Declaration since its signing seven  years ago. They have contributed to the stability and  prosperity of Macao."    [Correspondent] After 1999, Macao will be an integral part  of  China, a situation which raises many questions. Two such  questions are whether the death penalty will apply in the  territory and the other is the nationality of the residents.  The Chinese ambassador believes that appropriate solutions will  be found for these two questions.    [PRC ambassador] "The Portuguese descendants who live in the  territory have joined their efforts to help with Macao's  economic and social development. We hope that even after 20  December 1999, they can remain in Macao in peace. It is certain  that the Macao Special Administrative Region will protect their  customs and cultural traditions in accordance with the Basic  Law. China will apply the nationality law bearing in mind the  historic reality of the territory in such a manner as to find an  appropriate solution to the situation.    "In relation to Macao, we believe that after the transition  period the problem will be studied bearing in mind the social  reality. The opinion of the residents on the death penalty will  be sought and only then will the appropriate law on this matter  be drawn up."    [Correspondent] The Orient Foundation, created before the  signing of the Joint Declaration and based in Lisbon, has been  one of the problems in this period of transition. China wants  the foundation headquarters to be directly accountable to it.  So far no decision has been reached.    [PRC ambassador] "The Orient Foundation funds come from  Macao  and should serve Macao. The contract, which gives part of the  gambling profits to the Foundation, was signed before the Joint  Declaration and will go beyond 1999. This question should be  looked at by the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group during the  transition period. We are certain that through friendly  negotiations we will find the appropriate solution."</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Violence rebounds on Medellin: Colombia is taking a hard line in the battle on drugs THE HUGE blast that ripped through the heart of the Colombian capital on Saturday showed just how difficult it is for the government to protect the public from the random terror tactics of the Medelln drugs cartel. The 20 people killed by the car bomb were mostly shopkeepers, street sellers and children. Ten days ago two car bombs hit affluent office and middle-income residential zones in northern Bogota, triggering intensive security operations, which led to the discovery of 1,500 kilos of dynamite. The government has said it will not negotiate with Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medelln drugs cartel, who it is assumed is responsible for the bombs, and there appears public support for the position. The drug and guerrilla violence which previously led people to support surrender negotiations and peace talks appears now to be rebounding on its perpetrators. The public approves of the increasingly hard line adopted by the government since the breakdown of the peace talks with left-wing guerrilla groups in the first half of last year and Pablo Escobar's escape from jail in July. Colombian television newscasts are preceded by a string of photos showing the nation's most wanted men - guerrilla commanders, bombers, drug traffickers - and the rewards offered for information on them. This tactic has produced results, with two rebel leaders and six traffickers killed or captured as a result of tipoffs. A senior Medelln police officer said that over 10 solid tips are phoned in every day. Letters from Pablo Escobar to the government, threatening further violence and demanding 'political' treatment, have received short shrift. He has spent six months on the run from over 1,000 specialist troops in the Medelln area, and has failed to negotiate a new surrender; the Bogota bombs are evidence of a new approach. Pablo Escobar said he was forming an armed rebel group, and that all further dialogue should be carried out on the same terms as for guerrilla organisations. A government communique dismissed this as an attempt to disguise criminality as politics, in order to bargain for an amnesty. Over the past year, the two guerrilla groups, FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and ELN (National Liberation Army), have been found promoting poppy and coca growing, processing and transport operations. Police commanders say the Escobar organisation has also contracted many of its assassinations of policemen and car bombings to guerrilla units and members of the Medelln popular militias. This has dispelled most remaining doubts about the links between guerrilla and trafficking activities. Under the state of emergency declared in November and extended for another 90 days last month, the government has stepped up military operations and introduced special legislation to attack sources of guerrilla funding. A new anti-kidnap law approved by the president also raises penalties and freezes assets of victims and their families - over 1,100 known kidnaps were carried out in 1992, the majority by guerrilla organisations. The military and police budgets have increased substantially between 1991 and 1993, allowing the formation of new counter-insurgency companies, arms purchasers, higher wages and expanded intelligence networks. Economic targets such as oil and coal infrastructure are receiving greater protection and several bombs have been successfully defused in urban areas. Despite guerrilla attacks, which brought oil exports to a standstill in November, reducing the country's growth rate, the government still calculates the economy grew by 3.3 per cent last year. While businesses cite security as their chief problem, the economic mood is more optimistic than a year ago. Companies have adapted to the regular power cuts and electricity rationing is gradually being reduced. The economy thus continues to show the resilience it has demonstrated even through the 1980s when the rest of Latin America was suffering recession. Most independent analysts agree that 1993 growth should be between 3 and 4 per cent and expect the 25 per cent annual inflation rate to drop by another 2 percentage points or so. According to Mr Eduardo Lora, director of the economic research group Fedesarrollo, higher public spending, private investment projects and the oil industry will all help growth. The government is starting 1993 with a sweeping modernisation programme designed to streamline state institutions in line with the economic liberalisation of the last three years. Apart from abolishing some entities and restructuring others, the programme involves cutting some 23,000 jobs, which is generating hostility among labour unions. A national strike of public employees, including teachers, has been called for mid-February. None of this has done much to improve the popularity of President Cesar Gaviria, which sank after power rationing was introduced and Escobar escaped from jail. However, political attention is even now shifting away from Mr Gaviria to the candidates for next year's presidential elections.</p>

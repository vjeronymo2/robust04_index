			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: USX offers 7.5m shares USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday said it had filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 7.5m shares in a new class of USX common stock to be called USX-Delhi Group common stock. The initial public offering price will be between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a share, according to the company's registration statement. USX said in April it might sell shares in its Delhi Group, including the Delhi gas pipe line and other related companies, as part of its efforts to realise shareholder value. The Delhi Group had sales of over Dollars 423m in 1991, with operating income of about Dollars 31m and assets of Dollars 598m. USX had also considered selling assets or creating a limited partnership. USX said yesterday the proceeds from the offering would be used for the business purposes of its Marathon gas group. The Delhi group had been part of the Marathon group. The effort to realise additional value for Marathon follows the company's stock split last year, when USX agreed to issue a new class of stock after pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier.</p>

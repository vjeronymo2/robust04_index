			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, 18 Mar (INA)--News from New York says that  the UN Security Council [UNSC] decided tonight not to issue its  traditional statement which it makes bimonthly when it reviews  the siege imposed on Iraq.    French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, the Security Council  president, told journalists following the council's  consultations tonight that the council completed its review of  the embargo on Iraq in accordance with Resolutions 687 and 715,  without giving further details.    This is the first time in three and one-half years that the  UNSC has refrained from issuing its traditional statement on  extending the unjust siege on Iraq.    Diplomatic sources in the United Nations told an INA  correspondent that this was due to the division between UNSC  permanent members, which are divided into two groups. The first  group comprises France, Russia, and China, which insists on  recognizing the positive development that has taken place  between Iraq and the United Nations. The second group comprises  the United States and Britain, which wants to maintain previous  UNSC president statements, which usually say that the council  did not note progress in Iraq's abidance by UN resolutions. The  United States and Britain insist on this formula, and the two  countries suffered a severe failure at the council today.    The diplomatic sources added that the result of the  council's  three-day consultations are considered an important diplomatic  gain for Iraq, and that the second group, which comprises the  United States, Britain, and Argentina, have become isolated in  the council.    Following the council meetings, Yuri Vorontsov, Russia's  permanent UN representative, explained his country's position  during the three-day consultations. He said during the  consultations the Russian delegation said there are positive  elements in Iraq's implementation of Resolution 687 and  long-term monitoring according to Resolution 715.    Vorontsov added that the Russian delegation has behaved out  of conviction, and demanded that the positive elements in Iraq's  position be encouraged, therefore, the Russian delegation  demanded to include in the periodic presidential statement a  clear paragraph that points to this positive position adopted by  Iraq.    Vorontsov said: At the council's consultations, we clearly  stressed the need to specify when the long-term monitoring  measures began and the duration of the experiment. We proposed  that the experiment be for a period of six months, for example,  at the end of which Russia would be prepared to discuss lifting  the oil embargo in implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution  687.    As for British Envoy Sir David Hannay, he attempted to  belittle the importance of the outcome reached by the UNSC. He  did not make statements to attract the attention of reporters,  as has been his custom after each and every session of the UNSC.    Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright made no  comment. She left this for her secretary, who reiterated the  U.S. position, saying: "It is no secret that we want to maintain  the embargo against Iraq. However, some UNSC members do not  wish this to happen."    An ambassador of a UNSC member who preferred to remain  anonymous said that the climate of today's consultations is a  crucial factor that will be to Iraq's advantage in the next  periodic review due to be held on 18 May.    Some diplomatic sources said that the climate at the UNSC  today was the first of its kind, as there was a clear rift  between the two groups. It is a turning point in favor of Iraq,  the sources added.    The sources went on to say that U.S. Ambassador Albright  attempted to raise irrelevant issues to distract the  deliberations, alleging that her government has information  indicating that Iraq is massing its troops to attack Kurds.  However, the U.S. attempt has failed, because the French,  Russian, PRC, and other ambassadors ignored this attempt, and  insisted that the statement clearly acknowledge the positive  developments in Iraq's position. Nonetheless, the Americans and  Britons maintained their anti-Iraq position, thus eliciting this  outcome of the UNSC review, namely, the decision to maintain the  sanctions for two more months pending the next review of the  sanctions on 18 May, which is expected to be in favor of Iraq.</p>

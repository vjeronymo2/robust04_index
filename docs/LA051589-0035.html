			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Lawmakers from the Baltic republics pledged to press their demand for a greater  say over their own affairs at this month's inaugural session of the new Soviet  Parliament. At a meeting organized by progressive mass movements from all three  republics -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- deputies agreed on radical  resolutions to put to the Congress of People's Deputies when it meets in Moscow  beginning May 25. The meeting was held in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. Marju  Lauristin, a leading Estonian deputy, said 100 or so progressive Baltic  deputies hope to win support for some issues from several hundred members of  the 2,250-seat congress. The informal "Baltic bloc" is among several loose  factions being formed.  </P></p>

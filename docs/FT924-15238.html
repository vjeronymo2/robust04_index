			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Fowler may heed reformist pressure SIR Norman Fowler, Conser-vative party chairman, has acknowledged that he may be forced to bow to the demands of grassroots activists for a special meeting of the Conservatives' policymaking central council to make the party more democratic and accountable. A pressure group called the Party Reform Steering Committee has won the support of the 50 constituency parties necessary to demand an extraordinary meeting of the central council, which is composed of constituency activists, MPs, MEPs and peers. The pressure group wants the council to establish a party executive committee, with at least half its members elected by a postal ballot of the central council, which would take over responsibility for Conservative Central Office and the party's central funds. The chairman of that committee would be elected, but the pressure group says the new office would be non-political, dealing only with party matters, and would not replace the current party chairmanship, which is a political appointment. At a Conservative conference fringe meeting in Brighton last night, Mr Michael Normington, chairman of the pressure group, pressed for an early meeting of the central council. He said the group would take 'a very dim view' of verification of constituency letters of support being used as an excuse for delay. Mr Normington has been critical of those in the party hierarchy who he says have been putting pressure on constituencies not to support the group. Sir Norman told the FT that he hoped his own strategy to make the party's decision-making more accountable through the creation of a new executive board would meet many of the demands of grassroots supporters. The board would give constituencies the role they have sought in overseeing Central Office decisions.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 24 RICH NATIONS SET TERMS FOR AID TO EASTERN EUROPE  </P> <P> The industrialized world's 24 richest nations approved a U.S.-backed plan  Wednesday to give economic aid only to countries committed to human rights,  multi-party democracy and free-market economics.  </P> <P> The so-called Group of 24, which is already coordinating a $14-billion aid  package for Poland and Hungary, agreed to add Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria,  Yugoslavia and East Germany to the program but rejected both Romania and the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The group's decision to add the four Eastern European regimes was dimmed by its  failure to put up any new money.  </P> <P> In a joint communique, the foreign ministers of the 24 countries, all  democracies, said the aid package "requires further financial efforts from the  whole Western community." The statement said the ministers agreed to seek  specific commitments from their own governments.  </P> <P> In the communique, the foreign ministers said Romania could not be included  because the new government of President Ion Iliescu has not adopted sufficient  political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> "They called on the Romanian government to resume the course of reform based on  democracy, dialogue and peaceful change," the communique added.  </P> <P> The declaration said the ministers only "exchanged views" about aid to the  Soviet Union. It said the group was waiting for "positive developments of  reform towards a democratic system and a market-oriented economy."  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the group adopted five criteria for  assistance: adherence to the rule of law; respect for human rights;  introduction of multi-party systems; holding free and fair elections, and  development of market-oriented economies.  </P> <P> "Western assistance is not meant to maintain the status quo but to reform it  radically," Baker told a press conference.  </P> <P> A senior State Department official said later that it is the first time that  international aid-givers had ever imposed such strict political conditions.  </P> <P> He said the group's action amounted to approval of Baker's doctrine of  "democratic differentiation," which calls for democracies to assist other  democracies while shunning authoritarian states.  </P> <P> "It is enough of a trend that it is affecting attitudes globally," the official  said. "Some African nations are talking about multi-party systems because they  are concerned about this."  </P> <P> The group shuffled off for additional study a proposal by the European  Community for a separate, special fund of more than $12 billion to provide  short-term emergency loans to Poland, Hungary and the four newly approved  recipients.  </P> <P> Frans Andriessen, the community's vice president for foreign affairs, said the  six nations need enormous amounts of short-term aid to stabilize their  economies. He said he is not discouraged by the failure of the plan to win the  group's approval and he predicted that such a "safety net" would be adopted  eventually.  </P> <P> The group took no action on a suggestion by Baker to establish a separate  coordinated aid program for democratic governments in Central America. Baker  said he would raise the matter again at a later meeting. A U.S. official said  Baker envisioned a group smaller than the 24 aiding Eastern Europe to provide  money for Central America.  </P> <P> Andriessen, the informal chairman of the group, said the "door is open" for  Romania if the Bucharest regime changes its policies.  </P> <P> As for the Soviet Union, he said the group wants to await the results of a  study ordered last week by a summit of the 12-nation European Community in  Dublin.  </P> <P> But he added that the Soviet Union is "fundamentally different from all of the  countries discussed today" because its massive economy needs far more money  than the rest of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Baker said the United States wants to keep the Soviet Union out of the Group of  24 process although Washington will not try to prevent its allies from aiding  Moscow if they wish.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should divert attention at this stage from the vital task of  aiding those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that suffered for so long  under a totalitarian regime by addressing now a provision of economic  assistance to the Soviet Union," he said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said East Germany was included in the aid list to dramatize the  democratic reforms adopted by the regime since the fall of the Berlin Wall. But  the official said it is unlikely that East Germany would get any aid from the  group because of its economic merger this week with affluent West Germany.  </P> <P> Baker stopped in Brussels on his way to a NATO summit meeting that begins today  in London.  </P> <P> On the trip from Brussels to London, however, he ran into the jaws of a French  air traffic controllers' strike that disrupted flight patterns all over Western  Europe. Baker's Air Force jet transport took on enough fuel for the scheduled  hourlong hop. However, after the plane was forced to circle Heathrow Airport  for more than 45 minutes waiting for a landing clearance, it had to land at  Mildenhall, an air base about 70 miles from London shared by the United States  and Britain, to refuel. Baker arrived in London three hours behind schedule.  </P> <P> Baker said aid for the Soviet Union may be discussed in London although it is  not on the formal NATO agenda. He added that the subject is on the agenda for  the seven-nation economic summit next week in Houston.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said President Bush probably will urge the economic summit to  require Moscow to adopt political and economic reforms and to make sharp cuts  in its massive military budget before Western nations consider any sort of  assistance.  </P></p>

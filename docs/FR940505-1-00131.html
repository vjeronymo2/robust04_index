			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Applicability. The Agency believes that it is necessary to control emissions from all on-highway motorcycles and engines used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad motorcycles, as defined in the previous section, on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statewide basis to achieve needed emission reductions in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. It is the Agency's intent that the standards proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today, as well as the requirements of 40 CFR part 86 subpart E,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to all on-highway motorcycles, and engines used in nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles regardless of displacement. The following are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples of vehicles covered by the definition of nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles: dirt bikes, all terrain vehicles, go-cart, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mopeds. It is the Agency's intent that engines used in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles and similar nonroad vehicles meet the standards. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also the Agency's intent that on-highway motorcycles with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacements less than 50 cc (3.1 cu. in.) meet the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Standards. EPA proposes that all motorcycles sold in California meet a 0.8 g/km standards for HC, a 0.8 g/km standard for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 g/km standard for carbon monoxide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification data from current technology on highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles indicates that over 50 percent of these motorcycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are certifying to exhaust HC emission levels at or below 0.8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g/km HC. EPA believes that by using existing on-highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycle technology it is reasonable to expect that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles should be able to achieve comparable emission levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for HC. The Agency understands that an 0.8 g/km standard may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require substitution of 4-stroke nonroad engines for 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines currently used in dirt bikes, ATVs, and similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. However, EPA is also aware that catalyst technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists and is currently being applied to 2-stroke motorcycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mopeds sold in other countries to meet stringent legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions levels in those countries. EPA believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple oxidation technology is viable for reducing emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from engines used in both on-highway and nonroad motorcycles to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 0.8 g/km HC and 0.8 g/km NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has considered a 0.5 g/km HC standard for on-highway motorcycles and takes comment on restricting emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from on-highway motorcycles to this more stringent level and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicability of this standard to the smaller displacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-highway motorcycles under 50 cc (3.1 cu. in.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the test data on NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from motorcycles is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more limited, experience with light duty cars suggests that with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a catalyst, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission levels are approximately equal to HC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels. In addition, legal emission levels for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles in Taiwan, beginning in 1996, will be 0.8 g/km for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Testing data submitted by one catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer shows that HC+NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  levels range between 0.30 g/km  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1.88 g/km. The Agency realizes that there is a trade-off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between HC emission and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission and solicits comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of setting a combined standard of 1.6 g/km for HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also realizes that less emission data exists for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines used in nonroad motorcycles and solicits data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from manufacturers as a basis for evaluating the level of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Certification and Test Procedure. EPA proposes that the test procedure for on-highway and nonroad motorcycles will be the same as that procedure described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart F. EPA acknowledges that the test procedure described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart F, in general is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed on a dynamometer designed for two-wheeled motorcycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that many motorcycles as defined above have more than two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wheels. The test procedure described in 40 CFR part 86 subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F, involves testing motorcycles as whole vehicles on chassis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamometers designed for two-wheeled motorcycles, driving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same driving cycle (vehicle speed versus time) that is used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cars and light trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current Federal regulations contain a general provision for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA to authorize special test procedures for vehicles which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be properly tested under the standard procedures. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it is appropriate to test all of the new motorcycles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and engines included in today's proposal as whole vehicles under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this same procedure used for current motorcycles. The special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure provision would be applied as necessary to test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any vehicles which cannot be physically tested using current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycle dynamometers. For example, vehicles having more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one drive wheel on an axle exceeding the width of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycle dynamometer rolls might be tested using normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passenger car chassis dynamometers, or motorcycle dynamometers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with specially widened rolls. Vehicles with multiple drive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> axles would be handled, as much as possible, like four-wheel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drive passenger cars and light trucks are currently tested, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the power supplied through only one primary drive axle. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the foregoing adaptations of the currently available motorcycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and passenger car chassis dynamometers cannot be applied, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would expect to apply special procedures involving directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connecting the drive axle to a dynamometer, driven at an axle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speed that corresponds to the required vehicle speed. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comments on the test procedures outlined in 40 CFR,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart F, and its applicability to four-wheeled nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorcycles. EPA specifically requests comments on J1088 as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative test procedure. For J1088 and other alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures suggested, EPA specifically requests data to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlation between the stringency of the proposed standards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured on the test procedure defined in 40 CFR, Subpart F, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any test suggested by commentors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

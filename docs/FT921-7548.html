			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Plea over shop price claims is rejected THE government yesterday rejected proposals by an advisory committee for stricter curbs on shops that make misleading price claims and bogus special offers, Guy de Jonquieres writes. The government's decisions, spelled out in a speech by Mr Edward Leigh, the consumer affairs minister, were criticised by the Retail Consortium, the retail industry trade association, the government-backed National Consumer Council and the Institute of Trading Standards Administration. The committee set up by the Department of Trade and Industry to monitor the largely voluntary scheme to prevent misleading price claims concluded that it was being evaded. The committee recommended that the scheme be backed by legally enforceable regulations. Mr Leigh said that the government was not convinced that more detailed regulations would be effective.</p>

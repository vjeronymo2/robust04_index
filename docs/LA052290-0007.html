			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES, PUBLIC PLACES;  </P> <P> A PARK THAT PRESERVES GENTLE DAYS  </P> <P> Every morning, a rickety camper turns off La Cienega Boulevard into Baldwin  Hills and putters up to a lake set into a hillside covered in eucalyptus,  sycamores, pine trees and white alder. Across the hill, nodding oil pumps keep  up their ghostly rhythm and a Chevron plant smolders and snorts. But here, in  Kenneth Hahn Park, there is only the sound of robins, starlings and blackbirds  calling, of ducks splashing into the water, of a stream rushing headlong over  rocks into the lake. And Henry Crosby, a large, gnarled and solid man, is going  fishing as usual.  </P> <P> The park is full of flowers these days: pyracanthus bushes aflame, fields of  clover and daisies, banks of orange and purple. Fat and glossy birds bathe in  the stream, catfish hide in the dark reeds. In the distance, men grapple  clumsily with garden hoes and hedge trimmers; newcomers, on referral from the  courts, doing time here instead of in jail, drawn in by the calm clock of the  earth.  </P> <P> It is a park for men who came from somewhere else -- from dark, crowded rooms  in city streets below, but also from other worlds where the soil was all that  nourished a man. John Lindsay, the superintendent, learned in Mississippi how  to grow corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, peanuts and melon. Worrying over trees in  need of iron, sod to lay, bushes to plant, Bermuda grass to feed; this is how  he keeps faith with the father who sent him to college in hard times.  </P> <P> His helpers sign in, painfully and slowly; writing does not always come easily.  But in the early morning, the restrooms are scrubbed and sparkling, not a speck  lingers around the garbage cans. This place of still beauty created from scrub  and waste is a gift to be carefully tended. Police circle like stealthy lions  watching over a pride. This is a park of gentle days.  </P> <P> Its heart is the lake. Men on upturned 44-pound detergent pails, men on old  deck chairs, perched on rocks, standing easily, watching poles and the ripples  of wind on the water. Men gone fishing. A community of men under kind and  weathered hats; familiar as they are with the tiny signs of fish, they read in  each other the smallest signals of friendship. They listen to the wind, laugh  aloud -- huge hoops of laughter -- as one of their number lands a plastic bag,  and chuck beneath the chin the small grandchildren and daughters of their  cousins' cousins. Some sit close, chomping, chewing, chatting, poking for worms  in battered old fishing boxes. Watercolors from the old South; pictures from  long ago.  </P> <P> And, as the sun warms the hillside, Henry Crosby dozes in his sagging chair,  knowing that, should a stranger approach, his geese will hiss, warn and  threaten the unexpected outsider. Henry's geese come waddling off the lake as  soon as they see his camper turn into the parking lot. They are the companions  of his day, never more than yards away. When the catfish skulk, he stands in  the clear air, stroking the great, soft breasts of his geese who crane their  long necks in delight. Someone stole one of Henry's geese a while back. The  other goose pined, and Henry thought his heart would break. The lake's  fishermen worried with him. One night, weeks later, the goose was put back: joy  abounded.  </P> <P> Three times a month -- not nearly often enough, grumble the regulars -- trucks  rumble in from the fishery to feed 320 pounds of catfish into the lake. Next  morning, there is hardly place for a man to stand. How does word get around?  "I'll tell you, you tell me, I'll tell him," says Henry. The camaraderie of the  lake.  </P> <P> Most fish for their dinner. "I don't like fish much. I don't eat them much,"  says Henry. "I just like to catch them. I just like to be watching the pole and  pulling on something." He is here before 8, leaves when he gets hungry. He  fishes in the heat and fishes in the rain. At 77, he cannot remember a time  when he didn't fish.  </P> <P> He was born in South Carolina, son of a cement man. He went to work as a boy  and ran away at 9. "It was about 30 years before I let them know where I was.  I'm pretty sure they worried. They needn't of." Fishing and cement: They have  been his life. In his pocket, this gruff and warm man carries a card marking 40  years membership in the plasterers' and cement masons' union. He is retired  now, his hearing shot. Now he knows only the peaceful life of the lake, the  fierce fight of the catfish. "I've caught a 12-pounder and seen some bigger  than that." Bigger than that -- the cry of fishing men, watching water, as men  have since time immemorial.  </P> <P> "This is where you find the nice people," says Henry. "Down at the water.  People who fish are friendly, and if you don't fish -- why, you miss a whole  lot of relaxing."  </P> <P> There are many ways to tell the story of this city; this is one of the nicer  ways.  </P></p>

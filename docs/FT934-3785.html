			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (2): In pursuit of 'even' growth - The economy, expansion continues unabated / Thailand has shrugged off the gloom in its main export markets When Thais talked about a 'slowdown' last year, they meant that real economic growth had dipped to just over seven per cent annually. Now they are talking about a 'recovery'. Like other fast-growing economies in south-east Asia, Thailand has shrugged off the gloom in its main export markets, a gloom particularly evident in Europe and Japan. Total Thai export growth will slow to an estimated nine or ten per cent this year - compared to the official forecast of 15 per cent - but that is a result of lower agricultural commodity prices; exports of electronic goods and other manufactured products are still rising strongly. Economic growth has in any case been driven largely by increasing domestic activity and consumption. Government agencies are predicting real gross domestic product growth of at least 7.5 per cent this year (compared to 7.3 per cent in 1992), rising to nearly eight per cent next year. 'The domestic economy has been the engine of this year's growth,' says Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, in an interview. 'As GDP per capita rises above a certain level, you begin to have synergy and dynamism in the internal market.' Mr Tarrin is anxious to see the Uruguay round of world trade talks successfully concluded by the end of this year to ensure relatively open markets for Thailand's exports, but he has few reasons to be worried about the overall state of the domestic economy. Thailand enjoys a perennial budget surplus (although Mr Tarrin points out that the Thai budget does not include the operations of large state enterprises which use deficit-financing), while low food and crude oil prices have kept inflation remarkably subdued during a period of such high growth. By the end of the year, inflation should be between 3.6 and 3.7 per cent, Mr Tarrin says. Thai concerns about falling investment over the past two years, and about the competition for investment funds from other booming Asian economies such as China and Vietnam, have been allayed by a recent sharp rise in applications to the Board of Investment (BOI). Project applications were worth Bt524.74bn in 1990, falling to Bt281.99bn in 1991 and Bt213.07bn in 1992. But since the second quarter of this year, the sheaf of applications at the BOI's headquarters in Bangkok has growth more thick month by month, and the value of applications reached Bt201.96bn in the nine months to September. Japanese companies are among the most active investors. The strength of the yen, and the attractiveness of the Thai domestic market with its 70m inhabitants, has prompted Japanese multinationals such as Toyota to expand existing operations; smaller Japanese concerns - component manufacturers, for example - are also seeking cheaper locations away from their home base. One Japanese bank in Bangkok is said to be dealing with more than 70 Japanese companies investigating opportunities in Thailand. Bankers say that rising foreign direct investment, and a burst of portfolio investment into the stock exchange, have helped to produce a surge of liquidity in the Thai economy since the third quarter, forcing down interest rates. The trend towards lower rates has been accentuated by the current vogue for listed Thai companies to raise money through issuing 'Euroconvertible' debentures denominated in US dollars. The Thai financial authorities, ever watchful of inflation and concerned about the low savings rate (private saving was 21 per cent of GDP in 1992), are ready to push up interest rates next year if necessary. In the meantime, the government is planning a number of economic reforms to improve the international competitiveness both of Thai industry and of the financial sector, a process accelerated by US demands for more access to the services business in developing countries. 'Industrialisation will not hold the total key to our future,' says Mr Tarrin, the former president of Siam Commercial Bank. 'Trade and finance and the service sectors will play a very important role.' Banking, hitherto dominated by the 15 listed Thai commercial banks, will be gradually liberalised, partly by allowing offshore banking licence holders under the new Bangkok International Banking Facility to increase the scope of their activities. For the industrial sector, the government is proffering both a carrot and a stick. Import tariffs for raw materials are to be lowered, but there will also be gradual reductions in tariffs for finished and semi-finished goods in the years ahead. 'What you will see in the longer term - say three years from now - is a much freer market, much more vibrant imports,' says Mr Tarrin. 'Yet you'll begin to see more investments taking advantage of this and turning it around to exports.' Another government priority is to narrow the gap between rich and poor, a field in which Thailand has been notably less successful than its south-east Asian neighbours; wealth is concentrated in Bangkok and on the nearby eastern seaboard, and hundreds of thousands of people from poor farming families in the north-east migrate to the capital to find work as factory workers, domestic servants or prostitutes. 'We have a situation where 60 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture, but agriculture produces maybe 13 to 14 per cent of our GDP now. That tells you right away that our income gap is huge,' says Mr Tarrin. The centralisation of industry and commerce around Bangkok has also caused problems for businesses and residents in the form of traffic congestion and pollution. But the announcement in April of enhanced BOI incentives for investors in 'zone three' areas away from Bangkok and its environs (zones one and two) appears to be bearing fruit. According to Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BOI secretary general, 60 per cent of the applications from potential investors received in the first 10 months of this year indicated an intention to locate factories in zone three - 'we are encouraging the relocation of existing industry in zones one and two,' he says. Rapid economic growth in Thailand seems likely to continue unabated, but the government wants to avoid the mistakes of its predecessors and ensure that wealth and jobs are spread throughout the country. 'We will not pursue a high growth policy, says Mr Tarrin. 'We will pursue an even growth policy.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Balance of payments in million baht  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1990            1991           1992**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade balance                  -255,137        -247,618         -205,380 (as percentage of GDP)   -12.4 per cent  -10.4 per cent    -7.6 per cent Merchandise exports, fob     583,206         720,545          815,202 Merchandise imports, cif*     832,604         963,879        1,015,495 Non-monetary gold imports         5,739           4,284            5,086  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note:  * = total imports adjusted for balance of payments coverage, official gold imports and otner imports; ** indicates 1992 provisional estimates; data source: Bank of Thailand  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

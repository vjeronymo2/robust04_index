			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 14  April.    Pluspetrol executives said a well drilled in the Ramos area  of Salta Province has yielded a record production of 1.5 million  cubic meters per day. This is one of the most productive wells  in the continent. With five wells in operation, the gas field  already produces 6 million cubic meters per day, about 8 percent  of the country's total gas production. The drilling required a  $10 million investment. The Ramos gas field's proven reserves  total 100 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in  Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8)    The discovery of a large gas field by Total, a French oil  company, in the Southern Basin might increase the national gas  production rate 20 to 25 percent. The drilling of two wells  into the Carina offshore structure, 70 km off shore Tierra del  Fuego Province, has been successful, yielding between 470,000  and 485,000 cubic meters of gas per day. After the new  discovery, the basin's probable reserves might range between 120  and 150 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in  Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8)    With the goal of curbing public spending and improving the  honest and efficient use of state funds, the executive branch  limited, through Decree No. 502, the ministers' powers to  allocate and implement their respective appropriations. This  was reported by Budget Under Secretary Marcos Makon, who  explained that the decree signed by President Menem on 8 April  establishes, among other measures, that the budget cannot be  increased, even if there is more income, and there cannot be any  reallocations unless there is a specific national executive  branch decree.

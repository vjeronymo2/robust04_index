			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Associate Hwang Kum-chol, PhD] </F>   [Text] The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the  following:    "Today, our reality is filled with numerous renovations  and miracles unknown in any other time in history"    Huichon is a place of deep significance, well known in the  history of our nations machine industry and among our people.    Surrounded by the lofty peaks of Chogyu Pass, and the  Myohyang and Pinandok mountain ranges -- 1,000 meters above sea  level -- the Huichon Basin is the location of Huichon, the  leader of our country's machine industry.    Although it is unknown when people started living here,  historically, various names for this place have been recorded.  It is said that during the Koryo period a wisong (a majestic  castle for stopping the invasions of Japanese pirates) was built  here, and that afterward it was maintained as a fortress, called  Chongsaejin. The village there had been called Wiju, but later  the name was changed to Huiju. It was given this name to signify  that it was a village whose exploits in driving off the Japanese  pirates were glorious. Later, during the Yi Dynasty period, it  was called Huiju County, but this was later changed to Huichon  County. From this historical data, we can know that Huichon has  had a long history since ancient times.    The reason the history of this place is so long, and the  reason our ancestors ended up living here, evidently, is that a  large part of life here is generally related to the Chongchon  River and the favorable conditions of the river basin.    Looking at the natural conditions of Huichon, we can say  that  generally it forms a large basin.    Therefore, there are many high mountains and passes  surrounding it. Representative of these, the Chokyu Pass  mountain range stretches out in the north; the Myohyang Mountain  range, in the south; following the border with adjacent  counties, in the north is Taebawui Mountain, Kwangtae Peak,  Yonmok Mountain, Myongmun Ridge [Kogae], and Tuchop Mountain; in  the east is Ubi Mountain, Taeam Mountain, Onmu Mountain, Somun  Peak, and Mudong Peak; in the south is Piro Peak, which is the  main peak of the Myohyang Mountain Range, Hyangno Peak, Popwang  Peak, and Saskas Peak; and to the west is Paehwa Mountain and  Cholsan Mountain.    In Huichon also flow large and small rivers and streams: the  Chongchon River and its tributaries, the Huichon River,  Chisin-chon, Myongmun-chon, and Pyongwon-chon.    The watercourses have clear, clean water. Here are many  silver fish, carp, cornet fish, yare, and other fishes. Not only  this, but the watercourses have a large volume and the  conditions whereby a head can be obtained, making them favorable  for water-power generation. They raise the scenic beauty of the  city and are actively used for industry and irrigation.    Huichon also has famous mineral springs, including Kwandae,  Myongdae, Chongnyang, and Chongsang Mineral Springs.    It belongs to the area with the warmest climate conditions  in  Chagang Province.    Given these natural, geographic conditions, it can be said  that our home has conditions favorable for economic development.    However, in the past, Huichon was a backward, slash-and-burn  agricultural zone, in which slash-and-burn fields were reclaimed  and planted with millet, wheat, and potatoes. At that time,  therefore, there were only a few blacksmith's shops and  individual, manual breweries.    Thus, before liberation, would anyone have dreamt that our  home would become a center of the machine-manufacturing  industry, as it is today? Huichon was able to become a  machine-manufacturing center, and the pride of the nation, as a  result of the wise leadership of the Fatherly Leader and the  Dear Leader.    Already foreseeing the victorious future amid the shellfire  of the stern Fatherland Liberation War, the Great Leader  revealed the shining path of chuche economic development for the  long-term future of the fatherland.    Saying that if we are to build the nation's strong, chuche  industry, we must first develop a machine-tool industry, which  is central to the machine-manufacturing industry, the Great  Leader personally chose the site of a machine-tool factory here  in Huichon, with its close power-supply base and its convenient  traffic situation, and solved all problems presented by factory  construction. Thus, amid the flames of war a machine-tool  factory suddenly stood strongly on Huichon land.    The great history of change began in Huichon at that time.    Thus, the glory of the "Mother Factory" shown in Huichon  during the periods of postwar reconstruction and basic socialist  construction, and the history of our nation's first machine-tool  industry was created. In the early 1970s, lifting high the torch  of the Three Technical Revolutions, the whole production process  was reorganized into a great specialized system, capable of  giving birth to the miracle of making 1,000 machine tools per  month, or over 10,000 per year, if so desired by the Great  Leader and the Dear Leader.    The Dear Leader took a hand, leading our city Huichon, so as  to strengthen and develop it, making it our country's  machine-industry city.    Visiting the factory on 26 February 1967, the Dear Leader  showed workers his unlimited confidence and clearly revealed the  road ahead for the factory.    The Dear Leader solved all our problems, great and small, so  that Huichon will play an important part in the development of  our nation's machine industry.    Huichon was able to change as it has today because of the  wise leadership of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader.    This is so, even if we only look at a few of the facts.    Industry developed in Huichon. The machine industry makes up  about 70 percent of its total industrial output. Of this, it  makes up about 80 percent of central industries.    It is no accident, therefore, that our city is called a  modern, machine-industry city.    Its site chosen personally by the Great Leader amid the  flames of war and guided by him, Huichon Machine Tool Federated  Industries [Huichon Kongjak Kigye Yonhap Kiopso] is widely known  in our country as a base of machine-tool production.    Already lifting high the torch of the Three Technical  Revolutions in the early 1970s leading the nation, this factory  has brought truly spectacular development.    The corps of machines, linked, spread out along the  automated  line, is just like a machine sea. Regardless of whether one goes  to the sites of the remotely controlled, cast-iron production  process, the lathe-bead automated line, the apron-manufacturing  automated line, the support [patchigae] assembly line, or the  sites of casting, manufacturing, or assembly processes, all are  modern.    Equipment, such as automated lines, programmed lathes,  multipurpose milling machine, drill press, plaining machine, and  so on, produced in the factory, and the newest machine tools are  being sent to machine factories and the factories of various  sectors of the people's economy all over the country.    Their quality high, products manufactured here are also  meeting with foreign approval. Thus, they make up an important  part in our country's machine-tool exports.    The factory is equipped with a research center and  experimental laboratories fitted with the newest equipment in  keeping with the demands of modern scientific and technological  development.    Today, as the factory changes into a large-scale,  machine-tool production base, it is developing into a more  modern facility of a world-class scale.    No matter where one goes in Huichon, one hears the sonorous  sounds of the working equipment of the machine corps, well known  as our country's machine-industry city.    Together with industrial production, the appearance of the  city has changed drastically.    Enter its streets, stores, or the homes of its workers and  they are full of the sound of happy laughter.    The streets Namchon-kori and Chupyong-kori are formed  following the banks of the Huichon River, with multi-floored  houses lining up along it. Unable to even think of college  during the Liberation War, the Huichon Industrial College, the  Machine College, and technical schools have appeared in our city  and are raising men talented in machine-industry technology.    Is that all? A modern cultural center, library, sports  complex, department store, hospital, medical clinic, sanitarium,  and recuperation center were created under the benevolent  affection of the Dear Leader.    Also, what of the support facilities for the workers of  Huichon?    There are vegetable gardens equipped with sprinkler  irrigation equipment. There is a prairie-chicken factory  producing several million chicken and quail eggs and large  quantities of meat a year, a duck factory producing tens of  thousands of duck eggs and over a thousand tons of meat, and  even a deer ranch.    Although only wild pears were seen in the past, Huichon now  has a fruit-production base, producing a great deal of all kinds  of fruits, including pears, apples, peaches, and grapes.    It can truly be said that wherever one goes in today's  Huichon, it is full of pride and overflowing with joy.</p>

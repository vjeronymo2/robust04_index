			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the Brasilia Bureau] </F>   [Text] Former Sao Paulo State Governor Orestes Quercia  last week opened the battle against the so-called Gaucho Group  [from Rio Grande do Sul State] to obtain predominance within the  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The Gaucho Group is  headed by Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul State]),  the government's leader in the Senate. The Gaucho Group  supports the candidacy of former Social Security Minister  Antonio Britto in the upcoming presidential elections.    The Quercia faction has been strengthened by former  President  Jose Sarney's announcement that he will stay in the PMDB.  Harassed in the PMDB and believing he had lost Quercia's  support, Sarney had tried to launch his candidacy for president  through the PP [Popular Party], PFL [Liberal Front Party], PTB  [Brazilian Labor Party], and even through the PL [Liberal  Party], but he was not accepted by any of these parties.    On 15 January, the Quercia and Sarney factions will resume  their old alliance and will announce their intention of getting  the PMDB to break with the government. This was announced  during a luncheon at Sarney's home.</p>

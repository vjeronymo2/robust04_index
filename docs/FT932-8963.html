			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Books: The fall of a paper tiger PAPER DREAMS by Stephen Glover Jonathan Cape, Pounds 17.99, 328 pages STEPHEN GLOVER makes the foundation of The Independent newspaper sound such larky fun that, at first, it seems difficult to explain why it all ended in tears. As he acknowledges, Glover was lucky that his two co-founders, Matthew Symonds and Andreas Whittam Smith, were more dedicated and knowledgeable about newspapers - he himself could not distinguish between a wholesaler and a retailer or between circulation and readership. Fortunately, too, the obsessional Symonds and the languid Glover were led by Whittam Smith, who was not only older but also enjoyed considerable City credibility as the long-serving City Editor of The Daily Telegraph. The book provides a vivid insider's view of the foundation of the paper: the refusal of Lord Hartwell to consider Whittam Smith's idea of asking readers to refinance the Telegraph; the example set by Eddy Shah; the crucial involvement of Saatchi and Saatchi; the identification of the 'missing readership' which could be satisfied by a new paper; and the choice of the name. They were also lucky: for the paper was launched at the height of the boom a few months after Rupert Murdoch moved his papers to Wapping, which resulted in a 'rush of applicants' from The Times and The Sunday Times. 'Mr Murdoch may have regarded these journalists as ideologically unsound, and he may have been overjoyed to be rid of them. But they included many of his best journalists.' The story is dominated by the way that 'Andy Smith, (Whittam Smith) turned down for officer training during National Service because he supposedly did not have leadership qualities' was transformed into a charismatic entrepreneur who 'could have been a Nobel laureate in conviction, able to persuade dozens of City institutions to invest in the first serious paper to be launched in well over a century.' But his contribution was not only financial and managerial - even Glover, turned sour by his experiences, admits that Whittam Smith was always on the side of the reader, and credits him with some notable touches, notably the paper's imaginative use of black and white photographs. Astonishingly, the City did not worry at the founders' lack of managerial expertise, or, even more crucially, of any real experience of hard news reporting. Glover points up the City's obsession with form, the obsessional verification of every financial and legal detail at the expense of content - the founders' capacity to undertake their adventure was seemingly taken for granted by the financial community. The resulting paper was one of the defining events of the 1980s, demonstrating the can-do atmosphere of the times, the ability of the young to translate dreams into practice. Interestingly, Symonds defined the paper as mixing 'the politics of the extreme centre' with a preference for 'free market solutions to economic problems and a responsible liberalism on social issues,' an attitude shared by The Economist, another publication run largely by talented and arrogant youngsters. Glover's laid-back, semi-detached attitude makes him an admirable chronicler, but proved a disaster when, as seemed natural, he became editor of the Independent on Sunday, founded just as the recession was biting. But here I must declare an interest: to adapt a phrase I was 'an unpaid acting lance-corporal in the stage army of the good' commanded by General Glover and can thus compare his account with the way it seemed in the front line. As so often, the view from the trench is profoundly at variance with the despatches of the commander-in-chief, with their obsessional, self-justifying concentration on the political manoeuvrings at the top rather than on the progress of the war. Thanks to the success of the daily, the Sunday paper enjoyed a flying start, building up a colossal head of steam - which soon evaporated. To the troops Glover seemed to lack the energy, the enthusiasm, the decisiveness, the clarity of vision as to the message he wished to convey and the audience he wished to address, qualities common to all good editors. As Whittam Smith kept repeating, the paper did not 'create enough noise.' To make matters worse Glover surrounded himself with similar characters. His deputy, Sebastian Faulks, was a stylish novelist and feature writer but without any apparent interest in the actual editing process. The top brass as a whole formed what the troops termed the 'meeting' or 'strolling' classes, spending half their time in interminable, indecisive meetings, and the other half strolling down the open office which housed the hacks, for all the world behaving like overseers in a trireme looking down their patrician noses at the rows of galley slaves. I am afraid that General Glover is deluding himself when he says that it was 'an exceptionally happy paper.' Matters improved when Faulks was replaced by Stephen Fay, an energetic former Sunday Times man with a flair for choosing and inspiring younger journalists. But the combination of the recession and Glover's inadequacy made a crisis inevitable: in the summer of 1991 the daily and the Sunday were largely merged and he left. Since then the Sunday has flourished under a new editor, Ian Jack. Unfortunately, Glover is bitter in defeat: at no point does he face the fact that justice was done. As he puts it: 'An editor should be allowed to edit unless he were thought not to be up to the job.' Quite so.</p>

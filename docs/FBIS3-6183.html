(Choe Han-chun), councillor of the DPRK Embassy in Beijing,  said that the inspection team demanded that it take samples from  one facility, but the North Korean authorities rejected this  move, calling it an unjust demand.    Councillor Choe said that there was a slight dispute in the  process of inspection, but that it is not serious. He also  claimed that this can be resolved through dialogue between North  Korea and the IAEA.</p>

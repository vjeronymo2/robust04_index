			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / The Queen's Awards For Export and Technology 1991 (Company Profiles): Vision of a world covered in chocolate - Cadbury Schweppes CADBURY SCHWEPPES sees its future in global terms. 'We have retained a tight focus on our two business streams, beverages and confectionery, which we have continued to develop by a combination of organic growth, targeted acquisitions and partnerships,' said Sir Graham Day, the chairman, in the last annual report. The company's Queen's Award for Export Achievement is a reflection of this strategy in the chocolate business, part of the confectionery stream. Within the group organisation, this particular company is responsible, through Cadbury International, another subsidiary, for marketing chocolate abroad - by direct exports from the UK, by direct investment in overseas markets, by joint ventures with local companies in particular markets and through franchising. Broadly, Cadbury Schweppes International has two strands of revenue: from direct sales and from dividends and royalties. Concerned about its competitive position, the group does not separate chocolate sales from general confectionery sales in any single market or group of markets. Direct exports of chocolate from the UK, however, are worth nearly one-third of domestic chocolate sales. Markets served by direct exports include some European countries, the Caribbean and the Far East. In 1990, total group confectionery sales came to Pounds 1.32bn, of which the UK share was just over half. But there were sales of Pounds 195.6m in Europe, Pounds 30.2m in North and South America, Pounds 290.3m in the the Pacific Rim and Pounds 91.2m in Africa and elsewhere. Confectionery produced a trading profit of Pounds 163m, with the UK again accounting for slightly more than half, while Pounds 19.3m came from Europe, Pounds 8.9m from the Americas, Pounds 42.3m from the Pacific Rim and Pounds 9.2m from Africa and elsewhere. This stream of the Cadbury Schweppes business therefore produced nearly 49 per cent of group trading profits, which totalled Pounds 333.9m. Group pre-tax profits for 1990 were Pounds 280m, or 14 per cent higher than in 1989. The Cadbury business works with a high degree of decentralisation. The ownership and general management of the brand names works through the two business streams but the operational control, country by country, is done on a local basis. The stream managers develop the products, the operational managers are responsible for sales. Business techniques differ from country to country, depending on the commercial conditions. Cadbury works through associated companies (joint ventures with local groups) in, for example, Nigeria, India, Zimbabwe and Egypt, but has wholly owned operating subsidiaries in Ireland, France, Spain and the Netherlands. The group is also seeking penetration of the US and Canadian markets through partnerships with, respectively, Hershey and Neilson. With such a spread of interests, performance varies. Last year Ireland was good, Spain developed along predicted lines, the Netherlands traded well, but France was difficult. Returns were higher from Australia and New Zealand while companies in Malaysia and Indonesia turned in good performances. However, a drive into Middle Eastern markets was thwarted by the Gulf crisis and, as the last annual report put it, 'resources were quickly deployed elsewhere'. Last year's trading was abnormal to the extent that considerable energy was devoted to absorbing acquisitions made the previous year. This was not only a question of management but also of finances, as moves were taken to translate short term debt into longer term funding to reflect the international spread of interests. One aim, as the group said, was to 'match overseas borrowings with overseas assets and currency flows'. The group's global aspirations found their financial concomitant in, for example, preference share issues in the US and Canada, and an Australian dollar Eurobond issue. For the future, Cadbury Schweppes will continue to seek acquisitions and expand organically on both the confectionery and beverages sides of the business. The group is confident that the market for chocolate and chocolate-related products will continue to expand.</p>

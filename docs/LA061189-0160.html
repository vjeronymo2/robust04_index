			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMOKE FELLS 14 SAILORS IN SHIP FIRE  </P> <P> Fourteen sailors suffered smoke inhalation when a Navy helicopter carrier  caught fire in Long Beach Naval Station, but there was no serious damage to the  ship.  </P> <P> The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter carrier, caught  fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said.  </P> <P> The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where a cable from  shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of the fire was not known, but  an investigation was under way.  </P> <P> Damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke inhalation were  treated and returned to duty Saturday morning, Chesser said.  </P> <P> The fire was put out by 10:30 p.m., less then twenty minutes after it was  discovered, and repairs to the ship will be made by the crew.  </P> <P> The Peleliu had recently returned from sea operations, but Chesser did not know  the nature of the assignment. The ship normally has a crew of 900.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Panta Dzambazovski: "Who Will Pass the Second </F> Barrier?"]    [Text] Macedonia has lived in a politically pluralistic  atmosphere for almost four years, since the moment the political  parties were formed. This small area of around 26,000 square  kilometers, with its population of just over 2 million, has  demonstrated an enormous interest in political and party  politics. Almost unbelievable: According to official data from  the registration services of political parties and movements in  the Republic of Macedonia, 58 political parties and seven  associations of a political nature had been registered by  October 1993.    Yet interest in party membership or affiliations is  decreasing after years of meetings, rallies, and gatherings,  following the initial national and political euphoria.  Television coverage of parliamentary sessions are further proof  of this -- initially, the programs were more popular than soccer  or light entertainment programs, and the debates, the repeats,  and the "jokes" were retold at home, in the street, and in  cafes. However, today it may be concluded that these programs  are no longer popular and that basic political interest is a  thing of the past.  <H5>  The Dangerous Years -- Perfect Tranquility </H5>   Nonetheless, in this relatively short democratic period of  four years, parties with influence and a proper image, with  their large memberships and affiliations among the citizens,  have proliferated. Mainly, these consist of parties that caught  the "first train" to registration -- the SDSM [Social Democratic  Alliance of Macedonia], the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian  National Unity], the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity], and  the LP (formerly Reformist Forces -- now the Liberal Party], and  they won most seats in the first pluralist Macedonian  Parliament. The MAAK [Movement for All-Macedonian Action] and  the League for Democracy, which were the first to hold  constituent assemblies (4 February and 11 February 1990),  although achieving a proper image (national and all-  encompassing) and affiliations, suffered a disaster at the  elections and since then their fall has continued in that  eternal and merciless void called politics. The Social  Democratic Party of Macedonia (the first party in Macedonia to  register), the Democratic Union-Peasants Party of Macedonia, the  Macedonian National Party, the Party of Yugoslavs in Macedonia,  the Labor Party, and some others created and registered in 1990,  although on the "first train," remained at the political  margins, while, despite their modest election results, the  Socialist Party and the National Democratic Party have kept a  constant level of support among their constituencies,  membership, and affiliates, and they retain a degree of  political influence. As for the other parties subsequently  created, only the Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia, the  Democratic Party of Macedonia, and the Democratic Party, created  last year, have remained in the ratings.    Macedonia has passed through the years of living  dangerously,  of war and peace, social disturbances, disorder, and chaos in  the world of transition, in accordance with its own historical,  political, geographic and strategic conditions, in relatively  perfect tranquility. The same refers to parliament, maintaining  its own standards, without early elections, something that is  probably far from praiseworthy but that certainly reflects the  situation in a state that was seen as one of the youngest states  in the world, but capable of dealing with internal and foreign  problems and frustrations.    Macedonian politics has displayed in the international arena  a temperate and constructive policy whose only problem is the  dispute with Greece, in which the angels are, in any case, on  our side. This conclusion can be seen by the Christmas  recognition of Macedonia on the eve of the Greek presidency of  the European Community.    As for domestic policy, Macedonia has a number of its own  problems and unsolved frustrations that need to be settled in  the course of time. It has to do, first of all, with the social  sector. Our international state interests are not visibly  imperiled by the domestic political scene, because these have to  be viewed within the framework of foreign policy. It is not  possible to expect radical shifts, regardless of who might come  to power after the second parliamentary and presidential  elections to be held this year, because part of the Macedonian  strategy has been built on the basis of Macedonian Balkan  equidistance, the maintenance and reinforcement of Macedonia's  independence and neutrality. It can now be seen that the idea  of Macedonia as a country of peace and stability internally and  regionally has become dominant and that it will be difficult to  foster radical or nationalist ideas.  <H5>  Basic Political Issues </H5>   Going back to the political party scene in Macedonia, and  bearing in mind the foreign policy of our state and its  international recognition, one must inevitably take into account  certain political processes that might affect the state's future  political profile. Namely, as the time of national euphoria  passes, which has set the Balkans on fire and is still burning  in its central parts, the reverse process has begun in our  state. It is a process toward abandoning national and  nationalist engagement and turning toward everyday life. It is  the everyday life of dealing with basic questions requiring  precise answers and precise political engagement.    The year 1993 is very illustrative in explaining this  process. Namely, a number of events took place to indicate this  process. A number of parties were burdened with internal poison  and divisions. These parties had nationalist programs or  engaged in effectively nationalist political activities. The  past year saw, as was mostly exposed by the media, a division  within the largest party of the Albanians in Macedonia, the PDP.  In effect, the PDP used only half of its strength last year on  purely party politics and within the government coalition.    In practice, all its activities were limited by the  political realities in a country in which nationalism did not  win through, and in which such a nationalist party, through its  exponents (ministers and delegates), could see how far the  highest ladders could go -- to the negotiations with mediator  Arens, where the real and demanded possibilities remained  somewhere in the middle. [sentence as published] The radical  wing of the Tetovo branch, headed by Menduh Taci, appeared as a  reaction to these activities, threatening to withdraw from the  institutions of the political system if the nationalist demands  of the Albanians were not met, but declining to offer a concrete  political platform. The two opposing factions politically  divided the Albanian population, something that could also  divide the party and jeopardize the campaign of the Albanian  parties in the forthcoming elections.    The Democratic Party of Turks of Macedonia [DPTM], another  nationalist party, is experiencing serious disunity. Unlike the  situation within the PDP, the current president of the DPTM,  Erdogan Sarach, has been accused of radicalism by the party's  Skopje branch. Calls for the Turks to leave Macedonia, the  events in Zupa, and reports that genocide against the Turks is  in progress in the eastern parts of the country are the main  arguments for the branch's opposition to the party leadership.  The party's general assembly is expected to bring the matter to  a conclusion -- determining whether the populist or the civic  concept will prevail in this party, whose membership is drawn  exclusively from the Turkish minority in Macedonia.  <H5>  Disunity Before the Elections </H5>   The question of whether the political disposition of the  Serbs in Macedonia is seriously influenced by the political  forces of its northern neighbor will be answered in the course  of this year. The beginning of 1992 saw the Democratic Party of  Serbs registered. Many divisions, and political and national  pluralism interlocked within the party. The party's president,  Boro Ristic, successfully led the party until the signing of the  agreement with the Macedonian Government, through the mediation  of Arens, when there emerged a definite division within the  party between those in favor of Serbian national unity and those  in favor of "settling down" and accepting a minority status in  line with European standards. It is yet to be seen whether the  radical current headed by the new president of the DPS, Dragisa  Miletic, will unite the Serbs in one party and with one idea,  although all the internal circumstances suggest that there will  certainly be political disunity within this population, too.    The Muslim party, the SDA [Party for Democratic Action] has  experienced similar disunity. The faction of the first  president of this party, Sadrija Hasanovic, has continued to  follow the majority of its genuine principles, while another SDA  faction has emerged, led by Rizvan Halilovic, as well as the  SDA-Islamic Road, located in Tetovo.    The VMRO-DPMNE must also be mentioned as a nationalist  party,  as its activities were determined by external political  processes -- the breakup of Yugoslavia, the emergence of  Macedonia as a state, and its road to international recognition.  This party is very interesting for political analysts. Despite  all the forecasts, it achieved success in the second round of  the elections. Nonetheless, it lost its chance (to use its  number of deputies) to form a parliamentary majority and then a  government. It seemed to be unable to deal with the reality of  the political circumstances and the election results because of  its nationalist concepts, and its escape from the political  realities became an integral part of its political platform.  However, this was the point where the differing internal party  interests collided, resulting in a bolstering of party factions,  whose independent activities reached a point where new parties  were formed as some factions deserted the party. First, the  vice president of VMRO-DPMNE, Vladimir Golubovski, formed the  VMRO-Democratic Party in 1991, and later the VMRO-Goce Delcev  (1992) and VMRO-United (1993) appeared, while the latest party  to be formed from a VMRO-DPMNE faction has been the  VMRO-Patriotic Party, located in Bitola and led by former Vice  President Dimitar Crnomarov, to which the deputy Mitko  Atanasovski is inclined. A number of VMRO-DPMNE members joined  the Ilinden-Free Democrats, which then became the Democratic  Party within the Pan-Macedonian Association of political  prisoners and those persecuted for the ideas of VMRO-Goce's. In  addition, some eminent VMRO-DPMNE members and district officials  went over to the Democratic Party led by former SDSM leader  Petar Gosev.    Party disunity may not be the preserve of the national  parties alone, but what is obvious is that party turmoil is  characteristic of them alone. The former leader of the SDSM,  Petar Gosev, failed to attract a single deputy or member of the  party leadership. Nor has the Liberal Party achieved any greater  success, either.    However, this year's elections will show the views of the  citizens of our state, as well as the state of the parties in  Macedonia. And the citizens' vote will certainly provide the  most accurate answers to all the questions put forward in this  article.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEY, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FAMOUS FOR REAL REASONS TOO  </P> <P> Your in-depth report (on "Famous for Being Famous") failed to mention Angelique  (I think that's her name) -- the Hollywood poster bimbo.  </P> <P> I remember reading or hearing somewhere that she has a manager to make her  famous. She's not an actress, not a major league ball player and doesn't  endorse a product to my knowledge. But she's aspiring to be famous.  </P> <P> What a country!  </P> <P> MICHAEL B. BRISON, San Diego  </P></p>

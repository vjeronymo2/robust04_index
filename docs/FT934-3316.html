			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds Textiles What an embarrassment. Just as Mr Martin Taylor tidies his desk to bustle off to Barclays he feels obliged to issue a profits warning at Courtaulds Textiles, knocking 10 per cent off its shares. Problems commissioning a new Aristoc hosiery factory, a further downward lurch in French demand and the slowing pace of the UK recovery have made a mockery of the upbeat noises coming from the company three months ago. How much of the shortfall was caused by a slippage of grip resulting from management changes is hard to gauge. But the principal factor was the familiar tale of an operationally-geared company suffering a disproportionate profits hit whenever sales disappoint. The fourth quarter is critical, since it normally accounts for 40 per cent of profits. Worries about the budget may have unsettled buyers of luxurious lingerie. Insofar as Courtaulds Textiles' recovery has been postponed a year, the scale of the stock market's reaction seems reasonable. But, at least, it was commendably swift in releasing the bad news through a formal statement. If other companies are similarly disappointed at the gradient of recovery and unnerved by heady share ratings, it is to hoped they have the courage to follow suit.</p>

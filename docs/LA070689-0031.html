			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Actor Woody Harrelson, who tends bar on the NBC series "Cheers," will be  re-opening tonight in two one-act plays at the Court Theatre in Hollywood,  where he also toiled last fall. One play is "2 on 2," which he also wrote, and  the other is Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story." Others returning from the earlier  production are Clint Allen, Brad Blaisdell, Rob Moran and director Larry  Gilman. Even though he will be going back to work on "Cheers" early in August,  Harrelson says he will complete the scheduled run of the one-acts through Aug.  13, having successfully managed to do both last fall. "Doing 'Cheers' and the  plays simultaneously is exhausting, but what it means for me is being able to  hear people laugh day and night, and that is sweet, sweet music," says the  actor.

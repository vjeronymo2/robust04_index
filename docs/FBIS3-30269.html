The rate at which they will  grow depends on how much is being invested in this bipolar  "generator of the development of every society." In the SFRY,  both these activities had full verbal support, and difficulties  came about only when money was supposed to be given. It seems  that "old habits die hard."    There are about 15,000 scientists and researchers (11,000 of  them with doctoral degrees) and 150 scientific entities  registered in Serbia: About 30 institutes have been founded by  the republic, a quarter of which (seven) are under the patronage  of Belgrade University. There was a list in the former  Yugoslavia with the names of 33,000 scientific workers (of this  number, only 4,000-5,000 people could justify holding this title  on the basis of OECD standards). At the end of December 1990,  it was announced that we do not lag behind the world in the  number of researchers, but the difference is seen the moment one  counts the number of computers, finds out what one day of a  researcher looks like, or establishes the money allocated per  scientist.    Unlike their colleagues from the European Community, who  spend 47 percent of their working hours on research, in our  country only every second researcher uses a third of his working  hours for research. According to the number of scientific works  in natural sciences published in internationally recognized  scientific journals, before the war broke out the SFRY was in  48th place out of 172 states. Of the European countries, only  Romania, Turkey and Albania were behind us. The situation was  even worse in the social sciences: 61st place with only Romania  and Albania behind us.    One can learn about the situation in science by the numbers  of patents granted in the research and development sector of the  economy. As a comparison, one should say that in 1986 alone, a  single Japanese firm claimed 28,200 patents, a that which the  enterprises from the territory of former Yugoslavia (if they  joined together again) would be able to reach in 158 years!    When the very ambitious federal Law on Financing Scientific  and Technological Development was passed last summer, experts  immediately saw that everything "remained just on paper" because  funds amounting to 0.002 percent of GNP do not suffice even for  small, let alone more serious, projects.    The embargo and other things have caused scientists to leave  the country en masse. According to unofficial data, 17-20  percent of people dealing with science have left the country in  the last two years alone.    It has been calculated that the "brain drain" alone will  reduce the GNP over the past two years by $30 billion. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: HK Telecom tops market hopes with 16% increase HONG Kong Telecom-munications, a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, announced net profits of HKDollars 3.17bn (USDollars 410m) for the six months to September, a 16 per cent increase from a year earlier. The results were above market expectations, with the bulk of growth coming from calls to China. China now accounts for 44 per cent of international turnover and accounted for 26 per cent of total international revenues. Hong Kong Telecom has the monopoly of domestic and international phone calls in the colony, but its dominant position is coming to an end with the domestic network opening up to competition in 1995 and the government forcing the company to lower its international tariffs from next year. Baring Securities is estimating 15 per cent growth in net profit for the year to March 1992, but if the tariff cuts are enforced from January 1, rather than the end of the fiscal year, it predicts only 12 per cent growth. Earnings growth will be reduced to single digits in 1994. Mr Michael Gale, chief executive, said recent meetings with Chinese telecommunications executives led him to expect further explosive growth in revenues with China. Call tariffs to China will not be affected by next year's reductions, which will focus on North America, Europe and Australasia. Average tariffs will be reduced by 8 per cent. Turnover was up 19 per cent to Dollars HK10.54bn at the interim stage. The company declared a 20.3 cent dividend, in line with its profit increase.</p>

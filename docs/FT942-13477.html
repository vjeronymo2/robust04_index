			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Business Travel: Move to reduce fares to Aberdeen An Aberdeen company hopes to win Civil Aviation Authority permission to set up low-cost flights to London Stansted. Aberdeen London Express (Alex) would offer a morning flight to Stansted (getting passengers to Liverpool Street by 9.30) and an evening flight back, operated by European Air Charters using a BAe 1-11, writes James Buxton. The venture is a challenge to British Airways and Air UK. Aberdonians and oil company executives have long complained about the lack of a shuttle between Heathrow and Aberdeen, and BA's fares, which include a Pounds 192 off-peak return and a Pounds 258 fully flexible return. Air UK has two flights a day to Stansted and back. Alex, which intends to start in June, would charge Pounds 60 single and Pounds 120 return. It is hoping for oil company block-bookings.</p>

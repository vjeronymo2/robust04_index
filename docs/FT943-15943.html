			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilian star Leonardo banned for four games Brazilian mid-fielder Leonardo was yesterday suspended for four matches after being sent off for elbowing the USA's Tab Ramos during Monday's World Cup second-round clash in San Francisco, which Brazil won 1-0. Leonardo will miss the rest of the tournament and was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (about Pounds 5,000) for the touch line offence, which left Ramos with a fractured skull. The four-match suspension is the heaviest handed out by Fifa at the finals. Fifa general secretary Sepp Blatter described the incident as the most aggressive foul of the tournament. 'It was a revenge foul,' he said. The Brazilian football confederation has three days to appeal, but can protest against only half the ban, because Fifa's disciplinary committee can impose a two-match suspension without the right of appeal.</p>

A Serb from Belgrade and a former general in  the Yugoslav Army, he opted for the Bosnian side because he  shares the principles of tolerance and multiethnicity that  Bosnia and Serbia have always supported.    [Vannuccini] General Divjak, a few days ago you were  pessimistic. How do you judge the situation now?    [Divjak] I was not pessimistic. I was realistic. The  interests of Russia, Europe, and the United States intersect in  Bosnia. The international community's main fear is that the  conflict will spread. As for Sarajevo, very little has changed,  because the city is still surrounded, though people are no  longer dying as before.    [Vannuccini] From the military viewpoint, are you satisfied  with the withdrawal of the Serbian weapons?    [Divjak] Not at all. They have not withdrawn, or placed  under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision, even 60  percent of those that they had. UNPROFOR said this morning that  it was "surprised" to discover some 60 placements that it had  not seen before. The Serbs had 100 tanks around Sarajevo, and  they have withdrawn 30 of them.    [Vannuccini] But, General, it was you who signed the  agreement with Serbian Commander Mladic at the airport.    [Divjak] This is what happened: On the evening of 8 February  UNPROFOR's commander in Bosnia, General Rose, asked us for an  urgent meeting. He assured us that the Serbs had accepted all  the conditions set by UNPROFOR, from the truce to the withdrawal  of heavy weapons or their supervision by the blue helmets.  Since I realized that the general was acting in accordance with  the British Government's policy, I told Rose that I would prefer  to await NATO's decision before meeting with Mladic at the  airport. But Rose went to President Izetbegovic and put  pressure on him for us to attend. The meeting at the airport  lasted 15 minutes. There was nothing on paper, so each side can  interpret the agreement however it pleases. The fact is that  UNPROFOR tried to create political solutions on the ground in  order to implement the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. It is Bosnia's  ill fortune that in order to keep the Serbs happy UNPROFOR  places Bosnia on the same level as the aggressors.    [Vannuccini] Are you afraid that the Serbs could take back  their weapons?    [Divjak] The Serbs have around Sarajevo 12,000 men who are  still fully armed. We have 45,000, but we have only one weapon  for every three soldiers. And the Serbian artillery can hit  Sarajevo from over 20 km away. They have rockets that have a  range of 70 km. Our only real guarantee is NATO's ultimatum.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME pre-market trading prosposal raises storm A STORM of protest has been raised by the London Metal Exchange Board's decision to have a pre-market trading session on the market floor to mop up the early morning business at present conducted via telephone links between traders' offices. One prominent LME trader, who asked not to be identified, described the suggested move as 'a pointless exercise. I don't think there is any LME ring-dealing member who sees any sense in it at all'. He said it was 'astounding' that the Board could have reached such a decision without first fully consulting all members. Mr Hans Murmann, managing director of Metallgesellschaft's London metals trading subsidiary, said his company had previously studied the concept and 'we are not at all sure it is a good idea'. He said it would take the LME closer to becoming a floor market or a computerised market, both unsuitable ways for the exchange to operate. It might also keep traders at the exchange for most of the day so that they would miss the essential rapport with colleagues responsible for customer liaison. The LME Board said it hoped to have the new system operating before the end of this year. It would bring more business to the exchange and would better serve Far Eastern and Australasian clients. Mr Murmann said it would be better for the LME to keep to two trading sessions a day but to have the first earlier in the morning make life easier for Far Eastern clients. The Board acted after seeing a study by an LME external director into the membership structure. This study followed complaints by ring-dealing members that they were carrying a greater share of the burden of running the exchange and facing more risks than non-ring dealing members, but not getting commensurate returns. Mr Raj Bagri, the LME's chairman, said yesterday that moving pre-market trading to the floor of the exchange would switch business back from non-ring to ring traders. Also, 'it will bring more transparency and openness, which will be to the benefit of users of the exchange'. He pointed out that more than half the LME ring-dealing organisations were represented on the Board which had reached a unanimous decision to make the change. Mr Bagri said LME members would be consulted about the details of the change. 'It is the very strong wish of the Board to implement this proposal,' he added.</p>

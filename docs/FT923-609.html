			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Company News: Turin bank rises 22.8% in first six months ISTITUTO Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Italian bank which floated part of its shares this year, raised gross operating profits before provisions and depreciation by 22.8 per cent to L710bn in the first half of this year. The trend in earnings, which were ahead of budget, had continued into July and August, it said. Loans rose by 11.5 per cent to L92,500bn, with the rate of growth partly held back by the bank on credit grounds. Deposits rose by almost 14 per cent to L104,500bn, with the biggest increase coming from the bank's domestic clients. Stet, the stock market listed holding company for Italy's state-owned telecommunications activities, reported virtually static group pre-tax profits of L1,566bn in the first half to June, against L1,546bn a year earlier. The result came in spite of a 12.5 per cent rise in turnover to L12,526bn. Mr Biagio Agnes, Stet's chairman, judged the results satisfactory, but warned of growing uncertainties owing to the troubled state of the Italian economy. Stet made no profits forecast for the full year, but said that earnings should be in line with the net L1,413bn made in 1991. However, profits would be affected by the additional taxes and special measures planned under the government's severe 1993 budget. The group predicted an 11 per cent rise in sales for the year and maintained investment spending, which amounted to L4,632bn in the first half.</p>

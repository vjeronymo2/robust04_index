			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Careful planning can keep your estate safe - Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains how to hold the Revenue at bay Many people will not leave enough when they die to fall within the scope of inheritance tax. But plenty of others will - and, for them, it is worth thinking about IHT planning while they are alive. Otherwise, the Inland Revenue, rather than their heirs, could get most of their estates. There are a number of misconceptions about IHT, however. The 10 most common are: 1. Special relief is available for private property. Wrong. Some people confuse some of the capital gains tax provisions with those of IHT. Your principal residence is exempt from CGT - but it falls within your estate for IHT purposes. 2. IHT applies only to the rich. Wrong. The first Pounds 150,000 of an estate is tax-free, but anything above this is taxed at 40 per cent. Given the rise in house prices over the past decade or so, a lot of people, particularly in the south-east, will find that their main residence alone is worth much more than Pounds 150,000. Solution: Make use of your nil rate band (see 3 below) and of all your other exemptions to whatever extent is practicable. These include: An annual Pounds 3,000 gift to an individual. This can also be carried forward for a year, which allows you to give away Pounds 6,000 if you have not used up last year's exemption. A limitless number of 'small gifts' per tax year, each of a maximum of Pounds 250 to any individual. Wedding gifts of Pounds 5,000 from each parent (Pounds 2,500 from each grandparent and Pounds 1,000 from anyone else). Gifts to charity and to a qualifying political party plus works of art (so long as the public gets access to them). If you give away enough, your estate might elude IHT. But 'potentially exempt transfers' (see 5) escape the tax only if you remain alive for seven years after giving the assets away. And the danger with giving away too much is that you might not leave yourself enough to live on. One way round this is to make use of trusts (see 6). 3. I have made a will so I don't have to worry about IHT. Wrong. A will simply ensures that your assets are distributed in accordance with your wishes. It does not save tax unless it has been worded to take account of IHT. Solution: Ask your solicitor for guidance about IHT. You will want to ensure that your nil rate band - at present, the Pounds 150,000 you can leave without IHT being payable - is used up. (See 4 and 6). 4. I can leave everything to my spouse. This might seem an ideal solution, since transfers between spouses are exempt from IHT. But what if you and your spouse die at the same time? Even if you are survived by your spouse, the problem is only postponed - and probably worsened since, by the time they die, the assets are likely to have appreciated further. And leaving all your assets to your spouse also wastes your nil rate band. Solution: Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward, suggests drafting a will leaving assets worth the nil rate band to (for example) children. This bequest would then be free of IHT and would reduce the value of assets left to your spouse. (But see 6). 5. I can give assets away but still enjoy their benefit. No. If you make a gift but still continue to benefit from it (such as giving your house to the children but continuing to live in it, or taking income from investments handed over to them), it will be treated as yours. Solution: You can retain a benefit, such as continuing to live in the property given to your children but paying rent at the market price. But Steve Midwinter, of accountant Touche Ross, points out: 'The rent could be kept to a minimum by accepting, as tenant, obligations to keep the home in good repair.' Caroline Garnham, of solicitor Simmons &amp; Simmons, says a partner could leave capital to his spouse in trust for her life. At a later date, the trustees could apportion part or all of the capital to the children but without excluding the spouse from future benefit. But Garnham warns: 'This type of planning must not be done without good professional advice.' If you want to make a genuine gift, be sure it is documented and dated so it will count as a 'potentially exempt transfer.' 6. I do not trust my family so I cannot plan for IHT. Many people may find that tax-efficiency and practicality do not accord. If you make gifts to your spouse or children in the belief that everything is being kept in the family, there is the awful possibility that the spouse might walk out or the children turn against you. So, while it might be a good idea for IHT purposes to change the ownership of the house in which you live from 'joint tenants', where the survivor owns the house, to 'tenants-in-common', where each owns half the house and leaves the other half to the children, there is a danger that they could force a sale on the surviving parent. Solution: Use a trust, but take independent professional advice about it. John Battersby, of accountant KPMG Peat, recommends an accumulation and maintenance trust for young children or grand-children. This allows assets to be held in trust for the surviving spouse so they can have the benefit of income without being able to stop the capital from passing to the children or other intended beneficiaries. Stillerman also suggests drafting the will so that the estate is left in trust. This would leave assets within the family should, for example, a widowed spouse remarry. 7. If I give assets away and live for seven years, I will escape tax. You might escape IHT - but what about CGT? Depending on their value, you might incur a large CGT bill by transferring assets, whereas there is no CGT at death. Solution: CGT holdover relief was all but abolished in 1989, but it remains available when a chargeable transfer (as opposed to a potentially exempt transfer) is made for IHT purposes. Clive Scott-Hopkins, of independent financial adviser Towry Law, says the only chargeable transfer of any significance is into a discretionary trust - a flexible type of trust in which the trustees have discretion regarding those to whom payment of income and capital can be made. Thus, he suggests creating a discretionary trust under which, as long as assets within the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000 are transferred, there will be no IHT to pay and CGT will be deferred until the assets are sold. After seven years, the nil rate band comes back into use again. 8. Only UK residents pay IHT. Wrong. If you are UK domiciled, you will be liable to IHT on your global assets even if you are no longer resident in the UK (unless there is an over-riding double taxation treaty). It is also possible for someone who is neither UK resident nor UK domiciled to be liable to IHT if they own assets directly in the UK. Solution: Garnham says a non-UK domiciled person can avoid IHT on UK assets by holding them through a foreign company. But she warns that care is needed to ensure that, by avoiding one tax, another is not incurred. 9. IHT is payable only on death. Not necessarily, as should be clear from 7. Transfers into a discretionary trust are, technically, liable to IHT; but the rate at which they are taxed is 0 per cent on the amount within the nil rate band. Any excess above that will be taxed immediately at 20 per cent (instead of 40 per cent, as is usually the case under IHT) on the excess as long as you survive for seven years. If you die any earlier, tax is payable at 40 per cent, although 'tapering relief' reduces the tax charge by 20 per cent each year after three years, according to Scott-Hopkins. Solution: Make sure you choose the most suitable trust for your purposes and that it is structured in such a way as to escape as much tax as possible. Professional advice is needed here. 10. I have read everything I need to know about IHT. Unfortunately not. There is a lot more detail which cannot be covered in an article of this length. For one thing, Midwinter points out that many people miss out on 100 per cent business property relief because holdings within a family company are not structured to take advantage of it.</p>

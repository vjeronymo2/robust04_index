			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Food crisis for 34m Africans: UN body blames civil strife for continent's famine and shortages Famine and severe food shortages threaten more than 34m people in sub-Saharan Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warns today in a report which blames civil strife rather than bad weather for the continent's hunger. Intractable wars plague Liberia, Angola, Sudan and Somalia. In Zaire the government has all but collapsed. The fragile agricultural economies of Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya are buckling under the pressure of millions of refugees, while Rwanda has given the world the worst humanitarian catastrophe of modern times. The FAO says Africa is submerged in a 'perpetual food crisis'. Twenty-five years ago the region needed less than 5 per cent of the world's food aid; today 47 per cent of global famine relief is channelled to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a region that cannot afford the cost of commercial food imports at a time when global surpluses earmarked for food aid are also diminishing. 'Latest estimates show some 25 per cent of food-aid needs of the affected African countries are not yet covered by pledges, and deliveries fall seriously short of the pledged assistance,' the report warns. But the FAO says food aid is not a long-term solution for Africa. It emphasises the need for increased agricultural productivity which, it admits, is impossible to implement in the growing number of countries consumed by civil strife. An exodus of 2.5m Hutus following the victory of Tutsi-led guerrillas in Rwanda's civil war has created a refugee population entirely dependent on food hand-outs for survival. Inside Rwanda, unharvested crops are rotting in the fields. Aid workers fear that if refugees do not return by September they will miss planting next year's crop. 'Without an adequate and timely response to relief needs, a large section of the Rwandan population will face starvation in the coming months,' the report says. The Rwandan crisis has increased the number of refugees and displaced populations in sub-Saharan Africa to about 22m people. Most of these huge migrations, the FAO says, have been caused by civil strife. The uprooting of entire communities disrupts food production; creates long-term dependence on food aid; and destabilises food markets in the areas where refugees settle, by increasing demand and prices for local produce. Those who can return home often remain dependent on food aid before they can resume normal farming activities. Food supply and crop prospects in sub-Saharan Africa. July 1994.

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (6): A question of the right rate - Banking, Most policy reforms have been implemented ONE SECTOR where the Kenyan government cannot be blamed for dragging its heels is banking and finance. The bulk of the policy reforms laid out in the Financial Sector Adjustment Operation have been implemented, though there is still a good way to go on the institutional side. In April 1989, minimum savings and deposit rates were raised in three steps from 10 per cent to 13.5 per cent. With inflation below 11 per cent, real rates were positive, remaining so until 1991. In 1990, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) abolished its controls on lending-related fees, thereby liberalising interest rates, though maximum lending rates were capped until July this year when interest rates were completely deregulated. Treasury Bill rates are market determined - the cap was lifted in October 1990 - and early this year the CBK began open-market operations. It has not been possible to shift the entire government overdraft into the Treasury Bill market, partly because the authorities wanted to avoid paying more for their money, and because the money market could not have coped with the volume of short-term public sector borrowing. Prime lending rates are in the range of 16 per cent to 17 per cent for the main banks, and while this means lending rates are negative in real terms, the authorities expect the inflation rate, which averaged 20 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, to fall below prime and some deposit rates in the first half of 1992. The government is predicting positive real savings rates of about 2 per cent, and real lending rates of 5 per cent. It's a highly segmented interbank market with the leading players reluctant to lend to a number of the smaller, local banks. Similarly, high-risk borrowers are paying well over the prime rate - as much as 24 per cent to 25 per cent - for their loans. Four commercial banks dominate a market comprising some 28 banks and more than 50 financial institutions. The banking sector is dominated by the state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank and Barclays, each with more than 20 per cent of the market, followed by Standard Chartered with 15 per cent and the government-owned National Bank of Kenya with less than 10 per cent. Banking legislation was amended, specifying new capital asset ratios, set at 5.5 per cent in 1991 and 7.5 per cent by January 1992. Ten financial institutions were restructured and merged into a new bank - the Consolidated Bank of Kenya. A Capital Markets Authority (CMA) was set up in March 1990, tasked with broadening and deepening the existing markets. It has three key objectives - increasing competition in the securities markets, encouraging secondary market development, and improving incentives for private capital and particularly privatisation issues. Its first steps including getting the government to abolish double-taxation of dividends, reduce corporate rates, amend the unit trust legislation and allow company share issue expenses to be tax deductible. The authority has not moved as fast as it would like, partly because market conditions have been difficult, with the growth of political uncertainty and because the government fell behind target with its privatisation programme. There have been just two public share issues in the last two years - by Kenya Commercial Bank, and the Kenya Finance Corporation, while two others were aborted. The CMA believes that the market can absorb between KPounds 1bn and KPounds 2bn of new issues over a 12-15 month period, and has plans to bring as many as possible of the 15 parastatals identified for flotation to the market during 1992. The pace of privatisation will depend on market depth and enthusiasm for the different issues. An important reform in November was the launch of Foreign Exchange Certificates, denominated in US dollars and paying interest at the London Interban Offered Rate (Libor). These allow Kenyans or foreigners to bring in foreign currency - though not export earnings, which have to be sold to the central bank - and obtain a certificate enabling them to repatriate funds. The aim of the exercise was to loosen exchange controls, encourage Kenyans and others to bring in foreign currency, and marginalise the black market. The certificates are being traded at a premium in the secondary market, with anyone who imports foreign exchange being allowed to sell the certificate at a premium to someone moving funds out of Kenya. While the innovation has been welcomed by the banks, there are some worries over the government's ability to provide the foreign currency - and over the size of the premium that might emerge. The certificates are a potentially attractive vehicle for transferring dividends which are subject to a two-year pipeline. Their introduction has unlocked an area of pent-up demand pressure for foreign currency and if inflows are only modest, the premium in the secondary market could widen, dragging the black market premium of about 15 per cent to 20 per cent up with it. As in most sub-Saharan countries, monetary policy is budget-driven, with the central bank financing the public sector deficit. In 1990, government borrowing from the banks increased nearly 60 per cent to KPounds 28bn. This had slowed to 22 per cent in the year to September 1991. The public sector accounted for 70 per cent of money supply growth, underlining the extent to which monetary policy is dominated by fiscal considerations. Reserve requirements - 6 per cent for commercial banks - and liquidity ratios of 20 per cent for banks and 24 per cent for non-bank financial institutions are not used to regulate credit growth, because while most of the banks and financial institutions maintain such ratios, there are some which cannot and the CBK has not forced them to do so. Credit ceilings were introduced at the end of 1987, but these tended to be ignored by the banks until the authorities imposed penalties in May 1990. The snag with such controls is that they are targeted at the private sector, thereby constraining investment, while government credit creation continues unabated. If the government can get a grip on public spending, money supply growth should slow during the latter half of the fiscal year to June. The authorities are committed to cutting the budget deficit from 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 2 per cent, but this is an overly ambitious target and the signs are that it will be closer to 4 per cent. In spite of this, there should still be a marked slowdown in government borrowing and credit expansion over the next six months. Monetary growth has contributed significantly to the acceleration in inflation. Kenyan research shows that money supply growth fuels inflation with a lag of about six months, though a variety of other factors, such as the decontrol of prices, higher energy costs and currency depreciation, explain the increased tempo of price rises. With economic growth of no more than 4 per cent last year, and monetary expansion of about 20 per cent, inflationary pressures will remain strong for much of 1992, suggesting that the authorities will overshoot their target of 5 per cent inflation by the end of 1992.</p>

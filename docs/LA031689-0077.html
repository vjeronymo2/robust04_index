			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  YOUR COINS: CLOCK'S VALUE MAY BE JUST SENTIMENTAL  </P> <P> Question: For our silver anniversary, my mother gave my husband and me a  special clock in which the numerals were replaced by coins. Each coin  represented pertinent dates in our lives, such as birthdays and anniversaries.  My mother has passed on and I am wondering if I should insure the clock. Could  you please tell me if these coins are valuable? U.S. dimes: 1887, 1889, 1898,  1923; U.S. dollars: 1922. -- M.H.S.  </P> <P> Answer: Coins make wonderful gifts. United States mint sets and proof sets can  help commemorate births, weddings and various anniversaries. For the most part,  they are relatively inexpensive unless the dates are in the early '50s, '40s  and down to 1936, where you're talking big bucks.  </P> <P> Similarly, gold coins are often given as gifts because of the dates. They can  be given in presentation cases or fashioned as jewelry. Keep in mind that coins  made into jewelry will likely lose their numismatic value due to wear, so only  circulated pieces should be used for that purpose.  </P> <P> The same thing holds true for your anniversary clock. I'm sure a lot of thought  went into the clock as a gift. But the dates of the coins you mentioned in  their denominations are considered common. Also, they probably have been  damaged to a certain extent by the way they've been handled. So, as far as your  question concerning insurance is concerned, I doubt that it's necessary.  </P> <P> There's only one way to know for certain, however. Coins must be seen to be  accurately graded and appraised. Take your coins to a local dealer or  professional numismatist. If insurance is warranted, they'll let you know by  the value they place on your anniversary clock. I suspect, however, the  sentimental value will outweigh any collector value.  </P> <P> Q: I have a 3-cent piece dated 1853. On one side are the words United States of  America and the date. On the other is a C and III with a bunch of stars on the  perimeter. The coin is in fair condition, worn but everything is legible. Could  you let me know what it's worth? -- G.H.R.  </P> <P> A: Three-cent silver coins were issued from 1861 through 1873; there are also  3-cent nickel coins from 1865 to 1889. Your coin (the silver type) is worth  about $5.  </P> <P> Q: Thanks to one of your columns last year, I went through my collection of  quarters and found five stamped 1964, one dated 1776-1976; plus a $1 stamped  1900. I am a little excited and wonder what the value of these coins might be.  -- M.P.M.  </P> <P> A: Well, now, just simmer down. Your 1964 quarters are worth about $1 each, the  1776-1976 is a Bicentennial commemorative worth face value; and the silver  dollar is $8 to $10 and up, depending upon condition.  </P> <P> Q: In 1976, the Royal Canadian Mint began issuing a commemorative gold coin  once a year. So far, 12 such coins have been issued. The 1985, commemorating  the Canadian National Parks, has what I believe to be the lowest mintage,  59,745. Now, the $5 gold Statue of Liberty uncirculated has a mintage of more  than 90,000 but commands a higher premium than the lower-mintage Canadian  piece. What's even more surprising is that the Statue of Liberty has only about  a quarter of an ounce of gold, while the Canadian coin has exactly half of an  ounce of gold. In your opinion, would you consider this 1985 Canadian gold coin  a rare item with good investment potential? -- R.K.  </P> <P> A: You're getting into a very speculative area, and I don't like to speculate.  Especially on modern issues. But 59,745 is not rare. It is perhaps scarce, but  then only if 59,746 collectors are interested.  </P> <P> The market will be determined by supply and demand. It is also dominated by  Americans who primarily buy American coinage. You have to decide what your goal  is in collecting. If it's for profit, you're in a highly speculative area. But  if you like these modern coins because of their designs and the history that  surrounds them, then by all means be a buyer. With any luck, enough people will  agree with you and the profit potential will follow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Just in time for St. Patrick's Day is a commemorative marking the 1,000th  anniversary of the establishment of Dublin and the liberation of Ireland from  the Vikings. The 5-ounce silver piece (pictured) designed by Ceasar Ruffo  depicts a battle scene on the obverse and Dublin's motto, Baile Atha Cliath  (the Town of the Hurdle-Ford) on the reverse. No more than 5,000 of the proof  pieces will be minted. The commemoratives are $95 from Putnam Mint, 100 Putnam  Green, Greenwich, Conn., 06830; telephone (800) 227-1205.  </P> <P> The lavish 473-page catalogue for the Four Landmark Collections is now  available. The auction will be held in seven sessions at the Vista  International Hotel in New York from March 27 to March 31. Among the highlights  is an 1824/4 overdate $5 gold piece, one of only two known. For catalogues,  contact Bowers &amp; Merena, Box 1224, Wolfeboro, N.H. 03894.  </P> <P> The proliferation of grading services in the last few years has generated a  whole new industry. So-called slabbed coins (sealed in plastic and graded by a  neutral entity) have taken many collectors by storm. The Professional Coin  Grading Service, one of the leaders, recently certified its millionth coin. For  information, contact PCGS at P.O. Box 9458, Newport Beach, Calif. 92658;  telephone (714) 250-1211. Also popular is the Numismatic Guaranty Corp. of  America, which has added a hologram to its holders, a security measure. NGC has  a dealer network. For information: P.O.

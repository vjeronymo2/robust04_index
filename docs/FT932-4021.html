			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-seat bill published today FIVE OF the UK's six extra constituencies for the European parliament - agreed at the Edinburgh summit - will go to England, and the remaining one will go to Wales under the arrangements set out in a government bill to be published today. The legislation must be passed by October, in order for the new boundaries to be set in time for the Euro-elections next summer. But the plans are certain to attract vocal, and perhaps prolonged, opposition because there will be no extra seat for Scotland. The bill is scheduled to face all its Commons' stages on Monday.</p>

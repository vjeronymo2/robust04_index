			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries Despite slipping in response to yesterday's first-quarter figures, BAT Industries' shares are comfortably higher than before it spent Dollars 1bn on US cigarettes last week. The market's favourable reaction might incline Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, towards further action. The group has made no secret of its ambition to expand in financial services. But simply adding another jewel to the crown - by buying a continental European insurer, for example - would lack the same commercial logic. While an overseas insurer would spread BAT's risk away from the UK, there would be little obvious synergy with Eagle Star. Mr Broughton would have to convince the City that he had struck an exceptionally good deal. The acquisition of American Tobacco was applauded precisely because it addressed a strategic weakness. On that basis, securing additional distribution in UK life assurance should take priority. It is too early to say that the advent of commission disclosure will cause the same upheaval in UK life assurance as Marlboro Friday caused in US tobacco. But a shift in the balance of power towards bancassurance companies seems likely and Allied Dunbar's dependence on a direct sales force could leave it exposed. Acquiring a retail bank or building society would make strategic sense. Yet pushing gearing well above 50 per cent - the current year-end target - would be risky unless BAT can rely on US tobacco to generate cash. That, above all else, may be the value of last week's deal.</p>

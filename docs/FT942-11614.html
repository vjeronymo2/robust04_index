			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Brussels acts on cement dumping Mounting Portland cement sales from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the European Union have led Brussels to open anti-dumping proceedings against the three countries. The move comes at the instigation of the German producers' association, whose share of the German market fell to 80 per cent in 1992 from 86 per cent in 1991. The association is charging that exports from Poland, for example, are almost 40 per cent cheaper than locally-produced cement. The complaint comes despite the strong German position in Poland's cement industry. German cement companies have recently purchased many Polish state-owned plants and last year accounted for almost 40 per cent of Polish cement output. The anti-dumping action comes in spite of Polish promises to maintain 'fair' export prices. German producers and Poland's cement producers' association have an agreement the Poles will price cement exports at German levels. Polish producers have to obtain export licences from the country's foreign trade ministry. If the exporter offers to sell cement abroad at prices lower than those agreed with German producers the ministry may refuse to issue a licence. Last year Poland produced 12m tonnes of cement, of which 2.4m tonnes were sold abroad, mostly to Germany. This contrasts with the 19m tonnes produced by the industry at its peak in 1979 and 12m tonnes in 1992, when exports amounted to 1.6m tonnes.</p>

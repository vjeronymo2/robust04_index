			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Harding over Pounds 1m in the red TRADING CONDITIONS at Harding Group continued to worsen during the second half of 1990, particularly in the last quarter and as a result the group, which has interests in industrial and transport equipment and building materials, dived to over Pounds 1m into the red. Pre-tax losses for the year totalled Pounds 1.11m, against Pounds 821,000 profits previously, on turnover reduced from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 25.6m. As forewarned last September, the final dividend has been omitted leaving the interim of 1.1p to compare with the 1989 total of 2.75p. Mr Dennis Harding, chairman, said many group customers had also suffered from the economic downturn which has had a considerable impact on the group. A bad and doubtful debts charge of Pounds 110,000 for the first half was increased to Pounds 560,000 for the year. Provision had also been made for costs to be incurred in 1991 comprising Pounds 110,000 for branch premises closed during the year and, which in the present climate were difficult to dispose of, and a further Pounds 138,000 relating to management restructuring. Mr Harding said trading in the current year had continued to be very difficult. An extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 124,000) arose from the disposal of the Earthspan division. Losses per share were 3.84p (3.64p earnings).</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Wine: The 1991 clarets on offer TO SELL or not to sell: that has been the problem of many Bordeaux chateaux with their 1991 clarets. The problem arises because of three factors. First, April frost savagely cut production of most, but not all, chateaux. Second, heavy, diluting rainfall fell just before the vintage. And, third, there is plenty of wine from previous vintages still on the market. En primeur demand for the 1991s is at the very least problematical. The damage in the vineyards was so bad that JP Moueix, the leading Libourne company, refused either to introduce its own wines or buy from any of its normal suppliers in St Emilion and Pomerol. To ensure at least some sale, the very low level of the 1987 en primeur prices was canvassed for them in the Bordeaux trade, but as the successful 1991s are certainly better, this was too much of a cut for the first-growths, assured of a certain sale, and some of the leading seconds. The former generally raised their 1987 opening price of FFr 130 a bottle to FFr 160, and the others have not come out, but Pichon-Lalande and Montrose have. I tasted both at the Union des Grands Crus tasting in April, and they seemed excellent wines; and my favourites among the firsts were Ch Margaux and Latour. Wine merchants in the UK have had similar doubts to many of the chateaux owners as to the saleability of the vintage; and a number have made no opening offer. Others have, and a table of their comparative prices is given here. As fewer firms than usual have come out, and the lists are very selective, prices have been included where there are only one or two quotations. All prices are per dozen ex-cellars Bordeaux with shipping, duty (now Pounds 11.34 a dozen) and VAT (currently 17 1/2 per cent) and delivery to be added. Hungerford repeats its usual claim to match any ex-chateau price lower than its own, subject to stock availability; and Bibendum will quote on any other chateau not listed but obtainable on the Bordeaux market, an offer, no doubt, that merchants here would be glad to back and the depressed Bordeaux trade only too happy to supply. Buyers cannot look for any resale profit, but in many cases the crop was so small that the successes may be hard to find later. Those who like to follow particular chateaux may care to represent a vintage which will probably develop fairly quickly. Averys, Bristol (tel: 0272 214141); Bibendum, London NW1 (071-722-5577); Hungerford Wine, Hungerford, Berks (0488-683238); Lay &amp; Wheeler, Colchester, Essex (0206-764446); Layton, London NW1 (071-388-6081).</p>

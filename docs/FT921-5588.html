			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When the salesman is less than frank Frankers, the machines which stamp your mail and automatically calculate your postal charges, have attracted more than their share of unscrupulous salesmen over the years, writes Charles Batchelor. But there are signs that the industry is tightening up its standards. This was the conclusion of a review of the franking machine market carried out by What to Buy for Business*, a monthly consumer report on business equipment and services. There was a sharp fall in the number of complaints from franker users compared with a previous survey in 1990, the latest edition of the magazine reported. Despite this improvement, businesses which use franking machines (and other items of office equipment) should still keep an eye open for sharp practice, it warned. A common claim from rogue salesmen was that a machine was no longer usable because it was obsolete, overworked or could not be repaired. Some salesmen claimed, untruthfully, that the Post Office had withdrawn approval for a particular model. In fact, the Post Office has never withdrawn approval for any franking machine, the magazine said. A common scare tactic was to claim that a machine was overcharging because of its deteriorating condition or that it would cost more to repair than to replace. Users should check such claims with the service engineer, who is more likely to give unbiased information, or with the Post Office. There should be no need to replace equipment which is in working order, however old or unfashionable it may look. Frankers have an average working life of about eight years and one user said his was 20 years old. Salesmen sometimes claimed that the lease on a machine had to be renewed, often years before the actual expiry date. Some salesmen even attempted to tell businesses which had bought their machines that the lease was up. One claimed that the users were not allowed to own a machine and tried to take it away for replacement with one which was leased. Since office staff change and new employees may be unaware of the financing arrangement for a machine, details of the length of lease or whether the franker has been bought should be displayed on the machine with a note of where the paperwork can be found. A good way to get rid of salesmen was to ask them to put the claims in writing, the magazine suggested. Companies leasing a new franker should read the contract carefully and not sign in a hurry just because a discount is offered. The manufacturers have been making efforts to improve the quality of their service so, if you are dissatisfied, What to Buy advised: complain. *No 132/March 1992.

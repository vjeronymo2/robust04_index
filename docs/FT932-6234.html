			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Biggest Spanish union cold-shoulders socialists: Tom Burns charts a decline in confidence SPAIN'S biggest union, the General Union of Workers (UGT), has pursued for years its self-appointed task of steering the government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez along the road of socialist virtue. Now, though, the union ruefully admits that its efforts have failed and it has refused to endorse the prime minister's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) for the general election on June 6. The UGT had already distanced itself from Mr Gonzalez - its lack of support in the 1989 election helped to lose the socialist party some 800,000 votes and 10 seats in parliament - but its hostility has now gone further. Mr Nicolas Redondo, the union's veteran secretary-general, recently underlined the divide by inviting Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), to the UGT Congress and by sending one of the union's senior executives to the PP convention. The union's leaders feel betrayed by Mr Gonzalez's brand of market-oriented socialism. 'The government has broken promises it made to us and has been systematically against what we stand for,' says Mr Jose Mara Zufiaur, a member of the UGT executive. 'On social issues, Gonzalez has the sensitivity of a clam,' Mr Redondo once said of the prime minister. It was all very different in 1982, when Mr Gonzalez first swept to power in a landslide at the polls. The UGT then helped to draft the socialist party's manifesto and Mr Redondo was one of half a dozen senior union members to win a parliamentary seat for the PSOE. Within a year, however, he and Mr Gonzalez were quarreling over the government's delay in introducing a 40-hour work week - a campaign promise. By 1985, Mr Redondo had resigned his seat when the government announced pension cuts. The union leader's 'insensitive clam' jibe was recalled by Mr Aznar in a televised debate with Mr Gonzalez this week. 'The unions no longer believe you,' the PP's champion said as he berated the prime minister for failing to cement agreements on wages and social policies. Mr Gonzalez's economic team says the UGT and the communist-leaning union, the Workers' Commissions, are responsible for soaring labour costs crippling Spain's competitivity and for spending programmes widening the budget deficit. The unions contend that real wage increases have lagged behind productivity and that the rise in government expenditure is caused by the administration's inability to reduce unemployment. Mr Zufiaur says the government's introduction of six-month work contracts has served to worsen unemployment by creating a growing pool of casual workers shifting between short-term jobs and the dole. 'What most angers Redondo,' says an old friend of the 64-year-old former steel worker, 'is that Gonzalez never tried to maintain a fluid and open dialogue with the unions, either on a personal or on an institutional level.' Mr Zufiaur recalls a bitter exchange when the UGT sought to obtain more union participation in public companies: 'Gonzalez said we would make them uncompetitive and that was that.' Mr Zufiaur reckons the social policy enacted during the past decade has been due to union pressure, including a one-day general strike in 1988. Among the 'conquests' claimed by the UGT and the Commissions after the strike were pensions for some 200,000 of the elderly who had never made social security contributions and a rise from Pta250 (Pounds 1.30) to Pta3,000 in monthly child benefits for some 2m Spaniards who earn less than Pta1m (Pounds 5,130) a year. Blue-collar workers are unlikely to vote for the PP but, if Mr Aznar gains a workable majority on June 6, UGT leaders will be among those he ought to thank. 'We are on the left,' Mr Zufiaur says, 'but many of us are going to abstain, cast blank votes or vote for (the communist-led group) United Left.'</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April.    The latest 600 billion peso cut in government spending  proves  the inflation issue has pushed Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes to  a point of desperation. A few days ago, he made a most shocking  announcement: loans will be restricted. Moreover, Hommes plans  to ask the agriculture minister to halt food imports, and he  insists that inflation this year will be 19 percent -- despite  evidence to the contrary -- because it is currently nearly 10  percent and unemployment is up to 10.3 percent. Furthermore,  the planning sector, which had estimated economic growth at 5  percent this year, now estimates that it will be no more than 3  percent. Meanwhile, despite the implementation of preventive  measures, dollars continue to flow freely into the country.

They say the  restrictions primarily hurt the construction sector and savings  and housing corporations. National Association of Financial  Institutions says many approved loans cannot be paid out because  of the measure, adding that if it is maintained the financial  institutions will be virtually paralyzed by June. (Santa Fe de  Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 0000 on  22 Apr 94)    The National Administrative Department of Statistics  recently  published its report on unemployment for March 1994. In the  country's seven largest cities, unemployment increased from 9.6  percent in March 1993 to 10.3 percent in March 1994. During  that same period, jobs increased by only 1.2 percent, down from  3.6 percent from the previous year. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL  TIEMPO in Spanish 17 Apr 94 p 9C)    The Colombian Government and the Federation of Coffee  Growers  have approved the total refinancing of coffee growers' debts  that expire in 1994 and 1995. The beneficiaries of this  decision must make a 25 percent downpayment and will have 10  years and a three-year grace period to pay off their debt. The  refinancing, which eases tension between the coffee growers and  government, will be covered by 180 billion pesos set aside for  this purpose.

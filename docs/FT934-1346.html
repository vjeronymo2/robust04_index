			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Hanoi hardliners put reform process under threat: Iain Simpson sees stumbling steps on the path towards a market economy As Vietnam begins to count the rising social cost of its gradual transition to a market economy, there are renewed calls within the Communist party for reform to slow. At the current session of the Vietnamese National Assembly (parliament), deputies - almost all of whom are also party members - are engaged in a heated debate on the direction and speed of economic reforms. For all the talk of reform and more openness in Vietnam, the assembly session is strictly off-limits to outsiders. However, sources in the assembly and other observers say the debate is focusing on the 'social evils' of corruption, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor in Vietnam. Deputies from the more conservative wing of the party argue that these problems are a direct result of the country's gradual transition to a market economy. They say the process must be slowed down so the government can again take control over the economy and institute some kind of social welfare for people who have suffered under the reforms. Foreign observers say these arguments are gaining ground from the reformists, who say social problems such as these are caused by the attempt to straddle two economic systems. They say the sooner the government abandons the remaining elements of a centrally planned system, the sooner it will be able to deal with these problems. None of the social problems being debated at the assembly is solely the result of the government's reforms. However, many have appeared or got much worse since they were introduced in 1986. More than 2m people are jobless out of a working population of about 34m, and at least 5m more are seriously underemployed. This high rate is a result of both domestic and international changes. State factories which have been forced to close because they cannot compete have laid off tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, several hundred thousand were put out of work when the army withdrew from Cambodia in 1989. Others were working in the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe and were sent home after those regimes collapsed. Still others were farmers who fell victim to the dismantling of agricultural collectives in the north. Nevertheless, some conservative party members have argued that because unemployment first appeared after the reforms were instituted, they caused it, and rolling them back would solve the problem. Corruption, another subject of debate, is endemic. A year-long government campaign has produced hundreds of examples of graft among senior and junior officials but the interior minister, Mr Bui Thien Ngo, has already told the National Assembly that the effort to curb corruption has failed. The debate in the assembly appears to have grown out of concern that, if they are left unchecked, the growing wealth gap, rising unemployment and widespread corruption could lead to social unrest. Reformers argue that if the government can create jobs through foreign and domestic investment and continue its efforts to check corruption, unrest can be avoided. However, the conservatives continue to say that unless more central planning government control are reintroduced, there could be a descent into chaos. In the current political atmosphere of Hanoi, their arguments carry a great deal of weight.</p>

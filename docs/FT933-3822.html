			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Headway advances 15% to Pounds 0.27m Headway, the consumer and industrial goods manufacturer announced pre-tax profits 15.3 per cent ahead at Pounds 272,000, against Pounds 236,000, for the year ended June 30. This was boosted by a Pounds 194,000 net receipt from prior year business disposals and a reduction in interest charges from Pounds 568,000 to Pounds 137,000. Turnover was down by 12 per cent at Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 28.3m). Sales in the consumer products division were down from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 17.9m, a fall Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, attributed to the 'low level of demand for garden furniture in the critical final quarter'. Earnings per share rose by 23.1 per cent to 1.6p (1.3p) and an unchanged, single, final dividend of 0.7p is recommended.</p>

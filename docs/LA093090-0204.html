			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS  </P> <P> Kissinger not unexpectedly joins the hawks you quoted in your Sept. 14 issue  who dismiss sanctions and argue for a decisive military strike in Iraq now.  Even though sanctions imposed by virtually the whole world have never been  tried before, these "analysts" know they won't work.  </P> <P> Over time, they say, our waiting game will get harder to sustain. Harder than  what, one wants to ask, war?  </P> <P> What's really getting harder is restraining the hawks. Their own proclivities  and all that bright new military hardware glinting in the desert sun blind them  to other courses of action. But there are some. Iraq depends for water on two  vital rivers that originate outside its borders. It's been suggested that they  be dammed. This might precipitate military reaction by Iraq against the  countries damming them but perhaps we could negotiate with Britain, France and  Germany to come to the defense of these countries. Perhaps we could wait for  sanctions to take their inevitable toll.  </P> <P> There is in all of us a tendency to let frustration and fear impel us to use  force before trying other measures which might achieve our goals. We have to  remember, though, that our boys will be killed and our economy devastated by  giving in to this tendency. Let's hope Bush resists the advice of hawks like  Kissinger whose role in Vietnam should have put an end to invitations from The  Times and other responsible members of the media to give his discredited  advice.  </P> <P> ANN ALPER  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

A source from the nuclear sector said the electronic part of  the control panel is now a museum piece. It is close to 15  years old and has been superseded by more modern ones, but it  can be used if necessary. The same source said that state of  the art control panels with color video and sophisticated data  processing systems are being installed in the nuclear plants of  first world countries such as France, the United States, and  Japan.    The same source said that during the next decade new  reactors  with improved safety concepts will be produced, in which case  Angra-2 may no longer satisfy the requirements for a license  because it has been out of use for a long time. The source  noted that the heavy mechanical part of the reactor and the  construction of the plant are not at risk of being obsolete but  he indicated that the electronic part will all have to be  reviewed. The equipment is being kept in warehouses with great  care and under the supervision of technicians of the IAEA, which  has its headquarters in Austria.    But the source said no one in the world can guarantee the  realiability of high technology pieces kept inactive for almost  15 years. The source said that pumps and motors, for example,  kept idle for a long time tend to give problems. He added:  "This happens with cars and refrigerators, so why not with a  nuclear plant?" Luiz Manuel Amaral Messias, superintendent of  the nuclear construction of the Furnas Electric Power Plants,  Inc., admits that some parts will have to be changed but said:  "This is very common in any project." Messias said that when the  government decides to restart the nuclear plant construction,  the parts will be subjected to many tests to prevent problems.    Messias admitted that the auxiliary computer for operating  Angra- 2 that was bought in Germany is obsolete. He added that  the electronic module of the reactor's protection system has  already been changed because it did not fulfill the new  requirements. The post-accident monitoring system was also  replaced because it was too old. Messias added: "We are now  discussing the exchange of the nucleus of the reactor, which  monitors the flow of neutrons in the reactor."    As problems in the plants appear, Furnas plans to use  (German  technology) equipment and parts bought for the Angra-3 plant  (which will not be rebuilt) in Angra-1 which was bought from  Westinghouse in 1970.</p>

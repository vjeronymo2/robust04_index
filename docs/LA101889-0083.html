			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MISSISSIPPI;  </P> <P> GOP SEAT IN HOUSE WON BY DEMOCRAT  </P> <P> Democratic state Sen. Gene Taylor won a lopsided victory over Republican Tom  Anderson, a veteran Washington aide, in a special election in the 5th  Congressional District in Mississippi. With 94% of 372 precincts reporting,  Taylor had 65% of the vote to Anderson's 35% in the race to succeed Republican  Larkin I. Smith, who was killed in a plane crash in August. The victory means  that the Democrats hold all five of the state's House seats for the first time  in 17 years. The GOP holds both of Mississippi's U.S. Senate seats.  </P></p>

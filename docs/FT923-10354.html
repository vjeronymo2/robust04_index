			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Protest at Czech steel 'dumping' in the EC GERMANY and France have lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission about alleged 'dumping' of Czechoslovak steel in the EC market. Belgium has indicated it may protest, and other EC members may also complain. National officials will discuss the main elements of the case with the Commission today, but will not take any formal decisions. West European companies are worried that, in an attempt to earn hard currency, east European manufacturers are selling their products at unrealistic prices to the west. Action against Czechoslovak manufacturers would be politically sensitive; Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland have signed a pact with the EC aimed at improving trade relations.</p>

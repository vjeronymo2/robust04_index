			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Nafta ministers hunt for consensus THE trade ministers of the US, Canada and Mexico yesterday gathered in Washington to begin their final attempt to resolve differences over enforcement of labour and environmental laws and mechanisms to finance the costs of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Thomas Hocking, the Canadian trade minister, said before beginning talks with his counterparts - Mr Mickey Kantor of the US and Mr Jaime Serra Puche of Mexico - that the three would have to meet next week to finish the supplemental agreements designed to protect jobs and the environment and to guard against import surges. On Capitol Hill, there were further signs yesterday that Nafta is in political trouble. There were reports that the Clinton administration had rejected proposals for a 'Nafta plus' package, which would include the side pacts and a North American Development Bank. Plans to announce a 'Nafta czar' to press the agreement through Congress have also been delayed without explanation. The National Economic Council is said to have opted for a two-track policy, creating both a commission to implement clean-up and water treatment projects, and a funding entity in the Inter-American Development Bank to provide financing. Supporters of the so-called NADBank include many Democrats who otherwise oppose Nafta. Among them is Congressman Esteban Torres, who said he was 'appalled the administration is shooting itself in the foot' by rejecting the idea of an independent development bank, which would loan funds to communities in all three countries damaged by the restructuring of the job base in North America. Rarely a day passes without opposition being voiced against Nafta. On Tuesday 100 Democratic congressmen wrote to President Bill Clinton requesting that he delay Nafta until healthcare reforms are completed. On Wednesday Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur and several other colleagues released data showing that soil and water samples they had taken on a visit to the US-Mexican border were contaminated with industrial pollutants. The Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think-tank, issued this week an analysis of 34 companies which have set up lobby efforts in the US. The report said at least nine of the companies had shipped thousands of jobs to Mexico and 10 of them were among the top 30 US polluters.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Tiny Rowland made secret visits to Gadaffi MR TINY ROWLAND, chief exec-utive of Lonrho, returned to Britain from Africa yesterday after having twice flown into Libya during the past seven days for extensive and secret talks with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi. Both Mr Rowland's visits to Libya, made on a corporate Gulfstream jet, occurred before the imposition of the United Nations sanctions from midnight New York time on Tuesday. Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho East Africa, who accompanied Mr Rowland on his trip, said in Nairobi yesterday that the meetings were primarily to discuss further investment and business ventures between Libya and Lonrho. But he said that Mr Rowland and Col Gadaffi had also talked about ways of ending Libya's international isolation following the failure of the Libyan government to hand over the two Lockerbie airliner bombing suspects. Mr Too said Mr Rowland was carrying 'confidential messages' from the Libyan leader to the British government aimed at reaching a compromise. 'There are so many British companies doing big business in Libya and that is the only reason why Britain doesn't want full sanctions because they would lose the contracts and go bust,' Mr Too said. Mr Rowland's Libyan trips follow last month's announcement that Lonrho had sold Libya a one-third stake in the group's Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177m. At the March annual general meeting, Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's chairman, said Mr Rowland had personally secured the Libyan deal. According to a financier close to Lonrho, Mr Rowland has had a series of meetings recently with Col Gadaffi. The personal relationship between the two men goes back to the early 1970s when Mr Rowland was expanding Lonrho's interests into Sudan and the Middle East. Lonrho's decision to do business with Libya while the Lockerbie issue remained unresolved was widely criticised by some of the group's biggest shareholders and bankers. If, however, Mr Rowland can help find a compromise to the current crisis, pressure will be taken off Lonrho. Mr Too also said that, during the visits to Libya, Col Gadaffi had given his backing to peace talks being brokered by Mr Rowland and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, aimed at resolving the bitter nine-year civil war in neighbouring Sudan. Unusual secrecy surrounded Mr Rowland's flight plans after he left Heathrow airport last weekend on board the Gulf-stream IV, call sign Hotel Bravo Indigo Tango Zulu. BA's executive aircraft department at Heathrow said that it had been instructed not to divulge any details of the aircraft's itinerary. But the Financial Times has learned that Mr Rowland and Mr Too flew on Saturday April 11 to Sirte, in northern Libya, where they held a series of meetings with Col Gadaffi and other Libyan officials. Mr Rowland and Mr Too then flew on Sunday evening April 12 to Nairobi, where Mr Rowland met Mr Moi to discuss his Sudanese initiative. On Monday evening April 13, Mr Rowland and Mr Too flew to Khartoum for discussions with the Sudanese military strongman Gen Omar Hassan Ahmed el Bashir, who gave his endorsement to Mr Rowland's efforts. On Tuesday April 14 the two men flew to Tripoli, arriving after midnight. A further series of discussions were held on April 15 with Col Gadaffi and senior Libyan officials. Mr Rowland and Mr Too left for Zare before the UN sanctions came into force.</p>

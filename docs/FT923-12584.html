			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Observer: Ah well . . . The Bundesbank's latest move calls to mind a verse from a song composed by Tom Lehrer in the 1960s amid talk of giving Germany an active part in Nato's proposed multi-lateral nuclear force: Once all the Germans were warlike and mean, But that couldn't happen again. We taught them a lesson in 1918, And they've hardly bothered us since then.</p>

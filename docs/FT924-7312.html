			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nedcor advances 19% to R408m NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth largest bank, performed in line with its main competitors, but slightly better than market expectations, to record a 19 per cent increase in net profits to R408m (Dollars 136.88m) for the 12 months to September from R344m the year before. The country's banking sector has been the one whose profits have withstood the severe recession. Nedcor is no exception, profiting from wider interest margins as the cost of money has fallen quicker than lending rates. Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said all parts of the bank had performed soundly. The wider margins and an increase in lending volumes, helped net interest income rise 19 per cent to R1.6bn. Other income rose by 17 per cent, to R1.06bn from R904m, leaving total income 18 per cent up at R2.7bn from R2.3bn. Where the bank did feel the downswing was in the need to increase the provisions for bad debts, particularly in the case of clients holding properties in areas vulnerable to unrest. These rose by 2 per cent to R238m from R233m. Costs rose by 17 per cent, a figure which compares favourably with Nedcor's opposition, but a rise in the tax charge meant the increase in net profits was restricted to 19 per cent - up to R408m from R344m. A divisional breakdown of net income shows that R317m came from Nedcor bank, 17 per cent up on 1991. Finansbank and Cape of Good Hope Bank contributed R22m, Syfrets Group R22m and UAL Merchant Bank R47m - increases respectively of 57 per cent, 10 per cent and 21 per cent over 1991. Total assets grew by 14 per cent to R47.3bn from R41.6bn - in line with inflation - while advances increased by 12 per cent to R34.7bn from R30. The dividend is being lifted by 16 per cent to 66 cents a share from 57 cents on a similar increase in earnings to 215 cents a share from 185 cents.</p>

A check carried out by this committee jointly with other  agencies revealed that some of the Northern Fleet's personnel  had been exposed to excessive radiation dozes (7 people were  hospitalized). Nuclear materials are not properly isolated,  while nuclear facilities and ships are operated with violations  of the safety regulations. Some of the installations, put out  of service, have not been placed in a safe condition.    The State Atomic Inspection Committee is seriously concerned  about the handling of nuclear wastes. Containers are overloaded  and no measures are taken to process the radioactive wastes.  Liquid wastes are still being dumped into the sea.    The committee reports that it has informed the Defense  Ministry of the alarming situation on the Northern Fleet.    It says that on October 17, a TMT-27 tanker dumped liquid  radioactive wastes 105 miles east of Vladivostok and 295 miles  from the Japanese island of Hokkaido, all of which aroused  Japan's and Korea's protests. The introduction of state control  over the radiation safety of the Defense Ministry's facilities  is a must, says the State Atomic Inspection Committee.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- "The release of Rutskoy will alter  the configuration of candidates at the coming presidential  elections, and will especially weaken Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's  position," deputy of the State Duma, Minister for Affairs of  Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray said in an  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. He voiced the  hope that those released from Lefortovo "will wage the political  struggle in civilized forms."    "There is in me, as in anyone else, an element of alarm in  connection with the political statements of the inmates of  Lefortovo released yesterday," Sergey Shakhray added. "The  political organizations which achieved only a political amnesty,  should take upon themselves responsibility for the actions of  the released leaders. If the latter plan to continue the  struggle in the elections like other citizens of the Russian  Federation, that is a normal phenomenon, but if they are  planning to fight in order with the help of slogans to seize,  destroy, or gun down -- that means fresh criminal cases will be  instituted and there will be no consensus or reconciliation."    But Deputy Konstantin Zatulin in an interview to ITAR-TASS  expressed the opinion that any political statements by Ruslan  Khasbulatov and Viktor Anpilov on leaving Lefortovo are "quite  natural." The most important thing was whether these statements  would be followed by any political actions. Konstantin Zatulin  considers it expedient to "discuss in the Duma the question of a  possible ban on political activity by active participants in the  October events of 1993."    We remind you that after coming out of Lefortovo Viktor  Anpilov spoke today on Moscow's Theater Square, calling on  several hundred activists of "Working Moscow" and the Russian  Communist Workers' Party to set up a workers' party.    In an interview to REUTER's agency Aleksandr Rutskoy's aide  Andrey Fedorov stated that his boss "will not stay out of  politics because he has never given up the idea of becoming  president. He has come out of prison in a fighting mood."    As for Ruslan Khasbulatov, he told journalists that he was  leaving politics and intends shortly to visit his relatives in  Chechnya.</p>

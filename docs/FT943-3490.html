			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Railtrack lifts strike capacity Railtrack said it had managed to open 59 per cent of the rail network yesterday, an increase of 2 percentage points on the figure achieved last week. New sections of line to be opened in the 14th week of signal workers' strikes included the stretch between Tonbridge and Edenbridge in Kent, that between Preston and Burnley in Lancashire, and suburban routes north of Glasgow. Services between London and Gatwick airport were disrupted by a train failure unrelated to the signalling dispute. Railtrack has achieved considerable increases in the track mileage open for services in recent weeks but the latest increase is the smallest for some time. It has concentrated staff at the more modern signal boxes covering large areas of track but is now faced with staffing its smaller manual signalboxes which control only small stretches of track. The outcome of a two-day inquiry by Railtrack into last week's derailment of a commuter train at Bickley in Kent is expected to be announced today. The joint inquiry is being carried out by Railtrack and South East Trains, part of Network SouthEast. Railtrack said initial indications were that neither the signalling equipment nor signalling staff were at fault. The inquiry is looking at the technical operation of the points, signals, the train's brakes and the actions of the driver. Meanwhile travellers in London still face the prospect of disruption to the Underground with the rejection by the RMT transport union of a request by London Underground to call off plans for a strike ballot. The RMT was offered a 2.5 per cent rise to call off the ballot.</p>

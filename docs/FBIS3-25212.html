Contacts with Somali  delegations are already under way in an effort to secure the  release of the two hostages, and Mario Scialoia, the Italian  ambassador in Mogadishu, has taken steps to solve the problem.    Meanwhile, in a meeting with Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary  Carmelo Azzara, interim Somali President Ali Mahdi has asked for  the Italian contingent to remain in Somalia, or at the very  least for it to be "the last to leave the country."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Nesmyanovich: "The Fleet Is Not Just </F> Being Divided; It is Actually Growing"]    [Text] In Kiev they are continuing to comment on the  results of the Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea  Fleet.    At a briefing in the Ministry of Internal Affairs Col-Gen  Ivan Bizhan, deputy minister of defense of Ukraine, said that  the Russian delegation had not been prepared to resolve the  issues to be discussed. It proposed an unacceptable option  whereby the Russian portion of the Black Sea Fleet would be  deployed at bases in the Crimea and the Ukrainian share would be  outside the Crimea. Furthermore, I. Bizhan noted, it could only  be a matter of the brief presence of Russian seamen and ships  within Ukraine. With respect to Sevastopol, the possibility has  not been ruled out of temporary joint basing of the Russian and  the Ukrainian parts only in different bays. Major disagreement  also arose in approaches to resolution of the problem of the  coastal infrastructure.    As of 20 April the number of ships in the Black Sea Fleet  was  833. Of these 164 belonged to Ukraine, 669 to Russia. It was  planned for Russia to pay for 31.7 percent of the ships, which  were to go to Ukraine under the treaty.    In general, representatives of the Ukrainian Navy have long  advanced the idea that the combat strength of the Fleet is a  myth. The fact is stressed that the average age of the ships is  15-20 years. In recent years funds have not been allocated for  their maintenance. If this continues, the Fleet will "go to the  bottom" on its own by the year 2000. Ukraine's Navy, however,  which commemorated the second anniversary of its founding in  April, continues to be replenished with modern ships. And not so  few of them--the administrative ship Slavuch, the patrol vessel  Getman Sagaydachnyy, the airfoil landing ship Donetsk. The  missile cruiser Ukraina will join them in the future. The crews  of the patrol vessel Getman Bayda-Vinevetskiy, the small ASW  ships Lutsk, Ternopol, Lvov, Zaporozhskaya Sech... are being  completed and completely manned. And so, rumors of a premature  end of the Fleet may turn out to be greatly exaggerated.</p>

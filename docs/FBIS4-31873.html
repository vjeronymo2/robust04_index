			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F> Milan Rusko in Istanbul on 12 June: "In Such an Atmosphere, One  Does Not Look at the Time"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan took part in a  meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) in  Istanbul on 10 June. We asked him for an interview before his  return home yesterday.    [Rusko] Mr. Minister, before the conference, it was expected  that Russia would announce at it when it will join the  Partnership for Peace (PFP). Why was this expectation not  fulfilled?    [Kukan] According to Andrey Kozyrev, not all of the issues  involved have been clarified. He did not specify which ones; he  declared, however, that, although he was born in Brussels and is  always glad to return there, he does not want to go "step by  step," but only when everything has been prepared.    [Rusko] Did this not have an influence on the atmosphere of  the meeting?    [Kukan] A characteristic feature of the conference was its  working atmosphere. All of the participants accepted the  Russian representative's explanation with understanding. They  realize that Russia would like to have the kind of relations  with NATO that would correspond to its military and political  status and geographical position. At the same time, however,  the NACC members emphasized that there can be no privileges for  anyone within the PFP framework.    Another episode, however, also testifies to the atmosphere  of  the meeting. A group of experts drafting the final document was  working in parallel with the plenary session. It turned out  that this was the kind of demanding task that could only be  dealt with by people with ministerial authority. Therefore, the  talks were transferred to the plenum. However, they took two  hours longer there than envisaged. This was virtually a  dialogue between Russia and the other participants. An  agreement was reached in the end. It was said more than once at  the meeting that it would be a mistake if the other states were  to decide on a course of action that would place Russia in  isolation. Because Minister Kozyrev did not concretize in  detail his views on relations with NATO, it was not possible to  give a detailed response to his stance.    [Rusko] Does this mean that there were no contentious  issues?    [Kukan] The meeting was oriented not toward specifying them  but toward expressing a joint point of view on such fundamental  issues as relations between the states joining the PFP and the  North Atlantic Alliance, the question of resolving the regional  conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and  Afghanistan, and on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and  the observance of international agreements.    [Rusko] NATO officials and ministers from some of the member  countries implied at the news conferences that Russia is  interested in modifying the treaty on conventional weapons in  Europe. Was this topic also discussed?    [Kukan] Russian representatives are of the opinion that the  Vienna treaty should be adapted to the new conditions that have  arisen with the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the  signatories to the treaty. During the discussion, the heads of  the individual delegations pointed out that, in implementing a  document, a certain flexibility in complying with it cannot be  ruled out. This must be agreed upon in advance, however, and  everyone must agree with it. This accommodates the Russian  demands to a certain extent, while the binding nature of the  international treaties remains in force. The meeting emphasized  that it is also necessary to improve the mechanism for  supervising fulfillment of the treaty on nuclear  nonproliferation, whose validity expires next year. It would be  appropriate to make it valid permanently, and, if the NACC's  efforts proceed in this direction, we will support them.    [Rusko] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev set out more  than two weeks ago how Russia envisages interlinking the NACC  and the CSCE. What conclusion did the NACC conference reach on  this?    [Kukan] Everyone, including the Russian delegation in  Istanbul, emphasized their interest in further strengthening the  role of the CSCE, especially in the peacekeeping operations and  preventive diplomacy spheres. According to almost all of the  participants, however, the NACC remains an important  consultative body for coordinating politico-security issues.  The subject of military cooperation should be dealt with within  the PFP framework.</p>

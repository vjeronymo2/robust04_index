			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Book Review: Bureaucrats unbound THE FUTURE OF WHITEHALL By Oonagh McDonald Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, Pounds 19.99, 212 pages MANAGING PUBLIC SERVICES By Richard Common, Norman Flynn and Elizabeth Mellon Butterworth-Heinemann, Pounds 30, 152 pages The revolution begun in Britain's public services by Mrs Thatcher is reaching into the heart of Whitehall, with the announcement this week that up to 25 per cent of civil servants could find themselves competing for their jobs against the private sector. The public services minister, Mr William Waldegrave, told a conference in London that the extension of compulsory competitive tendering from local to central government was the next step in raising the quality and cost-effectiveness of the civil service. Already some parts of the government machine have been privatised. Others have been hived off in executive agencies with management autonomy from Whitehall. The parts which remain must now adapt to a new culture of contracting-out and managerial efficiency - with the Citizen's Charter constantly demanding higher-quality services and promising compensation if performance falls below standard. Yet good government is much more than the efficient delivery of services, as Dr Oonagh McDonald shows in her thorough account of 13 years of radical change in the civil service. Public services remain in the public sphere because they are required to address non-market objectives, such as equality of treatment and public accountability. These objectives often conflict with profit-maximising. Offering equal access to public transport will make it harder to make a profit, for example. And the regulation of safety standards is too sensitive to be delegated to bodies which are not subject to democratic accountability. The government's reforms aim to create quasi-markets in the public services. Competing organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors provide services under contract to purchasing bodies such as health authorities, local councils and - soon - central government departments. Yet public services are not entirely free to respond to market signals. Under-used jobcentres or vehicle testing stations often cannot be closed because of the need to maintain a nationwide network. Charges may be determined by statute or be subject to other controls. Competition against the private sector is forbidden or constrained. And there is often no identifiable consumer whose satisfaction can be the determination of success. Who is the customer to be satisfied by the prison service - the prisoner, the judicial system or the public? The complexities created for public sector managers by these quasi-markets are explored by Common, Flynn and Mellon in their fascinating guidebook to managing such reforms. Drawing on extensive experience of consultancy in the public sector, they offer a range of strategies for improving efficiency within publicly accountable services. Their recommendations are expertly illustrated by case studies of nine public services, from the social security benefits agency to London buses. Many of their prescriptions will seem commonplace to those in the private sector. For example, they advocate research to find out just what the customer wants. Yet this is a necessary counterweight to a culture in which the customer has had to make do with what the public service is prepared to offer. They also call for new approaches to personnel, management and training. People working in the public services must cast off the bureaucratic approach and learn to take individual initiative. More leadership is needed, rather than just management. Decision-making should be devolved so that real power is exercised closest to the customer. Decentralisation is not without its dangers when administering tax and benefits, for example - equality of treatment can crumble if frontline staff exercise discretion. Yet managers who are asked to bear extra responsibility will soon be demotivated if they are given no real power to affect matters. The existing constitutional arrangements under which public services are run do little to help. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility encourages ministers, MPs and the taxpayer to believe that politicians should be responsible for every last aspect of the public services. Managers all too often have the rug pulled from under their feet by their political paymasters for short-term political expediency. The politicians should certainly remain accountable for the general policy behind the public services. But day-to-day responsibility must be passed down to managers empowered to improve service delivery. New forms of accountability are needed which recognise these changed circumstances - including ombudsmen with increased powers to deal directly with maladministration. Just as managerial reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of public services, so too are constitutional reforms if public services can continue to be held to account.</p>

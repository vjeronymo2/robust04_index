			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES: SHRUG OFF THE FUR TRIM  </P> <P> Question: Are fur-trimmed coats fashionable now? I have an old sable shrug that  could become the collar and cuffs on a cloth coat, but I hate to go to the  expense if the look is dated.  </P> <P> H.I.  </P> <P> Answer: Fur collars and cuffs are not exactly the last work in coats, but fur  sleeves are. How about taking a page from Paris designer Christian Lacroix's  sketchbook and converting your shrug to sleeves, as illustrated here?  </P></p>

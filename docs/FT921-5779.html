			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Life after debt in Latin America THERE is a tendency in Europe to assume that the Latin American debt crisis, like the poor, is one of those things that will always be with us. Not so, as those familiar with the remoter reaches of the Financial Times have known for quite a while. The wags who asked whether there was life after debt for this benighted area now have their answers. Private capital is flooding back with a vengeance. According to a recent report from Salomon Brothers, Latin America attracted more than Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23bn) of private capital last year, of which Dollars 15.7bn was in the form of borrowing, Dollars 14bn in direct foreign investment and privatisation inflows, and a further Dollars 6.4bn in portfolio investment. That compares with Dollars 13.4bn in 1990. Here, then, is the world's liveliest new junk bond market. And the striking thing about the pattern of investment is that it stretches beyond Mexico into countries that are still notching up interest arrears, such as Brazil and Argentina. Even flight capital, that unseemly blight on the regional economy, is beginning to do an about-turn. The Mexican government estimates that nearly Dollars 5.5bn of flight capital was repatriated to the country last year. The growing confidence of international investors can be seen in the way private sector companies are regaining access to the markets on the basis of their own balance sheets and cash flow. Also in the stretching out of maturities in the Eurobond market, where Mexico's national development bank has even raised 10-year money. Meanwhile, Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, which heads the bank advisory committees to Brazil and Argentina, sees an end to past problems. He expressed optimism last week that these two countries would secure outline agreements with their bank lenders by June. In other words, the Latin American debt crisis could be as good as dead by the 10th anniversary of Mexico's default in August. Hallelujah. One of the more perverse features of the world economy in the 1980s was the way in which the widespread abolition of exchange controls did so little to encourage an efficient allocation of global resources. Instead of capital flowing from the developed to the developing world in pursuit of higher marginal returns, it went into the United States to finance twin deficits, empty office blocks and better election prospects for George Bush. Today, the world's biggest creditor country, Japan, would be unlikely to launch a new dollar support operation to help secure a second Bush victory even if the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa wished to do so. This reflects the impact of successive scandals, of which the latest, involving Sagawa Kyubin, promises a vintage crop of nasty revelations. The credibility of the politicians is at rock bottom and the government's ability to influence the Bank of Japan and its hardline boss, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has been undermined. The extent to which the subtle understandings that used to permeate Japanese public life have broken down was highlighted last week when the elder statesman of the ruling Liberal Democratic party called for lower interest rates to revive the sagging economy. His plea met with a dismissive rebuff from an impressively deadpan Mr Mieno. There are powerful forces at work, then, to ensure a better pattern of capital flows in the 1990s - not the least of them being the transformation that is going on in the Latin American economies themselves. Even the dimmest bond salesman could wrap his mind around the story: 400 million people in a continent with a GNP equivalent to, say, two-thirds of that of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which has a vibrant private sector and where liberalisation is being embraced with enthusiasm. The impassioned intellectuals who discussed dependencia are out; intellectuals who have watched the Asian dragon economies make themselves as dependent as possible on foreign multinationals are in. Three decades after the dragons dumped their import substitution programmes in favour of export-led growth, Latin America has got the message. The regional economy is already looking up. All countries bar Brazil saw solid growth last year. An eight-year declining trend in per-capita GDP has, according to Salomon Brothers, been reversed. The icing on the cake, as far as foreign investors are concerned, is the imminence of the North American Free Trade Agreement: liberalisation from the Yukon to Yucatan. And there is now talk of the need for free trade from Alaska to the Antarctic as a defensive response to the threat of a more protectionist world in which the US and Europe are at loggerheads on trade. But are Latin American financial instruments likely to be mispriced? Over the past year, Brazil's public sector institutions have borrowed in the Eurobond market at up to 6 percentage points over US government bonds of equivalent maturity. International investors have been rushing into short-term money market instruments in domestic currencies at yields equivalent to up to 20 per cent. Those figures clearly make some allowance for the risk of compensatory devaluations that invariably accompany trade liberalisation and for the risk of default. But whether it is enough is a moot point. David Hale, chief economist of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services, sees a parallel with the US junk bond market in the 1980s. He fears that an otherwise healthy development from the point of view of global resource allocation may over-shoot and create a new debt crisis in the mid-1990s. The regulators should thus be on their guard, especially in the US, where defaults could lead to yet another contingent liability on public finances. Latin America has, after all, a track record with foreign adventurers. Its gold played havoc with the Spanish money supply after the Conquistadores went to work. Its bonds have been the subject of countless defaults both in the 19th century and in the 1930s, when US commercial banks' efforts to securitise their bad loans left a formidable mark on the regulatory system. Latin America seems to have been put there to mask the aspirations of the greedy. Amazing how the appeal of this elusive Eldorado always reasserts itself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan will insure up to 500  million dollars in trade and investments to South Africa over  the next two years, Trade Ministry officials said Monday [20  June].    Officials of the International Trade and Industry Ministry  (MITI) said the decision, which has already been conveyed to  South Africa, will be officially announced at the Group of Seven  summit in Naples next month.    The insurance coverage is part of a package of Japanese  measures to aid South Africa's new administration under  President Nelson Mandela, officials said.    Yen-based loans will also be offered.    MITI officials said the decision is in response to a recent  U.S. request that industrialized nations increase aid to  Pretoria for its economic rehabilitation program.    The officials said the new insurance coverage is expected to  generate more involvement by Japanese companies in South  Africa's markets.</p>

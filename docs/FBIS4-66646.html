			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of Shiites </F> in Europe, by Hassan Murtada, in Cologne, Bonn; date not given:  "Settling of Scores Between Shiites and Sunnis"--first paragraph  AL-HAWADITH introduction]    [Text] After a talk delivered in the British House of  Commons, Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani went to Germany to lecture on  religious affairs in his capacity as spiritual head of Shiites  in Europe. In Cologne, AL-HAWADITH interviewed him about  developments in the Iranian situation, following the events of  Zahedan, the attempted assassination of President Rafsanjani,  and about his position as a religious personage from Qom. He  answered the questions, and expects difficult times for Iran,  because of an unprecedented economic crisis that is hitting the  poor classes and causing them to take to the streets. The  interview with Ayatollah Rouhani continued in Bonn, which is the  last stop on his tour. He did not want to go into questions of  religious authority, perhaps because one of his two brothers,  Mohammad Rouhani, is a religious scholar in Qom, who has his  adherents and students. Through the tape of the interview, which  runs more than two hours, a true picture emerges of the many  Iranian difficulties.    [Murtada] What precisely happened in the city of Zahedan?  Why  the eruption? Is there any connection between this security  convulsion and the assassination attempt against President  Rafsanjani? Is overburdened Iran on the eve of a  counterrevolution?    [Rouhani] What occurred in Zahedan was a settling of scores  between Sunnis and Shiites. The spark came at a border post with  Pakistan, when a Revolution Guard member killed a Sunni  clergyman on grounds that he had committed the crime of murder  and fled to Rawalpindi. He was allowed no defense and the matter  was dubious. The city's Sunnis became agitated; their movement  was led by the son of the slain clergyman, Abdollah Shahinjashr.  The regular forces intervened and supported the Shiites, who  live in nearby Zabol. Matters developed and took on sectarian  dimensions, since the Shiites of Zabol opposed the Sunnis of  Zahedan. Revolution Guard units were immediately dispatched to  restore order in Zahedan and put down the uprising. Many of  their personnel were killed.    Undoubtedly, the inhabitants were in a state of rebellion  against the regime, which relies on weapons to impose its  control. In the midst of this hubbub, President Rafsanjani was  shot at. The attempt was one of a series and was not the first.  The shooter was an officer of the Revolution Guard. He was not  alone. About 50 suspects have been arrested on suspicion in that  operation.    Behind the events at home, Rafsanjani--at Friday prayers in  Tehran University--said that the Americans and Israelis wanted  to kill him. Security forces were deployed on a vast scale in  many cities. Minister of Intelligence and Security, 'Ali  Fallahian, personally took charge of the investigations into the  assassination attempt against Rafsanjani. Besides Zahedan, there  are at least three cities with a majority of Sunnis, whose  inhabitants hate the regime. The most important of these cities,  in addition to Zahedan, are the capital of the southern  Baluchestan region, Hashtbar on the Caspian Sea, and Gonbd-e  Kavus, near the border with Turkmenistan. Security forces, Basij  (volunteers from among the oppressed), and Revolution Guard  elements were deployed to suppress what appeared to be a Sunni  intifadah against the Tehran regime.    [Murtada] Are the Sunnis in Iran capable of convulsing the  regime, which is controlled by Shiites?    [Rouhani] Government estimates put the number of Iranian  Sunnis at 7 million, i.e., 12 percent of the total population of  59 million. Sunnis live in the Baluchestan area, where they are  the majority; the plains of Gorgan, on the border with  Turkmenistan; and some areas of Gilan on the Caspian Sea,  neighboring Azarbaijan. Iranian Kurds are Sunni, as are the  Arabs in the oil-rich Khozestan region. The state's strategy is  to prevent the rise of any Sunni to high office in the  administration or governmental pyramid, as well as the Armed  Forces, Revolution Guard, and state organizations. Sunni areas  are generally poor. Their educational and social levels have  been low since the Shah's time and have continued that way since  Khomeyni. There are feelings of rebellion against the regime and  its organizations, especially in light of attempts to force  Sunnis to embrace Shiism and the Twelver School.    The Iranian Constitution, whose drafting was supervised by  Khomeyni himself, envisions no role for minorities in Iran. It  asserts that Iran is a Shiite state, of the Ja'afari school. In  1979, a clause in this Constitution protecting the rights and  private affairs of minorities was rejected. It was declared that  Islam is the religion of the generality of the nation. It is no  coincidence that we see widespread Sunni solidarity with Zahedan.    [Murtada] However, Arab and foreign observers think that the  degeneration of the Iranian situation in general, and the  Zahedan uprising in particular, can be attributed to difficult  living conditions and the collapse of the Iranian rial exchange  rate vis-a-vis the dollar.    [Rouhani] Living conditions are extremely difficult. They  are  the fuse for the explosions and acts of unrest in many cities.  The middle classes are ground down by high prices. When  President Rafsanjani tried to abolish the government subsidy on  certain commodities, in accordance with the instructions from  the International Bank, Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i was  opposed. All of this coincides with a population explosion,  inflation, and foreign debts, which have reached $30 billion.  The amount spent on armament is unknown, but it is in the  neighborhood of 4 billion [dollars] annually. All of these  reasons result in semi-daily disturbances, which the regime  controls by arms. However, it is unable to deal with the  underlying causes.    [Murtada] Has the crisis over Marja'iat [Supreme Source of  Emulation] in Iran ended? Can the supreme leader, Khamene'i,  become the Supreme Marja'?    [Rouhani] In previous sermons, Ali Khamene'i has stated he  is  a moqalled [emulator] himself, not a Marja'. The rank of a  Marja' requires at least 30 years of practice in teaching and  writing books before one becomes the Supreme Marja'. From this  perspective, it is impossible for Khamene'i to become the  Marja', especially since he does not fulfill these conditions.    [Murtada] Is Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah in Beirut, who is  knowledgeable and spiritually influential, entitled to become  the Marja'? Would it be incumbent upon him, therefore, to leave  the southern suburb, in order to settle in Qom?    [Rouhani] Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah studied under the Grand  Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani, who is my brother. He is considered  a supreme Marja' now. He now lives in the holy city of Qom,  which was his birthplace. Fadlallah is not entitled to be a  supreme Marja', so long as his teacher is alive, and he is the  Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Rouhani.    [Murtada] What developments do you expect on the domestic  political scene following the Zahedan incidents?    [Rouhani] Generally, the situation is unstable; disturbances  occur each day. Groups rise up against the regime. Killings  happen, and citizens are detained. From this perspective, Iran  is atop a volcano. I see a civil war coming in two or three  years. This is what the West doesn't understand. The  socioeconomic situation is difficult. Unemployment is a time  bomb, because it affects more than half the labor force. The  government cannot do anything with regard to the situation.    In the Shah's days, Iran's oil profits were about $50  billion  each year. The Shah ruled Iran for 37 years and came to power 12  years before Mosadeq, i.e., 1320H in the Iranian solar calendar  (1941). Mosadeq fell in 1333H (1953). The Shah continued in  power for 25 years after Mosadeq. During his reign, oil profits  were in the range of $50 billion per year. Iran's population was  around 35 million. Today, oil profits are $12 billion a year,  while the population is around $60 million. In addition to this  large gap, wealth, capitalists, and experts have fled abroad.  Major factories are either destroyed, or their owners have taken  their funds to the West. The country went through eight years of  war. I should mention that Rafsanjani revealed dreadful numbers  after the war. He said that 25,000 cities, towns, and hamlets  were destroyed with, at least, one-half million persons killed.  Now, their families are a burden on the state. This government  does not inspire confidence. It vacillates before problems that  remain unsolved.    I am a proponent of the dollar model. In the Shah's time,  for  example, I did not praise it. Everyone knows that I opposed it.  The dollar was equal to six tomans while, today, it is the  equivalent of 150 tomans. This is a large disparity in the rate  of exchange, and means the state's economic structure is in  ruins. In these circumstances, no one trusts the regime that has  gotten us into indebtedness to the choking point, with all the  debt services and commitments.    [Murtada] But, President Rafsanjani has showered promises to  reform the situation on more than one occasion.    [Rouhani] In my view, even if Rafsanjani wanted to do  anything, he could not because, first, he doesn't know the  mechanisms of the economy, nor does anyone in the government at  this difficult and complex stage. Naturally, he can call for  assistance from men of expertise and competence in the economic  and political arena, but he does not trust them. In general, the  regime does not trust Iranians abroad. Usually, they are  specialists. Today we have about 100,000 specialists abroad.  There are around 3 million exiles. Unfortunately, these capable  people are absent from Iran, living in Europe or the United  States. They don't trust the regime enough to return. Those who  dared to return were unable to do anything. So they packed their  bags and left the country again. They did not feel secure or  safe. The regime did not inspire them with confidence. Moreover,  the suspicion was mutual, and the upshot was Iran lost its  capabilities.    [Murtada] These days, many are talking about the second  five-year plan to boost the country's economy.    [Rouhani] Iranian five-year plans are pretty on paper;  implementation is another story. The government has been  incapable of applying what it plans for the last 15 years. The  next month is worse than the last month. The past is prettier  than the present. Today, we cannot say that Iran's situation in  various fields and areas is better then yesterday. The entire  regime is in a critical predicament, and its important men and  prominent figures know that better than anyone else.    [Murtada] In that case, how do you explain the arms  expenditure. Is it unreal in any way? Why guns before bread and  at its expense, as it appears from your reading of the situation?    [Rouhani] The Shah's regime did not respect the citizens'  freedom and gave not a fig for them. It feared foreigners, and  the present regime is maintaining this shahinshah principle. It  attaches no importance either to human rights, or to the United  Nations, the so-called international community. The arms  expenditures benefit a million armed men who protect the regime.  The regular army numbers one-half million; the Pasdaran about  300,000; and the rest, i.e., 200,000, are police, security  personnel, and secret police. This million forms the regime's  power, and its financial weight pours into their palms. The  regime's goal is to satisfy these elements and comply with their  needs. There is a wall between the people and the regime. By  chance, I asked one of my relatives who lives in Qom to bring me  some Iranian bread, which we call "Sangak." It is good bread. I  tell you that I cannot eat just one bite of it. It is black and  flavorful. No one knows what it is made of. This bitter bread is  eaten by 40 million Iranians. They eat it with cheese and milk.  This is the life of Iranians today. The people are in mourning  today, wandering aimlessly in misery. They are suffering from  difficulties that appear impossible to solve.    [Murtada] Do the president and the leader, that is  Rafsanjani  and Khamene'i, form one team, or does each one play his  political game within the power structure? Are differences a  natural occurrence, or are conflicts concealed?    [Rouhani] Contrary to what some say regarding disputes and  differences between the two men, although their points of view  are different, I believe that they coalesce and are in accord. I  have learned that in a recent leadership meeting in Tehran,  Khamene'i called for alliance with Iraq, because it opposes the  Americans and the West in general. In contrast, Rafsanjani  called for openness to the West. However, the different  viewpoint does not mean that the two men are quarreling. Each  one has his opinion but, in the end, there will be complete and  total agreement between them. Disagreement might lie in  distribution of roles. Rafsanjani always concentrates in his  speeches on the importance of relations with the West in order  to safeguard the regime, while Khamene'i sees the opposite. He  looks for reasons for the regime to stay in alliance with the  weak, with states outside the West's influence. However, the two  do agree on the principle of division of power. One is president  of the republic; the other is leader of the revolution. The  regime is based on the principle of division.    [Murtada] Where do "conciliation" efforts between Washington  and Tehran stand? Why hasn't normalization occurred, despite  Rafsanjani's desire for normal relations? Why hasn't the West  supported his efforts, so long as he is a counter-revolutionary  Trotsky? Is it true that Washington considers him a part of the  regime that it cannot trust in whole or part?    [Rouhani] The readings and analyses vary in this regard. I  am  sure that the Americans do not trust the Iranian regime, nor its  leading figures. Therefore, they ignore it, although they have  not granted it a respite. It seems to me from meetings with  Western officials that they are in no hurry to have normal  relations with the Iranian regime. They will impose their  conditions. The matter is no longer as it was in the past,  during the time of the Soviet Union and the dual polarization.  They are letting the Iranian regime chase after their heels and  not the reverse. Khamene'i's anti-American slogans are mere  words for internal consumption. In any event, the record is worn  out. No one listens anymore, even those who once believed in its  content.    [Murtada] Is there any close relationship between you and  the  spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, Hasan  Rouhani?    [Rouhani] There is no close relationship. Hasan Rouhani is  from Semnan; I am from Qom. His father is a religious scholar,  and he is also a religious scholar. His surname is "Alemi." He  is the official spokesman for the Supreme National Security  Council, which has 12 members, including Khamene'i, Rafsanjani,  the Ministers of Interior and Security, and Ahmad Khomeyni. It  is the highest political-military power in Iran and makes the  major decisions on all levels.    [Murtada] How could the situation develop in Iran in the  near  future, in light of the Zahedan challenges?    [Rouhani] The situation might go from bad to worse. The  regime is off balance and unstable.    [Murtada] What is the alternative to the regime? The  domestic  opposition? The Abol-Hasan Bani Sadr wing in the regime?    [Rouhani] The alternative might be a moderate Islamic  regime,  not the Islam that the present regime espouses. I mean a regime  that respects principles of Islamic justice and freedom. One  cannot offer hypotheses in this regard. The alternative is a  regime composed of a supreme council, whose strength is 400 or  500 persons. This council elects a nucleus of 10 to 12 persons  to rule the country. Free elections should then follow.  Everything depends on the people's free choice and  consciousness. They want tangible results.    I am one who calls for free elections. This means finally  turning the page of the Valay-e Faqih [Supreme Jurisprudent]. As  a jurist, I believe that Vali-ye Faqih is not a religious  principle, because it is a man's power over people. For example,  how can a religious scholar who knows nothing about arms,  military strategies, and the tactics of complex modern warfare,  presume to build an army and determine its type of weaponry, in  addition to its training? The same question also pertains to the  economic structure. It is very complex and delicate. The  cultural structure is no less complex for its part. Are  financial issues simple? I believe that Velayat-e faqih died  with Khomeyni and his legacy has been replaced by Vali-ye Amr  [Guardian of the Muslim Cause], i.e., the ruler or sultan.  Khamene'i, now, is Vali-ye Amr. As for the beiat [pledge of  allegiance], that is claimed by Rafsanjani, the elected  president. I think that all of this nomenclature touches the  people's religious sensibilities and strives for religious  legitimacy. The words and titles are pretty, but what is  important is managing the country and the results achieved.    [Murtada] Why dissolve the regular army? Why have attempts  been unsuccessful to merge it with the Revolution Guard forces?    [Rouhani] In a state like Iran, where all are subjects of  Vali-ye Faqih and vali-ye Amr, there is no place for a regular  army. These things must be done away with, before starting to  rebuild regular military structures, seeking help from experts  and technicians. The religious scholars should be excluded from  this; they might be proficient in religious jurisprudence, but  they don't know the requirements for a modern military  structure. This separation is a must.    [Murtada] Who is the Shiites' supreme Marja' today, after  the  death of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpaygani?    [Rouhani] Grand Ayatollah Mohammad 'Ali Araki. He is over  100  years old. I know him personally, very well. I attended a study  group with him, conducted by Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Khansari in  Qom. Araki is a pious man, but he is reaching the end of his  life, so that he no longer knows what is happening in Iran. One  of my friends called on him last year to talk with him and get  his views. My friend was astonished when Araki asked him about  Imam Khomeyni's health. He believed that Araki didn't know that  Khomeyni had been dead for five years. He apologized for the  question. He said: "I didn't know that. May Khomeyni live with  God in His Paradise." He was chosen the Shiites' supreme Marja'  precisely because he doesn't know what's going on in the  country, because there is the concern to maintain the regime, no  matter the cost. Araki supports the Vali-ye Faqih, while others  may reject it.    Now, every grand ayatollah is in Qom. There is no longer one  in holy Najaf. It is impossible for Khamene'i to become the  supreme Marja', because this selection depends on the people and  their faith. According to the Constitution, Khamene'i is the  effective head of state. He has the final word in all political  matters. Rafsanjani, in fact, is head of the Cabinet, with the  title of president of the republic. Today, he is less  influential than he used to be. Once he was a trusted advisor,  close to Khomeyni. I think that this is the basic reason for the  West's indifference vis-a-vis Rafsanjani, and his attempts at a  policy of openness toward it. He is being held back by radicals.    [Murtada] Why are Iranian-Gulf relations fluctuating warily,  despite serious Gulf initiatives, based on a desire for good  neighborliness. Then, the occupation of Abu Musa Island occurred  to reveal an overt expansionism?    [Rouhani] I think the Gulf states do not trust the Iranian  regime. A climate of confidence is basic in good-neighbor  relations. When I refer to the government in Iran it occurs to  me, in the first place, that firm relations ought to be  established with Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states. I can  well understand Gulf wariness vis-a-vis the Tehran regime and  its flip-flops. Abu Musa compounded this situation and,  unfortunately, caused alienation. Words alone will not eliminate  the suspicion and distrust.    [Murtada] One last question. The Islamic Revolution came to  power in 1979 and raised the slogan of just rule. Fifteen years  later, we see that the abyss has deepened between the rich and  the poor. That is what overthrew the Shah's regime. Does this  gap, now, represent a main danger point against the ruling  regime? Will history repeat itself, with another mark in Iran?    [Rouhani] Rafsanjani himself admitted that the gap is  growing  between the haves and the have-nots, between the wealthy and the  poor, which was the crux of the demonstrations against the Shah.  Now, class tensions are rising on the eve of the 16th year of  the Iranian Revolution. I think that this gap is a major danger  point for the regime which, as I expect, will be subjected to  major tremors even before the end of President Rafsanjani's  second term in three years. The president is a candidate to be  eliminated, since he is not affiliated with a well-known  religious family, as is the case with the leader, Ali Khamene'i,  who is the son of Ayatollah Javad Khamene'i and the nephew of  Shaykh Mohammad Khiabani, leader of the Tabriz revolt during the  Constitutional Revolution in Iran.    Rafsanjani is from a small village called Bahreman in  southern Iran. It is part of the city of Rafsanjan, in the  Kerman Province. During the Shah's regime, he fled to Iraq and,  then, to Syria and Lebanon, where he received assistance from  Imam Musa al-Sadr. His wish was to transform the revolution into  a state, but he immediately clashed with positions of power. As  a result, he has backed off his project in favor of maintaining  his seat in power. He is now completely in a semi-defensive  condition. He has lost his gamble on economic reform. I am sure  that his goal has been limited to continuing in power until the  end of his term. He is no longer likely to introduce reforms  into this situation, whose difficulties have apparently gone out  of control, especially in light of the collapse of oil prices,  the population numbers, the paucity of production, and the  decline in the currency exchange rate. I see no light at the end  of the tunnel. Unfortunately, bitter bread or "sangak" has  become the first concern that keeps various classes of society  sleepless, and makes them take to the streets.</p>

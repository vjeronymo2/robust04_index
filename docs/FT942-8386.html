			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fine Art rises 12% to Pounds 38m Fine Art Developments, the mail order and greetings cards group, pushed pre-tax profits up 12 per cent to a record Pounds 38.1m for the year to March 31. The shares rose by 11p to 505p. The result includes Pounds 1.53m from James Galt, the educational toy maker acquired for Pounds 13.5m in July last year. Galt contributed Pounds 13.4m to total group turnover of Pounds 317.2m, just 2 per cent ahead of last time's Pounds 311.5m. Pre-tax profits for 1992-93 were Pounds 33.9m, including total gains of Pounds 2.5m from disposals. Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, described the latest year as difficult. But the management had done a lot of groundwork which would lead to benefits this year, he said. Without the acquisition of Galt, turnover and operating profit in the mail order division would have been marginally lower. In fact, the division's operating profit rose from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 23.8m on turnover of Pounds 180.6m (Pounds 171m). The merging of Galt with Hope Education had achieved significant benefits. Hope lifted turnover 16 per cent and continued to win market share. Sales at the agency mail order business were down 3 per cent. Express Gifts sales were hurt by poor take-up after catalogues were requested. In the light of subsequent market research the catalogue has been redesigned to make ordering easier, and prices have been reduced. The group is also introducing interest bearing credit following requests from 50,000 customers. Operating profit in the cards and paper products division rose from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 19.8m, while turnover declined from Pounds 140.5m to Pounds 136.5m. However, excluding disposals divisional sales were 5 per cent ahead. Mr Chapman said that Britannia Products, the greetings card publisher, lifted sales in both the private label and branded businesses. Net interest payments were down from Pounds 7.69m to Pounds 5.54m. Gearing was 52 per cent (39 per cent) at the end of the year, reflecting the Galt acquisition. The group aims to get it back below 40 per cent this year. Earnings per share rose by 9 per cent from 29.54p to 32.29p. A final dividend of 11p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 14.3p, 12 per cent up on last time's 12.75p. COMMENT Another record result has helped to reassure the City after the hiccup of the interims, when teething problems with a new distribution system emerged and an aggressive marketing campaign failed to win growth in the mail order business. As a low-cost card producer, a small degree of recovery will quickly feed through to the bottom line. The credit scheme should generate some growth in mail order sales, and the group is keen to exploit Galt to the full. With profits of Pounds 43m pencilled in for this year, the shares are on a multiple of 14.5. which looks attractive.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A NERVOUS futures market saw a mostly firm day's trading turn into a late slide as traders declared themselves disappointed with the chancellor's statement, writes Christopher Price. The December contract opened at 2,729 and was squeezed up from thereon in anticipation of some tangible signs from the government that growth policies would be pursued. The contract peaked around lunchtime at 2,765 - a new contract high - before nerves set in and a bout of sideways trading followed. However, the chancellor's speech failed to impress the market, with most measures announced already discounted, according to traders. December began to tumble, eventually closing at 2,745, up 28 from the previous day and at a slight premium to its fair value of around 17. In after-hours' trading, December came under more pressure, with traders forecasting a weak opening this morning. Its fair value range had peaked at 17 during the day, before narrowing in late selling. Turnover was 8,265 lots. In the traded options market, volume was a substantial 40,377 contracts, of which 10,275 was in the FT-SE 100 option. ASDA once again led the way with 9,201. This was followed by Land Securities, which saw 1,200 July 420 calls sold at 23p. Thames Water, on 2,306, and Scottish Power, on 1,970, were other sizeable trades.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUY WILLIAMS, 'ZORRO' OF TV SERIES, DIES AT 65  </P> <P> Guy Williams, the actor who starred in the popular 1950s television series  "Zorro," has died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, authorities there said Sunday. He  was 65.  </P> <P> Williams' body was found by police Saturday in his apartment in the exclusive  residential neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently suffered a heart attack  and died about a week ago, the government news agency Telam reported. An  investigation was begun to confirm the exact cause of death.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 3-inch second-generation Italian-American, whose real name was  Armando Catalano, was chosen by Walt Disney Studios to portray Zorro on the  small screen in a role made famous in motion pictures by Douglas Fairbanks Sr.  and later by Tyrone Power.  </P> <P> The television series recounted the adventures of Zorro and his alter-identity,  Diego de la Vega, a seemingly spoiled son of a Spanish aristocrat.  </P> <P> De la Vega presented himself, to the chagrin of his father, as a disinterested  and apathetic overseer of a ranch in the section of 1820s colonial California  that was to become Los Angeles. When confronted with injustice, De la Vega  secretly transformed into a Robin Hood-like defender of his countrymen against  the abuses of Spanish overlords.  </P> <P> Zorro identified himself to villains and victims with trademark bullwhip, black  mask, cape and -- perhaps most endearing to audiences -- his signature of using  his foil to "make the sign of the Z" at the site of an escapade.  </P> <P> Extensive previous training in fencing helped Williams get the part in the  series, which was produced from 1957 to 1959. It continues to run on the Disney  Channel.  </P> <P> Williams also starred as professor John Robinson in the 1965-1968 series "Lost  in Space," portraying the patriarch of a futuristic family on a space  exploration mission gone awry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family in Space  </P> <P> The series followed the family in their sabotaged spaceship as they tried to  find their way home from a neighboring solar system.  </P> <P> Between the two television series, Williams starred in two movies that won him  little attention: "The Prince and the Pauper" in 1962 and "Captain Sinbad" in  1963.  </P> <P> The son of an insurance broker, Williams grew up in New York City, where he  attended public schools. After graduating from high school, he attended a  military academy. Williams' father wanted him to pursue an insurance brokerage  career, but Williams got into modeling and subsequently acting.  </P> <P> Williams was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires and had apparently lived there  alone for the last several months.  </P> <P> Williams had two children with wife Janice Cooper, a former model. A son,  Steven, was born in 1952 and a daughter, Toni, was born in 1957.  </P> <P> There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.  </P></p>

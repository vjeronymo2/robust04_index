The Premier, Li Peng, shortly afterwards ordered a State  Council inspection team to visit the scene of three separate  incidents in Yichang county, where an immediate injection of  funds was promised to resolve the problem, a Yichang city  official said.    But Beijing may be concerned that the provincial and local  governments have orchestrated or turned a blind eye to the  protests in order to draw the central government's attention to  the plight of the displaced people, most of whom have received  little or no compensation and remain in temporary housing. A  mass propaganda rally will run for three days from Sunday in  Yichang city. The Hubei Governor, Jia Zhijie, will officiate  and hopes this will attract national press coverage.    Lu Youmei, the president of the State Council's China Three  Gorges Development Corporation in Beijing, has been persuaded to  give a speech at the rally. A former vice-minister of water  conservancy and of energy resources, Lu is expected to pledge  Beijing's "all-round support" to solve the resettlement problem.    Details of the new year resettlement flare-ups are scant,  but  it is understood that resistance to resettlement has been most  acute among the elderly, whose job opportunities in new areas  are poor and who are worried the 90 renminbi (about HK$80) per  month promised to resettled pensioners may not materialise.  "The protests were quite superficial, but Beijing took notice  of them," one official said.    Sources in Yichang said the freezing weather in January  exacerbated discontent among more than 5,000 residents who had  been left in flimsy temporary housing because of slow progress  at new housing sites in Zigui and Xingshan counties. "In fact,  not a single family has moved into new permanent housing,  because of slow progress and a lack of funds," one official  said. Most of the 5,000 Yichang settlers were promised they  would spend the Spring Festival in new houses far superior to  what they left behind. Misuse of compensation funds earmarked  for residents has intensified resentment.    Compensation commitments for each family range from a few  thousand to as much as RMB 80,000, depending on the size and  condition of the housing that will be lost, which has also  stirred a great many charges of unequal treatment.    Yichang's government had initially agreed only to offer  subsidies of RMB 20,000 to RMB 30,000 to residents, leaving some  without enough funds to build new homes. "The living conditions  of these people have deteriorated very rapidly because the  expected support from Beijing has not materialised," one  official said.    Following the protests, Beijing agreed to bolster the RMB  44m  set aside by the provincial and local governments for the proper  resettlement of the 5,000 people. It also promised to speed up  approval of privileged policies similar to those in special  economic zones to draw foreign investment into the public  facilities and cheap housing sectors. "Foreign interest in  resettlement projects has been minimal, but we realise this is  part of the `all-round support' needed if we are to avoid future  disturbances," an official said.    The situation has rekindled memories of communist China's  resettlement efforts of the past, which Beijing admits have left  3 million people in dire straits since 1949. About 100,000  people in Hubei province and 950,000 people in Sichuan province  will be moved by the year 2000 to make way for the dam. An  additional 10,000 Yichang residents should be resettled in the  next few years. [passage omitted]</p>

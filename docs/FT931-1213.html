			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Import curbs raise hopes for Cretan bananas - EC quotas on 'dollar' fruit offers a chance to regain lost markets COLLAPSING greenhouses covered in tattered plastic testify to the rapid decline of banana-growing in Crete since Greece was forced to lift a ban on imports four years ago. Production has dropped from more than 20,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1980s to about 5,000 tonnes last year, covering only about 10 per cent of Greek demand. However, the European Community's decision to impose quotas on Latin and Central American bananas, the source of most Greek imports, offers Cretan growers a chance of recovering lost markets on the Greek mainland. 'Local growers are giving up because they can't compete with imports on price. But if the quotas stick, they could get back in because consumption is going up,' says Mr George Atzolidakis, an agronomist with the Siteia Development Organisation in eastern Crete. 'The selling point for Cretan bananas is that they're grown using very little fertiliser and pesticide. We've persuaded some producers to give up chemicals entirely in favour of dung and insect predators.' While demand for bananas is rising steadily, Greek per capita consumption, at about 5 kg, is still less than half the EC average. Like eastern Europeans, many Greeks had never tasted a banana before the late 1980s. A military dictatorship 20 years ago imposed a ban on banana imports, in an effort to promote production in Crete. The ban was maintained after Greece joined the EC on grounds of protecting the Cretan growers. It took a long legal battle, led by would-be banana importers who took their case to the European Court of Justice, before imports were permitted. The small fibrous Cretan banana, descended from plants brought from Egypt a century ago, was always unlikely to attract consumers. It was only after new varieties were introduced from Israel, together with cultivation methods developed in the Canary Islands, that Cretan bananas started to appear Athens. Cretan growers, mainly in the east and south of the island where winter temperatures are close to North African levels, spent Dr10bn (Pounds 30m) on plastic-covered greenhouses and drip watering systems. When production was at its height, there were almost 500 hectares of greenhouses for bananas in Crete. Only 100 hectares are still in use, and most Cretan bananas are sold on the island, with tourists among the biggest consumers. 'We did very well when the producer price was Dr600 a kg. But at less than Dr250 you might as well go back to olives and vines unless you happen to enjoy growing bananas,' says Mrs Popi Basias, a grower in Siteia. Imported bananas are still subject to a Dr195 a kilogram tax, intended to help keep the Cretan producers in business, although it is due to be phased out by the end of 1993 under single market rules. However, wholesalers in Athens are reluctant to handle Cretan bananas, while admitting their quality is better than fruit from Costa Rica and Colombia. 'Cretan bananas taste good but they're smaller and have a less attractive appearance than the imports. And even if we start importing more African and Caribbean bananas because of the quotas on dollar bananas, the Cretan product can't really compete,' says Mr Myron Mavrikides of Chiquita Hellas, Greece's largest banana importer.</p>

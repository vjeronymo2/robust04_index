			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Retailers win supply rights for newspapers Independent retailers have won greater access to supplies of newspapers from wholesalers after a lengthy debate about the newspaper distribution industry. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission found last December that newspaper wholesalers operated a complex monopoly and that some practices - refusing supplies in an area they judged to be adequately served - operated against the public interest. There was, however, a fear among existing newsagents that a sudden increase in new outlets might disrupt the distribution network and undermine the sale-or-return system and home delivery of newspapers. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that subject to satisfactory undertakings he had decided to accept a new industry code of practice, rather than introducing a statutory order prohibiting practices found to be against the public interest, as he had warned. The code, put forward by the Association of Newspaper and Magazine Wholesalers, will define conditions under which a new retailer will have a right of access to newspaper supplies. Established retailers will be able to sub-retail or transfer copies within 500 metres from their outlets in urban areas and 1km in other areas. New retailers will have to meet a minimum weekly order of 50 per cent of average orders for the area and pay a returnable deposit equal to three weeks' supplies. There will be a right of appeal in the case of disputes to a new body to be set up under the code. Mr John Gardner, managing director of VG, the convenience store group which led a campaign for greater access to newspaper supplies, yesterday welcomed the outcome. He said: 'Independent grocers will now be able to offer newspapers to their customers. For decades now newsagents have been able to sell groceries, but grocers were denied the right to sell newspapers. These unfair practices have now been abolished.' The minister has asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to negotiate satisfactory undertakings from the wholesalers that they will keep to the terms of the code of practice.</p>

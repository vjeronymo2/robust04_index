			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Observer: Stopwatch Andre Agassi, the 22-year-old tennis champion, was wearing a wrist watch when he won Wimbledon the other day, and it was almost certainly made by Ebel, the Swiss watchmaker which has been sponsoring him for four seasons. So why isn't Ebel highlighting the fact in its advertising campaign? An advert in last Friday's Independent focused on Agassi's victory in an obscure Frankfurt tennis tournament in November 1990 and mentioned a few other events which Agassi had failed to win. But no word of the most famous victory of all. Perhaps Ebel's advertising agency should be sent to the menders.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> AROUND TOWN;  </P> <P> WHAT'S IN STORE FOR MEN?;  </P> <P> POLITIX: BASIC STYLES TAKE A COLORFUL TWIST FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  </P> <P> Black is L.A.'s unofficial fashion color, but no one has let Politix in on the  secret. At a recent show of the chain's holiday and spring menswear, color was  rampant: olive trousers, orange jackets, mustard suits, shirts striped with  orange, green and violet.  </P> <P> The eye-popping components are aimed at both the adventurous man shopping for  himself and Hollywood stylists shopping for film wardrobes. In response to  "what's new?" Zareh Khederlarian, executive vice president of operations, put  the company's studio services department, which caters to stylists, at the top  of his list.  </P> <P> "In Living Color" is one television show already using Politix's concept of  European chic, which is definitely not geared toward the button-down crowd.  Although there was a button-down shirt in the show -- with a collar and buttons  so oversized they looked like a child's rendition of what Daddy wears to  corporate headquarters.  </P> <P> The Politix man would wear that shirt to his office along with a sack suit,  another spring offering. The sack, of course, "is not for the customer who  wants a perfect-fitting suit. It's not for the Brooks Brothers man," explains  Viken Momdjian, who with his brother, Asbed, founded Knockalong Ltd., the  London-based manufacturing company that spawned Politix.  </P> <P> "The exaggerated button-down is exactly the thing we are trying to do. Classics  with a twist," adds Khederlarian. "It's not something our customer would be  offended to wear. You'd be surprised, but more than 50% of them are lawyers and  businessmen."  </P> <P> Which means you might find your lawyer wearing a hooded shirt with his sport  coat. Or he might have on a purple double-breasted suit with some of the widest  lapels you've ever seen. Underneath will be a striped shirt -- striped, that  is, in shades of copper and mustard.  </P> <P> In addition to distinctive colors and shapes in moderate-priced merchandise  (shirts in the show ranged from $75 to $98; trousers $89 to $115; jackets $225  to $275), Politix is big on details. The latest round includes those huge  lapels, jackets with microscopic back vents, eye-catching buttons and unusual  seaming. The belts are handsomely tooled and the suede shoes, both lace-up and  slip-ons, come in catchy combinations, including rust and green.  </P></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Lloyd's is attacked over filling top job A GROUP of leading agents at Lloyd's is to press for a change in management style amid concern over the way a new chief executive is being chosen. The insurance market's senior appointments committee interviewed candidates from what is understood to be a final shortlist on Friday, scarcely two days after the approval of radical changes to the market's management and regulation. The changes, suggested by a team led by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, would alter radically the job of the chief executive. The appointee would lead a new market board and spearhead efforts to improve efficiency and profitability at Lloyd's, which last month announced its biggest losses. Sir Jeremy was appointed to head a re-examination of the issues raised earlier this year by the Rowland task force's report on the market's governance. As well as recommending the creation of a market board - to be elected by representatives of leading businesses at Lloyd's - he proposed that the role and size of the council, which both regulates and administers the market, should be reduced. He also said that another new body, led by an independent chairman, should take over regulation. But agents argue that Lloyd's is acting too quickly and should implement the broader package of reforms before it makes any new executive appointments. 'They are taking the thing completely the wrong way around - it is the cart before the horse,' said the chairman of one of the biggest of the underwriting agencies, which manage the affairs of Names - the individuals whose capital backs the market. Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that candidates for the post had been interviewed last week and said that an appointment 'may well be made' by the end of this month. It said it did not believe a final decision had been taken, but that Lloyd's was keen to press ahead with the appointment as part of reforms foreshadowed in the Rowland report. The agents are also critical of the role in the selection process of Mr Alan Lord, the former chief executive, who attended the selection meeting in an ex officio capacity. Mr Lord, who retired last month, opposed the suggested reforms as presented by the Rowland task force. The critics suggest that a new chairman should be elected before other changes are made. Mr David Coleridge, now in his second year as chairman, is expected to retire later this year. His successor is not yet known. Although a headhunting team has been searching for a new chief executive for more than six months, critics argue that uncertainty about the market's future would be off-putting to many potential applicants. 'If I were considering it I wouldn't be prepared to respond to a headhunter until I'd seen the Morse report,' said one agent. 'The best people have to be discovered and persuaded. The council has got to be seen to take radical steps.' Another senior figure said: 'It seems to me they are in too much of a hurry to settle this. Lloyd's either acts frighteningly quickly or very slow.'</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Germany urged to restore 40-hour week A LEADING German industrialist sought yesterday to reverse the trend to shorter working hours and called for the return of the 40-hour week. Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German chambers of industry and commerce, said Germany had the shortest working times, the longest holidays and the youngest pensioners. Moves to shorten the German working week are still taking place despite growing unemployment. Engineering workers, for example, are due this year to cut their working week from 37 to 36 hours. Mr Stihl conceded that unions would probably block a return to a 40-hour week, but said there was more chance that of getting Germans to retire later. 'Retirement under 60 must become a thing of the past. Otherwise Germany will be sent into retirement in terms of international competition,' Mr Stihl added. Meanwhile, the German government yesterday told employers that its solidarity pact for east Germany was on course, with a supplementary budget and savings package ready to become law by the middle of the year. Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister of state in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office, sought to reassure members of the German employers' federation (BDA) that negotiations with the 16 federal states could produce a deal on sharing the burden of subsidies to the east by the middle of March. The financial agreement between the central government and the federal states is the most complex item still to be finalised in the proposed solidarity pact. The other major element where agreement is outstanding is a deal with trade unions to slow down the growth of wages in east Germany.</p>

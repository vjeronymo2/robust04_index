			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The resignation of Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is unlikely to lead to a major  change in Tokyo's economic ties with the United States, a senior  trade ministry official said Friday.    However, Hosokawa's surprise announcement may set back the  resumption of the stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo  and Washington, said the official at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, who declined to be named.    But he quickly added the fundamentals of the accord reached  between the previous Japanese administration of Kiichi Miyazawa  and U.S. President Bill Clinton last July to establish a new  framework are still valid.    Hosokawa took over Miyazawa's trade policy toward the U.S.  that rules out the use of numerical targets to measure the  results of Japan's efforts to boost imports and the next prime  minister is likely also to respect the policy, the MITI official  said.    Although optimistic about the fundamental framework of  Japan's economic ties with the U.S., the official confirmed that  prospects for an early breakthrough in the bilateral trade talks  have become clouded following the latest political developments  surrounding Hosokawa.    Japan regarded the planned meeting between Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in  Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15 as "the best opportunity" to  open the way for resumption of the framework talks, the official  said.    "But the situation is now completely fluid," the official  said, noting it is "impossible to foresee developments still to  unfold," including even whether or not Hata will go to Morocco.    Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major  coalition member, has been tipped as a candidate to succeed  Hosokawa.    The premier's resignation also casts a shadow over Japan's  pledge to announce concrete market-opening measures by the end  of June or before the July summit of the seven major  industrialized countries in Naples, the MITI official said.    It is too early to say whether a schedule change regarding  the June market-opening package is necessary, but any prime  minister replacing Hosokawa should have "a stronger power base"  in order to get the framework talks rolling again, the official  said.    The official said Hosokawa's successor would not likely  "reverse the trend of deregulations" established by the Hosokawa  administration.</p>

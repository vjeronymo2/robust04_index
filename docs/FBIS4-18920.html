			<p>BFN     [Text] A sentence has been handed down in the trial  involving the terrorist attack on the Maison de France [in  August 1983] in Berlin. Former Stasi officer Vogt was sentenced  to four years in prison, but was released for the time being  [until the sentence becomes nonappealable]. The Berlin Court  considered it proven that the 51-year-old man had passed the  explosives for the attack on to terrorist Weinrich. With this,  the Stasi had provided active support for the terrorist attack.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: UAL tops expectations but warns of more cuts UAL, parent of United Airlines, yesterday revealed better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of Dollars 22m, or 54 cents a share. But it noted the results were still far from satisfactory and warned that further cost-cutting measures were necessary. The net income compared with a loss of Dollars 91m, or Dollars 3.80, in the same period of 1992 when vicious domestic fare wars and the effects of recession hurt the entire industry. At the operating level, UAL had earnings of Dollars 84m, compared with a deficit of Dollars 93m a year earlier. Operating revenues rose to Dollars 3.55bn from Dollars 3.14bn, while operating expenses were 7.1 per cent higher at Dollars 3.46bn. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, described the results as 'clearly unsatisfactory. While considerable progress was made on a relative basis on cost reduction, long-term viability in the domestic market requires substantial further reduction in unit costs'. Earlier this month, UAL's three main unions said they would make substantial wage concessions in exchange for a large equity stake in the company. Mr Wolf said the revenue performance continued to reflect fare discounting on domestic and North Atlantic routes as well as continued weak demand in the Pacific. United's cost per available seat mile fell 3.8 per cent to 9.09 cents in the quarter, largely as a result of a Dollars 400m annualised cost-cutting programme which started earlier this year. United's yield - passenger revenue per mile flown - rose to 12.30 cents in the second quarter from 12.14 cents a year earlier. Its load factor averaged 67.4 per cent, against 67.3 per cent the previous year. For the first half, UAL suffered a net loss of Dollars 115m, or Dollars 5.38 a share, excluding a one-time charge for debt retirement. A year earlier, UAL lost Dollars 199m, or Dollars 8.33, excluding the impact of accounting changes. Operating revenues for the first half rose 12.6 per cent to Dollars 6.88bn, while operating expenses were 8.5 per cent higher at Dollars 6.92bn.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                               The agricultural lobby--f resh from success in the 12 December  parliamentary election and format ion of one of the largest  factions in the State Duma--has quickly demonstrated its power by  winning cabinet approval of a program of government support for  state and collective farms that will cost trillions of rubles  and, according to reformers, set off a wave of inflation.  Deputy  Premier for agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha appears to have  orchestrated the drive, instigating the Agrarian faction in the  Duma to press for the new program and taking advantage of the  resignation of the cabinet's tight money defenders, First Deputy  Premier Yegor Gaydar and Deputy Premier Boris Fedorov, to push it  through the cabinet.  Although the program still must gain Duma  approval, the close cooperation between the powerful Agrarian  faction in the Duma and Zaveryukha in the cabinet, aided by a  sympathetic Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, has so far proved to be  a powerful force in the first post-election struggle over  resources.                                END SUMMARY     Zaveryukha, targeted by reformers as one of the cabinet's main  foes of reform and fiscal discipline, appears to have played the  central role in designing the new.agricultural program and in  organizing the cabinet's approval of it.  As the second part of a  two-pronged campaign, he encouraged Agrarian leaders in  parliament to press for greater financial support for agriculture  and manuevered within the government to pave the way for the  Agrarians' moves in parliament:     --On the eve of the 11 January opening of the Duma, Zaveryukha  and Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun met with the Agrarian  faction and spoke on the financial crisis in agriculture,  appearing to encourage them to press the cabinet for more money  for agriculture (Selskaya Zhizn, 11 January).     --An Agriculture Ministry report issued in early January said  that the government owed farms 1.3 trillion for agricultural  products purchased in 1993 and 800 billion in funds allocated to  agriculture but not delivered (Interfax, 14 January).  The  Agrarian faction in the Duma later used these figures in a  resolution calling on the cabinet to pay these debts.     --According to the 13 January Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the cabinet had  already prepared a draft decree "On Functioning of the  Agroindustrial Complex in 1994" apparently strengthening the role  of the Agriculture Ministry (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 13 January).  According to Deputy Finance Minister Aleksey Krasnopivtsev, the  decree called for 25.6 trillion rubles for agriculture (Interfax,  20 January).  At a mid-January conference on the decree,  Zaveryukha urged that the draft be submitted to the cabinet by 20  January (Interfax, 20 January).  Thus the decree was  substantially prepared before the Agrarian faction in the Duma on  19 January proposed a resolution calling for a decree "On  Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994."     --The Agrarian faction took up its part of the drive within days  after the Duma opened its first session on 11 January.  It moved  to both press agriculture's financial demands in the wake of  Gaydar's resignation on 16 January and to protect Zaveryukha  after Fedorov issued a 17 January ultimatum refusing to rejoin  the cabinet unless Zaveryukha was removed.  At the 19 January  Duma session, Chairman of the Duma's Agrarian Committee Aleksandr  Nazarchuk demanded immediate discussion of the agricultural  situation.  The Agrarian faction called on the Duma to approve a  statement defending Zaveryukha, assailing Fedorov as "personally  responsible for the financial catastrophe in agriculture," and,  using the figures in the Agriculture Ministry report, called on  the government to pay its debts to the farmers.  The Agrarians  also presented a resolution asking the Duma to call upon the  cabinet to adopt within five days a decree "On the Functioning of  the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994" which would satisfy the  financial demands of the agrarians (Segodnya, 2O January).  The  Duma rejected the statement as too extreme (ITAR-TASS, 19  January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 2O January), but adopted the  resolution (ITAR-TASS, Radio Rossii, 19 January; Sovetskaya  Rossiya, 20 January).     The resolution was approved only on the second vote and, to much  surprise, after receiving support from a highly unlikely side-  -Russia's Choice leader Gaydar (Radio Rossii, 19 January;  Segodnya, 20 January), whose party has been the main foe of the  Agrarians and whose tight money policies have stopped government  payments to farms.  The hostility between Gaydar and the  Agrarians had been reflected on the eve of the Duma opening when  Agrarian Party Chairman Mikhail Lapshin assailed Russia's Choice  for stating that it would not negotiate with "extremists" like  the Agrarian Party (Selskaya Zhizn, 11 January).  Journalists  were "amazed" at Gaydar's support for the Agrarians' resolution,  according to the 20 January Segodnya, which reported speculation  that he may have been motivated by suspicions that the cabinet  was already considering a decree on agricultural subsidies that  would be even more "destructive "--suspicions that were probably  well founded in view of Zaveryukha's activities.     --By 24 January, Zaveryukha told reporters that the cabinet had  prepared a draft decree on a program for the agroindustrial  complex in 1994 in response to the Duma's demand.  He said that  the program would pay 1.3 trillion to farms for their 1993  products, allow farms to postpone repayment of their 1993 credits  until the next harvest, and keep present state subsidies for  equipment, parts, fuel, and fertilizer.  He insisted the program  would cost the budget only 13-14 trillion, not the 26 trillion  that "monetarist-critics" were claiming, and that the budget "can  cope" with this amount (Segodnya, 25 January; Interfax, 26  January).     Chernomyrdin Cooperation     Zaveryukha has appeared to have Premier Chernomyrdin's support in  his efforts to boost spending on agriculture despite criticism  from reformist quarters.  The two traveled to a 25 January Orel  conference on agriculture in the Central Russian provinces and  made statements pledging large sums to agriculture, setting off  alarm among reformers that the cabinet was abandoning tight money  and selling out to the farm lobby.  According to the 26 January  Segodnya, Chernomyrdin promised 2.3 trillion to pay for  government debts to farms and large sums to develop Central  Russia's agriculture, while Zaveryukha promised even more--40  trillion for Central Russia by the year 2000--prompting the  premier to rebuke him for "excessive openness."  Novaya  Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 29 January said Chernomyrdin's promise of  2.3 trillion caused monetarists "to accuse the new cabinet of an  'economic coup'" and reported Yeltsin's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov's 27 January statement that the president was  dissatisfied with the cabinet's new agricultural policy.  Chernomyrdin quickly asserted that Zaveryukha's 4O trillion was  intended to cover agriculture all the way to the year 205O and  defended his deputy, complaining that he was being turned into a  "scapegoat" (Ostankino TV, 26 January).  Zaveryukha also  complained that the press was trying to discredit him (Izvestiya,  29 January).     Cabinet Approval     Zaveryukha scored a major success when the cabinet Presidium met  on 3 February and approved the decree "On Functioning of the  Agroindustrial Complex in 1994."  The Agriculture Ministry  declared the cost of the program mandated in the decree to be  14.2 trillion rubles, but critics objected that its real cost is  34 trillion rubles--or "22 billion dollars at the present  [exchange] rate" (Segodnya, Kommersant-Daily, 4 February; Andrey  Illarionov in the 8 February Izvestiya). (See Note 1 )  The  cabinet vigorously debated--for two and a half hours, according  to the 5 February Selskaya Zhizn--the cost of the program and how  the money would be used.  Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin  objected that the program would disrupt financial stabilization,  and Deputy Premier Anatoliy Chubays objected to provisions for  importing agricultural equipment (Izvestiya, 4 February).  Even  Chernomyrdin cautioned that support for agriculture must be  balanced against the need to prevent hyperinflation (Selskaya  Zhizn, 5 February), but he went along with the agricultural  lobby.     (Note 1) The session was closed and reporters were able to learn  details only from various participants, resulting in somewhat  differing accounts in Segodnya, Izvestiya, Nezavisimaya Gazeta,  and Selskaya Zhizn.  The pro-agricultural lobby paper Selskaya  Zhizn minimized the size of the program, declaring that it  totalled only 14 trillion, while the reports in the pro-reform  Segodnya, Izvestiya, and Kommersant-Daily stressed statements by  the Ministry of the Economy and Chernomyrdin aide Andrey  Illarionov that it would total over 34 trillion.     Reaction     The cabinet decision brought pleasure to the Agrarians but dismay  to reformers.  Although the decree reportedly did not meet  agricultural demands in full, Agrarian Party leaders at a 3  February news conference proclaimed themselves satisfied with it  and with the program's restoration of state orders for the main  agricultural products (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 4  February).  In contrast,  one of Chernomyrdin's top economic  advisers, leader of the premier's Analysis and Planning Group  Andrey Illarionov, protested that spending measures in the  program will set off hyperinflation and resigned.  Illarionov,  although a leader of Gaydar's 1992 Working Center for Economic  Reforms, had been chosen by Chernomyrdin to head the new Analysis  and Planning Group set up in April 1993 to help the new premier  deal with macroeconomics (Kommersant-Daily, 4 May 1993).  Illarionov told reporters after the cabinet meeting that the  January 1994 program provided not only 14.2 trillion of budget  subsidies but also 14.5 trillion credit for equipment and 6  trillion credit for the spring sowing--a total of 34.7 trillion.  He added that only 8.2 trillion of this 34.7 trillion can be paid  for with existing funds and the rest will come from credit  emissions and therefore boost inflation to 35 percent a month in  April and 50 percent in June and lead to an explosion of  "hyperinflation" (Izvestiya, Segodnya, 4 February).  In addition  to talking to reporters, Illarionov wrote an article published on  the front page of the 8 February Izvestiya assailing the cabinet  for caving in to the agricultural lobby and complaining that the  farmers are "feeding off the people" instead of feeding the  people.  Illarionov on 7 February sent a letter of resignation to  the premier, protesting the allocation of so many resources to  the "agroindustrial lobby," the cabinet's abandonment of its  anti-inflationary course, and the premier's reliance on  agricultural lobbyists (Russian TV, 7 February). (See Note 2)     (Note 2) A cabinet spokesman subsequently announced that  Illarionov had been fired for "violating labor discipline"  (giving lectures in Britain without informing the government) and  asserted that his statement of resignation over policy was just  an attempt to conceal his dismissal (Interfax, 8 February).     Implications     The quick post-election victory of the agricultural lobby over  reformers and monetarists dims prospects for holding back  inflation and fighting off similar claims by other segments of  the economy that are still dependent on government support.  Chernomyrdin, although voicing concern about inflation, stuck by  Zaveryukha and appeared to give the agricultural lobby most of  what it wanted.  With a big faction in the Duma and a close  alliance with the Communist Party faction, the Agrarians stand a  good chance of winning approval for their program when the  cabinet presents it to the Duma.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Boyko report: "LDPR Tries To Straighten Things Out </F> With the Privatizers"]    [Text] After adopting the budget, the State Duma at its  session yesterday undertook an energetic, although abortive,  attempt to suspend post-voucher privatization. A response from  the government -- a final approval of a corresponding program --  is to come today.    It seems that when he first addressed the State Duma,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in response to appeals by Anatoliy  Chubays to observe the time limit, let drop the phrase: "Mr.  Chubays, you will be watching the clock in Lefortovo! [prison]"  Yesterday's session confirmed the seriousness of the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's intentions.    The LDPR faction submitted to the Duma a bill with a  "telltale" name: "On Suspending the Process of Privatization in  Russia as of 1 July 1994 Pending Examination of the Results of  Voucher Privatization and Approval by the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly of a Concept and a State Program for  Post-Voucher Privatization." The Duma Council at its session  did not approve this move. The Council decided to find a  compromise and confine itself to an appeal to the president and  the prime minister. The draft appeal, submitted by  Privatization Committee Chairman Sergey Burkov, is effectively a  warning. It says that owing to lack of guarantees of ownership  rights for owners of former state property, the Duma will be  forced to suspend the law On Privatization of State and  Municipal Enterprises. Responsibility for this lies "with those  state officials who have failed to create a legal foundation for  this process." The appeal was not supported by the deputies.    Then Zhirinovskiy, stating that "behind each instance of  privatization there is a crime," demanded that the bill drafted  by his faction be passed immediately. It was supported by 194  deputies (226 votes were needed to pass it). As a result, "the  matter will be finalized" in the privatization and economic  policy committees.    It's now the government's turn. Sings are that the  post-voucher privatization program will be considered today. It  remains unclear, however, whether this program will be presented  to the Federal Assembly. On the one hand, until now Anatoliy  Chubays has insisted that the post-voucher program be enacted by  a presidential edict. His position is understandable: First,  there is little time, to put it mildly, for normal consideration  in parliament, and second, the Duma's intentions to punish  embezzlers and corrupt officials speak for themselves. On the  other hand, the State Duma's warning is serious enough.  Moreover, there is nothing to prevent the LDPR from regularly  moving its bill, which will hang like a sword of Damocles over  the government. In these conditions the likelihood of the  post-voucher privatization program's being presented to the  Federal Assembly increases. If this happens, Chubays will  apparently have nothing left to do but follow the fate of the  voucher and resign. While he found it possible to avoid this  move when the president ordered him to leave Moscow  privatization to Luzhkov, discussion in the Duma will have more  far-reaching consequences.</p>

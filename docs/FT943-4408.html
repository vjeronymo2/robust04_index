			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / S African ministers criticised The head of the communist allies of President Nelson Mandela's governing party hit out yesterday at the big salaries earned by South Africa's new rulers, Reuter reports from Soweto. Mr Charles Nqakula, general secretary of the South African Communist party, told trade union activists that the new rulers were in danger of representing only the bosses. 'It is scandalous that such huge amounts of money are squandered,' he told a meeting of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, an umbrella group with close ties to the communists. 'We pledge to continue the struggle. . . against the gravy train in the upper echelons of the public sector,' he added. The 'gravy train' comment hits a raw nerve in Mr Mandela's four-month-old government, which has been accused by such respected figures as Archbishop Desmond Tutu of enriching itself in the same way as the old white administrations.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Trade benefits of single market 'confirmed' The European single-market trading system has left the logistic departments of many UK businesses celebrating as they benefit from better trade structures, but drawn fire from company finance directors who face a new accounting headache. That is the message of a study released yesterday by the Customs and Excise board on the impact of the removal of community trade barriers on British companies. It comes at the end of the first full year of using the new trading and European Union statistical system, known as Intrastat. The study, based on a survey of 1,000 companies, reaffirms the department's earlier prediction that British business should reap at least Pounds 440m worth of benefit from the single market over the next five years - although it admits that many business people remain far from convinced about these gains. This savings figure is calculated through a 'cost/benefit' balance sheet which measures the impact of switching to the new regime. On the 'benefit' side, Customs calculates that last year companies saved about Pounds 151.97m because they no longer had to declare exports and imports at ports. They also saved Pounds 5.83m from cheaper community transit costs. On the 'cost' side, companies faced Pounds 97.33m start-up costs switching to the new system, which requires any company with an EU trade balance of more than Pounds 135,000 to submit trade statistics from in-house trading data. They also faced Pounds 3.99m of new annual operating costs because of the new system for value added tax returns. However, annual operating costs of the new system were only Pounds 40.444m a year - a figure that implies an annual saving of Pounds 134.981m to UK business as a whole, after the initial start-up costs. But in spite of the department's up-beat conclusion, it faces a difficult public relations job in getting this message across to business, Mr Mark Eland, Customs commissioner, yesterday admitted. Part of the problem, he said, was that the new system had created another accounting headache for company finance departments - even where the same company has benefitted through more efficient trade structures. Bigger companies have, unsurprisingly, born the brunt of the costs of Instrastat. Although the average switch-over cost for the 25,000 UK trading companies in the survey was calculated to be only Pounds 1,608, one large company quoted a cost of Pounds 1m. Smaller companies quoted start-up costs below predictions. The smallest trading companies have arguably seen the best benefits because they no longer face the cost of reporting their statistics at all. Benefits have also varied between sectors. While transport reported savings of 24 hours on road journeys to southern Europe, commodity trading groups have been more critical. Companies carrying out chain transactions in oil, for example, claim the system is penalising them because it fails to take account of the complexities of multiple purchases. Mr Eland says that Customs is lobbying the European Commission to 'tidy up' its VAT and trading directive - although officials within the Commission admit that change is unlikely to occur rapidly. With the next round of trade statistics due to be released tomorrow, Mr Eland said that an analysis of Intrastat would be issued tomorrow following widespread criticism from economists that the change-over to the new system had led to distortions in reporting the UK trade balance.</p>

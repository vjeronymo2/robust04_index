			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Prime minister of the  republic of Serb Krajina Borislav Mikelic on Tuesday [7 June]  assessed as positive the talks with a United States (U.S.)  non-government delegation and said he was confident that its  members would leave with quite different opinions about the Serb  people of Krajina than they had as a result of the anti-Serb  proganda abroad before their arrival. Mikelic met with the U.S.  delegation in Krajina's political center of Knin on Tuesday.  The delegation included many prominent former U.S. ambassadors  to the United Nations, influential diplomats and representatives  of the U.S. mass media, headed by the editor-in-chief of Time  magazine.    Mikelic and national security advisor to the Krajina  president General Mile Novakovic informed the visitors about the  current political situation in Serb-Croat relations and about  the genesis of the armed conflicts in the territory of former  Yugoslavia. The purpose of this visit was to review the  realization of the ceasefire agreement with Croatia and the  withdrawal of forces, and the conditions, efficiency and type of  work done by the members of the United Nations peace force in  the field.    The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in  Serb-populated parts of former Croatia in answer to Croatia's  secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority. Since March 1992, Krajina has  been a U.N.-protected area, which however, did not prevent  Croatia from attacking the area on four occasions, razing some  twenty Serb villages and killing more than a thousand civilians.    The agreement on a ceasefire and separation of forces, which  was signed by Krajina and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb in late March, became effective on April 4.</p>

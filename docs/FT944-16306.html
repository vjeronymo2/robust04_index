			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Radical reform of UN peacekeeping urged Radical reform of the United Nations system of crisis prevention, peacekeeping and humanitarian relief is called for in a hard-hitting post-mortem on the Rwanda emergency, published yesterday by the British charity Oxfam. The report places primary responsibility for the genocide, this summer, when up to 1m died, on extremist Rwandan politicians. But the international community and its most powerful member states have through 'complacency and inaction, contributed to the slaughter'. The catalogue of failure,it says, included: Failure to put sufficient pressure on the Rwandan government to comply with a UN special rapporteur's recommendations in August 1993, notably dismantling party militias. Pressure on the UN secretary-general to save money by cutting the UN force in Rwanda between October 1993 and March 1994. Arms supplies, notably by France and the US, to the previous Rwandan government, despite evidence of gross human rights violations. Cutting the UN force by 75% after 10 Belgian soldiers were killed in April 1994. Deliberate delay by major powers in the Security Council in setting up a new peacekeeping force. The US, according to Oxfam, 'took the lead in this shameful abdication of responsibility', refusing to acknowledge genocide was taking place and lobbying to confine the new force to border areas, despite 'clear evidence the majority under threat were within Rwanda'. Failure by the most powerful UN members to offer troops and failure to provide sufficient equipment and logistical support for troops offered by African states. As a result the second UN force did not arrive until months after killings began and 'genocide proceeded unabated and unopposed'. Oxfam admits it is unrealistic to suggest a UN force of 5,500 could have brought killings to an immediate halt. But 'the lame excuses of governments. . . have been given the lie by the successful protection of thousands of civilians by the rump UN force that remained in Kigali, by the ability of the French troops to restore security in the south-west, and by the speed with which Security Council members deployed troops when they chose to act, in response to the refugee crisis in Goma'.

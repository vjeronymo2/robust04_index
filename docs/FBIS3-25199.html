			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The leader of the Herstigte Nasionale Party  [Reformed National Party], Mr. Jaap Marais, has demanded that  the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] immediately withdraw  from the negotiations process. Mr. Marais said the leaders of  the Volksfront had no mandate from the Afrikaner people to  negotiate with the National Party and the ANC [African National  Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance. He  said that as soon as the AVF withdrew from the negotiations,  right-wing leaders could embark on a national campaign to inform  the volk [Afrikaner nation] of why they were refusing to  participate in the election.</p>

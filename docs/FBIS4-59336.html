			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of </F> the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by  Cairo radio correspondent Siham al-Buluk, place and date not  given; from "The Talking Newspaper" program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau member, secretary of the  YSP's Political and Foreign Relations Department, and envoy of  'Ali Salim al-Bid, we welcome you.    [Al-Dali] Thank you.    [Al-Buluk] Doctor, Yemen has accepted Arab mediation. We  know that an Arab League delegation has left for Yemen, seeking  to end this conflict which has pained all the Arabs. How much  can this mediation influence the crisis?    [Al-Dali] Doubtless the Arab League's mediation and the  arrival of an Arab League delegation is joyful news to us. We  formerly asked the Arab League and its secretary general, Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al- Majid for their good offices to end the crisis.  I believe that the arrival of an Arab League delegation is a  favorable sign that the other side is willing to accept the  League's mediation in this crushing ordeal and continuing  attrition on our good land, Yemen.    [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, when people heard that  Yemen was rejecting Arab mediation, it created widespread  frustration and raised questions about the Arab League's role.  However, when the mediation was accepted, this provided proof of  the League's strength and influential role.    [Al-Dali] This is true. We of the YSP, including Secretary  General 'Ali Salim al-Bid, expressed a willingness to accept the  Arab initiative right from the start. Regrettably the other  side, the people in Sanaa, rejected this mediation and hoped to  settle the issue militarily. It appears, however, that their  military option has run into a dead end. We are now in the  second week of fighting without any sign of their professed  ability to settle the issue militarily.    [Al-Buluk] We must remember it is a conflict among brothers.    [Al-Dali] Yes, yes, but remember that we are actually  fighting each other. It is impractical to deny this. We are  two sides fighting each other. We accepted mediation and a  cease-fire, not out of fear but to spare Yemeni lives. The other  side's subsequent agreement to receive an Arab League delegation  is a good sign. We hope that the meeting between the Arab  League delegation and the officials in Sanaa will achieve good  results.    [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, some countries are  being accused of being behind what is happening in Yemen. It is  said that these countries are fanning the fire of the civil war.    [Al-Dali] Our actions are not in a vacuum, nor are they  based  on false accusations. What actually happened is that among the  captured crew members of downed military aircraft belonging to  the north and the prisoners taken in Abyan we found nationals of  other Arab countries. One of these prisoners is an officer from  another Arab country.    [Al-Buluk] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz, 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the YSP  have urged dialogue as a way to end the crisis. In your  opinion, how can a dialogue be carried out now that war has  erupted?    [Al-Dali] War does not preclude the principle of dialogue.  On the contrary, you begin a dialogue to end a war. For this  reason, despite the bitterness we feel, the bloodshed, and the  arrogant intransigence of the brothers in Sanaa, we are willing  to have a dialogue. Actually we fought each other in 1972 and  1979 but the current war is more ferocious.    [Al-Buluk] Especially as Yemen has been united since 1990.    [Al-Dali] Yes, this war is fiercer and bloodier.  Nevertheless we are ready to sit down and negotiate.    [Al-Buluk] Do you think that the dialogue could take place  in an Arab land other than Yemen?    [Al-Dali] I believe that this could happen. Under the  current circumstances, it is impossible to meet on Yemeni soil.  But it could be possible to meet in Yemen when circumstances  change.    [Al-Buluk] What is the current situation in Yemen now that  the war has destroyed almost everything? Can you comment on the  ongoing events?    [Al-Dali] It's a tragedy, a big tragedy. It's a big tragedy  that will have a grave impact on the next generation. Instead  of presenting a united modern Yemen, a Yemen of law and order, a  Yemen of stability and democracy to our next generation, we are  passing on a Yemen ruled by terrorism, governed by the idea of  settling matters through military means, governed by bloodshed  and killing, and governed by a desire to annihilate the other  side. This is very regrettable.    [Al-Buluk] No doubt you know that President Husni Mubarak  made several appeals to the brothers to cease fighting. How do  you view the Egyptian mediation in the Yemeni crisis?    [Al-Dali] The Egyptian mediation, particularly the mediation  of His Excellency President Husni Mubarak, has had a positive  effect and has been welcomed by every Yemeni. We rely heavily  on the Egyptian role and the mediation of His Excellency  President Husni Mubarak. We wish this mediation success. We  and the YSP will give every possible support to this mediation  and the Egyptian role.    [A-Buluk] There is a question asked by every Egyptian  citizen  and every Arab citizen: Why did this happen in Yemen?    [Al-Dali] Simply and generally speaking because the old  power  structure wants to maintain its position and old regime and does  not want to give a chance to the new generation. The brothers  in Sanaa refused to implement the first article in the Pledge  and Accord Document, which calls for the arrest of those  involved in the assassination of YSP leaders. This led to the  failure of implementing the document.    [Al-Buluk interrupting] This document was signed in Jordan  in  February 1994.    [Al-Dali] Yes. The brothers in Sanaa regrettably  miscalculated by liquidating the South Yemeni brigades. It is  regrettable to talk about a southern army and a northern army.  But in fact the two armies did not unite. They started to  liquidate the [southern] brigades that were deployed in the  north with the aim of weakening the army of the south so that it  could be easily liquidated in an advance toward Aden. It is the  same idea and (?impotent) mentality [words indistinct].    [Al-Buluk] Don't you think that the four years that preceded  unity were enough to resolve the differences?    [Al-Dali] We tried the impossible in order to end the  problems.    [Al-Buluk] We are broadcasting this dialogue and this is  your  personal viewpoint. We hope that the war in fraternal Yemen  will end and that Yemen will again be as happy as it was.    [Al-Dali] This is not my personal viewpoint. Rather it is  the YSP viewpoint.</p>

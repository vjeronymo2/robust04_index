			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN, 73, CRITICALLY WOUNDED AFTER KNIFE ATTACK ON POLICE  </P> <P> An 73-year-old man who was behaving "erratically" was in critical condition  Sunday night after police shot him at his City Heights home, police and  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> The man, identified as Robert Miller, was shot when he "went for an officer"  with a knife, said Sgt. Steve Chivers of the San Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> Miller underwent surgery for multiple gunshot wounds in the upper part of his  body, said Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred just before 2 p.m. Sunday, according to Chivers, who said  details of the incident were vague.  </P> <P> Caroline Tuma, who lives across from Miller in the 3000 block of 44th Street,  said he had been acting strangely since Saturday, when he came outside and  began breaking the windows of his house. "He was angry at somebody," Tuma said,  adding that Chivers went back into the house and began throwing things out the  broken windows.  </P> <P> Miller apparently had been alone in the house since his sister left two weeks  ago, Tuma said.  </P> <P> Tuma said police made several visits to the house on Saturday and ultimately  took Miller to a hospital, but he either left or was discharged.  </P></p>

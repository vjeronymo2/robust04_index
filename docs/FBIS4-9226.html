			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- Upon arrival in the  Parliament Palace, Romania's President Ion Iliescu, surrounded  by the press, was the target of a salvo of questions, starting  from his always congenial mood, and the impressions about  Placido Domingo's concert, and to the Crans Montana Forum  conference topics.    The Romanian president found Domingo's concert "a good  overture to this conference," and said he hoped the presence at  the conference of the Israeli foreign minister and the PLO  leader is a "good omen," showing optimism about the possibility  of direct contacts these days in Bucharest.    Challenged by a journalist with the supposition that an  agreement might be signed, the president said: "I do not know if  the stage of signing an agreement will be reached, because  negotiations are in progress. They will be coming with fresh  information from the negotiations under way in Cairo, but we do  hope that their meeting in Bucharest marks a positive step,  stimulative for the ongoing of the negotiations."    President Iliescu also expressed the hope that the  conference  might contribute to the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and to  stopping the conflict in that area.</p>

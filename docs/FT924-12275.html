			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (6): Numbers crunch - The Accountants THE DIGITS '2' and '0' are cropping up frequently among the accountancy firms at the moment as they restructure their businesses for the coming millenium. Emblazoned on glossy brochures and heading internal memos, KPMG Peat Marwick boasts proudly of '20/20 Vision'. For Coopers &amp; Lybrand, it is 'Vision 2000'. For Price Waterhouse, there is 'MCS 2000'. Other firms are more sceptical of such public statements of change, arguing that the best strategies are those which are kept concealed from their competitors. But all are indulging in organisational and numerical change of sorts, not least in shedding staff. Earlier this month, KPMG Peat Marwick made 28 of its 800-odd consulting staff redundant. Late last year, Price Waterhouse got rid of 150 of its 1,000 consulting staff. One other thing that the firms have in common is a marketing drive to call themselves consultants - and not simply accountants. There is considerable justification to the claim. Much of the explosive growth during the 1980s did not come from audit work but from consulting. In the UK alone, the Big Six accounting firms generated Pounds 624m from consultancy in the 12 months to this spring. Some Pounds 136m, or nearly one quarter of last year's total fee income from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest firm, was from consulting. That was a larger contribution than came from either the tax or insolvency divisions, and more than half of the total from auditing. Nearly Pounds 175m - or more than half of total income for Arthur Andersen - came from the firm's semi-autonomous consulting division, Andersen Consulting. Its growth dominates the firm and swamped the impressive expansion even in Andersen's audit department. Andersen also dominates the overall market for consultants. A survey by Alpha Publications showed that billings from the firm throughout western Europe were Dollars 908m last year. Next came KPMG and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Only then came non-accountants: McKinsey and PA Consulting. The remaining Big Six firms were all represented among the top 10. Accountants, in short, continue to dominate much of the market for consultancy. That reflects the degree to which they have wanted to provide the widest range of services as a 'one-stop' shop to clients. In particular, it shows the extent to which they have wanted to - and been able to - achieve considerable 'leverage' by cross-selling other services to existing audit clients. That ratio hovers between 20 and 40 per cent for many of the firms. This leverage has been one of the factors bringing the firms under growing scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest. Can auditors really exercise objective, critical judgement when examining work carried out by consultants from the same firm? Will the size of the total bill to a particular client sway independence when harsh comments could lead to loss of revenue? These charges are dismissed by accountants. But Mr Malcolm Coster, head of consulting at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, concedes there is at least a perceived conflict of interest, and that the position is likely to get tougher in the next few years. Most of the firms see their biggest challenge as bringing greater focus to their work. In their desire to offer clients every possible service, they have expanded into activities well beyond the traditional preserve of the accountant. Mr Brian Pomeroy at Touche Ross says that for his firm, these will include information technology, operations consulting and human resource management. Yet he also admits to tension, because he still wants the firm to respond to clients as 'full-range suppliers'. On the other hand, Coopers &amp; Lybrand recently announced publicly that it would not participate in tenders for schools inspector work. Mr Coster says that where competition has cut into the margins on some government work, he is no longer interested in tendering. All this change is happening against a backdrop of fierce price competition, both from other accountancy firms and from niche consultants with far lower overheads. At the same time, the firms are having to face a very different type of client. Mr Michael Grunberg, managing director of the consulting arm of Stoy Hayward, says that on one recent tender, the potential customer asked the consultant to complete a written test. 'Buyers are becoming much more mature,' he says. 'They look at the CVs of the individuals who are going to be working on the team, not the salesmen. It's getting to the point where the cost of all bidders preparing is greater than the value of the contract.' It is also having an effect on the type of staff hired. Mr Clive Williams, head of consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, says many firms took on too many inexperienced staff in the 1980s which they are now having to shed. He believes the optimum size for a practice is 500 to 600 professionals. Further growth will come through a series of strategic alliances with specialist consultants. He negotiated his first with a boutique called Kalchas earlier this year and says he is discussing a further three. Mr Bob Simm, head of consulting at KPMG Peat Marwick, says: 'The consultant of the future will be a specialist not a generalist, hungrier than ever before, better able to operate at boardroom level, more able to articulate the skills he has to other business units and better able to price jobs sensibly.'</p>

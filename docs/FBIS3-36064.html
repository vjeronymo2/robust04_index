			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Major General Mustafa Nesirov, </F> chief adviser on border affairs at the National Security  Ministry, by Sakit Ochaghly; place and date not given]    [Text] Talks and consultations are being held and concrete  proposals are being put forward at the highest levels on the  defense and inviolability of our borders.    [Begin recording] [Nesirov] Each state must defend its own  borders, and borders should be defended by the border guards of  a given state. We must defend our borders with our own border  guards. We will undoubtedly achieve this.    [Ochaghly] Talks are being held on this subject. Are you  taking part in these talks?    [Nesirov] The commander of the Russian border guards wanted  us to defend the borders jointly. That is, Azerbaijan's border  with Iran. We said at that time, and even earlier, and during  the talks with Lieutenant-General (Mikhalayov) in Baku that we  ourselves will defend our own borders. It will not be correct  if we allow the Russian border guards to defend Azerbaijan's  border with Iran jointly with us. It will mean the loss of  sovereignty. We have a sovereign state and border guards. We  must defend our own borders with our own border guards.  Undoubtedly we will achieve this. [end recording]</p>

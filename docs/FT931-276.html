			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Segni opens rift in Italy's Catholic vote ITALY'S Christian Democrat party has been plunged into an identity crisis following the resignation on Monday of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement. The party, Italy's largest, has always accommodated a wide spread of ideologies. Thus it has been both conservative and progressive, deeply Catholic and left-leaning, market-oriented and heavily in favour of a strong state sector in the economy. Mr Segni's gesture has profoundly damaged this diffuse, accommodating personality and opened up an unprecedented rift in the Catholic vote. The circumstances in which he has left permit no room for doubt: there is no space for him in a party so profoundly tarnished by the corruption scandals and the even more damaging imputation from magistrates that its most senior members are allegedly linked to the Mafia. His Christian Democrat credentials are impeccable. Mr Segni, aged 53, is the son of a former Christian Democrat president of the republic and has been with the party for 16 years, representing his native Sardinia. He formed the Referendum Movement three years ago both as a challenge to the inability of parliament to reform the electoral process and to the control of his party by discredited politicians. Mr Segni has spent the best part of a year agonising over whether to remain inside the party. It seemed after this length of time that he accepted he could carry more weight acting as a reformist inside the party - no matter how much he disagreed with Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the astute new Christian Democrat leader. Mr Martinazzoli has consistently out-manoeuvred him; perhaps the final straw was the way in which the Christian Democrats have climbed aboard the referendum bandwagon. This threatened to deny him a much deserved achievement as his referendum proposals for introduction of a majority voting system for the Senate are likely to be endorsed on April 18. His break leaves him free in a fast-changing political climate to forge new alliances or form his own party. This is the first time since the war that the Catholic vote has been faced with a split. The Church, powerful backers of the Christian Democrats, faces an awkward choice: back the new reformist forces or stay with the discredited Christian Democrats in the belief that Mr Segni will burn himself out and that the former can regenerate themselves.</p>

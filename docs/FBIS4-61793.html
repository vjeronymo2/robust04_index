			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of Lithuania's parliament said he was  alarmed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's recent  statement that Russia might suspend its troop withdrawal from  Estonia.    Ceslovas Jursenas, in an interview with Interfax on Monday,  expressed the hope that Grachev had been stating his own rather  than President Boris Yeltsin's position.    "Any delays with the troop withdrawal, and especially the  deployment of an additional contingent, would not only be a  clear manifestation of pressure on what is a sovereign state but  would also mean disregard of the opinion and position of the  world community and a violation of provisions enshrined in the  documents of the United Nations, the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe and other influential international  organizations," Jursenas said.    "It is not pressure but negotiations based on principles of  equality and mutual respect that are the only way to solve  problems," he said.</p>

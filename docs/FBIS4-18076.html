			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- According to the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD], the British Government should contribute more  toward financing the European Union [EU]. The discount granted  to Great Britain in 1985, involving 6 billion German marks [DM]  annually, is no longer justified today, the deputy chairwoman of  the SPD and spokeswoman for European affairs, Wieczorek-Zeul,  stated at a news conference in Bonn today. She pointed out that  the German net payments currently amount to over DM23 billion.    Ms. Wieczorek-Zeul presented a 10-point catalogue with her  party's demands for the German Presidency of the EU Council of  Ministers, which begins in the second half of 1994. According  to the SPD, the fight against unemployment must be given top  priority. As the election results in Italy have shown, in view  of 20 million jobless throughout the European Union, measures  are urgently required to combat the increasing danger of  right-wing radicalism. The realization of the trans-European  transportation system would be a suitable project in this  respect. During the German presidency, the SPD also expects  initiatives designed to prevent the "social dumping" by foreign  companies in the sphere of services -- above all, in the  construction industry. Closer cooperation with the European  Union in the fight against right-wing extremist criminals is  also required. A female EU commissioner is going to be  appointed to promote equal rights for women in European  institutions.    According to the SPD politician, the German presidency will  assume particular significance. The changeover takes place at a  time when members of the government parties seem to be lacking  the willingness for further European unification. She was  optimistic that the SPD will assume power in Bonn during the  German presidency of the European Union.</p>

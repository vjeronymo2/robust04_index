			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam held  a news conference in Berlin, Germany, on 10 June. Reporters of  foreign newspapers, news agencies, and radio in Germany attended  the news conference. The foreign minister, who spoke at the  news conference, talked about our principled position on the  nuclear issue -- including the essence of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula, the replacement of fuel rods, and the  method of resolving the nuclear issue -- and answered reporters'  questions by saying: Over the past few years, the great leader  Comarde Kim Il-song has already declared on many occasions that  our country has no intention nor capacity to produce nuclear  weapons. If we have them, where can we use them! The nuclear  issue of our country has been raised because the United States  has dealt with us from the beginning with its doubts on our  peaceful nuclear activity.    He stressed that because our country has a foundation of  self- reliant national economy and a powerful defensive  capability, no sanction steps can frighten us, and he continued:  We demand that the United States respond to talks with its  interest to peacefully resolve the issue. The United States  should clearly know that if it does not come to the talks, but  rather tries to resolve the issue with its pressure or  sanctions, it will only aggravate tensions on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

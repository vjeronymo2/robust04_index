"Choam Khsan is still in our hands as before," the officer  said referring to the border town in remote Preah Vihear  province which started to come under heavy artillery attack  early this week, with about 100 rounds being fired each day.    Several hundred familes fled their homes to escape the  intense shelling and rocket fire and moved to the safety of the  provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, the officer who requested  anonymity said.    Many families had to leave before they could harvest their  rice crops and hundreds of rice-fields were burnt, he said.    The government cooperated with aid agencies and to airlift  in  food and shelter Friday for more than 2,000 displaced people who  had gathered in Tbeng Meanchey, an aid agency official said.    Tbeng Meanchey is currently inaccessible by road but  government troops were reported to be trying to clear mines  which block the road running north through a heavy Khmer Rouge  area in central Kompong Thom province.    Meanwhile "serious military activities" were taking place  around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all of northern  Cambodia at Anlong Veng, Cabinet Minister Veng Sereivut said  without elaborating.    Defence Minister Tie Banh said that government troops  started  moving on the Khmer Rouge base at Anlong Veng on Friday in a  bigger assault than previous ones.    Earlier offensives in the area were called off because of  bad  weather and poor logisitics.    "Our troops should have no problems capturing that area,"  Tie  Banh said.    Other government officials would not specify whether the  advance was an all-out assault to take the base or just an  attempt to use military pressure to push the guerrillas towards  peace talks.    Reports of an impending attack have been circulating for  weeks, confirmed by some government officials and denied by  others.    A Western diplomat said that some military officials were  reluctant to talk about activity in the area "because they  didn't want to build up expectations and then have a failure."    But he said he would not be surprised if the government had  launched a major attack. "They were pretty much gradually  creeping towards Anlong Veng over the past two weeks," the  diplomat said.    Another Western diplomat said he was aware the government  had  been moving men and munitions into the area for some weeks but  could not confirm what was happening on the ground.    However, he questioned the military significance of  capturing  the base.    If the Khmer Rouge were faced with a large-scale attack, the  guerrillas would probably just abandon the base like they did  when a similar base came under heavy attack at Phum Chat in  northwestern Cambodian last August, he said.    Phum Chat is right beside the Thai border and government  officers said at the time that the guerrillas had crossed into  Thailand and escaped.    "The question to ask is `Can the Khmer Rouge continue to  abandon bases?' And if they can, `Do they have others in a  neighbouring country?'" the diplomat said.    The Khmer Rouge's infamous one-legged general Ta Mok was  based in Anlong Veng but military officials and diplomats said  he left in December, together with a number of his men, to set  up another command post in Preah Vihear province not far from  Choam Khsan.    Attacks in the Choam Khsan district have increased since  then.</p>

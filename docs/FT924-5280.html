			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BPB The plasterboard war seems to have ground to a standstill, but corporate battle fatigue may not be enough to raise prices significantly. BPB, Lafarge Coppee and Knauf might all want higher profits, yet each still has to juggle price against volume. There is still excess capacity, particularly in the UK, and the British and French markets continue to weaken while Germany's decline has yet to come. The omens for sustained price rises are not good. Indeed, BPB's decision to cut its dividend at the interim stage reinforces that view, however confident the company tries to sound. To be sure, the payment was at an unsustainable level and the new chief executive may want to start with a clean sheet, but trading prospects can hardly be rosy. With the dividend 'rebased', the market must adjust its valuation of the stock. A 25 per cent yield premium may not be enough, given that even the reduced payment will be barely covered by earnings this year. And the prospective earnings multiple of 24 clearly looks far ahead to better times. Presumably those will one day return, and BPB's strong market position will eventually earn rewards. But that only highlights the narrowness of BPB's focus. A little judicious diversification when the company was making Pounds 200m of profits might have prevented it scraping to earn Pounds 50m now.</p>

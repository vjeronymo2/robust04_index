			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE HOLDS UP U.S. BID TO DEPORT 'SUBVERSIVES'  </P> <P> Government efforts to deport a group of immigrants once charged with subversion  ran into more roadblocks Friday in Immigration Court as Justice Department  attorneys admitted that they had wrongly charged one of the defendants with  fraud in a subpoena.  </P> <P> Immigration Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko ruled that deportation efforts aimed at  two lead defendants -- Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh,  33, of Long Beach -- cannot proceed until a federal court decision affecting  their cases is resolved.  </P> <P> Hamide and Shehadeh face subversion charges under the McCarran-Walter Act. The  act, passed during the McCarthy era of the 1950s, allows the deportation of  aliens for advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the  unlawful destruction of property.  </P> <P> Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles overturned  several of the act's political sections and declared that aliens have the same  broad free speech rights as U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> Until the McCarran-Walter decision is resolved -- whether through the appellate  process or simply by having the government throw in the towel -- Hrycenko ruled  that their cases "will not proceed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8 Immigrants Jailed  </P> <P> Hamide and Shehadeh were among eight immigrants -- seven Palestinians and a  Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for almost two weeks on charges  that they belonged to a Palestinian group with a history of terrorism. All  denied the charges, and none were charged criminally.  </P> <P> Charges were eventually dropped against three other immigrants. But three more  still faced lesser deportation charges -- and for the first time in 27 months  the government proceeded against them this week.  </P> <P> On Friday, a three-man team of Justice Department attorneys from Washington  moved against Bashar Amer, 27, of Glendale. He is charged with not maintaining  his academic status -- that is, not taking 12 units a semester, as generally  required by immigration rules, at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga between  1985 and 1987.  </P> <P> Last Monday, immigration officials subpoenaed Amer's college records. But when  Justice Department attorney Stewart Deutsch produced the subpoena for the court  on Friday, it said that Amer was being investigated in connection with "a fraud  against the United States."  </P> <P> A surprised Hrycenko asked Deutsch how that could be possible when the charge  against Amer was that he had not taken enough college credits to remain in the  country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Maybe It's Sloppiness'  </P> <P> "There is no fraud," Deutsch admitted. "That is an error."  </P> <P> "Maybe it's solely sloppiness," said Hrycenko. She continued Amer's hearing  until July so that the government could change the charge.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based immigration official who signed the erroneous subpoena,  John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Amer's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout of the National Lawyers Guild, said he had "no  reason to think (the fraud charge) wasn't intentional" in light of the  government's continuing efforts to deport the immigrants.  </P></p>

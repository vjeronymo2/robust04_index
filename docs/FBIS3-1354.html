			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 24 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk is  to have "fundamental" discussions with Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to ensure free and fair  elections in kwaZulu/Natal against a background of African  National Congress [ANC] pressure to have administrators  appointed to the region. Mr de Klerk announced this at a news  conference at the Union Buildings after he met an ANC delegation  led by ANC President Nelson Mandela on Thursday [24 March].    Mr Mandela addressed a separate news conference at the Union  Buildings after they failed to fully agree on the measures to be  taken in kwaZulu. Mr de Klerk said while his government was  empowered to take over government functions in kwaZulu, as ANC  Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had suggested earlier, this  was not what he intended doing.    Mr de Klerk briefed the ANC delegation which included Mac  Maharaj, Mr Ramaphosa and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo  on the government's security contingency plans for Natal. The  SADF [South African Defense Force] call-up would obviously  involve an increase in manpower levels, he said.    On a political level, Mr de Klerk said he would like to meet  Mr Buthelezi as soon as possible to discuss arrangements to  ensure free electioneering in kwaZulu, and to discuss the  possibility of another initiative to involve the region in an  inclusive political process.    He would see Mr Buthelezi to prevent the necessity for SA  Government intervention.    Mr Mandela told a separate news conference Mr de Klerk had  not reacted like a state president in his comments on Mr  Ramaphosa's suggestions, but like a petty politician. Mr  Mandela was "completely disgusted" by Mr de Klerk's response.  Mr de Klerk had failed to contact Mr Mandela on the matter as  he should have handled an issue of national concern.    Asked whether there was a rift between him and Mr de Klerk,  ?r Mandela said they had "made progress" during their  discussions on kwaZulu/Natal's political and security situation.  If there was progress, free and fair elections in Natal should  be possible.    Mr de Klerk had defended kwaZulu's and the IFP's actions,  and  ignored the fact that state resources were being used to  destabilise the political process, Mr Mandela said.    Mr de Klerk said he made it clear at the meeting that the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] did not have the powers to  tamper with lawfully-elected institutions in kwaZulu. He  dismissed any notions that he was part of a strategy to topple  the kwaZulu government.    Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman Johan  Kriegler earlier briefed both leaders on meeting with the  kwaZulu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. Mr de Klerk said the  IEC's information on the situation in kwaZulu was more negative  than initial interpretations had suggested.</p>

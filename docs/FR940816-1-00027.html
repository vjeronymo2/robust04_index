			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. For what period may a specific attainment date be waived?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When nonanthropogenic sources have been determined to contribute significantly to violations in an area that has been reclassified to serious, in accordance with the above criteria, those sources may permanently prevent the area from attaining the standards. Therefore, the attainment date for such areas could be waived indefinitely. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``However, the phrase waive a specific date'' does not require that the attainment date be waived indefinitely (see footnote 23 on the effect of waiving the moderate area attainment date), nor does it lessen the State's obligation to strive to expeditiously attain the NAAQS at some time in the future through available means. While EPA does not expect States to exhaust their resources to meet standards that may be unattainable, it does expect them to continue efforts to minimize exposures to unhealthy air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In cases where it is feasible to implement measures that will reduce future emissions from nonanthropogenic sources (i.e., planting indigenous vegetation or establishing wind breaks), EPA has the authority under section 188(e) to extend the attainment date for a serious area for up to 5 years beyond 2001 if it is possible that the NAAQS could be attained in the future. Such measures should be considered by States before seeking waivers of the attainment date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even though a specific attainment date and serious area requirements may be waived indefinitely for an area where, respectively, nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly to violations and anthropogenic sources do not, the State should review the status of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic source contributions in the area every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 years. Such a review would entail determining whether nonanthropogenic sources still contribute significantly and anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. Since emissions from anthropogenic sources increase with population growth and the location of new sources to the area, the contribution of anthropogenic sources to violations can become significant over time. Therefore, the need for reinstating a specific attainment date and/or previously waived serious area requirements should be reconsidered periodically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has the authority under section 172(c)(3) to require periodic updates of a nonattainment area's emissions inventory to assure that the requirements of part D are met. The EPA plans to use this authority to periodically review the waiver status of areas, as described above. A specific attainment date and applicable requirements should be reinstated if it is determined that nonanthropogenic sources no longer contribute significantly or anthropogenic sources begin contributing significantly to violations in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. What requirements applicable to serious nonattainment areas under subpart 4 of part D should be waived?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

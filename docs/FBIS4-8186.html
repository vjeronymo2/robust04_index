			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- Assembly President of  the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) Momcilo Krajisnik on Monday  said the renewed air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on  Monday were a disastrous move on the part of the United Nations,  which he said had greatly exceeded its authority and assigned  NATO the task out of a wish to aid the Bosnian Muslims in their  offensive in the area of Gorazde.    "We had proposed that the war stop on all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, but the proposal was not upheld by  either the Muslims or the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), but,  quite the contrary, the Muslim offensive was tolerated and  (Bosnian) Serb positions were air raided," Krajisnik said on  Belgrade's Politika TV.    The Muslim side in late March launched a strong offensive on  Bosnian Serb positions from Gorazde, a Muslim enclave which  should have been demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-proclaimed  "safe area." around 10,000 Muslim troops were massed for the  offensive.    Krajisnik said that the Serb side countered the Muslim  offensive because it was provoked and because the Muslims used  the "safe area," which has not territorially been defined, "as a  source of war" in eastern Bosnia.    The R.S. assembly president said that UNPROFOR had for no  reason at all violated the U.N. charter and its mandate in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, and instead of censuring the Muslims had  "completely sided with the Serb enemies."    Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership was following the  situation and that it had requested of the United Nations to say  who had ordered the air strikes.    Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership would decide on its  further action and contacts with UNPROFOR, which he said had  been frozen for the time being, only upon receiving an answer  from the United Nations.</p>

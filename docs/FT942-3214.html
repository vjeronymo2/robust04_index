			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (24): More mobility for staff - The Virtual Office Even the greatest fan of information technology (IT) and new working methods would not suggest that the days of the conventional office are numbered. But the rising price of travel and office space and the falling cost of remote computing are challenging business people to re-examine the reason for commuting to work, since many tasks which rely on information processing can be handled just as effectively outside the office. Often, a job can be performed equally well from home, from a hotel bedroom, from a car or from an office hired by the hour at an airport - meanwhile, the person at the other end of the telephone may be unaware that his opposite number is not in a conventional office. This is the concept behind the 'virtual office.' It is not another expression for solitary teleworking or for working normally from home and visiting the office once a week - although it may include these practices. The virtual office still generally implies team work as employees of a larger organisation, the essential difference being that information technology removes the need for the business office to be in one fixed location. Implicit in this the concept is some degree of computer literacy although staff do not necessarily have to relearn their basic skills. Home and mobile phones can be programmed to dial straight into the employer's internal phone system, while desktop and portable computers can also be programmed as 'virtual nodes,' meaning that users can log on to shared company computer systems exactly as if they were in the office and connected directly into the local area network. No additional user techniques are required so the user is 'at work' as soon as he or she picks up the phone or switches on the computer. Affordable digital ISDN phone lines and easier-to-use software make logging on to corporate networks simple, with barely any delay detectable. Computers, photocopiers, fax machines and laser printers have also all shrunk in size and price, allowing companies to equip their employees at moderate cost with compact, powerful office technology that fits into any small room. The isolation of the virtual office can be a drawback and many employers who favour this system ensure that staff visit the corporate office regularly to keep in touch and to reinforce the feeling of belonging to a team. In cases where eye-to-eye contact is felt to be important, videophone technology from BT and others may become an increasingly affordable solution, although it could prove a poor substitute for genuine human interaction. There is no shortage of lively contact in many virtual office jobs, however. Sales people, for example, spend most of their time out meeting customers; and customer-support staff spend much of the day on the phone. Mothers may 'telework' part-time while tending their young families. For these people, the move to the virtual office concept means no real change to their lifestyle. The US sets the pace in virtual office applications, with more than 25m people working from home. A leading domestic appliance company no longer requires its customer service personnel to come to work, instead they stay at home. Their employer equips each worker with a company phone and computer, linked to the corporate database by ISDN digital telephone line. Customer calls to the support line are directed automatically to an agent sitting at home who can log into the company database to check parts, numbers and prices, arrange for parts to be sent, or credit cards to be debited and even process refunds. Few would suggest that the virtual office will supplant the habitat and structure of office life as we know it, nor would its exponents claim its methods would suit all kinds of operation. But for certain tasks and situations where staff normally work without constant supervision and have no pressing need to visit an office daily, the virtual office will become an increasingly viable, cost-effective and desirable way to work. The convergence of low-cost computers and telecoms has made it possible to set up video conference calls, work on designs and pass files backwards and forwards without ever leaving home. The key is the ISDN telephone line, available in the UK from BT and Mercury. This allows computer data to be transfered by phone. The concept is called multimedia communication and all leading computer hardware and software suppliers have products available. For example, in the UK, Flextel in Sandbach has introduced a transferable phone number - users acquire a fixed phone number that does not alter when they move location. The system 'translates' this number to their real number.</p>

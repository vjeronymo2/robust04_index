			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Observer: Fighting talk Meanwhile, the Labour party's efforts on the City prawn cocktail circuit seem to be paying handsome dividends judging by yesterday's outburst from Fidelity's Barry Bateman. In his first public outing as chairman of the Unit Trust Association, Bateman savaged the government's wider share ownership policy, calling it as misguided as the poll tax. 'But wider share ownership is not as big an issue so it will be difficult to convince the government of the folly of their ways. There are not many votes in it.' Undoubtedly the unit trust industry has suffered because the instant profits provided by successive privatisations have overshadowed the less spectacular gains of steady long-term investments which suffer front-end charges. Moreover the government has prevented unit trusts from exploiting the full juicy potential of personal equity plans. 'If anything, the Labour party seems to know more about wider share ownership and popular capitalism than the Tory party,' says Bateman. However, even Bateman draws back from urging his members to put their money where their mouth is and make a contribution to the Labour party.</p>

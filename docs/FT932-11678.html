			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: RMC Group There is a lot of common sense behind RMC's decision to merge its Berlin associate with its main German operation. It can now make full use of accelerated depreciation allowances on east German investment, saving perhaps Pounds 100m in tax over the next four years. The cash flow benefit is significant: whether it justifies yesterday's 5 per cent jump in the share price is another matter. RMC's tax charge will come down just as Redland's is going up, but earnings derived from temporary tax concessions are of poor quality. The traditionally conservative RMC will probably smooth the effect on the bottom line with deferred tax provisions. Still, it will need strong markets to sustain earnings after the allowances end in 1995. A pointer will be whether this month's UK price increases stick. The prospective multiple some 40 per cent above the average assumes a strong recovery - well before it is set in concrete.</p>

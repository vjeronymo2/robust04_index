			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR KUWAITI EXILE REGIME: PHONES, FAXES, NIGHTMARES;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: FROM A MOUNTAIN HOTEL, OFFICIALS MANAGE GLOBAL ASSETS AND SEEK TO  LEAD A SCATTERED PEOPLE.  </P> <P> From a luxury resort hotel perched high in the arid mountains that rise up from  the Red Sea, the government of Kuwait goes about the business of running a  country in exile.  </P> <P> By day, the desert wind whines eerily through the vaulted lobby, while  white-robed security guards with machine guns in shoulder holsters roam past  the reception desk. Government aides carry reports from the Defense Ministry,  on the mezzanine level, to the prime minister's reception room, on the fifth  floor. Reports arrive by facsimile from Kuwaiti embassies in London and  Washington. The telephones ring relentlessly.  </P> <P> By night, Kuwait's Cabinet ministers gather behind closed doors for hour after  hour of meetings, then wander upstairs to a long, white-clothed table to dine  on whole roasted lamb and spiced rice.  </P> <P> Aides turn on CNN or Egyptian soap operas in a room off the main lobby. After  dinner, Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, the crown prince, puts on tennis shoes  under his long white dishdasha and leaves the hotel. His driver takes him to a  spot not far from the hotel, and he walks back in the silent desert night.  </P> <P> Rarely does anyone see the emir. Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, when he is at  the hotel, spends most of the time closeted in his fifth-floor suite, walking  up and down on the balcony that looks out over the majestic Sarawad Mountains.  </P> <P> "I think there must be no more tiles left on the floor of the balcony: He just  walks back and forth," a member of the royal family said. "You never see him  sitting anymore. He's either walking or standing. Since right after the crisis,  he didn't want to talk to anyone, he doesn't want to hear anything. He won't  read the newspaper, he has someone read it to him. He doesn't say anything. He  just keeps walking."  </P> <P> If there is an air of unreality to this remote bureaucratic retreat, it is  because there is an element of the fantastic in trying to govern a country  whose population is scattered across Saudi Arabia, to other countries in the  Persian Gulf, and to Cairo, London and Paris; a country that has been invaded  and annexed by Iraq, and whose financial assets around the globe, estimated at  $100 billion, must be harnessed to support day-to-day needs and a military  buildup.  </P> <P> "Kuwait is a country that now consists almost entirely of hotel rooms," said  one diplomat in Saudi Arabia, which has become host to the largest population  of Kuwaitis outside Kuwait.  </P> <P> At least half of Kuwait's native population has fled the country, and half of  those people, perhaps 150,000, are in Saudi Arabia. Hotels in Dammam, Dhahran,  Khobar and Riyadh are filled with Kuwaiti families. High-rise apartment  buildings in Riyadh, Jidda and Dammam are being renovated to house thousands  more.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti children are enrolling in Saudi schools. Kuwaiti government branch  offices throughout the country offer a monthly stipend for Kuwaiti families  that averages $810 a month. All this, including medical care and educational  expenses, is costing the Kuwaiti government nearly $150 million a month.  </P> <P> Cabinet ministers are spread all over the world, making diplomatic contacts  with foreign governments and keeping the Kuwaiti treasury afloat. The oil  minister has negotiated to purchase crude oil, mostly from Saudi Arabia, to  supply Kuwait Petroleum's 6,533 retail gasoline stations and three refineries  in Europe.  </P> <P> The finance minister is helping oversee Kuwait's investments in auto  manufacturer Daimler-Benz AG, chemicals manufacturer Hoechst AG, Britain's  Midland Bank PLC, San Francisco's Santa Fe International Corp. and plantations  in Malaysia. The defense minister is organizing military recruiting centers in  Saudi Arabia that have signed up more than 3,200 Kuwaitis in the past 10 days.  </P> <P> In Cairo, Kuwait Airways is preparing to resume regular passenger service to  New York, London, Bombay, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur with the eight Boeing 747s  and 727s that were outside of Kuwait when the Iraqis invaded Aug. 2.  </P> <P> "Cairo to New York in eight hours and back to Kuwait any minute," says one of  the advertisements scheduled to begin running in the Arabic-language press this  weekend. "Until we're able to welcome you home, welcome aboard," says another.  </P> <P> "We are living a dilemma, but we are trying to be up to the situation," said  Housing Minister Yahia al Sumait. "We know this is not what the Kuwaitis  deserve, but under the circumstances, we have tried as much as we can to give  the Kuwaitis outside the country enough so that they maintain their dignity as  Kuwaitis, and their pride, but where they also would not forget their brothers  inside Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Of course we are guests here, even as a government. This is a very serious and  devastating thing to happen. We have been hurt in every sense of the word. Our  people have been scattered all over the world. Everybody is looking for his  brother or his son or his father. We pray day and night for this to end."  </P> <P> In Taif, the sense of surrealism is magnified because it is the maelstrom of  the Kuwaiti nightmare, a hotel full of fallen princes and their professional  public relations aides who work round-the-clock to document their nightmares in  the hope that the rest of the world might help end them.  </P> <P> Blown-up photographs of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein line some of the hotel  corridors, next to similar blow-ups of Adolf Hitler. Press releases document  Iraqi atrocities inside Kuwait: tales of soldiers killing innocent civilians in  their homes, slaughtering animals in the Kuwait city zoo, turning the ill and  the mentally incompetent out of hospitals and into the streets.  </P> <P> Kuwaitis trade stories of the invasion, of how it was when they escaped, what  the Iraqi soldiers did, how afraid they were.  </P> <P> "You know, we are not used even to firecrackers -- firecrackers are forbidden  -- and now we see bombs coming out from tanks?" a government official said. "It  was like a dream. Planes and tanks. I saw so many people paralyzed on the  streets. They don't believe what's going on. Tens of helicopters, like  butterflies in our skies. Just imagine yourself there."  </P> <P> At this point the man, the head of a government department, pressed his fingers  to his eyes and refused to go on.  </P> <P> Sheik Jabbar al Mubarak al Sabah, a member of the ruling family and director  general of civil aviation in Kuwait, said: "You don't understand how it is  here, because your hand is in the water. Mine is in the fire. Since I came out  from Kuwait, I don't remember that I slept before 5 or 6 in the morning.  Whenever you lie there and look at the ceiling, things come to your mind, and  other things become connected to that thing.  </P> <P> "Even if you sleep, you think about driving a car. Suddenly you see a mountain,  you start thinking about the mountain, then you start to think about trees on  the mountain, the birds, the river, it keeps going like this, you see? And this  happens to me on a daily basis."  </P> <P> When a listener seems not to understand, he talks about a doctor friend of his  who left Kuwait recently and went to Egypt.  </P> <P> "He locked his door," he said, "and he grew his beard, and he did not come out,  he just lay on the bed looking at the ceiling. He did not talk to anybody. I  don't know. Probably he saw strange things. I know if we go back to Kuwait, I  think they should bring hundreds of psychiatrists."  </P> <P> As the rest of the world debates the wisdom of military action against Iraq,  and appears bent on holding out for a diplomatic resolution as long as  possible, Kuwaiti officials fear that their country is slowly disappearing with  every Iraqi family who moves into Kuwait city, with every telephone pole,  computer, diagnostic machine and video recorder hauled back to Baghdad, with  every Kuwaiti killed for fighting against the Iraqi occupation.  </P> <P> "We are impatient," the housing minister said. "Every day we receive  information from inside Kuwait, the more impatient we are. Of course, all those  leaders of the free world talk about peace, because they know what war is. If  you have a wound, you try to cure it by all kinds of medicine, but if the only  kind of medicine that will work is a hot steam, then that must be it.  </P> <P> "If it can be done without war -- please. But the question is, how long? Those  leaders talk about war and they know what it is, but Saddam (Hussein), this man  doesn't want to speak wisdom. He doesn't care what happens to Kuwait, to  Kuwaitis. Yes, I am impatient. But you have to forgive me for this."  </P></p>

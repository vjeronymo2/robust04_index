Wire rope used as a component of a tiedown assembly must conform to the requirements of the November 1985 second edition of the Wire Rope Technical Board's Wire Rope Users Manual. Wire rope which is not marked by the manufacturer with a working load limit, shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to 1/4 of the nominal strength listed in the Wire Rope Users Manual. (See &sect;393.7(b) for information on the incorporation by reference and availability of this document.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cordage <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Cordage used as a component of a tiedown assembly, must conform to the applicable Cordage Institute rope standards listed below: PETRS&hyph;2, Polyester Fiber Rope, 3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, January, 1993; PPRS&hyph;2, Polypropylene Fiber Rope, 3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, August, 1992; CRS&hyph;1, Polyester/Polypropylene Composite Rope Specifications, Three- and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979; NRS&hyph;1, Nylon Rope Specifications, Three- and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979; C1, Double Braided Nylon Rope Specifications, DBN-January 1984.

The working load limits listed in the tables in this paragraph are to be used when the tiedown material is not marked by the manufacturer with the working load limit. Tiedown materials which are marked by the manufacturer with working load limits which differ from the table, shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to the value for which they are marked. Synthetic cordage (e.g., nylon, polypropylene, polyester) which is not marked or labeled to enable identification of its composition or working load limit shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to that for polypropylene fiber rope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

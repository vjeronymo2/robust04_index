			<p>BFN     [Text] The President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov said on local  television on Monday that any stabilization of relations between  Crimea and Ukraine is out of the question as long as the  political aggression by Kiev continues.    Speaking of the Tuesday [24 May] meeting of the  parliamentary  delegations of Ukraine and Crimea in Kiev he voiced hope for its  fruitfulness. Unlike the executive branch of power, Meshkov  said, the Ukrainian parliament has not taken steps violating the  constitution.    Answering a question about the most favorable and the most  unfavorable course of developments the president said:"The most  favorable forecast is that we will resolve our problems over the  holiday season, the most unfavorable -- the refusal of Russia to  be involved in the settlement of the Crimean problem."    At the same time he said that the last option is so  improbable that there is no need to worry.    Answering a question about the possible reaction of the  Crimean administration to the use of force by Kiev Meshkov said  the steps of the Crimean leadership are clearly regulated by the  Crimean Constitution and laws.</p>

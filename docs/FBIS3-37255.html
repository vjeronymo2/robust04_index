I do not think this was  a wasted effort, rather we now have here real capital to work  with," St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak said.    In an interview with RIA, in the run-up to a session of the  CIS Inter-Parliamentary Assembly Council which opens tomorrow,  Sobchak noted that forum participants are to tackle many new  issues in view of an altered political situation.    In particular, he noted, it is necessary to elect a new  chairman of the council.    In his view, a representative of Russia could fill this  post,  for example, Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of the Federation  Council of the Federal Assembly.    Speaking of the situation in the CIS, Sobchak praised the  work of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which, according to  him, "promoted integration processes" in the Commonwealth.    The very fact that its headquarters is in this city,  continued the mayor, "will make it a focus of attraction for all  CIS member-countries".    Sobchak stressed the need to step up integration processes  in  the CIS, above all in the economic area.    Citing the Russian president's recent visit to Georgia, the  mayor pointed out that it became apparent there "where a civil  war can bring a country". [sentence as received]    "Realisation that by disrupting economic links we did  tremendous damage to each other is helping us to take past  mistakes into account".    "If," he went on, "we want to get out of the crisis  together,  the best thing is to do it jointly.    "Today, in view of the depth of crisis in some CIS  countries,  even Russia finds it simply unprofitable economically to make  agreements without protecting its rouble and its interests".</p>

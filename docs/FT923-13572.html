			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: Convention causes a shiver of apprehension WHEN the Democratic party meets in New York this week to crown Mr Bill Clinton as its presidential nominee, it is also likely to send a shiver of apprehension through an otherwise bullish US credit market. For a successful Democratic National Convention, producing a boost for Mr Clinton in the opinion polls, will create even greater uncertainty over the outcome of this year's three-way presidential race. And anything that detracts from the chances of President George Bush being re-elected will be taken badly by the bond market, which still seems to assume a Bush victory and fears that inflation would be reignited by the kind of national investment programme being advocated by Mr Clinton. Politics apart, the market has had plenty to be bullish about ever since the surprisingly bad employment report issued on July 2, and the Federal Reserve's quick response in slashing half a percentage point from the discount rate. Last week, corporate issuers rushed to take advantage of lower short-term rates, with the US market absorbing over Dollars 9bn of new corporate issues. The interest rate differential, or spread, between risk-free Treasury bonds and corporate debt has tightened so much because of declining short-term rates that some of last week's corporate issues encountered substantial buyer resistance. That in turn helped hold down the price of Treasury securities as traders lightened their positions to cover unsold corporate inventories. Yet the overall mood remained strongly bullish as a succession of economic indicators released during the week suggested that the momentum of both the economy and inflationary pressures remain very weak. The government reported on Friday that wholesale prices rose a mere two-tenths of 1 per cent in June, while on Thursday the Fed reported a Dollars 7.3bn drop in M2, the monetary aggregate it tracks most closely, for the week ending on June 29 and a Dollars 13.8bn decline in M3. M2 is showing an annual growth rate of 0.9 per cent, far below the Fed's target range of 2.5 to 6.5 per cent. Statistics like this have increased fears of a 'triple dip' recession, though the economic consensus still expects modestly accelerating growth in the second half. The coming week could bring some better economic news, with the retail sales figures for June forecast to show gains of between 0.2 per cent and 1 per cent, thanks mainly to a stronger automobile sector. The weakness of the economy certainly leaves room for further Fed easing over the summer if the statistics look horrendous. But whether the central bank moves or not, its action on July 2 appears to have produced a substantial shift in the market's view of the remainder of 1992: no longer do analysts expect the Fed to reverse direction and start tightening monetary policy by the end of the year. The Fed's easing, coupled with the poor economic statistics, helped push the dollar down sharply last week as, too, did the likelihood of tightening German monetary policy and the apparent willingness of Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, to talk the currency down during the G7 economic summit. This raises two concerns for the bond market, both of which are likely to have most impact on the long end of the yield curve: one is a lack of enthusiasm among foreign investors, concerned about currency risk, for long-dated issues; the other is the threat of inflation implied by an effective dollar devaluation. The latter need not, perhaps, be taken too seriously, given the generally weak state of the domestic economy. Yet the market refuses to put much faith in the long-term inflationary outlook, as underlined by the extraordinary slope of the yield curve, which is now so steep that one analyst calls it a 'yield pole'. The Democratic convention will do nothing to flatten it.</p>

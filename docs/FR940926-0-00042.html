			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EDO, NGVC, Thomas, NYCFD, and Volvo GM addressed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed labeling requirements. EDO and NYCFD stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label should include the maximum fill pressure at a location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> close to the fill receptacle. NGVC recommended that a blank area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the container installation date be included in the label to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be filled in by the installer. Volvo GM stated that only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers that are manufactured after the standard's effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date, and therefore actually subject to the standard, should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitled to display the DOT symbol as certification of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the standard. Thomas stated, without elaboration, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeling requirements of NGV2 should be adopted. NHTSA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal did not include certain additional information included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in NGV2, including the type of container, inspector symbols,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trademarks, manufacturer's part number, and serial numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed labeling requirements with a slight modification from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed format. In item (a), the agency has modified the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal which states ``The tank manufacturer's name and address''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to state the following: include the statement that ``If there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question about the proper use, installation, or maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this container, contact [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> manufacturer's name, address, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone number <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided not to require the other additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items of information in NGV2 since the agency did not propose the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of such information in the NPRM. Notwithstanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's decision not to require this additional information, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer may list such information on the label, provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information does not obscure or confuse the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. In particular, NHTSA encourages manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency has decided to adopt NGV2's design and material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications in this final rule. Specifying the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container should facilitate oversight of compliance tests since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each type of container is required to undergo hydrostatic burst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, but with different safety factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the upcoming SNPRM, NHTSA anticipates proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional requirements about the CNG fuel container's label,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the container type. In addition, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipates proposing that the label include an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement addressing the container's inspection and maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the label would state that ``This container should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be visually inspected after an accident or fire or at least every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 months for damage and deterioration in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable Compressed Gas Association guidelines.'' The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that such a statement would alert owners to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desirability for reinspection over time or in the event of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident. NHTSA will also propose requirements related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label's location, in response to EDO's and NYCFD's comment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum service pressure should be labeled in an area close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the fill receptacle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Leadtime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to make the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements effective on September 1, 1994. The agency believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this would provide a reasonable time period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to make minor modifications in container design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal was based on the agency's belief that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements were similar to RSPA standards currently in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency requested comment on the feasibility of this effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received eleven comments about the proposed effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date applicable to the container requirements. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were TMC, the U.S. Department of Energy, TBB, Oklahoma Gas, NGVC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EDO, Volvo/GM, AAMA, ARC, Navistar, and NGV Systems. EDO and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Navistar requested that the final rule be issued as early as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. DOE and Oklahoma Gas recommended an effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1995. NGVC recommended an effective date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1996, unless NGV2 were adopted which would permit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate supply of containers. NGV Systems stated that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier effective date would be difficult to meet since the rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as proposed, would require new tooling, process development, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps equipment modification. ARC stated that the rule, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed, would require major modifications, since its containers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been designed to comply with NGV2. AAMA and Volvo/GM stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the effective dates for the vehicle requirements and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment requirements should not be concurrent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA notes that these comments were based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, as proposed in the NPRM. Since the final rule has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been made essentially consistent with NGV2 (with the exception of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon fiber containers), the agency anticipates that container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers can for the most part already certify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, other than carbon fiber ones, comply with the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. This belief is based on comments on the NPRM and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings with NGVC, the CGA, and CNG container manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to manufacturers of carbon fiber containers, EDO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that it already complies with the standard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brunswick indicated that it would need less than one month lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time for a safety factor greater than 2.25. Brunswick further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that it would need an unspecified time period to modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mounting brackets and other hardware. The CNG industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups have informed the agency that they want a CNG fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container standard to be effective as quickly as possible. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, they favor having an opportunity to ``voluntarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify compliance'' to the standard once the final rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published. The CNG industry groups believe that it is necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Federal standards to be in place as soon as possible, given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expected increased demand for CNG containers in light of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal and State fleet programs for clean fuel vehicles. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also favor quick adoption of a Federal standard to preempt state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that otherwise may be promulgated and to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard CNG containers are not marketed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish an effective date six months after the final rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued. As explained above, most CNG containers can be certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with the new Federal motor vehicle safety standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since they already comply with NGV2 or can be modified so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they comply within six months. Nevertheless, the agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is necessary to provide a leadtime of six months to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers time to make whatever design changes are necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to conduct testing so that they can certify that their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers comply with the new standard. In the meantime, prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the standard's effective date, the industry is free to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertise containers as meeting the CNG equipment standard that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take effect in six months. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Manufacturers have taken the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach of seeking early compliance with respect to other agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements such as those relating to dynamic side impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection and air bags. Therefore, the agency encourages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to seek, to the extent feasible, to manufacture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their CNG containers to meet these new requirements before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date the standard takes effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> However, the agency emphasizes that a manufacturer may not certify a container as meeting the equipment standard until the standard goes into effect. Under the Vehicle Safety Act, a certification is a statement that a vehicle or item of equipment meets all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards that are then in effect. Therefore, until a standard is effective, manufacturers may not certify compliance with it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to the concern expressed by AAMA and Volvo GM that the effective date of the container regulation should precede that of the vehicle regulation, AAMA based its comments on the belief that it will need to know the performance of the containers it will use in the fuel systems of its vehicles. NHTSA notes that CNG containers now typically meet NGV2 and thus should comply with NHTSA's standards. Therefore, AAMA members already have access to and detailed knowledge about containers that should meet the new requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Portugal applies to join ERM PORTUGAL made a surprise application to join the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism yesterday, underscoring its commitment to controlling inflation. The escudo will join the ERM on Monday at a central rate against the D-Mark of Esc87.6, assuming Portugal's application is accepted by a meeting today of Community officials. The move, which is unlikely to have any impact on sterling, will mean that all 12 EC members, except Greece, have their currencies pegged to the D-Mark within the ERM. The Portuguese currency, like those of Spain and Britain, will be allowed to fluctuate in a wide, 6 per cent band. All other units have a narrow, 2.25 per cent band. The ERM is seen as a system for bringing down inflation by restricting opportunities for currencies to lose value. Portugal intends to join the mechanism at a relatively high central rate, signalling a desire to follow tough monetary policies. The decision was announced yesterday by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, after a special cabinet meeting. The escudo's central rate will be Esc180 against the European Currency Unit (Ecu). A meeting today of the EC's monetary committee will review the procedures for entry and set limits for the escudo's links with the other currencies in the system. The move was not expected until later this year or early in 1993 when inflation - 10.2 per cent at the end of February on an annualised basis - was expected to be substantially reduced.

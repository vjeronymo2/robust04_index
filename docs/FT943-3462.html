			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Management: Merit in being a mentor Lorna Beckford believes that being a successful role model and mentor to Veron Neale, a young Afro-Caribbean undergraduate, is a valuable two-way process. 'It is important to demonstrate to young black people that they can be successful in big companies. Conversely, I have enjoyed being a mentor to Veron. Her questions sharpen my own thinking,' says Beckford, an equal opportunities manager at British Telecommunications. BT is one of a host of companies taking part in a pioneering scheme for undergraduates developed by Norman McLean, careers adviser for African, Caribbean and Asian students at the University of East London. It is a unique post. Part of McLean's brief was to increase the success rate of ethnic minority graduates in the job market. Research by the Commission for Racial Equality has shown that black graduates are twice as likely as their white peers to be unemployed after graduating. A priority for McLean was to establish better links with employers. McLean says that many students may need a boost in confidence to encourage them to apply for employers' graduate training schemes. 'Some students are the only members of their families to have entered higher education and do not know anybody in their own communities to whom they can go for guidance,' he says. The mentor scheme provides a one-to-one relationship which allows students to focus on their personal and professional needs. Being a mentor is a serious undertaking and requires commitment, including spending up to half a day every month for six months with the student. Last year more than 100 mentors were recruited from 60 employers and McLean is now recruiting employers for this year's scheme. In November he will launch a nationwide programme involving seven universities and colleges.</p>

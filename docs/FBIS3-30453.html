In an interview for CTK, ITAR-TASS and AP, dedicated to the  latest developments in Russia, Havel said he has always had much  liking for the reform efforts of former Russian First  Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar and former Finance Minister Boris  Fyodorov.    "I hope that the current changes will not mean the freezing  or stopping these reforms. If reforms were to be stopped  half-way it would be even worse than if they had not been  started at all," Havel said.</p>

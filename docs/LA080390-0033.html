			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> An Oceanside resident who has contracted malaria probably was infected locally  by a mosquito bite, county health officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The person, who lives near San Luis Rey River, had not traveled outside San  Diego County recently, leading county health officials to conclude that a  mosquito was the probable source of his infection.  </P> <P> Besides surveying the area for any other possible cases, county officials also  set mosquito traps along the riverbed and also plan to spray the area through  Saturday night to kill adult mosquitoes.  </P> <P> Noting that only one of the 24 mosquito species known to occupy the county is  capable of carrying malaria, health officials emphasized that the chances of  getting the disease through a mosquito bite are slim. Nevertheless, people who  live near the riverbed should take precautions such as wearing long-sleeved  shirts and pants or using mosquito repellents, they added.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Poachers tried to enter the Russian waters off the  isle of Kunashir in the Russian Far East on 14 occasions from  June 1 to 6. They approached from the Japanese island of  Hokkaido without identification signs or navigation lights in  poor visibility.    The Russian border guards had to fire warning shots,  Lieutenant General Vitaliy Sedykh, commander of the Pacific  border guard district told the Japanese consul in Vladivostok  Wednesday.    The Russian border guard press office reported that the  poachers did not respond to all demands to stop. As they  escaped, they cut off the nets in which large amounts of fish  died.    Sedykh said that warning shots were fired in the early hours  of June 4 and 6 when two poaching schooners and six schooners  respectively were sighted.    The border guards fired over 300 30 mm and around 10 76 mm  shells.</p>

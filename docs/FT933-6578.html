			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / China, Pakistan hit by US sanctions THE US yesterday imposed economic sanctions on China and Pakistan, claiming they dealt in sensitive missile technology in violation of international arms controls. Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said the US would prohibit sales of munitions and sensitive technology - that with both military and civilian uses - to both countries for two years. In the case of China, US companies will be denied export licences for sales to or contracts with 10 Chinese entities, including the ministry of aerospace industry and the ministry of defence. Only new sales and contracts will be affected. The sanctions are expected to have little impact on Pakistan which is not a big consumer of such US products. Officials said they were reviewing how the law would apply to the purchase of spare parts and maintenance contracts on F-16 jet fighters bought from the US. The decision is expected to cost US companies Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) in lost sales. Asked if American companies would be protected against their losses, Mr McCurry said: 'No. That's a significant cost that we pay but it reflects the seriousness with which we look at the issue of nuclear proliferation.' Yesterday's announcement followed months of disagreement among US intelligence agencies about whether China was shipping components of the M-11 missile to Pakistan in violation of the International Missile Technology Control Regime. This week the agencies said they had reached a consensus that the sales had taken place. M-11 missiles can be equipped with nuclear warheads and have a range of nearly 300 miles. Under US law, the administration is required to impose sanctions for breaches of the missile control regime. The severity of the sanctions depends on the gravity of the violation. President Bill Clinton has vowed to take a strong line regarding China and weapons proliferation. By choosing not to retaliate against Chinese exports to the US, he has probably contained the dispute, which might have grown to include a Chinese embargo against US agriculture and other low technology products. China has consistently denied making illicit sales. Pakistan yesterday also denied that its purchases had broken US rules. The foreign ministry said Pakistan had acquired only 'some short-range missiles' from China after being attacked by Soviet-made scud missiles from Afghanistan in the late 1980s. 'Concern for missile proliferation does not arise from Pakistan but from India's extensive missile development programme, including the Prithvi and Agni missile systems,' an official said.

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (6): Why pay for what you don't need? - Execution-only Two completely different types of stock market investor have one thing in common: the same sort of stockbroking service will suit their needs. It is known in the business as an 'execution-only service', though dealing-only would be a more readily understandable description. At one end of the investor spectrum is the holder of a handful of privatisation issues with only a modest overall value. At the other end is the active private investor who closely follows the fortunes of different companies. He decides what to buy and sell and when to buy and sell. The second sort of investor does not need the advice which the traditional private-client broker offers and, more important, does not want to pay for it. The first sort of investor probably would appreciate a bit of hand-holding, but may find the cost of advice disproportionate to the value of his share-holding. The prime appeal of execution-only brokers is the value they can offer to cost-conscious investors. The traditional broker may charge up to 1.85 per cent for each deal, with minimum charges of up to Pounds 50. By contrast, some execution-only services set the minimum as low Pounds 10 with a percentage charge nearer the 1 per cent mark. The idea of cheap broking came from the US, where the more marketing-conscious Americans call it discount broking. Two of big US discount brokers, Fidelity and Charles Schwab, run stockbroking operations on this side of the Atlantic. But it is the home-grown broker Sharelink which has made much of the running in uncovering the big demand for cheap, no-frills share-dealing services. Sharelink has even advertised itself on prime-time television. High-profile promotion of this sort by a stockbroker would have been unimaginable a decade or so ago. Other players have entered the same market, including the Share Centre and, more recently, CityDeal. Despite the onward march of execution-only services, many established brokers have been happy to stick to familiar ground, offering advice on what to buy and sell to the many stock market investors who require it. They also provide portfolio management, taking all the decisions for people who do not want to be involved in managing their capital. But some of the traditionalists have responded to the new competition by running separate, branded, dealing-only services. Thus Investorlink is run by Walker, Crips, Weddle, Beck. The Sharemarket is part of Gall &amp; Eke. Stocktrade is owned by Brewin Dolphin. The most basic of execution-only services simply involves carrying out orders to buy and sell. But there are often extras, such as the provision of information on companies and the various investment ratios, as well as things like Pep and nominee services. Price differentials can still be significant, and the cheapest broker may depend on the size of the deal. That is one reason why canny investors will use several different brokers, depending on the exact nature of the deal they want carried out.</p>

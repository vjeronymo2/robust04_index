			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang's position in connection with the issue  of the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection of  its nuclear weapons is arousing apprehension throughout world.  Station commentator (Aleksey Kondrachev) writes:    What is Moscow's reaction to this matter? In a news  conference, Gregory Karasin, official spokesman of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, said: Moscow cannot but express apprehension  over how the agreement between the IAEA and Pyongyang is being  carried out. First and foremost, Pyongyang must abide by the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT].    Regarding the DPRK statement, Gregory Karasin said there are  doubts about whether the inspections will continue. He pointed  out that North Korea's remark that it will withdraw from the NPT  is indeed arousing worry and apprehension around the world.  Russia hopes that as a member of the NPT, the DPRK will abide  by its obligations. Also, the DPRK should completely abide by  the agreements reached with the IAEA.    Moscow is calling for bilateral or multilateral talks to  ease  the tension surrounding the Korean peninsula. In a news  conference with reporters, a U.S. undersecretary of state said  Washington is also calling for a diplomatic solution to the  issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear facilities.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed out that  stronger measures could follow, depending on what Pyongyang  does. He warned that if there is no change in the DPRK's  position, the UN Security Council [UNSC] may even adopt a  resolution resulting in sanctions against the DPRK.    In a news conference, Takemura Mashiyoshi, director general  of the general affairs agency, pointed out that Japan is already  examining what concrete measures it will take if the UNSC  proclaims sanctions against the DPRK.    According to a statement by the official spokesman of the  French Foreign Ministry, France recognizes that international  sanctions must be taken against the DPRK.    However, Beijing absolutely opposes such a measure. In a  news conference, Chinese Premier Li Peng said China consistently  believes that the issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear  facilities must be resolved not through pressure but through  dialogue and negotiations.    Pyongyang's position remains the same. The DPRK is rejecting  all denunciation. In a news conference in Moscow, the DPRK  ambassador to Russia said it is inevitable that the DPRK will  have to take countermeasures against pressure and threats from  the United States.</p>

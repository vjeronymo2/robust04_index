			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Xiao from the "Opinion" page: "State Slows </F> Down the Economy"]    [Text] The performance in the first quarter of this year  shows that the central government is slowing the tempo of  economic development.    But, if the government wants to continue calling the tune  and  keep the dancers on their feet, it has to watch out for  inflation and the ailing State-owned enterprises.    "Against a background of bold reform moves and high  inflation, a slight slowdown in the economy is good news," said  Liu Li, an analyst on macro-economic performance with the State  Economic &amp; Trade Commission.    "It may ease worries that an overheated environment could  undermine the success of the prospective financial reform  package."    Ever since last September when central government went for  an  easy money policy, economists have been afraid that the economy  may be on the way to overheating.    But, despite their deep worries, they prefer a step-by-step  slowdown in the economy to a sudden application of the brakes --  the economic instability caused by an emergency stop is the last  thing they want to see.    And now the first signs of the hoped for slowdown are  becoming apparent.    In the period from January to March the industry grew by  18.6  percent, which was more than 3 percentage points down on the  same period last year.    And conditions are favourable to the government side in the  battle against inflation.    Consumer market are fairly stable which is helping the  government to hold down price hikes. Retail sales in the first  quarter were 25 percent up on the same period last year, a 5  percent rise after inflation.    And in spite of low interest rates, residents continue to  put  their money in the banks.    According to Liu, bank savings ballooned to 1,660 billion  yuan ($190.8 billion).    This represents deposits of 180 billion yuan ($20.7 billion)  since the end of last year.    During the first few months of last year, by comparison,  depositors were cashing in their savings to protect themselves  from inflation.    "The wide range of goods in the shops has boosted consumer  confidence, and they have learnt from 1988's panic buying and  are more reasonable when going shopping," said the analyst. It  is widely believed that a nationwide buying spree is now  impossible.    In 1988 when China first witnessed successive months of  double- digit inflation rates, it was spend, spend, spend.    But this year, more and more people are making fixed-term  deposits at the expense of current accounts, as is shown by the  downturn in the curve which traces the ratio between the two.    This new savings trend shows that people trust in the  government's determination to fight inflation. When inflation  prospects were gloomy in 1988 and in the second half of last  year, people went for current account deposits and the ratio  curve peaked.    Furthermore, by the end of last month banks had clawed back  the 140 billion yuan ($16.1 billion) which was issued around  Spring Festival. The reduction in the money supply will help to  pull down inflation.    And the balance of foreign exchange at the end of March is  expected to exceed $30 billion, compared with only $21 billion  at the beginning of this year.    "The economy is heading for a healthy status and a soft  landing is in prospect," said Li Guobin, an analyst at the State  Information Centre.    And industrial growth is going to fall off, he said.    Enterprises will continue to suffer money shortages, as is  shown by the declining ratio between business savings and  industrial output. And as consumer savings increase, sales will  wane, increasing stockpiles.    Businesses are not optimistic about the immediate future of  their markets.    And the government's tight credit policy will also cool down  the economy.    Central financing of capital construction has decreased 23  percent in the first quarter, according to Liu.    But, although money supply is being squeezed, inflation  seems  to continue to grow. Li said that the consumer prices index in  the first quarter was up 20 percent. And inflation will  continue to be a major problem in the second quarter of this  year, making it difficult to predict the course of this year's  economic development.    Leading economist Wu Jinglian said that central government  must stick to its anti-inflation policy.    Another knotty problem is the declining performance of  State-  owned enterprises.    According to Liu Li, 45.9 percent of State-owned enterprises  were in the red at the end of February. One third of  State-owned enterprises suffered losses last year.    Economists are worried that the ailing enterprises may delay  banking reform. For, once the State banks are commercialized,  they will grant loans according to business performance, rather  than losing their money in the black hole of unprofitable white  elephants.    Meanwhile, the gap between the booming coastal and inland  regions is widening.    In the first quarter, seven provinces in the east and south  -- Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui Fujian, Jiangxi and  Guangdong- contributed 12.2 percentage points to the nation's  18.6-percent industrial growth.    And the country's economic progress cannot be secured if its  regions continue to dance to different beats.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Washington looks forward to a less frosty relationship RELATIONS between the US and Israel have rarely been frostier than they have over the past two years, and the Bush administration's pleasure at the prospect of dealing with a new Israeli government is scarcely disguised. President George Bush and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir never got along. They clashed on policy - notably about the issue of US loan guarantees to help resettle Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and about Likud's refusal to give up occupied territories in return for a Middle East peace settlement - but their conflict was compounded by personal antipathy. Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, have always had a much warmer relationship with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, who as defence minister was a frequent visitor to Washington earlier in the Bush administration. The US administration yesterday refrained from direct comment on the Israeli election results, but Mr Baker made perfectly clear his belief that the likelihood of a Labour government should provide new impetus to the Middle East process, which has been largely stalled since the last round of negotiations in Washington in April. 'I would hope that we could see the next round of bilateral discussions taking place just as soon as it is conveniently possible in the aftermath of the formation of a new Israeli government,' Mr Baker said yesterday. While no one believes that progress in the peace talks will be easy, even with a Labour government, Labour is expected at least to be less dogmatic than Likud on the principle of giving up, in exchange for peace, some of the occupied territories. On issues such as settlements policy and Palestinian self-government, the Labour party stands much closer than Mr Shamir's Likud to the Bush administration's view of the necessary components for a Middle East peace settlement. A shift in policy on settlements - even though Mr Rabin rules out only 'political' settlements, not those which serve some security purpose - could open the door for Israel to revive its request for the US to guarantee Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) of loans to help with the resettlement of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. However, Mr Baker refused to speculate on that possibility, warning that it might be days or weeks before a new Israeli government was in place. In Congress, too, aides said that while some members might see the Israeli election results as an opportunity to revive the loan guarantees issue, any discussion before the formation of a new government would be premature. They noted that congressional opposition to the loan guarantees was based not only on Israel's settlements policy, but on a more general reluctance to vote for any kind of foreign aid in an election year.</p>

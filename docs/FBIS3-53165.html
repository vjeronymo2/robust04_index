We  had hoped that the efforts of the sincere sons of Yemen would be  pooled to produce a solution and a way out of the stifling  crisis which has taken hold at all levels. We have followed the  efforts of the good Yemeni men and leaders from the various  political forces as well as the efforts of the brothers and  friends to promote a solution that would safeguard Yemen, its  unity, and its democracy and spare Yemen and its people entry  into a dark tunnel with no known end and a catastrophe the  dimensions of which only almighty God would know.    We have always pointed out that a lack of a comprehensive  strategic vision for the post-unity era would certainly lead  Yemen to this tragic situation and that an approach by the  political leadership to this civilized shift [unity] based on  narrow-minded perspectives and calculations would lead everyone  to this critical uncontrollable situation.    We made every possible effort to prevent the situation  reaching the point it has now reached, and we submitted a  serious initiative based on advanced local government that would  preserve Yemen's unity and popular democracy and lay the  foundations for the future. We explained that we left the  homeland in the interest of unity and that we will remain loyal  to that unity because we cannot forget the waves of martyrs who  died for it nor can we forget that all the wars and infighting  that occurred in our recent history were for the sake of unity,  and also that we should not fight among ourselves for the  disintegration of Yemen because history would condemn our entire  generation for such a sin.    Despite all that, the crisis has deepened and the situation  has worsened, warning of grave consequences as all institutions  are being geared toward serving the conflict and the parties to  the conflict, reaching the point of sharp polarization in the  armed forces and security forces, which are being systematically  mobilized on a divisive basis to resolve the situation.    Signs of explosion and infighting are looming on the horizon  in our country, warning of a civil war that would destroy  everything, tear Yemen and its people apart, revive all  sectarian, partitionist, and tribal ills which were buried by  the September, October, and great May revolutions, and destroy  the achievements of generations of our struggle people.    Masses of our great people, the situation has reached a  critical point and the time has come for the people to pronounce  their verdict: No to infighting, no to the logic of force, no  to the revivial of partition and totalitarian rule, and no to  the disintegration of Yemen.    Here and in the name of millions of our people, I appeal to  the political leadership to resort to reason and serious  dialogue, which is the only option, and to begin to implement,  step by step, what was agreed in the Dialogue Committee. I  particularly appeal to our armed forces not to be dragged into  that fatal conflict and not to aim their guns at any party  because by doing that they would be aiming directly at the very  heart of the people and their hopes and aspirations. Only the  united voice of the people, all the people, and of their armed  forces would safeguard unity, a resounding voice saying no to  infighting and no to ruinous civil war, and yes to dialogue, for  only dialogue will protect unity and democracy and maintain  general security and stability in the region.</p>

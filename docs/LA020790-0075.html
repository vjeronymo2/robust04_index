			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINNIPEG OFFICIAL SAYS HE HAS NO PLANS TO SELL TO ANAHEIM GROUP  </P> <P> The president of the Winnipeg Jets said he has no plans to sell his NHL team to  an investors' group from Anaheim, in the wake of news reports Tuesday from  Canada that an offer was made.  </P> <P> "We have not accepted any offers," Jet President said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> "We're not moving and we're not selling the team. Let's drop it."  </P> <P> Shenkarow conceded he has been approached by people who "said they want to buy  the team." Among the offers was one from Anaheim, said Shenkarow, who declined  to identify the individuals involved.  </P> <P> "They saw who is the smallest franchise, in the smallest market," said  Shenkarow, who wants a new arena with revenue from concessions and luxury  suites.  </P> <P> He said the chances of getting a new facility in Winnipeg are "50-50." If a new  arena is not built, Shenkarow said, he would entertain other offers.  </P> <P> However, the Jets' president said he is unfamiliar with Anaheim's proposed  arena, which has been challenged in court by the Los Angeles Rams, among  others.  </P> <P> Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services, the firm selected to build  and operate Anaheim's proposed 20,000-seat arena, said there is a group  prepared to buy a basketball or hockey franchise for the new facility.  </P> <P> But Monet and city officials have declined to identify the would-be owners  other than to say "it's not the city, not Ogden."

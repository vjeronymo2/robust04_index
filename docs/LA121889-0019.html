			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORNING BRIEFING: THESE COACHES HAVE HEART-TO-HEART TALK  </P> <P> Rick Majerus, the University of Utah's basketball coach, was understandably  nervous before undergoing coronary bypass surgery Thursday.  </P> <P> Majerus said he called a friend, Indiana University assistant coach Don  Donoher. "I told Don, 'I'm really apprehensive,' " Majerus said. " 'I don't  know what I'm getting into. I wonder if Bob (Knight, Indiana's coach) could  give me Bo Schembechler's phone number.' At 7 o'clock the next morning,  Schembechler was on the phone to me."  </P> <P> Schembechler, the University of Michigan coach who will retire after the  Wolverines play USC in the Rose Bowl, underwent open heart surgery in 1970 and  1987.  </P> <P> "He talked to me a long time and explained everything," Majerus told the  Herald-Times of Bloomington, Ind. "And he said, 'You're going to be better than  ever, and you're going to feel better. You're going to be more productive.' "  </P> <P> Majerus, who coached at Ball State in Indiana, still is in intensive care at a  Salt Lake City hospital. He said he plans to change his diet.  </P> <P> "I am a cured man," he said. "I'm never going to that Choo-Choo Train and eat a  bucket of ribs again. I don't know if I can go with a carrot souffle, but I  can't eat every rib in the house like I used to."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Dec. 18, 1964, who scored 56 points, including 18 in the final  quarter, in a 111-107 victory over the Lakers?  </P> <P> Camera shy: Don't expect any interviews with Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan  during the Eagles-New Orleans Saints telecast on ABC tonight. Ryan still is  fuming over some comments by the ABC crew during Philadelphia's loss to the  Bears at Chicago Oct. 2 and said he isn't going to talk to them.  </P> <P> "They put down Buddy Ryan," he said. "They put down (Eagle quarterback) Randall  Cunningham. They put down our football team. I don't have any respect for them.  We don't need these guys. They need us."  </P> <P> He touched 'em all: There's only so much good a pregame pep talk from Dodger  Manager Tom Lasorda can do.  </P> <P> Lasorda, in Indiana for a visit, gave a brief talk to the Valparaiso Crusaders  basketball team Saturday night before their nonconference home game against  Xavier.  </P> <P> The Crusaders appeared fired up as they emerged from the locker room after  Lasorda's talk and, despite their 0-6 record, they took a 12-5 lead against the  Musketeers. But the magic wore off, and Xavier improved to 3-1 with a 95-63  victory.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Oscar Robertson of the Cincinnati Royals.  </P> <P> Quotebook: John Brockman of Spring Valley, Ohio, who saw his first race at  Hialeah in 1939, on rumors that the Florida race track will be turned into a  cemetery: "It's like a champion that's over the hill. Time has passed it by,  that's all." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

Sakalas and V.  Andriukaitis acquainted the journalists with documents related  to the procedure of no confidence in the government that this  faction is initiating. The journalists were also informed that  13 Seimas members had already signed the text of the declaration  of no confidence in the government, and that seven additional  members intended to sign in the near future. (The signatures of  29 members of Seimas are required for the Seimas to take up  deliberation of the issue of no confidence in the government.)    Seimas deputy chairman A. Sakalas set forth the main  principles on the basis of which the Social Democrats were  expressing their lack of confidence in the LDDP government.  According to him, the current government did not implement its  strategic pledges and did not present a vision of the future of  Lithuania. "We do not know what kind of industrial structure is  foreseen for Lithuania, or what Lithuanian agriculture will be  like and whether the effort will be exerted to make it  effective. We also do not know what kind of banking structure we  will have," A. Sakalas noted. In his opinion, the government has  heretofore said nothing about the development of the services  system, or about solving transit problems, including military  transit. There was also nothing being said about the creation of  free economic zones, the development of infrastructure, or the  problems of employment and unemployment.    Also, according to the head of the Social Democratic party,  the government was operating without adhering to the program  that it had adopted.    He asserted that in the wake of the actions of the current  government, Lithuania has "eaten" its way to a $174 million  debt, and that this debt will have to be repaid from the pockets  of the taxpayers or by using new loans. "The economic crisis  continues to deepen, and industrial and agricultural production  is decreasing", A. Sakalas continued, noting that no one  foresees when this crisis might end. He also characterized as  fictitious the increase in residents' income proclaimed by the  government, since about 70 percent of this increase was achieved  by using foreign credits, and the remainder came from "eating  up" the savings of residents and enterprises, as well as from  the "economy" to compensate for unpaid taxes.    A. Sakalas is of the opinion that responsibility for the  situation in the country also falls on opposition parties and  that this responsibility takes various forms. These include the  proposal by the conservatives to initiate early elections,  something which A. Sakalas considers unrealistic at this time;  or the suggestion to "pick off one minister at a time", which  Sakalas says is being proposed by certain LDDP representatives;  or simply operating on the basis of the principle "It's none of  my concern" and observing the situation passively. According to  A. Sakalas, the Christian Democrats have chosen this last route,  asserting that "We did not appoint this government, and so it  isn't for us to dismiss it either." The Social Democratic leader  appraised that kind of position by the Christian Democratic  party as "political impotence or hypocrisy in not wanting to see  the poverty of the Lithuanian people."    When asked who might replace the government led by A.  Slezevicius, V. Andriukaitis said that considering the extent of  the crisis, "it is doubtful whether a single political force  could or can lead Lithuania out of that crisis." He believes  that no one political force currently has such a level of  popular support that its proposed reforms would be accepted.    V. Andriukaitis noted that "the problem of coalitions is  becoming the urgent concern for all political parties at this  time." In his opinion, political forces could make a pact of  concord for two years, regulate the decision-making process in  the Seimas, form a new government, and confirm its new program.</p>

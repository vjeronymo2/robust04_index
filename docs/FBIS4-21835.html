			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Excerpt] The IRA tonight announced a three-day ceasefire  from Tuesday next week as Prime Minister John Major arrived in  Northern Ireland for a visit.    Speculation had been rife that a ceasefire was imminent and  that it could be open-ended. In the end, they said they were  suspending offensive military action for 72-hours from midnight  Tuesday, 5 April to midnight Friday, 8 April.    The IRA said: ``Our statement of March 13 reiterated our  continued willingness to be positive and flexible in exploring  the potential for moving the situation forward. As further  evidence of this, we will unilaterally suspend offensive  military action for 72 hours from midnight Tuesday, 5 April  until midnight Friday, 8 April. There are no conditions attached  to this unilateral initiative, but we hope that the British  government will accept this further opportunity in the spirit in  which it is offered and utilise it to the best advantage of the  British and Irish people.''    The IRA made it clear that what they wanted was  clarification  of the Downing Street declaration signed by Mr. Major and Albert  Reynolds on December 15 and not immediate negotiations.    It is understood the thinking behind the statement was that  the IRA wanted to make what they considered to be a gesture of  goodwill in an effort to break the current impasse.    The Government has repeatedly insisted that there can be no  talks with Sinn Fein until the declaration was accepted and a  permanent end to violence called and seen to be in operation.    The IRA statement also said: ``Making peace is a difficult  business for all involved but the difficulties must be overcome.  That too is the responsibility of all involved, but particularly  the British Government. We hope that the further opportunity  here provided is used to that purpose and effect.''    Mr. Major, arriving in Belfast shortly before the IRA's  announcement tonight, said he thought a ceasefire over the  Easter period would be cynical. What people wanted was a  permanent end to violence, not just a brief public relations  gesture. [passage omitted]</p>

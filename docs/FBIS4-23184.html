			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "That Mandela and Terreblanche  meet and talk is good. But what they have to talk about gives  cause for concern," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on 30 May in a page-14 editorial. "Terreblanche wants amnesty  for a bunch of rightwingers who have perpetrated awful  atrocities after the current deadline," and "to enter into  discussions with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] on this  issue is to dignify his cause with a status it does not  deserve." Presenting another side of the argument, the  editorial states that "morally, amnesty is no more or less right  for today's cases than it was for the Strydoms and McBrides."  "But we do not believe that amnesty needs to be extended so far  as to cover crimes committed after inclusive negotiations began  in earnest in 1992. To do so is to fly in the face of  commitments given at the time, to cheapen the sacrifice of those  who died and to further the impression that life is cheap in  modern South Africa."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "Justice Minister Dullah Omar  probably had no option but to formalise the trading of indemnity  for information about those events," begins the Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 May in a page-12 editorial. The  editorial adds that "several commissions either failed to  uncover evidence or had it hidden from them, and even the  Goldstone Commission has been only partially successful in  peeling open layers of deceit." Mandela's government is  partialy discussing amnesty in an attempt to "heal the wounds of  the past, to allay fears of retribution and to join former foes  in building a new country." However, "a willingness to forgive  is matched by a determination not to forget; linked to both is  the necessity to know why things were done, but whom on whose  orders." Concluding the editorial writes that "what Omar has not  said is when the process will stop, when the indemnity date,  originally set at October 1990, will not be advanced for any  reason. Killers must lose their political excuse, and police  know that prosecuting criminality is not a waste of time. The  transition cannot go on forever."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Judge's Decision in Goniwe Inquest Viewed -- "The feeling of  deja vu, considering the historic times we are in, sits rather  uncomfortably on the half-expected findings of the now notorious  Goniwe Inquest," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on  30 May in a page-12 editorial. Such findings "were par for the  course" in the past. Now, however, it "defies all reason."</p>

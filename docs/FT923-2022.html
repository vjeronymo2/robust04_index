			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Food and Wine: Cheaper bubbly THE PROSPECTS of cheaper champagne have been enhanced by a sharp, unprecedented cut in the officially recommended price of grapes in the large vintage now in progress, writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell. They are down from FFr30 to FFr24 a kilo for those from the top-rating villages to FFr19.1 for the outlying ones. Although the lower prices will take some time to work through the blends, this is accompanied by a quality-raising elimination of the inferior third pressing and a reduction in the maximum quantity of grapes permitted per hectare, plus a blocking of surplus still wines to prevent excess sparkling wine production from a vintage that may yield at least 250 million bottles - 20 per cent more than estimated sales this year.</p>

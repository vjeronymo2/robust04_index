			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Observer: Empty house Still on the subject of political patronage, bets are starting to be laid on who is going to get the chairmanship of the Housing Corporation, one of Britain's biggest quangos. Chairman Sir Christopher Benson is moving to the Schools Funding Agency in April and yesterday the government announced that one possible successor, deputy chairman Sir Norman Wakefield, was stepping down later this month. Given that the Housing Corporation spends about Pounds 2.3bn - making it Britain's biggest house builder - its budget could come under attack in the next round of government cuts. Even so there are plenty of big names in the trade with time on their hands. Sir Eric Pountain steps down as chairman of Tarmac in a few months, and Sir Clifford Chetwood, the ex-chairman of Wimpey, or Sir Nigel Broackes, the founder of Trafalgar House, would fit the bill on past form. It's the sort of post which in olden days would have counted towards a peerage. Of the existing board members, solicitor David Kleeman's name has been mentioned. But as is indicated by Sir Norman's imminent departure, the job is likely to go to an outsider.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWEL THIEVES HIT AGAIN, GET $20,000  </P> <P> Four men brandishing handguns took $20,000 worth of jewelry and gems from a  Robinson's store in Cerritos on Wednesday in the latest of a series of armed  robberies at Los Angeles area department store jewelry counters, sheriff's  deputies said Thursday.  </P> <P> Customers were in the store at the time but no one was injured, Sgt. Steve  Manthorne said.  </P> <P> "It fits in with what we call the counter-smash robberies that have been  happening in the past three to four years," Manthorne said. "Numerous stores  have been victims and it's an ongoing problem."  </P> <P> The thieves strode into the jewelry department at Robinson's in Los Cerritos  Center Mall about noon Wednesday, pulling out revolvers and demanding that a  sales clerk open the display case, he said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the robbers emptied the case of gems and jewelry, fled the store  and drove off in a white Chevrolet Cavalier.  </P> <P> The car had been stolen and was abandoned across the street from the mall,  fitting a pattern followed by thieves in similar jewelry-counter robberies,  Manthorne said.  </P> <P> "It's a method of operation that robbers have found successful," he said. "They  take off in a stolen car, abandon it one or two blocks away from the store and  have another car waiting for them."  </P> <P> In September, three armed robbers took $500,000 worth of necklaces, bracelets,  pins and rings from a Bullock's store at the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, the  second such incident recently at that shopping mall.  </P> <P> Two months earlier, thieves with handguns took about $200,000 worth of jewelry  from a Broadway store at the Sherman Oaks Mall, officials said.  </P></p>

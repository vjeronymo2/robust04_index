			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / France's own Euro-sceptics: Europe The melodramatic scenes of confusion, ambiguity, double-dealing and uproar, in which the parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty was finally brought to a end in the British House of Commons last week, provided a fitting conclusion to a political process which has been as unedifying as it has been prolonged. Some people may think that the government's never-ending succession of defeats, retreats and ambiguous victories was just the unfortunate consequence of the weakness of the prime minister and of his paper-thin majority in parliament. Yet this lamentable political spectacle, so far from being an accident, may in fact be an accurate representation of attitudes in the government, in the House and among the people. In any case, Mr John Major brought on his own head last week's melodramatic denouement, since he deliberately set up the conditions which maximised the risks both to himself and to the treaty. When he insisted on a special status for Britain outside the social chapter of Maastricht, he made it easy for his opponents to argue that the treaty could be changed after all; he gave them the choice of alternative battlegrounds, on which to form opportunistic alliances against him. Even now, it is difficult to make out why Mr Major insisted so hard on staying out of the social chapter. He argues vehemently that greater job protection for workers would in fact destroy jobs. But does he seriously expect the other 11 member states to rush ahead with restrictive new employment laws, just at a time when unemployment is so high and still rising? Is it that he shares that strange traditional British prejudice, that foreigners do not understand economics? Does he assume that their political behaviour is wholly irrational? Or was this just gesture politics addressed to his own backbenchers? Was he opting out of some bits of the Maastricht treaty, any bits, it didn't much matter which, mainly in order to demonstrate a suitable determination to maintain an arm's-length independence from Brussels? The Maastricht treaty debate has stirred up fierce nationalistic passions, largely inspired by wild phantasms of some kind of mega-state run from Brussels. Instead of dispelling these irrational fears, the government has actually encouraged them by appeasement. However, the British case needs to be seen in a broader European perspective. France has in recent years always been at the forefront of initiatives to press Europe forward; and opinion polls have showed large and steady majorities in favour of the Community. But even in France the Maastricht treaty stirred up fierce opposition from nationalists. The government only won its popular referendum by the narrowest of margins; and the passionate debates of the parliamentary phase of ratification showed that quite a large minority of Conservative deputies, especially among the Gaullists, were unconditionally hostile to the proposed development of the Community model of Europe. The anti-Community minority on the Gaullist benches is now much larger, as a result of the Conservative landslide in the March general elections; and it is not clear that the government led by Mr Edouard Balladur is going to be able to keep it under control. On the contrary, the large government majority may well fall apart ahead of next spring's elections to the European Parliament, and it may even split three ways; and there is already intermittent sniping by nationalist Gaullists against the government's economic policy, which is an indirect way of attacking the Maastricht treaty. The government will almost certainly face a breakaway challenge from former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who seems determined to lead his own UDF party in the European elections next year, since this would give him a dry run for another go at the presidential elections in 1995. It is partly to deflect him that Mr Balladur has offered to head a single Conservative list of candidates; but his other motive is to prevent the ultra-nationalists in the Gaullist party from fielding a separate anti-European list of candidates. Mr Philippe Seguin, a leading Gaullist nationalist, has already started attacking the government's franc fort policy, with its emphasis on low inflation and resulting high interest rates, and has called for 'another', more growth-oriented, policy. Such a change in stance might help reduce unemployment; it would certainly further undermine the Maastricht programme for monetary union. By himself, however, Mr Seguin is probably no more than a nuisance; more worrying for Mr Balladur is that Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists, has ostentatiously failed to denounce Mr Seguin. There are two differences between Britain and France. The first is that the Gaullists who opposed Maastricht were more numerous than the British Euro-sceptics, because nationalism is, after all, the dimly remembered ideology that once underlay Gaullism; whereas British Tories would deny anything as coherent as an ideology. Second, the entire middle ground of the French political and administrative establishment is a whole order of magnitude more pro-Community than their counterparts in Britain. If the franc were blown out of the exchange rate mechanism, it is virtually inconceivable that any French finance minister would boast that it made him sing in the bath; on the contrary, any French government one can imagine would regard it as a major political and European crisis, calling for urgent remedial action at European level.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Porter, chief reporter: "Drug Link as </F> Thieves Go Overboard for Boats"]    [Excerpt] Behind the fanfare of the Earls Court Boat Show,  the industry is having to combat an alarming increase in boat  theft which has become linked with international drug  trafficking.    Stolen high-speed powerboats are being used to transport  drugs into Britain from offshore rendezvous. Police and marine  loss adjusters also have evidence that stolen boats have been  sent in containers to the Caribbean as a new method of  "laundering" payment for drug consignments to this country.    Thefts are not confined to coastal waters. One of the  worst-hit areas is the Midlands, where boats and trailers are  stolen from drives on suburban housing estates.    Modern manufacturing techniques, in which fibreglass hulls  are stamped out by the thousand, have brought recreational  boating within the range of lower middle-class man. They have  also made it very hard to identify stolen craft because so many  look identical and registration is not compulsory.    "Looking at rows of these boats lined up at marinas is like  looking at a car park full of Ford Escorts," said one theft  investigator. "They all look exactly the same. But whereas all  the Escorts would be on the DVLC computer in Swansea, the boats  may have little or no means of identification."    As boat builders at Earls Court report new confidence in a  reviving market, an expert in marine loss adjustment estimated  that around 2,500 boats, worth an estimated &pound;20 million,  are  stolen each year in Britain, and the figure is rising.    Peter Clarke, head of C-Claims, leading investigators into  small craft losses, said: "It is a steadily worsening trend.  Every year sees an increase in the number of thefts. In the  summer on any one day about 20 boats will be stolen around the  country.''    "My experience over 20 years in this business is that the  level of crime rises during a recession and levels out when  recovery comes--but it never falls."    Mr Clarke fears that increased links between boat thieves  and  drug traffickers could see an increasing element of violence  attached to theft. In the Caribbean, families aboard expensive  boats have been hijacked, thrown overboard and left to drown.    "Substantial yachts costing &pound;200,000 or more have been  stolen and used for drug running," he said. "We came across a  scam where containers stuffed with stolen speedboats, jet skis  and four-wheel drive vehicles were to be despatched to Caribbean  islands. There is no doubt this was meant as direct payment for  drugs."    Peter Cranstone, runs the Personal Watercraft Association,  which represents the one-man craft better known as jet skis--the  brand name for the Kawasaki model. These craft, because of their  small size and popularity, have become a major target for  organised crime. "They were being stolen and used to pay for  drug consignments--a new way of laundering payments," he  explained.    But, thanks to an agreement with four of the biggest  manufacturers, all new craft now carry two or three hidden  electronic tags--transponders--which react to electronic  scanners. According to Mr Cranstone the hidden transponders are  already proving a deterrent. [passage omitted]</p>

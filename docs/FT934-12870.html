			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Asian city pollution 'at danger levels' MANY Asian cities are dangerously polluted, and sulphur dioxide and suspended dust levels can be tens or hundreds of times worse than in US or Canadian cities, according to a report prepared by the United Nations. 'Air pollution statistics point to the special risks of living in a large Asian city,' says a study of Asian urbanisation from the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap). 'Many Asian cities have high rates of lung cancer, tuberculosis and bronchitis,' Escap says. 'In Bangkok, average blood lead levels are 40 to 45 microgrammes per decilitre, four times the US standard. There is evidence of permanent brain damage in children because of lead poisoning.' Bangkok dust levels in 1989 alone are estimated to have cost 26m lost work days and 1,400 extra deaths. The Thai capital is notorious for its traffic congestion and for its uncontrolled construction boom. Escap says the single-minded pursuit of economic growth has made several cities into 'pollution havens' afflicted by water and air pollution and inadequate waste disposal. The agency rejects the commonly held view that developing countries must first pollute to become rich and then pay for protecting the environment later. 'While appropriate environmental protection imposes minimal short-term costs, it produces substantial long-term economic and social gains,' the report says. It calls for the introduction of various forms of taxation and effective laws and institutions to restrict pollution. Water contamination, which kills thousands of Asian children each day, is a particularly serious problem. 'Rivers that flow into Asian cities are already laden with pathogens, sediments and pesticide residues,' Escap says. 'They then become increasingly polluted with sewage, industrial effluent and solid wastes.' Many Asian cities generally dispose of solid wastes in open landfills, which pose pollution problems in themselves. In Manila, about 20,000 people live on and around a rubbish dump known as Smokey Mountain, although the fact that they make money by selling the waste is often regarded as environmentally beneficial.</p>

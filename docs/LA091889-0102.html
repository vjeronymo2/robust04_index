			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTRY JOE CAPTURES WHIFF OF TROUBLED '60S  </P> <P> Even with two decades to buffer the change, it has to be a spirit-wrenching  experience for Country Joe McDonald to have gone from galvanizing a  half-million people at Woodstock to playing before less than a 10,000th that  number (we're talking about some 40 persons here) at Huntington Beach's Night  Moves on Saturday.  </P> <P> But the psychedelic-era veteran opened a solo acoustic show with his  "Entertainment Is My Business," which, rather than the cynicism or hackdom that  title might suggest, was defined by McDonald's ensuing performance as a  tenacious statement of purpose.  </P> <P> Despite the tiny -- and in some quarters noisily inattentive -- audience, the  singer-guitarist still tried as hard to connect as he did in the days when  folks got arrested for doing his "Fish Cheer" counterculture rallying cry.  </P> <P> Where he once painted his face with Day-Glo flowers and sported combat  fatigues, on Saturday McDonald looked for all the world as if he had stepped  out of a Montgomery Ward Father's Day ad, dressed in casual, nondescript  sportswear.  </P> <P> But the anti-war protest "Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag" and other of his  '60s works still held pleasingly nostalgic whiffs of patchouli, including  "Janis," "Here I Go Again" and "Not So Sweet Martha Lorraine."  </P> <P> The instrumental "Section 43" from the 1967 debut "Electric Music for the Mind  and Body," and a more recent guitar-and-harmonica piece fared less well, being  neither compositionally nor instrumentally engaging enough to sustain the time  they were given.  </P> <P> The show's few lapses did seem to come in pairs, with songs about Florence  Nightingale and Red Cross founder Clara Barton adding up to perhaps one more  tune about nursing than was needed. Similarly, the back-to-back performance of  "White Powder" and "Cocaine" only diluted the anti-drug slant of each.  </P> <P> Though he obliged fans expecting his '60s-radical anthems, McDonald very much  remained a potent topical troubadour. He brought out the timeliness of Woody  Guthrie's Depression-era "Talking Dust Bowl Blues" with its tales of hard times  and underfed kids who "looked like a tribe of thermometers running around."  </P> <P> A Navy vet himself, McDonald has been active for decades in veterans' causes,  and his strongest song of the evening was "Go Go Johnny Rambo," a biting slap  at the way America embraces the Stallone interpretation of the Vietnam  experience while ignoring the vets themselves, declaring "Loving Johnny is so  easy, because he's only a fantasy."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Athanasios Dhrougos] </F>   [Excerpts] Turkey's secret nuclear program is a threat to  Greece. According to extremely confidential APOYEVMATINI  information, YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] military  officials have been particularly concerned.    According to these reports, "heading toward the year 2000  and  facing a chaotic situation in the Balkans, Turkey in the next  three or four years will be well along the path of developing  nuclear forces, something that will make it particularly  respected in the part of the world stretching from the Adriatic  to Kazakhstan."    A nuclear program that aims to construct a nuclear bomb is  under way. This program will be added to Ankara's already  fast-developing arms programs for the Air Force and Navy. The  same confidential analysis of Turkey's nuclear activities  stresses that in the new geopolitical environment that followed  the dissolution of the Soviet nuclear arsenal; Ukraine's  acquisition of nuclear weapons; and the general instability in  the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey must  prevent incidents from happening because the threat of small  regional wars with nuclear weapons, such as between Pakistan and  India, cannot be ruled out. [passage omitted]    To a great extent, Turkey satisfies the basic prerequisites  for a nuclear country. It has uranium supplies and is strong in  the sciences. If its cooperation with Pakistan, Argentina, and  China proceeds, the Turkish nuclear bomb will become a reality.  At the same time, Ankara is trying to exploit instability in  the Middle East as well as the ambitions of many states in the  area, such as Libya and Iran, for weapons of mass destruction  (nuclear-chemical) by claiming that Iran or Iraq will threaten  it in the future. Therefore, because of changes in NATO  policies, it must have a nuclear bomb. [passage omitted]    Ankara is trying to acquire nuclear weapons from the former  Soviet Union's full and diverse arsenal but is concerned with  U.S. and European reaction. All those unemployed scientists  have been hired to various "special groups" on a yearly basis  for $2,300 per month. Their contracts may be renewed.  Scientists from Kazakhstan who are experts on nuclear weapons  teach at Istanbul University. [passage omitted]    The cost of making nuclear weapons is believed to be great  but Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and her staff are  concerned with the new world that is being created. They attach  particular importance to the country's nuclear infrastructure,  which is now making progress and will show results in three or  four years.    APOYEVMATINI knows that Turkey's nuclear program concerns  the  Greek military. It is a fact that in the next few years,  Turkey's threat to Greece will include a nuclear element. Our  side must adopt a strategy that will analyze in depth future  threats, mainly by Turkey's many arms programs.</p>

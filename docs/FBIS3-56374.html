			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuzar and Mikhail Pogorelyy: "New </F> `Flight Plan' for Russia and the United States"]    [Excerpt] The second working day of U.S. President Bill  Clinton's official visit to Russia began, by the normal  standards of diplomatic protocol, uncommonly early. Even before  the talks in the Kremlin, the U.S. head of state paid his  respects to the great people who saved humanity from fascism --  Bill Clinton laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in  Aleksandrovskiy Garden by the Kremlin Wall.    Then an extremely intense work session began. The third and  final round of the Russian-U.S. summit talks took place in the  Yekaterinskiy Hall of the Great Kremlin Palace. On the Russian  side, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation defense  minister, took part in the talks together with other delegation  members. This enables us conclude that the subject under  discussion was Russian-U.S. military-political cooperation. One  aspect of this was the retargeting of both countries' strategic  nuclear missiles. On this issue, it was announced, a mutually  acceptable understanding had been reached.    At the subsequent joint news conference, President Boris  Yeltsin announced among other things that new flight plans had  been prepared not just for the missiles (which in itself would  have been a major sensation just a couple of years ago), but for  the whole complex of Russian-U.S. relations. They will become  partners on the global strategic level.    It is precisely the fact that his intentions are sincere,  together with the fact that he is firmly protecting his own  interests, that seems to explain the persistence of President  Clinton's mediation efforts to settle the Russian-Ukrainian  crisis with regard to the nuclear missile problem. The  agreement signed after the trilateral meeting in Moscow  guarantees that the missiles stationed in Ukraine will finally  be dismantled and that the warheads will be transported to  Russia to be destroyed. All the work involved in eliminating  the third most powerful nuclear complex in the world should be  completed in record time -- 10 months. It is true that a  specific schedule for withdrawing nuclear warheads from  Ukrainian territory has not yet been published in accordance  with the mutual agreement of the parties involved.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, 2 Mar -- Problems of Polish-French defense  and military cooperation, the situation in Europe, especially in  the former Yugoslavia and Russia, and Poland's place in a  European security system were the subjects discussed by Admiral  Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Francois Leotard, defense ministers of  Poland and France, during their Wednesday [2 March] meeting in  Paris.    Minister Kolodziejczyk is on an official three-day visit to  France. On Thursday he is to take part in a trilateral meeting  of the French, Polish, and German defense ministers. [Words  indistinct] Leotard and Kolodziejczyk, Volker Ruehe will also be  taking part.    Military cooperation with France is very highly appraised by  the Polish side, as Minister Kolodziejczyk pointed out at a news  conference after his meeting with Minister Leotard. He  especially highlighted its technical aspects -- assistance by  French industry in modernizing Polish army weapons and adapting  them to West European standards. Without French assistance, the  Polish minister said, adapting our defense structures to the  level of Western Europe would have been incredibly difficult.    Kolodziejczyk also drew attention to France's role in  speeding up actions aimed at integrating Poland into a European  security system. In connection with the envisaged granting to  Poland of associate member status of the Western European Union  [WEU] (a decision is to be reached at the WEU Ministerial  Council on 9 and 10 May this year), he expressed the view that  at present this was the greatest opportunity for such  integration and at the same time a way of getting into a  European security system. According to Kolodziejczyk, Poland's  future full WEU membership could overtake the economic  integration with the European Community.    According to sources close to the French Defense Ministry,  France wants Poland's actual association with the WEU to take  place as early as possible. At a news conference on Wednesday  Leotard recalled that it was the position of France and Germany  which speeded up the process of bringing Poland closer to the  WEU. At the same time he emphasized that WEU associate status  is a transitory stage, leading to full membership in that  military organization.    During the talks between Kolodziejczyk and Leotard the issue  of Poland's possible participation in the European Corps in  Strasbourg was also raised. The Polish minister expressed his  belief that such a solution is possible and necessary.  Leotard, who regards this issue as complicated, believes that  the first step could be the presence of Polish observers at the  corps.    This subject will be discussed, among others, during the  Thursday meeting of the Polish, French, and German defense  ministers. Leotard said it would be desirable to hold such  meetings regularly, every year, and for trilateral cooperation  in the field of defense to supplement political cooperation, an  expression of which are the regular trilateral consultations  among these countries' foreign affairs ministers which have now  been taking place for two and a half years.    The heads of the Polish and French Defense Departments also  talked about joint maneuvers by the two countries' armies. It  was reported that maneuvers with the participation of French  Alpine riflemen will take place this June in southern Poland.  Also this year there will be joint maneuvers by the Polish and  French Navies in the Baltic. This will be the first joint  exercises by units of the two armies since the end of the Second  World War. They will also be the first in which French units  will participate together with units from a central European  country. Specific details of these intentions will be discussed  during the coming visit (9-12 March) to Poland by Admiral  Jacques Laxande, the chief of the General Staff of the French  Armed Forces. He will visit Warsaw, Poznan, and the triple city  [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot].</p>

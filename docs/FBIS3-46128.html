			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Violating Agreement Is Bound To Reap What It </F> Has Sown"]    [Text] China and Britain have signed a series of  agreements regarding the transfer of government which are  serious and binding. Chris Patten, since his assumption of the  governorship of Hong Kong, has simply been ignoring these  binding agreements, doing whatever he wants to do, taking  unilateral actions, undermining steady transition, and creating  chaos with a view to extending British rule and gaining more  colonial interests. The man who totally disregards the  agreements may think himself very clever. But, in fact, what he  has done will prove to be the most stupid trick, since British  interests rest on the agreements between China and Britain, too.  If the British forsake these agreements and take their own way,  they will finally find out that British interests will be hurt,  and Chris Patten will reap what he has sown.    As far as the airport issue is concerned, Chris Patten has  always been playing the "piecemeal" appropriation tactics,  acting first and reporting afterward, as he believes that what  has been done cannot be undone. His trick is to let the excess  in the construction costs keep accumulating and the "callable  equity" keep aggregating, and then leave the awful mess to the  special administrative region [SAR] government.    In doing so Chris Patten definitely has impaired the  interests of Hong Kong people and totally violated the  Sino-British memorandum on the new Hong Kong airport project.  An airport project with constantly inflating construction costs  will certainly be a project of high costs and poor returns. The  new Hong Kong airport is not to be built with pounds Chris  Patten brings from his home country. Therefore, he is not  entitled to be generous at Hong Kong's expense and to dispose of  Hong Kong people's money lavishly. The memorandum has ruled  that the liabilities related to the airport construction to be  left behind by the British Hong Kong Government shall not exceed  Hong Kong $5 million. Now the increase in construction costs  and repeated financial appropriations as a result of unilateral  acts taken by the British Hong Kong Government will leave a  HK$45 billion worth of liabilities to be borne by the SAR  government after 1997, which will be more than nine times as  much as the limit set by the memorandum. The British Hong Kong  Government's financial appropriations in violation of the  guideline on liabilities as prescribed by the memorandum are  bound to arouse reaction from the Chinese side. In order to  safeguard the interests of Hong Kong people, to ensure sound  financing for the SAR government, and to achieve a steady  transition, the Chinese side will have to take some  precautionary measures.    In a statement made yesterday, the spokesman for the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council declared:  Unless the Chinese and British sides reach an agreement on the  financing of the new Hong Kong airport project, 1) the Chinese  side and the future SAR government will take no responsibility  for any financial outlays and liabilities arising from the new  airport project. 2) All land leases related to the new airport  project and the revenues arising therefrom, including the  airport reclamation and plots of land along the airport railway,  are, with no exception, subject to negotiations and approval by  the Sino-British Land Commission, in accordance with the  provisions of Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  3) All contracts related to the new airport project, striding  over 30 June 1997, and signed by the British Hong Kong  Government without the prior consent of the Chinese side will be  null and void as of 1 July 1997. 4) All legislation related to  the new airport project passed in the British Hong Kong  Legislative Council will be null and void as of 1 July 1997.    It is not that the Chinese side does not endorse the  construction of the new airport. In fact, the Chinese side has  so far approved the Central and Wanchai land reclamation  projects and the Western cross-harbor tunnel project. The  Chinese side's very intention is to ensure that all financial  outlays conform with the memorandum, to minimize the huge amount  of liabilities left over to the SAR government, and to urge the  British side to return to the negotiating table and stop  arbitrarily spending and appropriating.    With a financial surplus of over HK$100 billion, the British  side now resorts to an idea of shifting liabilities onto the SAR  government by encroaching on the SAR's land lease revenue and  securing a huge amount of loans. This destructive [chai lan wu  2135 3620 3064] behavior will undermine cooperation and steady  transition. And the British side's purpose in doing so is to  take away the money from Hong Kong people and turn it into  staggering profits in British consortia's pockets. For example,  the Chingma Bridge project promises a profit rate as high as 50  percent. And that is the reason why the British cabinet  committee does not hesitate to support Chris Patten in breaching  agreements and acting recklessly during the late transitional  period.    The practice to leave over to the SAR government an amount  of  liabilities nine times as much as the limit prescribed by the  memorandum is a wishful thinking on the part of Chris Patten.  But now the Chinese side has declared that it will not take any  responsibility for such financial outlays and liabilities. This  will warn international consortia not to be fooled by the  British Hong Kong authorities and not to grant loans at risk.  This actually will prevent the British from arbitrarily  spending money and leaving huge debts to Hong Kong people. The  British side is also trying to pave the way for acquiring  greater economic benefits after 1997, by such means as  reassignment, signing contracts, granting franchises,  authorizing the airport corporation to grant land leases, and  formulating the new airport corporation bill to make the  corporation an "independent kingdom" and thus sidestep  supervision. But any losses arising thereof will be borne by  Hong Kong people. Therefore, the Chinese side will not possibly  recognize any laws and ordinances, contracts, and franchises  concerned before any agreement is reached. The purpose in doing  so is to guard against the attempt by the British Hong Kong  Government to anticipate and exhaust Hong Kong's financial  resources.    Lots of historical facts, as well as what is taking place  now, show that the British are trying to create chaos and then  fish in troubled waters, making money by every means. The  disputes between China and Britain on the airport issue are, in  substance, an issue of whether to observe the memorandum in  running the airport project or not and whether to handle  transition affairs through negotiations and cooperation or not.  Everyone who loves the motherland and Hong Kong will support  the Chinese side's sensible, reasonable, and legal measures and  oppose any arbitrary acts taken by the colonial authorities out  of selfish consideration.</p>

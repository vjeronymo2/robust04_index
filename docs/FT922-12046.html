			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Hurd seeks to reassure Turkey MR Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary who is making his first visit to Turkey, yesterday commended Ankara's robust role in the US-led coalition against Iraq. He emphasised the importance of Turkish backing for an extension of the allied air umbrella for the Kurds of north Iraq. Mr Hurd also sought to reassure Turkey of renewed UK support for a new role for Turkey in Europe which 'goes beyond Turkey's membership of Nato'. He pledged that Turkey would be considered as a recipient of aid under the Matutes plan, the EC's development programme for the Mediterranean basin, on an equal basis with EC members. Turkey has an association agreement with the EC and is moving towards a customs union in 1996. The visit follows the allied demarche to Iraq last week to remove missile batteries and end its radar illumination of allied aircraft. Mr Hurd said he was 'very encouraged by the shared analysis' of the security situation in North Iraq where Iraqi forces have tightened an economic blockade on Kurdish areas. He also indicated Turkey had given approval for a possible strike against Iraq, which he said was implicit in the terms of the demarche.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a  patriotic champion of reunification who had been active in South  Korea for a long time for the reunification of the country and  the democratization of the society, died, to our regret, on  January 18 at the age of 76.    He devotedly struggled in South Korea for independence and  democratization of the society and for the reunification of the  country.    He, who started the activities for democracy in 1974 as a  member of the Council of Literary Men for the Practice of  Freedom, worked out the "March 1 Declaration for Democracy and  National Salvation" against the "Yusin" fascist dictatorship in  1976. And in 1979, he, active as the chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of the National Alliance for Democracy and  Reunification, continued the struggle on the street and behind  bars, opposing the seizure of power by the "fifth republic"  military fascist clique and denouncing the barbarities of the  United States in the Kwangju popular uprising.    He was arrested and imprisoned more than once because he  urged the U.S. troops pullout, the obstacle to the country's  reunification, and called for the establishment of a democratic  government, the conclusion of a peace agreement, reunification  through confederacy, etc.    He was active as the chairman of the National Congress for  Democracy and Unification, the co-chairman of the National  Liaison Organization for Democracy, the chairman of the United  People's Movement for Democracy and Unification (Mintongnyon)  and advisor to the Coalition for National Democratic Movement  (Chonminnyon) in the period from 1984 to 1989.    He participated in the "World Conference for Peace and  Reunification of the Korean Peninsula" in 1988 and called for  the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace  agreement and the denuclearization of the peninsula.    He supported the proposal advanced by the great leader  President Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1989 for the  convocation of a North-South political consultative meeting to  discuss the way of reunifying the country through confederacy.  And he visited Pyongyang at the risk of his life in late March  that year.    While in Pyongyang, he was received by the great leader  President Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of  national reunification, and renewed his strong faith and will  for reunification.    As the advisor to Chonminnyon, he held talks with officials  of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland, agreed to the removal of the political and military  confrontation between the North and the South, the replacement  of the armistice agreement between the DPRK and the United  States with a peace agreement, the adoption of a nonaggression  declaration between the North and the South, reunification  through confederacy, etc. and published a joint statement.    Back to South Korea, he was arrested and jailed by the  fascists. But he continued the struggle for independence,  democracy and reunification. Working as the chairman of the  preparatory committee for the inauguration of the South side  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon) from 1991, he made strenuous efforts  for national unity and peaceful reunification.    Though the old man had become weak because of many years'  imprisonment, he admirably fought to the last moment of his life  for the patriotic cause of reunification.    Although Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, who fought for independence and  democratization of the South Korean society and for peaceful  reunification of the country, passed away, his desire will be  surely realised by the South Korean people and students and his  patriotic spirit for reunification will always remain in the  memory of the Koreans at home and abroad.</p>

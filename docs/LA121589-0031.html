			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> INVESTMENT IN RIK SMITS IS PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR PACERS  </P> <P> When Steve Stipanovich was injured a year ago, the Indiana Pacers had to get  production from 7-foot-4 Rik Smits faster than anticipated.  </P> <P> Under normal circumstances, Smits, a 23-year-old native of the Netherlands,  would have been given more time to mature.  </P> <P> Smits' education is one reason the Pacers won only five of their first 28 games  last season. With Stipanovich's career over, Smits is a bigger reason the  Pacers are 13-5 and lead the NBA's Central Division.  </P> <P> Smits scored 13 of his 30 points in a 25-9 first quarter of a 102-78 victory  over the New Jersey Nets in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday night. He finished  with 15 rebounds and was 10 for 10 from the free-throw line to pace the Pacers,  who were 21 for 21.  </P> <P> The Pacers made Smits, who played at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the  No. 2 pick in the 1988 draft.  </P> <P> "Rik is developing into one of the best centers in the league," teammate Reggie  Miller said.  </P> <P> San Antonio 104, Houston 100 -- Willie Anderson scored seven of his 19 points  in an 11-2 Spurs' spurt in the closing minutes at Houston.  </P> <P> The victory gave the Spurs a 13-6 record and a tie with Utah for first place in  the Midwest Division.  </P> <P> Washington 105, Charlotte 101 -- Mark Alarie sank an 18-footer with 15 seconds  left to break a 101-101 tie, and the Hornets lost their ninth in a row.  </P> <P> Armon Gilliam, obtained in a trade with Phoenix Kurt Rambis, played 18 minutes  in his Hornet debut and had nine points.  </P> <P> Chicago 124, Orlando 113 -- Michael Jordan scored 26 of his 38 points in the  first half at Chicago as the Bulls cruised to victory.

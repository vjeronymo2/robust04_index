			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Illingworth Morris and Woolcombers push ahead ILLINGWORTH Morris and Woolcombers Group, both part of a textiles empire controlled by Mr Alan Lewis, yesterday reported gains in pre-tax profits and turnover for the year to March 1993. Turnover at Woolcombers, where a planned flotation was abandoned a year ago, rose from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 27.3m. Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 3.05m. At Illingworth Morris, Woolcombers' parent, consolidated pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.39m to Pounds 1.9m on increased turnover of Pounds 57.7m, against Pounds 48.3m in the previous year. An extraordinary item of Pounds 541,000 (Pounds 123,000) represented costs relating to the postponed flotation of Woolcombers. Exceptional items of Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 190,000) partly reflected redundancy and reorganisation costs less profits on disposal of surplus properties. 'Cost reduction measures were implemented during the year and a major amount of reorganisation was undertaken so as to place the group in a stronger position,' said Mr Lewis. Illingworth Morris was taken private by Mr Lewis in 1989, five years after he won control from the widow of actor James Mason after a long series of court battles.</p>

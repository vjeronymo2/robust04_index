			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Chanel's secret classics CHANEL No. 5 is possibly the world's most famous perfume and Cristalle and Coco also have their fans but what few know is that there is a clutch of Chanel perfumes that are more exclusive still - Gardenia, Cuir de Russie, Bois des Iles and No. 22. All four were originally created in the 1920s in the heyday of Coco Chanel at roughly the same time as the ineffable Chanel No. 5 and by the same parfumier, Ernest Beaux. While Chanel No. 5 caught the imagination of the sophisticated world, the other four found smaller audiences in the Chanel boutiques in London and Paris where devotees buy them to this day. Those who wear them know that they are members of an exclusive little club for so few know of these perfumes' existence. For those looking for a perfume that stood the test of time but still has an aura of recherche glamour, go to the Chanel Boutiques (which are the only places to sell them) and ask to sniff the perfumes. Some like the sweetness of Gardenia, others the spiciness of Cuir de Russie, the exotic floral notes of No. 22 or the rich boskiness of Bois des Iles but whichever is the one for you, rest assured you will not be smelling it everywhere. 200 ml bottles of Eau de Toilette sell at Pounds 59 each, 14 ml and 28 ml of the parfum at Pounds 69 and Pounds 113. A splendid present would be the set of three crystal bottles of 7.5.ml of parfum of Gardenia, Cuir de Russie and Bois des Iles for Pounds 165.</p>

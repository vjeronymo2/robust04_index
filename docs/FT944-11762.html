			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Not yet Major's last post Take no notice of all the headlines about the humiliation of Mr Michael Heseltine. Yes, the trade secretary has lost a battle over Post Office privatisation, but that is not the significant defeat. The authority of the government, already questioned, lies in ruins. It is now obvious that Mr John Major is not in charge. His administration does not know where it is going. The prime minister lives by the mercy of whatever may be ordained by any two or three taxi-fuls of rebel members of his party. His government is steered by the winds, buffeted by fate, kicked around by ad hoc gangs of second-raters who oppose it from within. It has proved unable to put a simple Post Office privatisation bill in the speech due to be delivered by the Queen when she reopens Parliament on November 16. If Mr Major recovers his nerve, he might introduce such a measure anyway, perhaps early next year. The odds are that he will not. It is a sorry sight. Mr Major showed courage during the debate on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty, when he faced down Conservative rebels and challenged them to topple the government. He might have tried the same tactic this time. The chances are that it would have worked. He has, instead, shied at the fence. His government's apparent inability to sell the postal service confirms the difficulty of promoting radical or unpopular legislation when your parliamentary majority is low and falling. It is an indication of weak leadership. Will we now refer to 'Mr Major's lame duck administration'? Probably. That said, a kinder construction may be put upon yesterday's events. The prime minister may have reasoned that a halt to PO privatisation would be popular with the voters, and therefore helpful to the Tories. As Mr Kenneth Clarke acknowledges, high water charges in some areas have turned opinion against sell-offs. The chancellor has also observed that the excessive salaries some greedy water company directors have paid themselves have given privatisation a bad name. At the recent Conservative party conference Mr Major wisely avoided the temptation to lean further to the right. True, restless free marketeers in his party will not cease their twittering until the government has minimalised itself out of existence, but the wider electorate thinks differently. The prime minister appears to have chosen to fight the next election as a centrist. Anything else would be politically stupid; as it happens he could yet win another term, even as a lame duck. I am not alone in thinking this. If you peer through the eyes of Mr Tony Blair the present condition of British politics is simply stated. The leader of the opposition is far from complacent about Labour's chances in 1996 or 1997. He is nature's worrier, aware that in spite of everything it would be premature to wave goodbye to Mr Major. The prime minister has been through a difficult fortnight, during which he has not always seemed in control of events. His handling of the succession of disclosures of alleged corruption among his ministers has not won him high praise. That may have damaged the government, but it will not win an election for the opposition. Mr Blair believes that most voters dislike the Conservatives and want a change, but he also knows that they are not yet convinced that the people's party would improve the quality of their lives. The Conservatives harbour two schemes for winning votes. First, when election day is near the prime minister will wave the Union Jack, challenging the opposition parties on both Europe and constitutional change. Second, the chancellor might cut income tax in November 1995, in time for an April 1996 election. If not then, taxes will almost certainly be reduced in November 1996, ready for a tax-auction campaign the following April. To make assurance doubly sure, Mr Clarke might reduce taxes in both Novembers. This will be a strong temptation if Mr Major is obliged by fear of defeat to hang on until the last possible date in 1997. A similar double whammy - the flag and tax cuts - worked in April 1992. It is not axiomatic that it will fail next time. Mr Blair understands this. He is trying to change voter perceptions as a form of immunisation against future Tory tax reductions. His concern is with 'shifting the fundamentals'. This means speaking out boldly to change Labour thinking at every turn, and trying, through speeches and voter education programmes, to prepare the electorate to resist eve-of-poll Budget bribes. He has moved Labour towards the centrist, or Conservative, position on interest rate rises, Ulster and education. He proposes to remove the socialist Clause 4 from labour's constitution, and has put his chosen moderniser in as party general secretary. The recent report of the social justice commission contains useful arguments in favour of taxing child benefit and means-testing state pensions. You and I may mutter that that is all very well, but there are still very few specific policy commitments. Mr Blair talks about laying foundations, putting building blocks in place, preparing the ground, thinking matters through seriously, pointing the compass in the right direction. He accepts that we now expect Labour to deliver specific, costed, proposals. Yet we will have to wait. Certain 'flagship' policies may emerge at next October's party conference. As to tax, the Labour leader argues that you cannot get close to the truth about the best economic policy until very near polling day, since everything depends on the economic circumstances that prevail at that time. So he intends to maintain maximum flexibility. In the short few months he has been leader, Mr Blair has worked hard to appear relaxed. Everything he says and does is aimed at victory. For example, he does not expect to win parliamentary jousts with Mr Major at question time; leaders of the opposition rarely beat prime ministers. He has chosen, instead, to maintain the right tone, the reasonable demeanour, suitable for take-outs on the evening TV news. He attempts this even when the prime minister blusters and rages. So far he has been fortunate. He has managed to come across as a leader in control - of himself, his colleagues and his party. With the best will in the world, the same cannot be said of Mr Major.</p>

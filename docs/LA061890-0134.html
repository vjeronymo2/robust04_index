			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT OUTGUNNED YET;  </P> <P> A TALK WITH THE SENATOR WHO WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN  </P> <P> Campaigning for reelection two years ago, U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini fired an  M-16 assault rifle for the first time. He liked it.  </P> <P> And if his public duties didn't saddle him with mind-numbing three-day trips to  Estonia and other time-crunchers, DeConcini says he would once more go hunting  deer and javelina, a type of wild pig.  </P> <P> In other words, the 53-year-old Democrat from Tucson seems to fit right in to  the Arizona landscape, just the way Wyatt Earp once did.  </P> <P> But for some of his constituents and former supporters, DeConcini has strayed  "off the reservation," as one opponent put it. For them, he is a renegade, a  betrayer of traditions and rights that stretch even further back than the  gun-slinging days of the Wild West. By proposing a ban on 14 military-style  semiautomatic firearms -- like the one used in last year's Stockton school  massacre -- they believe DeConcini, a conservative in a conservative state,  joined a dangerous cabal of liberals bent on restricting the right to bear  arms.  </P> <P> In retaliation, NRA members picketed DeConcini's Phoenix office. Others made  "nasty" phone calls and "some threats," the senator says. A few mounted a  petition drive to recall DeConcini. It failed, falling more than 100,000  signatures short of the number needed to force a recall election.  </P> <P> That's not the only flank the low-key politician must worry about. The former  prosecutor and son of an Arizona state Supreme Court judge is one of the  "Keating Five," the group of senators under investigation by the Senate Ethics  Committee for allegedly interfering with federal regulators on behalf of the  failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. As a result, in one state poll  DeConcini's dissatisfaction rating rose from 29% to 41% in a three-month  period. He has vehemently maintained that he did no wrong in the Keating  affair, one of several ethical scandals that have swept through Congress  recently.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that the Keating affair has been a serious political blow,  DeConcini portrays the vote on his gun ban as an example of the Senate standing  up to a special-interest group.  </P> <P> "There's no stronger special interest than the NRA and here were guys who said  no," he declares. "They took money from them, they'd been lobbied and they said  no."  </P> <P> After a $190,000 media campaign late last year and other damage-control  tactics, DeConcini, an independently wealthy lawyer with extensive real estate  holdings, may be bouncing back. An April poll showed that his ratings had  "stabilized and started to move up" with a majority of voters giving DeConcini  an excellent to fair rating, says aide Michael Crusa.  </P> <P> His biggest advantage, however, may simply be time. DeConcini doesn't have to  run for reelection until 1994 and he says he won't decide whether to make the  race for at least another year.  </P> <P> But Earl de Berge, research director of the Phoenix polling organization that  took both the January and April surveys, notes that political circles in the  state already are buzzing with talk of possible challengers to DeConcini in  1994. These rumblings are likely to remain muffled for a while. "I think  everyone is waiting to see what the ethics committee does," he explains.  </P> <P> De Berge also notes that the state's other senator, Republican John McCain, has  also been enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal, perhaps making both  politicians vulnerable.  </P> <P> Even with the latest improvement, DeConcini's numbers are "not a pretty  picture" because of his still-high negative rating of 24%, de Berge says. Yet  in a "routine" election, DeConcini probably would still be electable, despite  the Keating affair, de Berge adds.  </P> <P> DeConcini's assault-rifle ban, first proposed last year, passed the Senate late  last month, albeit by one vote, 50-49.  </P> <P> Although the future of DeConcini's measure -- part of a larger anti-crime bill  that has been held up by parliamentary maneuvering -- is uncertain, the victory  remains a moment to savor.  </P> <P> "I've been there for almost 14 years and (the NRA has) never been rolled once  on the floor (of the Senate)," he says. "That's the first time they've ever  been beaten on the floor."  </P> <P> But for the National Rifle Assn., the once unbeatable pro-gun lobby, it was a  sort of Custer's Last Stand, perhaps the most stunning in a series of recent  defeats on both state and federal levels, including an assault rifle ban in  California. Moreover, the NRA had once named DeConcini its legislator of the  month for his unswerving support of the gun lobby. It also had endorsed him in  his election bids and given him campaign money.  </P> <P> Obviously, something happened. But what? Was it a total political  transformation, as the headlines might suggest? Or was it a case of a  politician who ultimately discovered he couldn't have it both ways -- and opted  for the risky road anyway?  </P> <P> Reliving his unexpected victory the other day, DeConcini plumped firmly for the  latter, portraying himself as a man who broke reluctantly with former  supporters and with his own long-held principles to advocate a limited gun ban.  </P> <P> Before he introduced Senate Bill 747 he had been "with the NRA on every damn  issue they've ever had," he says.  </P> <P> The senator is slouched in a chair of his resort hotel room, speaking  dispassionately about an issue that has added to his already ample political  troubles. This morning DeConcini seems utterly unflappable. That may have  something to do with the fact that he and his wife Susan are celebrating the  birth of their first grandchild. Later in the day, the DeConcinis plan to see  the baby for the first time. When the senator mentions the savings and loan  scandal or his new enemies in the gun lobby, he often chuckles and shakes his  head as if bemused by the tortuous paths of politics.  </P> <P> "I didn't just wake up one morning and say, 'Oh, I think I'll do something to  tick off the NRA,' " he says. "I thought about it very clearly and I knew what  I was getting into."  </P> <P> While polls have found that 64% of Arizonans support his gun ban, DeConcini  suspects that the long-term political fallout may hurt him. "I know the gun  lobbyists and I know the NRA members here," he explains. "They are single-issue  people. They're active and they're not going to forget about this, whereas the  people who like what I did are going to forget about it."  </P> <P> This sentiment is echoed by NRA lobbyist David Conover who notes that the  50,000 association members in Arizona "are active and relatively hard-line" in  their opposition to nearly all gun controls. "It's a tough state to be in favor  of gun regulation," Conover says. While the NRA may work with DeConcini in the  future, the group is unlikely to ever support him for reelection or turn to him  for help, the lobbyist says. "All those things are going to be different now."  </P> <P> Many in the NRA "feel I've betrayed them," DeConcini concedes, even though he  maintains that his measure was a compromise, conceived partly as an alternative  to harsher restrictive measures by more liberal senators.  </P> <P> In fact, DeConcini says he sought to avoid a full-blown split with the NRA,  negotiating with the group's lobbyists to find common ground on the issue.  </P> <P> Shortly after the Stockton school killings last year, in which drifter James  Purdy -- armed with an AK-47 assault rifle -- killed five children and wounded  29 others and a teacher, DeConcini recalls that the NRA came to him for help in  fighting back calls for a national assault rifle ban.  </P> <P> "I think they were talking to all the members they had who were pro-NRA or pro  the Second Amendment position," he says, referring to the Bill of Rights  provision regarding firearms. DeConcini says he rebuffed the approach,  stressing that his views were shaped by the extensive use of assault weapons by  drug dealers.  </P> <P> In the mid-1970s DeConcini, then Pima County prosecutor, was tapped to lead a  statewide law enforcement drive against drugs, the beginning of his public  affiliation with anti-drug efforts. In the early '80s, he was under 24-hour  guard for a time because of a death threat he received after he "fingered" a  Bolivian government minister who was mixed up in the drug trade. In the Senate  he has introduced a number of bills to turn up the heat on drug dealers and has  chaired the Senate Drug Enforcement Caucus. DeConcini also was asked by  President Bush to become the country's first "drug czar."  </P> <P> From this perspective, DeConcini says he gradually came to believe that assault  weapons in the hands of drug dealers were too dangerous to remain on the  market.  </P> <P> "Those were the things that weighed on my mind to say I think it's time that we  try something, notwithstanding my own philosophy toward non-restriction of guns  and knowing who I was taking on," he says.  </P> <P> In the best of all possible worlds, he believes that "any gun restriction  should be at the state level or local level."  </P> <P> Expanding on this credo, DeConcini suddenly begins to sound like a true son of  the West. He does not want "a bureaucracy like the FBI or the Treasury  Department, non-elected people, being able to determine whether you have the  right to have a gun," he says emphatically. "And that includes semiautomatic  rifles because I think that this is an invitation for someone to see your name  there and say, 'Oh I know (him). I remember that son of a gun. Well, I'm going  to go check his financial background.' "  </P> <P> Indeed, DeConcini says he revised his gun-ban measure because the NRA objected  to a provision that called for registration of semiautomatic versions of  military rifles with the Treasury Department. He also limited the ban to three  years because the NRA argued against a flat ban, the senator says.  </P> <P> Eventually, however, his patience and desire to keep fences mended wore out  like an old pair of boots. "I got to the point where I got a little frustrated  with them because they didn't want to negotiate at all," he says. "All they  wanted was to chop it away."  </P> <P> His last meetings with gun owners were as acrid as powder smoke.  </P> <P> "I finally got upset and then some of them threatened me with a recall in one  of the last meetings I had with them here," he recalls. "I said, 'Hey, I can't  deal with you if that's how you're going to deal . . . I'm not here to deal  under intimidation . . . You're beating up on me and threatening recall and I  don't appreciate it."  </P> <P> DeConcini still is miffed by the NRA's tactics early on in the battle against  his gun ban, although the national group did not officially back the recall  attempt. He was particularly incensed by the "blatant lie" that his bill would  ban "your standard 12-gauge shotgun." Eventually, the NRA backed off, agreeing  to "stop sending mail into your state condemning you by name," he says.  </P> <P> In this rancorous atmosphere, DeConcini was uncertain that his measure stood  even the whiff of a chance when it came up for the May 23 vote. But he was  convinced that he was closer than his opponents would ever guess.  </P> <P> He credits the last-minute support of Republican John Warner of Virginia and  Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for the bill's passage.  </P> <P> And his account of Warner's and Bentsen's votes throws light on politics  between senators:  </P> <P> "I had no necessary clout with Warner. I know him well and know he likes me,  but I couldn't go to him and say, 'You know, John, what can I do to help your  campaign or something' and say, 'Gee, will you help me?' . . . Bentsen is  another one. . . . Here he is, chairman of the finance committee . . . I don't  have anything that he wants necessarily. We're good friends. We socialize. . .  . He knew I wanted the bill but I couldn't say, 'I really need this. After all,  I've done this for you.' There was nothing there. And he just walked in on his  own, came up to me and said to me, 'You know you're damn right. You've got a  lot of guts and I really admire what you're doing and I'm going to vote with  you.' "  </P> <P> Observers of DeConcini's career are well aware that the gun bill is not the  first time the senator has shown a capacity for surprising behavior. Three  years ago, he cast a key vote against the nomination of Robert Bork to the  Supreme Court, a stand that irked those who saw support of Bork as a litmus  test of true allegiance to conservatism. In his first term, DeConcini backed  the Panama Canal Treaty, anathema to many conservatives, after gaining  concessions from the Carter Administration.  </P> <P> DeConcini says he has grown used to being depicted "as a cautious, careful guy  that often stays on the fence until the last minute and then, when I do  something like Bork or the Panama Canal or (the gun control bill), they say,  'Oh my God, what's he doing?' "  </P> <P> Such reactions, he says, stem from a misreading of his character. "My way of  operating is I don't make quick decisions," he explains. "I try to get the  information and, sure, I'm subject to political pressure, but I try to think it  out and get a lot of information before I make a decision."  </P> <P> Despite his current problems, DeConcini says he continues to like being in the  Senate. But he quickly adds, "I've got an ego and satisfaction that I want out  of it. But I don't have to have it. I never had to have it financially. I do it  because I was raised that way -- do it out of a sense of wanting to  participate. I'm as political probably as anybody but I don't make my decisions  based on what am I going to be elected next time?"  </P> <P> He also says passage of the gun bill should muffle critics who argue he has  lost clout in the Senate because of the savings and loan controversy.  </P> <P> But later, when asked, DeConcini returns almost eagerly to the potential  pleasures awaiting him outside politics.  </P> <P> "I've got a lot of options," he says. "I'm a native son here. My family's been  in the real estate business a long time. I own real estate, I like developing  real estate. I like practicing law. . . . So, I've got a lot to do. And, you  know, I think about that. I think about it with great joy sometimes.  </P> <P> "I'd like to be in La Jolla now. I have a home in La Jolla and I used to have a  boat and probably when I -- not retire -- but when I get out of public life,  I'll spend some time in La Jolla and maybe buy a boat."  </P> <P> Is he at peace with himself?  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, that's one thing I am," he replies. He adds that his personal code  helps him maintain inner calm: "Do what you think is right and be honest with  yourself and your God and your family and things will be OK, even in tough  times when the ethics committee is looking at you."  </P> <P> Then he laughs quietly.  </P></p>

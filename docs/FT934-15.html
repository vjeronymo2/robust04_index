			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI and Zeneca firm This year's headline demerger ended 1993 on a positive note with ICI rising against the market to close 11 up at 802p and Zeneca lifting 8 to 842p. US buyers had pushed ICI higher in New York on Wednesday night after they bought the shares in the form of American Depositary Receipts - ICI ADRs in New York were up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 47 1/2 before Wall Street opened yesterday. The rise squeezed the London stock higher. Analysts said the shares also benefited from the deal announced by Shell and Montedison for a merger of their polyolefins interests deal due to 'hopes for further consolidation in the chemicals industry'. However dealers attributed much of the strength in the two stocks two heavy buying from Swiss Bank Corporation which was involved in the expiry of a very large tailor made option, said to cover 30 leading stocks. One senior marketmaker said 'Swiss Bank had the ball and they wouldn't let anyone else play with it.' High street retailers were broadly lower as institutions moved in to lock in some of the big profits in the sector.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Clinton cautious over progress on trade at summit: President doubts G7 meeting will stop economic friction between Japan and US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has only modest hopes that next week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations can achieve a critical breakthrough in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks. He also doubts that an agreement with Japan on bilateral frictions can be reached in Tokyo, largely because of current Japanese political uncertainty. But he said the Japanese people should view their political transition with 'excitement and interest' and as a positive development. His comments came in an Oval Office interview with journalists from the G7 nations, of which the Financial Times was the UK newspaper representative. It is believed to be the first session Mr Clinton has held exclusively with foreign correspondents since taking office in January. In general, he was bullish about the prospects for the summit. He predicted 'serious discussions' on co-ordinating macro-economic policies, trade and exploring new ways of attacking structural economic difficulties, particularly unemployment. He suggested this last category would be explored fully at a summit 'for perhaps the first time'. He hoped for 'genuine progress' on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But he fell short of predicting summit agreement, preferring instead to talk of 'increasing the chances that we will successfully conclude Gatt by the end of this year'. Anticipating that Tokyo might confine itself only to a general exhortation, he said the words in the communique should be seen as far less important than the 'tone, atmosphere and ideas' discussed in the Japanese capital. He was sure the G7 process served a purpose. 'Our job is to lead. I know it is difficult to lead when you have troubles yourselves, and all of us have economic troubles. All of us to a greater and lesser extent also have political conflict within our countries.' But if the G7 played to its strengths - he cited its innovative workforces, technological competence and understanding of how economies worked - and if co-ordinated policies were put in place, 'I think G7 meetings can really make a difference'. Administration officials have ducked questions about any failure to make a final push towards a Uruguay Round agreement. But, in a briefing this week, one senior official hinted that the US might be prepared to accept, as an interim measure, a more limited pact on market access measures. On Japan, Mr Clinton was insistent on 'some realignment in our trade relations - and I think we're going to work that out'. But he stressed 'the lots of other things we have in common', on both the economic and security policy fronts. Mr Clinton emphasised examples of US economic leadership and rejected suggestions that there were doubts about the US will to lead. His Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) five-year budget deficit reduction plan, now facing a final test in Congress, constituted the sort of action that other summit nations had been demanding of the US for years. He was proud of the initiative to develop a substantial assistance package for Russia, discussion of which is also on the Tokyo agenda. 'The commitment to do more for Russia will be clear, substantial and generous because of all the problems all of our countries have at home,' he said. 'I am expecting a very successful summit, particularly concerning Russia.' But he said, with a tacit nod to poor US unemployment figures released yesterday, that there was only so much the US could do to improve its own economy. Job creation in the US, two-thirds of which has stemmed recently from exports, was dependent on recoveries in Japan and Europe. He also declined to criticise the Bundesbank for being dilatory in cutting German interest rates, saying that independent central banks should be free of external criticism. The health of the German economy, he said, was 'vital for all Americans'. The latest French complaints about US anti-dumping rulings on steel imports failed to recognise that US laws were consistent with Gatt rules, he said. But if France wanted to propose stronger trade enforcement mechanisms he was always ready to consider them. On non-economic issues, he said disagreement with Europe over Bosnia was 'the only point of contention between us'.

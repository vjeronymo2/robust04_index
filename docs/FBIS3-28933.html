			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States have decided to hold the joint military exercise  "Team Spirit" this year if the North Korean nuclear issue is not  resolved, South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Friday.    Han said the two countries have also agreed to make a final  decision on the deployment by U.S. Forces in Korea of Patriot  missiles after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  discusses the issue at its Board of Governors' meeting Feb. 21.    Han made the statement at a press conference after meeting  with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense  Secretary William Perry earlier Friday.    Pyongyang and the IAEA are deadlocked over IAEA inspection  of  North Korean nuclear facilities. Unless some progress is made  before the IAEA Board of Governors meets, the United States and  its allies will refer the question to the U.N. Security Council  for possible economic sanctions against North Korea.    "The deployment of Patriot missiles is still in the stage of  discussion," Han told reporters. He and Perry have agreed to  make a final decision after the IAEA Board of Governors'  meeting, Han added.    As a result of his talks with U.S. Government leaders, Han  said he was able to confirm that "there is no change in the  basic approach of South Korea and the United States to the North  Korean nuclear question.    "There is nearly complete agreement on countermeasures  between the two governments," Han said.    Han's remarks were received as an indication that Seoul and  Washington have agreed to pursue a peaceful solution to the  problem until the issue is referred to the U.N. Security  Council, if the IAEA Board of Governors judges that the  continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been broken.    "I have agreed with Secretary Christopher that it is  desirable to exchange opinions and adjust positions among the  IAEA Board of Governors," Han said.    "South Korea and the United States have decided to hold  close  consultations before and after the IAEA Board of Governors'  meeting and at every stage," Han added.    The international community will do its utmost to help  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and will respect and  cooperate with any decision made by the IAEA and the Security  Council, Han said.    China has played a "very constructive" role, Han said,  adding  that he expects Beijing will continue to make a positive  contribution in practical ways.    In regard to Team Spirit, Han said South Korea and the  United  States will plan for and hold the exercise unless progress is  made on the North Korean nuclear problem.    The content of President Kim Yong-sam's personal letter to  U.S. President Bill Clinton was not disclosed, but it was said  to favor persuading North Korea to resolve the nuclear question  through dialogue.    If all efforts failed, South Korea would go along with any  decisions by the international community, Kim was understood to  have told Clinton.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REJECTION OF LOAN ENDS IN DEATH, SHOOTING OF WOMAN  </P> <P> A Bellflower man, irate that a plea for a loan was rejected by his half-sister  and her husband, fatally wounded the husband at the couple's store in Artesia  Saturday and then chased down his half-sister a short distance away, critically  wounding her, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The man, identified as Sun Ki Baik, 33, fled in a 1977 Oldsmobile, prompting  deputies to issue an all-points bulletin for his capture, said sheriff's  spokesman Dean Scoville.  </P> <P> The dead man was identified as Kwang Kim, 49, of Cypress. His wife, Myong Kim,  43, was rushed to Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach where she was listed  Saturday night in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the face and chest.  </P> <P> Scoville said Baik went to the Cerritos New Market in the 19100 block of South  Norwalk Boulevard Saturday afternoon to ask his half-sister and her husband for  an unspecified amount of money. "It wasn't a unique request," Scoville said.  "He had asked for money before from them."  </P> <P> The couple, however, turned down the request, apparently enraging Baik,  Scoville said.  </P> <P> Investigators said Baik pulled out a small-caliber handgun and fired, fatally  wounding Kwang Kim in the face.  </P> <P> His wife ran from the store, but was cornered by her half-brother near a home  on 191st Street, a few doors away. There, Baik allegedly shot his half-sister  twice, Scoville said.  </P> <P> He then fled in a car with a California license of 470 SXJ, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Scoville said anyone with additional information about the shooting should call  sheriff's detectives.  </P></p>

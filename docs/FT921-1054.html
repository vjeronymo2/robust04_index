			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: JLI calls for Pounds 13m to finance acquisitions JLI Group, the prepared vegetables, dried fruit, nut and popcorn group, is raising Pounds 13m net of expenses through a 1-for-2 rights issue at 98p a share. The money raised is to finance acquisitions. The shares fell 8p to 115p on the news. The group's previous rights issue, launched last July, was also a 1-for-2 but at 87p and raised Pounds 7.7m. JLI forecast a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 3.1m for the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 2.3m in 1990-91. It promised a final dividend of 3p, to which the new shares will be entitled, to give a total of 4.5p (4.3p). Analysts expect earnings per share to be about 9.3p against 8.5p reported last time. The group is buying Golden Twin, an own label nut processor and packer, for Pounds 2.1m and taking on Pounds 1.5m of debt. It is in advanced negotiations with two other companies and the cost of the three deals, including borrowings taken on, will amount to about Pounds 12m. In April JLI also has to make a Pounds 2m final payment for Playtime Foods, a nut and popcorn business, acquired last July. Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said that the aim of the rights issue was to keep year-end gearing at about 25 per cent, and allow the group to finance seasonal debt peaks. He said that the issue would not cause dilution in 1992-93 even without any economic recovery because of savings which could be made from combining production. He added that Mr John Alexander, non-executive chairman, who is 69, would not take up the rights on his 1.1m shares but the other board members would.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.1 For gas dilution systems utilizing mass flow controllers, the mass flow controllers in the gas dilution system shall be calibrated against a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable standard according to the manufacturer's instructions once per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.1.2 For gas dilution systems using mass flow controllers, the accuracy of the controllers diminishes at low flow rates. Therefore, it is recommended that flow rates below 10 percent of flow controller capacity be avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2 High-Level Supply Gas. An EPA Protocol calibration gas is recommended, due to its accuracy, as the high-level supply gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.3 Mid-Level Supply Gas. An EPA Protocol gas shall be used as an independent check of the dilution system. The concentration of the mid-level supply gas shall be within 10 percent of one of the dilution levels tested in Section 3.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Performance Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.1 Laboratory Evaluation (Optional). If the gas dilution system is to be used to formulate calibration gases with reactive compounds (Test Methods 15, 16, and 25A/25B (only if using a calibration gas other than propane during the field test) in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), a laboratory certification must be conducted once per year for each reactive compound to be diluted. In the laboratory, carry out the procedures in Section 3.2 on the analyzer required in each respective test method to be laboratory certified (15, 16, or 25A and 25B for compounds other than propane). For each compound in which the gas dilution system meets the requirements in Section 3.2, the source must provide the laboratory certification data for the field test and in the test report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2 Field Evaluation (Required). The gas dilution system shall be evaluated at the test site with an analyzer or monitor chosen by the source owner or operator. It is recommended that the source owner or operator choose a precalibrated instrument with a high level of precision and accuracy for the purposes of this test. This method is not meant to replace the calibration requirements of test methods. In addition to the requirements in this protocol, all the calibration requirements of the applicable test method must also be met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.1 Prepare the gas dilution system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using the high-level supply gas, prepare, at a minimum, one dilution for each dilution device utilized in the dilution system. Dilution device in this method refers to the mass flow controller, critical orifice, capillary tube, or any other device which is used to achieve gas dilution. For gas dilution systems utilizing mass flow controllers, it is recommended that two dilutions be performed for each mass flow controller range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.2 Calculate the predicted concentration for each of the dilutions based on the flow rates through the gas dilution system (or the dilution ratios) and the certified concentration of the high-level supply gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.3 Introduce each of the dilutions from Section 3.2.1 into the analyzer or monitor one at a time and determine the instrument response for each of the dilutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.4 Repeat the procedure in Section 3.2.3 two times, i.e., until three injections are made at each dilution level. Calculate the average instrument response for each triplicate injection at each dilution level. No single injection shall differ by more than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2 percent from the average instrument response for that dilution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.5 For each level of dilution, calculate the difference between the average concentration output recorded by the analyzer and the predicted concentration calculated in Section 3.2.2. The average concentration output from the analyzer shall be within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2 percent of the predicted value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2.6 Introduce the mid-level supply gas directly into the analyzer, bypassing the gas dilution system. Repeat the procedure twice more, for a total of three mid-level supply gas injections. Calculate the average analyzer output concentration for the mid-level supply gas. The difference between the certified concentration of the mid-level supply gas and the average instrument response shall be within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.3 If the gas dilution system meets the criteria listed in Section 3.2, the gas dilution system may be used throughout that field test. If the gas dilution system fails any of the criteria listed in Section 3.2, and the tester corrects the problem with the gas dilution system, the procedure in Section 3.2 must be repeated in its entirety and all the criteria in Section 3.2 must be met in order for the gas dilution system to be utilized in the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

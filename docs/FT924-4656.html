			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: ABSA boosts interim dividend AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), South Africa's largest banking group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent advance in net earnings to R293.8m (Dollars 97m) for the six months to September, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Earnings per share rose from 45.4 cents to 51.9 cents, and the bank is stepping up its interim dividend from 15.5 cents to 17 cents a share. ABSA was formed in 1991 when United Building Society, the country's largest building society group, acquired the assets of three major banking groups - Allied Group, Volkskas Group and Sage Financial Services. Earlier this year, ABSA acquired Bankorp Holdings (Bankorp), another South African bank, for R1.3bn. Absa said a year-on-year comparison of income was completely comparable as the September 1992 results took into account the contributions of Bankorp. Mr Herc Hefer, chairman, said the group was expected to continue to perform satis-factorily in the current six months, even though no significant economic recovery was anticipated. Group bad debt provisions increased 91 per cent to R420.1m at September. The increase came from the application of provisions for all advances acquired through the Bankorp merger and the prolonged recession, Mr Hefer said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 20 May (AE) -- Former Sao Paulo Governor  Orestes Quercia, presidential candidate of the Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party [PMDB], today met in his campaign  headquarters with two incumbent governors and five former  governors of his party to officially announce that Iris Rezende  will be his running mate on the PMDB ticket. She is the wife of  former Goias Governor Iris Rezende -- both husband and wife have  the same name. The ticket will be approved by the PMDB national  convention to be held in Brasilia on 22 May.    Quercia said he chose Mrs. Iris Rezende because he was  determined from the outset to have a woman as his running mate  as a way of paying tribute to all Brazilian women.</p>

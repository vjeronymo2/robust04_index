			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Sowing seeds of doubt in the taxpayer's mind There was a lot of grumbling about 'red tape' from farmers this year when they were asked to complete the complex forms needed to claim compensation for cuts in EC production subsidies. But one farmer with 2,000 acres in Britain's rich cereal-growing region of East Anglia was determined to look on the bright side. He calculated that the payment he would receive for completing the 10-page document would amount to Pounds 12,500 per page. Out of his total income of Pounds 125,000 from the EC, moreover, he would be paid nearly Pounds 25,000 simply for not growing cereals on part of his land. As the first compensation cheques arrive through the post this month, it will be possible to see exactly how much taxpayers' money goes to supporting each farmer. Under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, arable farmers receive cash in hand to compensate them for a 29 per cent cut in cereal support prices over three years. To be paid, however, they must leave idle, or 'set aside,' 15 per cent of their land. The reform of the CAP was seen as vital to ending the worst excesses of agricultural protectionism. It was designed to pave the way for a Gatt agreement which requires the EC to cut the value and volume of cereal export subsidies by 36 per cent and 21 per cent respectively over six years. But it is by no means certain things will work out that way. To begin with, subsidising farmers for setting their land aside could run foul of tax- payers. Agricultural subsidies to producers alone cost EC consumers and taxpayers Ecu66bn (Pounds 51bn) last year, according to the OECD. Because member states have undertaken to cushion farmers from the cuts in cereal support prices, that overall burden will remain much the same until and unless production falls. However, as support shifts to highly visible payments, so taxpayers will be more likely to question the cost. Set-aside payments are due to rise to about Ecu1.2bn in 1995. The farmers themselves could also jeopardise the scheme. They dislike set-aside because it goes against their instincts for making the land productive. Critics of the scheme say it was hampered from the start by the exemption of small farmers producing less than 92 tonnes of cereals a year on the grounds that they would be unfairly penalised. This measure alone is estimated to reduce the overall set-aside area from 15 per cent of EC arable land to between 9 and 12 per cent. Experience in the US, where set-aside has operated since the 1930s, shows there are also inherent problems which lessen the chances of the scheme controlling output: Farmers put their poorest land into set-aside Yields on the remaining land rise as farmers use more labour, machinery and chemicals to compensate for the lost production Yields increase when land enriched by fallowing comes back into production. To overcome the first of these problems, the European Commission initially required farmers to 'rotate' the area they set aside each year for six years, so that 90 per cent of their arable land was left fallow at some point during the scheme. But it is now proposing, under French pressure, to limit the scheme to three years. Although the required set-aside area would be increased to 20 per cent, only 60 per cent of land would go out of production during the lifetime of the scheme. In other words, the richest land would probably remain untouched. Meanwhile, there are already signs that yields have improved. The EC grain traders' association, Coceral, estimates that average yields are up about 5 per cent compared with last year on a harvest that has fallen only about 3 per cent to some 164m tonnes. Yields tend to increase by about 2 per cent a year because of improvements in seed and fertiliser technology. The extra rise suggests more intense production, although it could be partly due to better weather. Coceral estimates that the land in cereal production has fallen by only 7 per cent, lower even than the Commission's actual target of 8-9 per cent for the first year. The Commission puts a brave face on all this, arguing that the policy will work better as prices fall. Some arable farmers may initially have found it worthwhile to forgo compensation payments in order to sell more crops. It says last year's harvest was poor and the fall from a more normal harvest would have been closer to 8 per cent. Brussels also argues that the problem of more intensive farming on land in production will lessen as declining prices cease to cover the cost of extra inputs. But the policy faces erosion on other fronts. The commission has agreed to allow fixed as well as rotating set-aside from next season provided 20 per cent of the farm is taken out of production. This increases the prospects that only less fertile land will be affected. Set-aside also depends on compliance. 'If the problems the EC has experienced in enforcing its dairy quota - especially in Italy where they simply were never enforced - are any indication, then non-compliance could be a serious problem,' says Mr Michael Herlihy, an economist with the US Department of Agriculture, in a recent paper on US and EC set-aside. Cereal farmers know last year's CAP reforms may not be the end of the matter. Some fear they could face increased set-aside requirements as the winds of free trade begin to blow into the EC's protected market. French farm unions claim more than 30 per cent of land would have to be left idle to meet the requirements of the Blair House farm deal between the US and the EC. The industry has long been regarded as a special case. 'A free trade policy for cereal production is seen as a bridge too far for policy-makers and farmers,' says Mr Michael Murphy, an agricultural economist at Cambridge University, in a recent paper. But as taxpayers begin to see the size of subsidies, especially to the most prosperous of the EC's farmers, the pressure for even more radical change may become unstoppable.</p>

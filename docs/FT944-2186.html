			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / GDP forecasts revised upwards Expectations of UK economic growth have moved up and forecasts of inflation down since Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, unveiled his second Budget last month. The Treasury's latest monthly survey of 38 independent forecasts found average expectations of the growth in gross domestic product are now 3.8 per cent for this year and 3.2 per cent for next year, compared with 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent in November. In his Budget, Mr Clarke forecast growth of 4 per cent this year and 3 1/4 per cent in 1995. Expectations of inflation have moderated since the Budget, although the forecasters surveyed tend to be slightly less sanguine than the Treasury. The forecasters expect underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to be 2.2 per cent in the current quarter and 2.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1995. These expectations compare with November's consensus forecasts of 2.4 per cent for this year's fourth quarter and 3.2 per cent for the end of 1995 and the Budget forecasts of 2 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent. In its survey, the Treasury covers areas such as unemployment which do not feature in its own published forecasts. The independent forecasters expect unemployment to continue falling although forecasts for end-1995 range from 2m to 2.6m. The Treasury is not publishing its interest rate forecasts. But, according to another survey of forecasters, published by research company Consensus Economics, the City's average expectation is for 3 month interbank rates to rise to 6.6 per cent in three months time and to 7.2 per cent by December 1995.</p>

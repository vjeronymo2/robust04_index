			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Dealers Advised to Boost Chevrolet Orders: The Chevrolet division of General  Motors Corp. has warned its dealers in a special bulletin to order more cars or  the company would be forced to idle assembly plants in January, a weekly trade  publication reported. The bulletin is unprecedented because it discloses  January production rates and how they compare to dealer order banks, said  Automotive News. Chevrolet plans to build nearly 91,000 new cars next month,  while order banks as of late November stood at just 24,130 units, the letter  said.  </P></p>

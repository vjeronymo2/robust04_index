			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Banque Indosuez profits hit by property write-down BANQUE Indosuez, the fully owned merchant banking unit of France's Suez group, yesterday announced a 13 per cent fall in net annual profits, hit by a big write-down on an overvalued property purchase. Net profits at the bank, which is mounting a joint bid for Perrier with the Swiss food multinational Nestle, fell to FFr805m (Dollars 144.26m) last year from FFr929m in 1990. This follows the previous year's 10 per cent profits fall. New provisions rose by more than 20 per cent over the same period, from FFr1.29bn to FFr1.55bn, the main element in which was a FFr650m write-down on the NMPP newspaper distribution building in Paris. Banque Indosuez bought the building for FFr2.7bn in 1990, one of the city's largest ever property deals, in the so-called 'golden triangle,' a fashionable area near the stock exchange. The purchase took place just before the central Paris market started to weaken. The bank wrote down FFr100m for the building in last year's accounts and says this completes the NMPP provisions. More than half of the property, now being renovated, has attracted purchase promises from French and foreign investors. Within the overall provisions, FFr904m related to doubtful loans, down 24 per cent from the FFr1.19bn provided against loans in the previous year. This was due to the quality of the bank's commercial and industrial loan portfolio, said Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman. Operating profits were up 58 per cent to FFr1.37bn from FFr872m on a rise in net banking by 17 per cent over the same period, to FFr10.93bn from FFr9.32bn. 'Having produced strong growth in operating profits in 1991, Banque Indosuez has piled up heavily its risk provisions,' said Mr Jeancourt-Galignani. He said it was remarkable that growth was spread across all the bank's activities and geographical regions, except its Tokyo broking business, which lost money.</p>

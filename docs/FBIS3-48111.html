The nature-remaking project is to reclaim 1,000 hectares of  land by building a dam linking Sikyo-ri, Chongsu Islet and  Tungam-ri in Kangyong County, South Hwanghae Province.    The project has increased the area of cultivated land and  changed the coastline and looks of the country.    The builders of the South Hwanghae Provincial Chongdan  General Tideland Reclamation Enterprise who were in charge of  the project had overfulfilled the daily plan by more than 70  percent on an average in the whole period of the project by  boosting the utility rate of transport means and actively  introducing new construction methods.</p>

While the grand struggle has been carried out, the  blood ties between the great leader [yongdoja] and our people  has become all the more cemented as an invincible one which none  can break.    At a time when the single-hearted unity of the leader  [suryong], the party, and the people is being tightened beyond  measure and the socialism of our own style is triumphantly  marching ahead, we meaningfully mark the birthday of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great leader [yongdoja] of our  party and our people and the supreme commander of our  revolutionary forces.    The revolutionary holiday of February is the greatest  holiday  for our nation in which the glorious chuche lineage has been  firmly inherited, and the firm guarantee has been prepared to  ensure the endless prosperity for the fatherland and the  happiness for all the generations to come.    Observing the historic day, all the party members and  working  people are gripped by boundless reverence for the great leader  [yongdoja] and are recalling with great pride the proud history  of having marched ahead under the leadership of the party and  the leader [suryong].    The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's  revolutionary activities is the most glorious history of the  great revolutionary and the great leader [yongdoja] who has  devoted his all for the noble cause for the fatherland, the  people, and the revolution.    Embarking on the road of the revolution with the firm will  to  succeed to and consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary  cause pioneered by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim  il-song in the early days, the dear comrade leader has led our  people's struggle for the socialist construction and the  fatherland reunification into the ever-victorious road, standing  at the fore of our party, the people, and the revolutionary  forces.    Today, the era of the Workers' Party of Korea has met the  golden age, and the status and dignity of our party and the  fatherland has reached its zenith. Upholding the great leader  [yongdoja], who has created the most glorious history of  struggle for the revolution and the people, comes as the honor  for Korea and the greatest pride of our times.    Recalling our party's history of struggle adorned with  inflamed events and feats, we feel the greatest pride because  the single- hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary  ranks uniting around the great leader [yongdoja] has been firmly  achieved.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: Our single-  hearted unity is the most firm revolutionary unity and  invincible unity with limitless power in which we are firmly  united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and fidelity  based on one center and one ideology.    Unity is power and a fundamental source of triumph in the  revolution. At a time when the generation of the revolution has  been changed and is carrying out its tasks to inherit and  complete the socialist cause, the question on how to unite  around the leader [yongdoja] is a vital question connected with  the destiny of the revolution.    The single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary  ranks has a long history and tradition. The tradition of our  unity rallying around the leader [yongdoja], which was created  amid the stern flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, has been  brilliantly inherited along with the advancement of the  revolutionary cause.    Today, in our country, the single-hearted unity of all the  party members and all the people centering on the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il has been firmly achieved. As the result,  the problem in inheriting the tradition of unity has been  brilliantly solved.    Never has there been a time like today in which all the  party  members, working people, and officers and men of the People's  Army, with absolute loyalty for the leader [yongdoja], are  firmly united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and  fidelity. The achievement of the great single-hearted unity is  the most biggest triumph for our revolution.    The might of our single-hearted unity rallied around the  dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been clearly proved in our  arduous practical revolution.    The single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the  most powerful weapon that enables them to brilliantly carry out  any difficult and massive task in revolution and construction  and vigorously accelerate the general onward march of socialism  of our own style. The history of our socialist construction is  decorated with proud courses in cultivating roads and creating  miracles with the might of unity.    Upon inheriting the long tradition of struggle, our people  were able to create the speeds of march admired by the people of  the world and to run like the wind in the seventies, eighties,  and nineties because they waged struggles after strongly uniting  around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Everything that casts its ray on the fatherland -- the  strong  foundation for a self-reliant national economy, the powerful  national defense capability, and the great monumental edifices  erected everywhere -- is the brilliant fruition of the might of  single-hearted unity. If it had not been for the weapon of  single-hearted unity, we would not have been able to endlessly  develop our economy during the period of the Third Seven-Year  Plan, when the situation at home and abroad was difficult. And,  if it were not for the might of single-hearted unity, all of us  would not be able to march to highly display the superiority of  socialism of our own style as boldly as we are doing today.    Our single-hearted unity is a source of invincible might  that  enables us to defeat any antirevolutionary offensive of the  imperialists and strongly defend achievements in reunification.    For the past few years, imperialists and reactionaries of  all  sorts have maneuvered more viciously than ever to isolate and  stifle [korip chilsik] socialism of our own style. However,  they were no match for the might of our people single-heartedly  united around the dear comrade leader. Because there was  single-hearted unity, our party and people could defeat the  enemy's reactionary ideological offensives and crush [kyokpa]  any maneuver by the enemy to politically and militarily threaten  us and bring us under its control [che-ap].    During last year's semi-war period, the entire country, all  the people, and the entire Army, cherishing our supreme  commander's iron will deep in their hearts, rose up unanimously  to launch revolutionary offensives to crush [patan] the enemy's  attempt. This is a graphic example of how powerful the might of  our single-hearted unity is.    Today our party and people are responding to the enemy's  threats, blackmail, and vicious appeasement tactics with a  strong revolutionary stand and fighting with a bold offensive  spirit and indomitable spirit [taedamhan konggyok chongsingwa  pulgurui kijiro]. The source of this might is the invincible  unity of revolutionary ranks. As long as there are iron-willed  revolutionary ranks that rise up unanimously in concert with the  great leader [widaehan yongdojawa hanmaum handdussidoeyo], our  fatherland will cast its ray as an invincible fortress of  socialism.    Today the single-hearted unity of our party and  revolutionary  ranks is unity with the greatest vitality. A fundamental reason  for this is the greatness of the leader [yongdoja].    The solidity of unity depends on how firm the center of such  unity is. Only when one upholds the people's leader [chidoja]  who wins unswerving trust and support from the entire party and  all the people, can there be firm unity that is unshakable in  any storm. The might of our single-hearted unity comes from the  fact that the dear comrade leader's ideas and theories are great  and that those ideas and theories are the ideological basis of  our unity.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and  enriched the great leader's [widaehan suryong] revolutionary  idea, the chuche idea, and provided a powerful ideological and  theoretical asset for the long and arduous revolutionary course  that can defeat the imperialists and complete the socialist  cause to the end.    Today Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories are firm  guiding principles for our party and revolutionary cause and  banners that can achieve complete and unconditional ideological  and theoretical unity in the revolutionary ranks. Because we  have these great ideas, the political and ideological purity  [sungyolsong] of our party and revolutionary ranks is firmly  ensured generation after generation.    Cherishing our party's ideas and theories, which are  associated with the dignified name of the dear comrade leader,  in their hearts as their bone, flesh, and belief, our party  members and workers live and fight according to the requirements  of those ideas and theories today.    No alien [isaekjogin] ideological elements whatsoever can  set foot in our revolutionary ranks, which are firmly armed with  the great leader's [yongdoja] ideology and will. As our party's  ideology and theory is infinite, our single-hearted unity which  regards it as the water of life will never change.    The single-hearted unity of our party and the revolutionary  ranks is becoming an ever-victorious and invincible unity. This  is because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is  great and the authority of his leadership is incomparably high.    The dear comrade leader's leadership art is a  chuche-oriented  leadership art which makes it possible to display the popular  masses' infinite strength to the utmost. It is also an  ever-victorious leadership art that finds a breakthrough in  solving problems in whatever situation and turns an adverse  situation into a favorable one. Through his extraordinary  leadership capabilities, the dear comrade leader brilliantly  fulfilled many difficult and complicated tasks presented in  carrying out the socialist cause of our era. He also achieved  immortal achievements before the era and revolution.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made countless  accomplishments in the revolution and the construction. They  include achievements in strengthening the party, the staff of  the revolution; enhancing our party's leading role in every way;  bringing in fundamental upturn in the construction of the  people's armed forces; and filling the superiority of the  socialism of our own style in every domains of politics,  economy, and culture. For these great achievements, the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being highly praised as a genius  of creation and construction and a great strategist, and has  come to grip the absolute authority over the people.    Our people, through their lifetime experiences shared with  the party, came to cherish deep in their hearts the steadfast  conviction and will that they can surely conquer any fortress of  the socialist construction as long as the dear comrade leader  leads them. Our single-hearted unity is so strong as the entire  society is overflowing with such unshakable faith and will.    The great ethos of single-hearted unity in our society is a  brilliant crystal of politics of benevolence and politics of  love and trust afforded by the dear comrade leader. The dear  comrade leader's warm love for the working people and his  unfaltering trust for the revolutionary fighters are his natural  gifts and basic characters of politics afforded by him.    Our party, with its limitless magnanimity, has taken care of  the people from all walks of life, including the working people,  the peasants, and the intellectuals, by holding them in its  broad bosom and led them to fruitful life and struggle. In  addition, it made all the people who follow the party to proudly  stand for members of the revolutionary ranks.    Our party's politics of great love and trust has given birth  to loyalty and filial duty among our party members and working  people, and made the beautiful communist traits to bloom fully  in our society.    Thanks to the dear comrade leader's great noble traits, our  society has become a big family under which the great father and  the people are connected in blood; a harmonious society where  the people help and pull each other along in accordance with the  communist principle of one for all and all for one; and a united  society in which the great flower garden of the civilian-army  unity is being unfolded.    Because we uphold the dear comrade leader, who is the center  of unity, the great ideological theoretician, the excelled  politician, and the father of the people, our single-hearted  unity will display full its infinite might and vitality in the  future. Before us lie the heavy tasks of brilliantly completing  the chuche-oriented socialist cause by further strengthening the  single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All of the  working people should inherit the tradition of our revolution's  single-hearted unity, and direct big efforts to further  strengthen the single-hearted unity of the party and the  revolutionary ranks uniting around Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Single-hearted unity is an eternal slogan for our people's  struggles and an immortal banner that provides the Korean  revolution with bright prospects. In the course of upholding  the dear comrade leader, we must more brilliantly inherit the  proud tradition of the Korean communist movement in which we  have considered unity to be the most precious and defended it at  the risk of our lives. If we are to strengthen the might of  single-hearted unity by all means, it is more important than  anything else to possess absolute admiration of the leader  [yongdoja] and uphold the leadership of the party and the leader  [suryong] with loyalty.    The most important among the traits of revolutionaries who  boundless treasure unity is to have a firm attitude and position  with which they uphold the leader [yongdoja]. Revolutionary  warriors must single-heartedly uphold their leader [yongdoja]  with loyalty. Warm loyalty with which one follows one's leader  [yongdoja] and considers him to be a person to whom one owes  one's life and who defends one's destiny is a basic trait that  our revolutionaries must possess.    All party members and workers must resolutely walk along a  single road of loyalty, always cherishing deep in their hearts  the notion that it is very fortunate that they have the great  leader of the people [widaehan inminui chidoja], who shoulders  the destinies of the fatherland and people and who leads the  chuche-oriented socialist cause to a single road of  invincibility.    Our people's eternal spiritual pillar and center of belief  [yongwonhan maumui kidung sinnyomui kidung] is the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The more openly the imperialists and reactionaries launch  antirevolutionary offensives and the heavier revolutionary tasks  face us, the more deeply we must cherish the belief that our  socialist cause will win victory without fail as long as the  dear comrade leader leads us. For all party members and workers  to loudly sing the song of loyalty and song of belief entitled  "We Will Win as Long as You Are There" and to meet face to face  with difficulties and archenemies [taejok] is a way to fully  demonstrate the might of our single- hearted unity.    If single-hearted unity is to be strengthened in the party  and revolutionary ranks and functionaries, among other people,  must take the lead to uphold the leadership of the party and the  leader [suryong]. Functionaries are essential people in the  party and revolutionary ranks and the leading officials of the  revolution. Our functionaries are those who must become flag  bearers as well as hands [sonbal] in upholding the party and the  leader [suryong]. All functionaries must thoroughly imbue  themselves with the revolutionary doctrine and prepare  themselves as genuine loyalists who eternally share the same  life and destiny with the party and determined revolutionaries  who strongly defend the revolutionary guardposts, to which the  party assigned them, and boundlessly glorify our party's  revolutionary achievements until they die.    Those who always share the same will with the leader  [yongdoja], who consider the party's policies to be their belief  and devotedly implement them to the end, and who resolutely  struggle to defend our single-hearted unity by all means: They  are genuine revolutionary warriors.    Our functionaries must always compare Comrade Yi In-mo's  party spirit with their own and persistently make efforts to  learn from his spiritual world. To our functionaries who cannot  live even for a moment without the people's trust and love,  nothing is more important than possessing the spirit of  devotedly serving the people. The functionaries must never  forget their role in establishing blood ties between the party  and people, go among the popular masses, and make brisk efforts  to better extend the dear comrade leader's favors to our people.    If our single-hearted unity is to be strengthened by all  means, we must substantially and continuously carry out the work  to unite the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from  all other walks of life around the party.    The solidity of our revolutionary unity is guaranteed by the  ideological solidity of the popular masses who absolutely  support and follow the party and the leader [suryong].    We must further strengthen the indoctrination work to make  the party members and workers accept loyalty to the party and  the leader [suryong] as their faith, conscience, morality, and  daily life and, in particular, the work to propagandize the dear  comrade leader's greatness. In this way, we must make the entire  society the crystallization of loyalty, devotion, and single-  heartedness. In particular, our intellectuals must have a  revolutionary awareness and communist conscience and defend and  uphold the party with knowledge and technology.    All intellectuals must cherish deep in their hearts the  great  honor of being the party's eternal companions, sincere  supporters, and excellent advisers, an honor that the dear  comrade leader has given them. They must also become  forerunners who give the people a belief in sure victory and  must become bugles in the socialist march.    The young people are the inheritors [kyesungja] of the  revolution who must glorify the party's cause, the dear comrade  leader's cause, generation after generation. They are also the  most vigorous group of people in our society. With a firm  resolve to become guns and bombs [chongpoktan] that defend and  protect the party and the leader [suryong], all young people  must live and struggle in a revolutionary manner and must always  rush to difficult guardposts to which the party calls them and  create miracles and feats.    Giving fuller play to the traditional ethos of army-people  harmony is of important significance in solidifying the  wholehearted unity of our society as firm as a rock. Today, the  soldiers of our People's Army have the revolutionary soldier's  spirit of laying down their youth and lives willingly for the  comrade supreme commander and are carrying out their honorable  mission as revolutionary fighters with guns. Because we have  the People's Army which is boundlessly loyal to the iron-willed  brilliant commander General Kim Chong-il, our party is strong,  and the security of our fatherland is firmly ensured.    All party members and working people should always attach  importance to military affairs, love the soldiers of our  People's Army like their real brothers and sisters and real sons  and daughters, and help them wholeheartedly. All the officers  and men of the People's Army should love the people and wage a  struggle devoting everything they have to it to defend the  people's lives and properties.    As long as the army and the people uphold the party's cause  with loyalty in firm unity between them, the wholehearted unity  of our revolutionary ranks will be as strong as a fortress.    Upholding the great leader's New Year's address and the  decision adopted at the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, our people are  vigorously pushing ahead with a new onward movement to fully  display the superiority of socialism of our own style.    We should fully display the might of single-hearted unity in  today's struggle to implement the revolutionary economic  strategy set forth by the party.    All party members and working people should staunchly strive  to carry out our party's grand socialist construction plan by  highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  hard struggle. In doing so, they should adorn this year, the  first year of the adjustment period, with brilliant feats and  triumphs.    Today when some 50 years have passed since the great guiding  star rose from the sacred Mt. Paektu, our revolution has a  bright future. The great leader [yongdoja] stands at the fore;  the invincible party leads us to victory; and single-hearted  unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses is  pressing hard on our revolution's march.    Victory is on our people's side who are firmly united around  the leader [yongdoja] with conviction and fidelity.    Everyone should consolidate the single-hearted unity among  all party members, working people, and officers and men of the  People's Army centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  as firm as a rock, and staunchly fight for the ultimate victory  of the chuche cause.</p>

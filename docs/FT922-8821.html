			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (3): Sea gas will drive new stations - The region will provide power for England in the 21st century DISTINCTIVE new industrial landmarks are springing up on the flat countryside between the Wash and the Humber estuary. They are the chain of gleaming new power stations which will supply much of England with cheap, environmentally clean electricity well into the 21st century. As a result of the new investment, the region could one day rival the coalfields of Yorkshire and the Midlands as a centre for bulk electricity generation. All the new generators there will use natural gas from the North Sea, and comprise high efficiency combined cycle technology, in which the waste heat from the primary gas turbines is used to drive auxiliary steam turbines. The area's first new station, at Killingholme on south Humberside, is due to start supplying the national grid in the autumn. The 900 MegaWatt plant, owned by PowerGen, one of the successor companies of the former Central Electricity Generating Board, will be the biggest non-nuclear power station to be opened in Britain since the 1970s. The PowerGen plant is the first of eight large gas-fired power stations planned in this area and over the next five years. They have a total capacity of 5,730MW, which, on a warm bank holiday evening, could supply a high proportion of national demand. The list includes a second 800MW PowerGen plant at Killingholme, and a 620MW station on the same site being built by National Power, the bigger of the non-nuclear companies carved from the CEGB. The catalyst for the programme was the 1990 privatisation of the electricity industry which demolished the monolithic CEGB and opened the door to competitive electricity generation. Two other factors have attracted a large part of the planned new generating capacity to the South Humberside and Lincolnshire area: Its accessibility to the main 'super-grid' lines built to convey electricity to south-east England from the power stations of the Yorkshire and Trent Valley coalfields; and Its terminals for the gasfields of the southern North Sea, which are set to rival the coalfields as the principal fuel sources for electricity production. These twin factors, says Mr Philip Champ, director for power station development at East Midlands Electricity, are 'the magnet which has made the region around the Wash the busiest bit of England'. In addition to those planned at Killingholme, new plants are being built or planned at Brigg, Keadby, Stallingborough and Sutton Bridge. The radical nature of the overhaul of the electricity industry is evident in the exotic mixture of companies behind the new projects. They include the privatised regional electricity companies (before being privatised, they were restricted only to distribution of power) and numerous overseas companies, ranging from combustion equipment suppliers to overseas utilities. A Pounds 400m plant at Keadby, South Humberside, is a partnership of Scottish Hydro-Electric and Norweb, the North West electricity distribution company. In the Pounds 400m plant, at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, East Midlands Electricity is partnered by Electricite de France, the French state utility, GEC Alsthom (the Anglo-French combustion plant-maker), France's Compagnie Generale des Eaux, and Iberdrola, an independent Spanish utility. PowerGen's first Killingholme station is being built by Siemens, the German electrical giant, and its Kraft Werk Union power generation group. The biggest single project, the 1,320MW South Humber Bank, at Stallingborough, is being developed by IVO (Imatran Voima Oy), Finland's biggest electricity company, which is also the contractor for the Yorkshire Electricity-led 240MW station at Brigg, a British Sugar refinery site. The Brigg turbines will be supplied by the Lincoln-based European Gas Turbines, 90 per cent owned by GEC Alsthom and 10 per cent by General Electric of the US. Contrary to the ripples which power station projects sometimes cause elsewhere in Britain, the people of this area have seemed rather unconcerned at the rate of new development in their midst. Planning permission for a power station has been available for years at Stallingborough, proposed site of the South Humber Bank plant. Similarly, at nearby Killingholme, bought by the CEGB in 1957, there had been successive plans for stations - both oil and coal - all of which were abandoned for economic reasons. But there would be local anger if suggestions resurfaced to use Killingholme for a different energy-related purpose - in the mid 1980s, it was one of the places studied by NIREX for the burial of low level nuclear waste. (The idea was later dropped when the government went for a deep-level burial ground at Sellafield, Cumbria, but could be re-examined if the Sellafield scheme were abandoned.) There is also local anxiety over plans for a big new coal importing terminal at Immingham. The plans were shelved before the general election, but might be revived if the new Conservative government gives the electricity industry the green light to expand coal imports. Local resistance to the new port is laced with concern about the effect it would have on employment in the Yorkshire coalfield. On the other hand, many locals will breathe a deep sigh of relief over the effect of the smallest power station being built in the area. The 15MW station, on the site of the former Flixborough chemical works, will be powered by the manure of nearly 1m chickens a year reared on the Scunthorpe area's 40 battery farms. The highly pungent 'poultry litter', as it is clinically called, has been traditionally used to fertilise the area's rich farmland giving it its recognisable aroma. This is one power station which should significantly improve, rather than pollute, the atmosphere.</p>

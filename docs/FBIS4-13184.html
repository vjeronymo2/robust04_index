			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 17, IRNA -- A Persian daily here  Sunday censured the United Nations for its indifference towards  the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI', editorialializing on the develpments in  the Bosnian city of Gorazde wrote that despite being announced  as a safe area by the U.N., Gorazde has been a target of the  Serbs' shellings and chemical attacks over the past one month.    Due to the indifference of the U.N., said the daily, the  situation has aggravated in the area to the extent that the  Bosnian prime minister says what else the Serbs should commit to  make them liable to punishment?    This statement will be recorded as a black point in the  history of the U.N. as an organiztion that claims to support the  rights of the nations and protect peace and security in the  world, the paper said.    Turning to the hard conditions imposed on Bosnian Muslims  and  the fact that the Serbs do not abide by any rules and  regulations, the daily criticized the U.N. for imposing an arms  embargo on the Bosnian Muslims whereby reducing them to  defenceless victims of the criminal Serbs.    The bitter reality that the world witnesses today is the  death of humanity in the West on the one hand, and the  double-standard role of the U.N. on the other, the paper said,  adding that the world nations should, therefore, protest against  the U.N. which has been reduced to a protector of `the law of  jungle'.</p>

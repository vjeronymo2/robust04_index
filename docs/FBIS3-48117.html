			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Japanese Government on  Monday [24 January] described as "untimely" remarks by U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen over the weekend that  Washington may "reexamine" the bilateral trade framework talks  if no accord is reached before a Japan-U.S. summit on February  11. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a press conference that  Bentsen made the remarks "too early" since vice  ministerial-level talks are now under way in Washington.    At a separate news conference, Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko  Saito also called Bentsen's remarks "untimely" and "not  constructive" because both sides are engaging in serious  discussions to achieve agreements. Saito said it was not timely  because Japan and the U.S. have been strengthening their  efforts to produce such accords.    On Sunday, Bentsen said the United States "will not settle  for any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have  credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to  reexamine the basis of the framework." Bentsen said his remarks  are not meant as a threat but were "just the logical  consequence," reflecting "the realities of the situation."</p>

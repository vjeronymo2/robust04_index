The market price for soybeans is expected to drop to 1.60 yuan  per kilogram in the spring because the soybean area has  increased in the north. Soybean demand has decreased in Europe,  and soybean prices have dropped in international markets. The  Heilongjiang provincial government has stipulated that no  soybeans will be shipped to other provinces prior to fulfillment  of contract orders.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN DIES FROM BURNS SUSTAINED IN BLAZE;  </P> <P> FIRES: THE INCIDENT IN YORBA LINDA PRECEDED ANOTHER ONE IN IRVINE THAT STARTED  WHEN A CHRISTMAS TREE BROKE OUT IN FLAMES, INJURING TWO PEOPLE.  </P> <P> An 85-year-old Yorba Linda woman died from burns sustained over 70% of her body  during a fire which led to the evacuation of a senior citizens' apartment  complex early Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Two hours later, a 4-year-old and his father were injured and their family left  homeless in Irvine as a result of a fire that started in a Christmas tree and  engulfed their house.  </P> <P> According to fire officials, the Yorba Linda fire broke out at 5:33 a.m. at the  Villa Pacifica Apartments, a housing complex for elderly residents in the 18000  block of Lemon Drive. Matilda Tuohy apparently was asleep in her second-floor  apartment when her electric blanket caught fire, rapidly igniting her blankets  and trapping her amid heavy flames and smoke. When firefighters arrived, Tuohy  was lying on the carpet near her bed, not breathing, fire officials said.  </P> <P> "Apparently, she tried to get out because she was found on the floor of her own  bedroom," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. "They (paramedics) found her  and were able to resuscitate her."  </P> <P> But Tuohy died at 3:44 p.m. at UCI Medical Center's burn unit in Orange.  </P> <P> The fire at the complex of two-story buildings forced about 20 elderly  residents outdoors before dawn while firefighters battled the stubborn blaze.  </P> <P> "It was quite frightening," said Joy Barber, who was among those evacuated.  "Once I got down the steps there were flames coming over the window and up by  the roof."  </P> <P> Officials estimate the fire caused $70,000 in damage, including smoke and heat  damage to two neighboring apartments.  </P> <P> Young said investigators are trying to determine whether a smoke detector in  Tuohy's apartment sounded when the fire broke out. He said fire officials have  not determined what caused the electric blanket to malfunction.  </P> <P> Two hours after the Yorba Linda fire, an Irvine family barely escaped with  their lives when their Christmas tree caught fire in the living room, creating  an inferno that engulfed their home within minutes.  </P> <P> "No one in the house even had time to call 911," Young said. "(The) mom said  the fire started in the back of the tree and the whole thing just exploded."  </P> <P> Kathy O'Connor, who was sitting on a couch about 20 feet from the tree, had  just enough time to grab her 2-year-old son and run outside, fire officials  said. The toddler had been sitting next to the tree when the fire started.  </P> <P> One neighbor said he ran to get a garden hose as he watched flames shooting  from the windows.  </P> <P> "She (O'Connor) was yelling, 'Phil (O'Connor, her husband) is still inside!'  but then I heard Phil say, 'I'm all right!' " said Lee Ennis, a neighbor. "You  could just see the flames taking off."  </P> <P> Moments later, Philip O'Connor, 40, grabbed the couple's 4-year-old son, Philip  Jr., and climbed out a second-floor window, fire officials said. He suffered  second-degree burns on his hands and back, while Philip Jr. suffered minor  burns on his hands. Philip O'Connor received outpatient treatment at the Irvine  Medical Center. Philip Jr. was being treated at Children's Hospital of Orange  County.  </P> <P> Officials are investigating how the Christmas tree caught fire.  </P> <P> The family lost everything inside the house, including all the newly opened  Christmas gifts cherished by the children, Young said.  </P> <P> So, on Saturday afternoon, county firefighters delivered a load of belated  Christmas presents to the two young O'Connor boys.  </P> <P> "The kids were devastated. Their toys were completely gone," Young said. "So we  delivered these to boost their spirits."  </P> <P> The toys -- including stuffed animals and a tricycle for the 2-year-old, a  train set and a bicycle for the 4-year-old, and lots of Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtle pajamas and clothes -- came from Operation Santa Claus, an annual  program that county firefighters run with the county Social Services  Department. The toys usually are delivered to children at Orangewood, the  county's home for abused and neglected children, on the day before Christmas,  but this year there were some late donations at several fire stations, Young  said.  </P> <P> After the O'Connor blaze, the firefighters rounded up appropriate gifts from  the late donations. The first delivery, in a firetruck, was made to the  2-year-old, who was with family friends in the neighborhood. Later, the  firefighters took gifts -- including a blanket, to replace Philip Jr.'s  treasured object, which burned -- to the youngster at Children's Hospital.  </P> <P> According to neighbors, the O'Connors' two older children were away in Florida  visiting grandparents.  </P> <P> "They (O'Connors) said if they had been home they would have never been able to  get them out," Ennis said. "Their dog got stuck inside and died."  </P> <P> Young estimated damage to the home in the 15000 block of Vichy Circle at  $465,000.  </P> <P> Fire officials said the blaze was the eighth this holiday season started by a  Christmas tree catching fire.  </P></p>

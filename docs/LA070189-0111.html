			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS: THE T'S HAVE IT IN RAP NIGHT AT THE PALACE  </P> <P> It was T time at the Palace on Thursday night, a celebration of the many T's in  the world of rap. Howie T, Toddy T, Sweet Tee, Grandmaster D.S.T. and T La Rock  weren't scheduled -- Ice Cream T was, but she didn't show up -- so the Palace  crowd had to settle for T for two: local rappers Ice-T and King T.  </P> <P> Not that long ago, in the brief period between high-energy rap and the  ascendancy of gangster-chic, Ice-T was the best-known rapper on the West Coast,  and his canny blend of raw Bronx-style rhyming and slick L.A. production made  him an underground rap hit. Where Easterners Melle Mel and Run-D.M.C. may have  occasionally rapped about desolation in general, he celebrated the rough beauty  of violence as one who had seen it, and his hard-core reputation was enough to  make him a credible anti-drug, anti-violence spokesman among gangsters  themselves.  </P> <P> These days, outslicked by MC Hammer and outgunned by N.W.A, Ice-T seems  determined to become the Redd Foxx of rap, the guy who leers through songs like  "Sex" and "LGBNAF", sometimes like that sort of man who persists in telling  dirty jokes at a party whether anybody laughs or not. Some new songs, performed  here for the first time, have awesomely danceable, Public Enemy-inspired beats  but betray the same obsession with the puerile.  </P> <P> There are no giant Uzis in Ice-T's show these days, no visible weaponry save  the pistol medallion slung around his neck on a fat gold chain, but at least a  dozen people were on stage with him, most folding their arms on their chest and  glowering. He rapped into a headset he'd hidden under his hat, which tended to  make his show even less focused than it had been earlier this year -- though  he's never sounded better.  </P> <P> Though opener King T is an enormously appealing young hardcore rapper -- he  clearly loved it on stage, striding about and brandishing a contraband can of  the malt liquor he endorses -- and his deejay, Pooh, is among the best  scratchers around, he's still relatively new to the large stage. Give him  another year. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT PLUNGES .4% IN APRIL;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION, WHICH WAS OFF 14% FOR THE MONTH, IS BLAMED FOR  SHARP DECLINE.  </P> <P> U.S. industrial output plunged 0.4% in April, due primarily to a sharp decline  in automobile production, after registering a healthy gain in March, the  Federal Reserve said today.  </P> <P> Private analysts had expected a decline of about 0.2%.  </P> <P> "It is consistent with all other economic data that point to weakness," said  Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorp in Philadelphia.  "Things are very sluggish."  </P> <P> The report also said American industry operated at 83% of capacity last month,  a decrease of 0.5% from March.  </P> <P> "A sharp drop in the production of motor vehicles and parts, affecting both  consumer goods and business equipment, accounted for the April decline in  industrial production," the Federal Reserve said.  </P> <P> In March, industrial production increased by a revised 0.5% and factory  operating capacity recorded a revised increase of 0.3 percentage point, the  report said.  </P> <P> Motor vehicle production was off by 14% for the month. But excluding autos and  parts, total industrial production remained unchanged in April, the Federal  Reserve said.  </P> <P> The industrial production report "reflects a great deal of unusual conservatism  on the part of the auto industry," said economist Cynthia Latta of the private  consulting firm DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> "Their policy in the past has been to produce, produce, produce and then push,  push, push -- and that hasn't been too good for profits," Latta said. "They  have bitten the bullet this year."  </P> <P> The 0.4% in output was the first since a January drop of 1% in the wake of  December's big freeze, which crippled all types of business activity across the  United States.  </P> <P> "That decline is consistent with the very weak employment number (for April)  that included a decline in manufacturing employment and hours worked," Levy  said.  </P> <P> But Latta suggested the economy "is a little weak, but not quite as weak as the  0.4 decline suggests."  </P> <P> By industry, manufacturing production was down 0.6% in April, production of  durable goods -- items made to last three or more years -- was off 1%, and  nondurable goods fell 0.1%.  </P> <P> "Apart from autos and trucks, production of durable consumer goods declined  0.7% owing mainly to a drop in output of appliances," the report said. "The  output of nondurable consumer goods remained sluggish in April."  </P></p>

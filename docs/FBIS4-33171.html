			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Cuban daily GRANMA condemned the meddling in  Mexico's internal matters by Democratic Representative Robert  Torricelli, who is described as a politics' dealer. An  extensive editorial by reporter Nicanor Leon Cotayo, highlights  a wave of repudiation in Mexico of Torricelli's attempt to  appoint himself a judge of Mexico. He adds that the chairman of  the Western Hemisphere Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of  Representatives, this year inaugurated two hearings to examine  the situation in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, arguing that  NAFTA grants Washington this right. The U.S. Congressman also  drew up a draft bill outlining the guidelines the Mexican  electoral system should follow from now on.    GRANMA's article emphasized that Torricelli, once again,  defends a trend in U.S. policymaking to make meddling in the  internal matters of other countries state policy. The Cuban  daily concludes by indicating that what is of most concern is  the increasing tendency among high-level U.S. officials to  reveal their true intentions.</p>

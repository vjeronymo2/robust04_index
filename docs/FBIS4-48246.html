			<p>BFN     [Text] A Somali National Alliance [SNA] spokesman has  described the report broadcast by the BBC Somali service at 1730  saying two Somali clans fought in the vicinity of Mogadishu  airport as baseless lies and intended to stir up instability.  He added that on 17 May [as heard] 1994 at about 1300 fire was  exchanged between UN Operation in Somalia forces from Nepal and  armed gangs who were stealing the vehicles these forces were  using around the airport. Since then the SNA has been busy  investigating the incident and extent of the damage.    In conclusion, the spokesman clearly said that the alliance  has no connection with that incident and was very sorry about  the deaths of the three Nepalese soldiers confirmed so far. He  said he was sending condolence messages to the relations,  families, and the Government of Nepal who lost their soldiers.</p>

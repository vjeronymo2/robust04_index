			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Unionist MPs face grassroots backlash: James Molyneaux has a tricky task in maintaining unity in his party Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, will today conduct the last of three private meetings of party activists in an exercise that will gauge the strength of grassroots backing for the party's guarded support for the Downing Street declaration. The continued backing of Northern Ireland's largest political party for the declaration is vital to the UK-Irish peace initiative's prospects of success. The declaration, of December 15 last year, entrenched the majority unionist veto over constitutional change in Northern Ireland but balanced it with explicit recognition of the possibility of a united Ireland. Senior officials admit that initial reaction to the declaration was negative. 'At first the phone calls we were getting here were talking about sell-outs,' says Mr William Bell, a UUP councillor in Lisburn. But they say this mood changed once people started to study the document in detail. 'Over Christmas the whole tone of the telephone messages changed to one of support for the parliamentary party,' says Mr Jim Wilson, UUP general secretary. Yet not everyone is happy, and it is clear that the leadership will not escape without criticism from this week's meetings. Mr Jim Clarke, a UUP councillor in Belfast, plans to use tomorrow's gathering to urge the party to withdraw its support for the declaration because it 'gives no alternative to Ireland's problems but a united Ireland'. Mr Clarke, who broke party ranks to support a motion condemning the declaration when it was debated this week by Belfast City Council, argues that Mr Molyneaux was 'too hasty' in welcoming the document. 'Jim Molyneaux has not got a mandate from the people to accept this,' Mr Clarke says. Mr Raymond Ferguson, a UUP councillor in Enniskillen, says the meetings will reveal deep discontent in the party. 'People in the unionist community here are sore and angry,' he says. 'I am sure that the meetings . . . will be used by them to make it clear that they are not at all happy with what the UUP Westminster MPs are agreeing to in this declaration.' Another prominent UUP councillor says there is 'widespread opposition' to the document in the party. 'My phone and mail bag has been dreadful with people complaining about it . . . We feel that Molyneaux is being sucked in  -pulled along by Major because of Major's small parliamentary majority,' the councillor says. Senior officials expect that during the meetings Mr Molyneaux will discuss the advice he gave privately to Mr Major before the declaration. The leadership's hand has been strengthened by Westminster's decision to approve the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee, a long-cherished unionist aim, symbolising the province's integration with the UK. But Mr Molyneaux must still tread cautiously. The slightest sign that the so-called loyalist veto over any change in the province's constitutional status might be undermined could send support cascading to the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party before the European elections later this year. The UUP leader's priority appears to be to encourage progress in the talks process being pursued under the stewardship of Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister.</p>

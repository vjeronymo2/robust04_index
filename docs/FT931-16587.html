			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Conventions will limit claims against insurers: Insurance group fears heavy loss 'AT THE moment we are looking at a heavy loss, but if the vessel breaks up, this will be a major catastrophe,' said Mr Michael Thorpe of Skuld, the Norwegian protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) club, which provides liability insurance for Bergvall &amp; Hudner Ship Management, manager of the stricken Braer. He said that under the terms of two international conventions to which the UK is a signatory, potential insurance claims to meet the cost of the pollution clean-up and related losses should be contained to a maximum of Dollars 35m (Pounds 23m). Liability for the Braer is limited to about Dollars 17m under the Civil Liability Convention - funded by tanker owners - and to between Dollars 33m and Dollars 35m under the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund. London marine insurers and brokers said that for the limits to be breached, claimants would need to show that the vessel's owners were, at least, guilty of gross negligence. Friends of the Earth, the environment group, is urging the introduction of unlimited liability for tanker accidents. Of the potential Dollars 35m payout, Skuld, the fourth-biggest P&amp;I club with premium income of more than Dollars 150m, would pay Dollars 2m. Sixteen P&amp;I clubs, owned by shipping fleets, would meet the next Dollars 13m. Claims above Dollars 15m would fall on the reinsurance market, largely through a scheme negotiated by the P&amp;I clubs with Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies. Reinsurers would cover claims up to Dollars 500m if convention limits were breached.</p>

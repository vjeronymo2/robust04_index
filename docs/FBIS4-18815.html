			<p>BFN     [Text]  <H5>  The World's Most Bloody Terrorist Organizations Met in the </H5> Greek Cypriot Sector and Adopted Decisions  <H5>  ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] </H5> Scourge Is Reviving    Dirty Conspiracies in Southern Cyprus. The Revival of ASALA  Was Endorsed in a Meeting Held in Nicosia With the Participation  of the World's Most Bloody  <H5>  Terror Organizations Under the </H5> Chairmanship of Iran and Libya  <H5>  There Will Be an Explosion in Terrorism Around the World </H5>   The Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the Armenian Secret Army  ASALA, the German and Japanese Red Armies, Red Brigades, Islamic  Jihad, and Abu-Nidal's groups took part in the secret meeting  held recently. Plans were made at the meeting, chaired by the  heads of the Iranian and Libyan intelligence organizations, for  operations that would soak the world in blood within a short  period. The organizations were assigned duties for armed and  bomb attacks.  <H5>  The Bloody ASALA is Again on the Scene </H5>   The wife of ASALA terrorist Agopyan, who was murdered in  Athens in 1988, also took part in the meeting as the leader of  that organization. Agopyan's wife, who met with the prominent  intelligence officer in Tehran 'Ali Falahian recently, obtained  great support also from the other bloody terror organizations  during the meeting in Nicosia. The meeting, during which Tehran  exerted enormous pressure to revive ASALA, promised to provide  every assistance to this bloody organization to organize itself  in many European countries.  <H5>  [Box p.20] </H5> <H5>  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is Greatest Supporter </H5>   Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi occupies the leading  place on the United States' list of terrorist countries. In an  interview in NEWSWEEK magazine last week, he described some  organizations known to be terrorist groups around the world as  freedom fighters. In his interview al-Qadhdhafi said: "This is  one of the misconceptions about my person in the minds of the  Americans. Neither Ahmad Jibril nor Abu-Nidal are terrorists.  They are fighters for a sacred cause."  <H5>  Their First Act Took Place in Corsica </H5>   The decisions adopted in Nicosia made themselves felt. The  shootings and bombings last night following the detention of 14  members of the "Corsica National Liberation Front," which  struggles for the liberation of the island, while preparing to  carry out a bombing in the French island of Corsica on Sunday  night, is believed to have been carried out by the same  organization."  <H5>  Meeting on "How We Must Soak the World in </H5> Blood"    The latest meeting in Nicosia in the Greek Cypriot sector,  which has become the capital of terrorist organizations in  recent years, was hair-raising. The leaders of the world's most  bloody terror organizations examined and discussed how to spread  terror over Europe and other countries. The meeting's outcome  was even more frightening: "The world will be soaked in blood  this year!"</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Signs of welcome for men of Kent WHAT joy the old roundels at Kent's oast kilns must have given returning soldiers after distant campaigns. Together with ancient smock windmills, they symbolised the tranquillity and continuity of the English countryside, writes David Hoppit. But east Londoners no longer go to Kent at picking time. Neither do labourers toil in the dusty kilns, drying the fragrant cones that flavour the very beer that once quenched their thirst after evensong. Most roundels are now houses despite their shape, which makes furnishing difficult and such things as radiators hard to fix. Conversion is not easy, though: none was built with a damp course and installing windows is tricky. Moreover, local authorities (quite rightly) insist upon retaining and restoring the lucarne (hoist) and the huge dunce's-cap cowls, some 10ft high, atop the circular roofs of tapered tiles. But painting them is no problem: Kent authorities have decreed that any colour is acceptable so long as it is white. Most of the roundels of Kent and Sussex were built between 1850 and 1900, owners believing them to retain heat better than the traditional square kilns. But the south-east did not have a monopoly on them. Worcestershire has many hop gardens and cider orchards, and the co-operative kiln at Suckley, not far from Leominster, was still being operated early in the 1960s. Now, it has been converted into a large house with the ground floor used for business purposes. Altogether, there is 11,000 sq ft of floor area and the gardens of nearly an acre have views of the Malvern hills. Agent Andrew Grant (0905-24477) suggests a price in the region of Pounds 365,000.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / View from the Rialto Don't laugh, but I'm beginning to wonder whether Mr John Major really can look forward to a prolonged tenure of office. This rush of blood to the head will be explained in a moment. First, let it be assumed that similar intimations of political mortality may have occurred to the prime minister himself yesterday as he consulted colleagues on the vexed question of whether or not to dismiss his chancellor in response to the clamour of frightened Tories. If so, he will be aware that a cabinet reshuffle alone will not restore calm for long. For it is becoming plain that a chancellor here or there is no longer the deciding issue. Anyhow, the time for Mr Norman Lamont to resign was after lunch on September 16 1992, when his previously-proclaimed policies crumbled. There can be no glorious departure now. A sacking, or even a transfer, might be taken as evidence of panic. Mr Major has been struggling since Black Wednesday to restore his personal authority. In so doing, he has already used up six or perhaps seven of his political lives. Throwing Mr Lamont overboard might not be sufficient to prevent Fate from depriving him of the rest. So much for doleful thoughts. The conventional wisdom, frequently rehearsed in this space, is that the Tories will win the next general election in spite of the upsets that have made such fools of them since they won for a fourth time in a row in April 1992. To judge by most of the weekend comment, this assumption has survived the drubbing the government took from the voters last Thursday. Most of us have also made the calculation that Mr Major will stay as leader. Nothing tests your faith in the conventional wisdom more severely than a change of scene. In London last week, the familiar arguments held sway. Labour remains unmodernised, in thrall to the trade unions, and therefore unable to count on winning seats in the south of England. The Liberal Democrats can neither help such a Labour party nor attain an overall majority on their own. Boundary revisions will help the Tories. The economic recovery will favour the incumbents at the next election. There is no obvious candidate to replace Mr Major. To cap it all, the Tories have three or four years in which to regroup themselves. If they look like losing the next election they will, of course, choose to lose Mr Major first. Just a small hop across the water and this perspective changes. No sooner had I arrived here in Venice for the annual conference of the International Press Institute than doubts began to creep in. One reason is that so many of the other representatives come from countries in which traditional politicians, or existing heads of government, have lost or are losing popularity. The first four examples that spring to mind are France, Spain, Germany and Italy. The political uncertainties that prevail in Britain are recession-driven, as in other European democracies. Britain's recession has been running for longer than the others, so its electorate is more disenchanted. Mr Major's favourite reverie, in which by 1996 Mitterrand, Gonzalez and Kohl have all left the stage to him alone, may suffer from the fault that he is currently dodging the largest fusillade of rotten eggs and old cabbages. Looked at this way, the well-known facts of British political life can be re-stated. For a start, the two principal opposition parties are edging closer to one another. Their leaders are saying 'no deals, no pacts', but voters showed last week that they know how to combine to throw the Tories out when they want to. The Conservatives are deeply divided. Their anti-Maastricht and pro-Thatcher schismatics (not always the same individuals) seem willing to fight to the death to destroy the party they say they love. Mr Major is contrasted with his predecessor in the same way as Mr George Bush was once compared with Mr Ronald Reagan. The Anglo-American super communicators of the 1980s were replaced by grey individuals who seem unable to get things done. One of those, Mr Bush, has fallen. Ergo. . . From a distance, you see a vague outline of the wood, not the trees. At home among the thickets of British politics the killer question, 'If not Major, who?' is asked by everyone, including his Thatcherite enemies. The latter have no champion ready to take over the party and insufficient voters to support a stalking-horse. Likewise, the remark 'Labour? You cannot be serious' usually suffices to shut off contemplation of a Conservative defeat. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has his own answer to these arguments. He says he is a patient man, playing a long game. It is as if he wants you to believe that his recent lack-lustre parliamentary performance (which belies his reputation) is the product of a deliberate stratagem, which, roughly summarised, is to sit back and let the Tories tear themselves apart. This would make sound sense, if it was accompanied by quiet backroom words designed to re-invent the Labour party. If that is happening it is very quiet indeed. Here in Italy, a different fancy presents itself. Until very recently, the famous Italian political problems - organised crime, corruption, a multiplicity of small parties leading to weak government - seemed insoluble. Perhaps they still are. But, as the rest of the world has been witnessing with some admiration, the Italians are undergoing a bloodless revolution. The complexities are described alongside. The cheering reminder for outsiders is that no political situation is permanent; quite surprising changes can suddenly occur. We saw that in the communist states. Now we are seeing it in a western democracy. In London this may seem like pie in the sky. The log jam in British politics seems unbreakable. The electorate holds the government in fair contempt. The Labour party has not yet earned its trust. The likely consequence is a long period of sub-standard administration by Conservative politicians of the second rank. That is the conclusion to which you must come if you accept the conventional wisdom, as I suspect I will as soon as I get home. Yet something unpredictable may change this - the rise of a Northern League, as in Italy, or a Ross Perot, as in the US, or a sensibly modernised Lab-Lib opposition, as in so many British imaginations. If you wish to be optimistic about British politics you must believe that the people do eventually bestir themselves, even in the most complacent of democracies.</p>

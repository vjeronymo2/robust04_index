			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters pointed out that in any event the apparent conflict between CAS and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) should be eliminated. It was also pointed out that the government should be consisted in its application of cost accounting practices in this area. It should either allow revaluation of assets subsequent to business combinations and then deal with the resulting gain and loss issues, or adopt practices based on not revaluing assets and limiting depreciation and gains and losses to historical costs without regard to business combinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board agrees with the commenters who stated or inferred that in case of asset revaluations subsequent to a business combination the procedures involved to develop an adequate and equitable method to share the gain or loss between the government and the contractor would be complex and costly. At the same time, the Board does not agree with those commenters who maintain that the government is not entitled to any share in the gain or loss subsequent to asset revaluation because such a gain or loss can only accrue to a party that bears the risk of ownership, i.e., the contractor. The Board believes that in a business environment where cost-based pricing prevails, which includes an allowance for cost of money, and long-term contractual relationshps are the norm, the buyer, i.e., the government, has a sound claim to the benefits that may emerge as the tangible capital asset values increase in response to the interaction of various market forces. Conversely, the Board also believes that if the government is entitled to the benefits that may emerge as the asset values increase, it should also be prepared to bear the additional costs when the asset values are decreasing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Board has concluded that in light of the complexity of the procedures that are needed to deal with the revaluation of assets and the subsequent sharing of ensuing gains and losses, the most acceptable course to follow in pursuit of its objectives is to retain the original asset acquisition cost as a base for calculating contract costs after a business combination or merger has taken place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 9904 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cost accounting standards, Government procurement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Steven Kelman,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, and Chairman, Cost Accounting Standards Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, it is proposed to amend 48 CFR part 9904 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 9904_COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

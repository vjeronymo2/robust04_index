			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: SUNDAY SILENCE WINS SUPER DERBY  </P> <P> Sunday Silence won the $1-million Super Derby at Louisiana Downs by six lengths  Sunday, setting up a horse-of-the-year duel with Easy Goer in the $3-million  Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 4 at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla.  </P> <P> Returning from a two-month layoff, Sunday Silence covered the 1 1/4 miles in a  slow 2:03 1/5, but the 3-year-old colt still dominated.  </P> <P> Coming around the final turn, Sunday Silence was less than a length ahead, but,  under Patrick Valenzuela, he pulled away as the field straightened for home.  </P> <P> Louisiana-bred longshot Big Earl was second. Awe Inspiring, the second pick in  the field of eight, was third.  </P> <P> The victory, worth $600,000 to the dark bay son of Halo-Wishing Well, increased  his career winnings to $3.2 million.  </P> <P> After upsetting favored Easy Goer in the first two races of the Triple Crown,  Sunday Silence finished second by eight lengths in the Belmont, then was upset  by Prized in the Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park in July.  </P> <P> "If we win the Breeders' Classic, the choice will be hard," winning trainer  Charlie Whittingham said of the horse-of-the-year award. "Easy Goer has the  Eastern vote."  </P> <P> Sunday Silence paid $2.80, $2.60 and $2.20. Big Earl, who set much of the early  pace, paid $7.80 and $2.20. Awe Inspiring returned $2.20 to show.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangkok, March 29 (YONHAP) -- A senior North Korean  official here asserted on Tuesday that the United States is to  be blamed for the tension on the Korean peninsula over the  nuclear question, arguing that peaceful resolution of the  nuclear issue is up entirely to the United States.    In a prepared statement at a press conference held at the  Foreign Correspondents Club here in Bangkok, North Korean  Ambassador to Thailand Yi To-son said the only method of  peaceful settlement of the nuclear question is for North Korea  and the United States to adopt a "package deal."    On the possibility of North Korea's acceptance of  re-inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  Yi said, "this, too, depends on the outcome of our negotiations  with the United States because the nuclear question lies not in  technical matters but in political ones."    The North Korean envoy stressed that North Korea will under  no circumstance be the first to unleash an armed provocation  over the nuclear question.    He said if South Korea and the United States invade North  Korea, "our country would be destroyed."    Asked what would become of the North Korean economy if the  UN  Security Council adopts a sanction against North Korea, Yi said  that even if a sanction were applied, North Korea would fully  stand it because "we have run our economy on our own with our  technology, resources, work forces and facilities over a long  period of time."    He added that his understanding is that Japan and the United  States have already begun to apply economic sanctions against  North Korea.    Yi also charged the United States with taking the lead in  efforts to invoke a sanction against North Korea through the  U.N. Security Council by pushing ahead with the deployment of  Patriot missiles in Korea and staging of the Team Spirit  military exercise as planned.    "All pressures against us would only delay the settlement of  the nuclear issues and make the problem more complicated,  leading North Korea to withdraw competely from the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty," he said.    Regarding the issue of exchanging special envoys between  South and North Korea, Yi asserted that "South Korea distorted  the significance of the proposed exchange of special envoys by  making it appear as if the exchange is designed merely to  discuss the nuclear issue."    "South Korea has thus applied a brake to the dialogue  between  North Korea and the United States," he said.</p>

"The president will react calmly, without emotions. He will  give a moral assessment of the event", Vyacheslav Kostikov told  reporters on Thursday.    However, the spokesman himself believes the implementation  of  the Duma decision would result in "a serious destabilisation",  will be detrimental to Russian national interests and will  affect the foreign policy.    Kostikov hinted that the amnesty to rebels may not be  implemented because of a "possible war of juridical  interpretations".    "If the Constitution says that the State Duma declares  amnesty it does not mean that it adopts a decision on it",  Kostikov said adding that "the amnesty in its political part is  immoral" because it frees those who are responsible for the  death of people.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WORKING OUT WHILE AT WORK;  </P> <P> HEALTH: COMPANIES ARE SPENDING MILLIONS ON EMPLOYEE EXERCISE CENTERS, BELIEVING  FIT EMPLOYEES ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTHIER.  </P> <P> Corporate fitness centers used to be a perk.  </P> <P> "Companies started putting in recreational centers and exercise equipment  because it was a 'good thing,' " said Stephen Pauley, manager of the Rockwell  Employees Recreation and Fitness Center in West Hills. The center, which opened  in 1941, serves the 9,000 area employees of Rockwell's Rocketdyne division.  </P> <P> "The benefit to a company was undefinable. You couldn't put it on a graph or  show how it would help a company's financial picture. It was just a good thing  to do. A benefit. A warm fuzzy."  </P> <P> The workplace has changed radically at Rocketdyne since the West Hills center  opened. Likewise, views on bodybuilding and fitness: Pumping iron has gone from  aberration to social acceptance to being a craze that shows no sign of abating.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, more businesses jumped on the fitness bandwagon -- and not just  to be faddish or to increase their quota of warm fuzzies. Corporations, many of  which had long subsidized health-club memberships for top executives, were  ready to experiment with offering the joys of sweat to a far wider range of  workers. They were willing to bet that a fitter employee would be a more  productive employee who would file fewer costly health claims.  </P> <P> Such national powerhouses as Campbell Soup, General Electric, Hughes Aircraft  and Toyota U.S.A. have installed fitness centers at various facilities in the  past few years. Likewise, a handful of firms headquartered in the San Fernando  Valley have made a considerable investment in exercise equipment, locker rooms,  showers and even personal trainers.  </P> <P> Rocketdyne's commitment to fitness and recreation, for example, comes with an  annual price tag of $1.3 million to staff and maintain the 10-acre West Hills  center, with its indoor exercise building and extensive outdoor playing fields.  The property, once part of an estate owned by comedian Lou Costello, was  acquired to provide plant employees with recreation space for baseball games,  picnicking and other family outings. One of the playgrounds has a metal Jungle  Gym-like structure shaped, appropriately, like a rocket.  </P> <P> "All this started as part of the industrial recreation movement of the early  1940s," Pauley said while conducting a tour of the center. "Back then, we had  about 80% blue-collar workers at the plant and 20% white-collar and executives.  The company thought it was a good thing for the employees to have a nice place  to spend leisure time with other workers. Join clubs, play sports. It would  build morale. But there wasn't much thought given to 'working out.' They did  enough physical labor on the job. It was hard work."  </P> <P> With the advent of computerized automation, the ratio of blue- to white-collar  workers at Rocketdyne has almost reversed itself, Pauley said. And the  blue-collar jobs involve much less heavy lifting.  </P> <P> "Now those jobs mostly consist of someone sitting and watching a CRT screen,  monitoring what an automated machine is doing," Pauley said. "It used to be  that after a day of work, blue-collar workers had to go home and rest. Now,  they leave work and go work out."  </P> <P> The fitness center, which is free to Rocketdyne employees, their spouses and  retirees, has also been transformed by technology, especially in the room  recently set aside for cardiovascular exercise, with its eight high-tech  Stairmaster machines (with six more on order), two rowing machines and 12  stationary bicycles. The nearby weight room has several racks of dumb bells and  barbells, plus an 11-station circuit of Nautilus exercise machines. A suspended  wood floor, which is thought to reduce the impact on the body during aerobic  exercise, was recently installed in a former auditorium at a cost of $35,000.  </P> <P> Outside are two 60-foot swimming pools and a children's wading pool; tennis,  basketball and volleyball courts; a running track and a croquet green.  </P> <P> But on a recent weekday afternoon, fewer than 20 people were using all these  facilities. Pauley said that because the company allows little flexibility in  workers' schedules, most of the people who use the center during the workday  are retirees and spouses.  </P> <P> "Flex time has traditionally been a no-no at Rocketdyne," he said, "so workers  have to come after work or on weekends. That's when we get very busy." Pauley,  a trim man who has competed in 90 triathlons, clearly wishes company policy  were otherwise.  </P> <P> "I think flex time would be the way to go," he said, "but it's not easy  convincing a big company to make that big of a change on the say-so of the  fitness director."  </P> <P> Pauley estimates that only about 10% of the eligible workers visit regularly.  He wishes that the percentage were higher, but he also is not sure what he  would do if the numbers suddenly increased. "I'd like it to be at least 20%,"  he said, "but 20% of 9,000 is a lot of people. As big as this center is, we  would not be able to handle them."  </P> <P> At GTE California headquarters in Thousand Oaks, about 23% of the 3,000  eligible employees and area retirees use the plush fitness center. The carpeted  exercise area includes a suspended wood floor for aerobics, numerous Keiser  air-pressure weight-training machines, two Stairmasters, five treadmills, 12  stationary bicycles and a rack of free weights.  </P> <P> Next to each bike and treadmill is a socket for personal headphones. The  exerciser can turn a knob to choose from three music selections or the audio  from a wall-mounted TV.  </P> <P> Although GTE allows many of its employees flexibility in scheduling their  workdays, only three people were using the room on a weekday afternoon. "Our  heaviest time by far is lunch," said Mike Leonard, a fitness trainer hired by  GTE to run the center. Leonard, who interned under Pauley at Rockwell's fitness  center, explained that because GTE has a successful van car-pool program, many  employees cannot take the time before or after work to exercise.  </P> <P> Those who take advantage of the program receive an initial fitness test to  gauge their strength and endurance levels. Using software developed by Fitness  Systems, a Los Angeles company that provided advice on the design of GTE's  fitness center, Leonard and his three full-time "fitness specialists" (also  supplied through Fitness Systems) come up with a personalized exercise program.  </P> <P> In this area, Leonard differs from his mentor at Rocketdyne. "We bought a  computer package that cost us about $2,000 a couple of years ago to design  custom fitness programs," Pauley said, "but we gave up on it. It didn't allow  us to make the programs custom enough. It didn't allow for enough personalized  attention."  </P> <P> Both programs retest participants periodically and both Pauley and Leonard say  that people who follow their programs and come to the centers regularly make  great progress.  </P> <P> Don Rose, who was using a "leg extension" machine at GTE to exercise his legs,  agrees with them. Rose, who is 70 and retired last year, comes to the gym five  days a week. "I had had a lot of plans to start exercising in my life," he  said, "but I never got much past the planning stage until the mountain came to  Mohammed.  </P> <P> "When it was right in the same building where I was working, it was so  convenient I couldn't come up with an excuse."  </P> <P> Rose has lost 25 pounds since he started exercising in the fitness center, and  he says his endurance has greatly increased. "I used to huff and puff just  walking down the hall," he said. "Now I can easily cover a few miles at a  time."  </P> <P> The center, which was included in the plans for the headquarters that opened in  1985 (the gym didn't open until 1987), costs almost $200,000 a year to operate,  said Martina Cunningham, manager of the company health program.  </P> <P> GTE pays only about half of that. The rest comes from the $10 monthly fee paid  by those enrolled in the fitness program. For that, participants get not only  the use of the facility and guidance of trainers, but also an individual oak  locker, towels and overnight laundry service for their gym clothes.  </P> <P> Redken Laboratories in Canoga Park has installed a small fitness center  outfitted with a weight-machine circuit, free weights, a treadmill and  stationary bicycles. A trainer works on a part-time basis to give fitness tests  and demonstrate the use of the machines.  </P> <P> "The idea behind it was that it would help with health costs," said Jim  Griffith, vice president of human relations. But there is little flexibility in  work schedules at Redken, and the gym is open only during lunch and after  regular work hours. Griffith estimates that only about 30 employees out of 500  use the gym.  </P> <P> "I wish it were more, but a lot of our people here are parents, and they want  to go home right after work. The numbers making use of the gym are just not  high enough to make a correlation between usage and health costs."  </P> <P> The correlation between usage and health costs is difficult to study, even at  gyms that are used by a much higher percentage of employees.  </P> <P> "Some people might ask, 'What does all this fitness stuff have to do with  making better rocket engines, making more money,' " Pauley said. "I think there  is definitely a connection, but that is very hard to show."  </P> <P> While there have been surveys that suggest cost benefits are derived from  having an employee fitness center -- a study by the Canadian government  suggested that workers enrolled in some type of corporate health and fitness  program take an average of 2 1/2 fewer sick days per year -- the definitive  testing has not been done. The problem is the cost of doing an exhaustive  study.  </P> <P> "We're talking expensive number crunching," Pauley said. "To do it right would  cost about as much as it costs to run this center for a year."  </P> <P> Until that testing is done, the health of corporate gyms must depend completely  on a benevolent management view toward fitness.  </P> <P> "If a company goes through hard times, the health center is among the first  things to go," Pauley said. "It's still considered just a perk when times get  rough.  </P> <P> "Until we can prove otherwise, we are still just a 'good thing.' "  </P></p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Pinheiro champions EC openness EUROPEAN citizens would have the right to demand information on EC proposals and decisions which affect them, under a new 'openness' regime the Commission is due to discuss at the end of this month. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC commissioner for internal political relations who has the job of trying to restore the Commission's credibility at a time of widespread hostility, told the Financial Times he is planning a radical overhaul of the Brussels information directorate. The, until now, virtually invisible directorate known as DG10 will be slimmed down and reorganised, with officials responsible for obtaining and providing information on each area of EC policy on demand. Under Mr Pinheiro's plans a small watchdog group, independent of the 'vested interests' of other Commission departments, will monitor DG10 for the quality and timeliness of its information. The operation as a whole would be overseen by a consultative council made up of users of the service in each member state. 'They will be there to provide the truth. There will be no propaganda, I am very clear cut on that,' Mr Pinheiro said. His plan has still to be discussed by the Commission, and although the commissioner expects fierce resistance to the degree of openness, he claims backing from Commission President Jacques Delors. His chances of getting his reforms through should have improved after the outcry that greeted a report on EC information policy last week by an independent group of mostly public relations experts. The report, commissioned by Brussels last November, recommended advertising and propaganda techniques to sell European integration to citizens and journalists. 'What we want is quite different,' Mr Pinheiro said. This would include providing information on problems created by EC decisions and would oblige the Commission to admit mistakes. 'A certain humility is called for,' the former Portuguese foreign minister said. 'You can't pretend that whatever you do is blessed by some hidden God who prevents you from making mistakes.' As an example of how the new system would work, Mr Pinheiro said any steel region or company in the EC would be able to get full, comparative information and background on the controversial cuts in steel output now under discussion. 'Information has to be based on reality,' the commissioner argued, acknowledging that the EC had until now tried to hide the downside of programmes like the single market, which started up this year.

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery bid Takeover moves put some fizz into brewery stocks as JA Devenish soared 85 to 367p on an agreed Pounds 214.3m paper and cash bid from the rival Greenalls Group. But as many analysts flinched from a price they saw as high, the bidder, which is offering one Greenalls share and 394.5p nominal of convertible bonds for every two Devenish shares, or cash of 356.5p per Devenish share, saw its stock price slide 28 to 358p. Boddington, which has a 19.2 per cent stake in Devenish after a failed hostile takeover bid two years ago, bounced 13 to 286p. Whitbread, with a shareholding of 11 per cent in Devenish, saw its prices rise. The 'A' shares firmed 3 to 500p and the 'B' 10 to 980p. Brewery specialists had mixed views but ones largely tempered by caution over dilution of earnings in the short term on a highly priced bid. 'Christmas has come six months early for Devenish's and Boddington's shareholders,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities as he warned of a risk of Greenalls' move being 'scale for scale's sake'. Scale also concerned Mr Martin Hawkins at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, who feared that too large an operation can erode the important street level aspect of brewing operations. He did, however, believe that concern over dilution of earnings was exaggerated and was hopeful over medium-term prospects. Another beneficiary of Greenalls' move, and particularly the high price it placed on Devenish, was Grand Metropolitan, which is rumoured to be seeking a sale of its Chef and Brewer public houses. The high value may strengthen market talk of a GrandMet disposal of those pubs. GrandMet, which moved up 7 to 432p, was also still riding the wave of Tuesday's positive investment seminar.</p>

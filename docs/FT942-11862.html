			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US and Chile to take 'first step' to trade accord The US and Chile will take 'a first step' towards negotiation of a free trade agreement with the launch later this month of technical talks on investment, according to Chile's finance minister. Mr Eduardo Aninant yesterday said after talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that the US Congress might approve the Uruguay Round global trade accords in September. This would clear the decks for the US and Chile to conclude their negotiations in early 1995. It has not yet been decided whether Chile will join the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico, Canada and the US or directly negotiate a deal with the US. Mr Aninant said he wanted whichever route was 'the sooner, the neater, the better'. Mexico, which already has a free trade pact with Chile, and Canada have both signalled a willingness to admit Chile into Nafta. If a bilateral deal with the US is agreed, the understanding would be that Nafta membership would be the ultimate goal. Mr Aninant said the Clinton administration would ask Congress for new 'fast track' negotiating authority on trade matters this year along with legislation implementing the Uruguay Round. It had not yet been decided if Chile would be specified in the fast-track request, but some form of broad authorisation would be required for the formal talks. A free trade deal with Chile has raised little controversy in the US, but the Clinton administration's failure to find Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.5bn) needed for the Uruguay Round has fanned fears that Gatt legislation would be delayed until next year. Mr Aninant said the 'informal conversations' on investment starting later this month would be 'an exchange of information, a constructive dialogue'.</p>

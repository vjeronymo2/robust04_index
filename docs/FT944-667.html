			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures dipped lower. However, with the market closing at mid-day, trading volume was negligible, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 March contract was 3113 when pit trading came to an end at 12:10pm, down 12 points for a net rise on the week of 70 points. The premium to the cash market was 30 points or seven points over fair value. Stock options traded equally thinly with less than 11,000 contracts dealt. At 1244 lots, BTR was the most actively traded individual stock option.</p>

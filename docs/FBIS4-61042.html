			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Patriarch Aleksiy of Moscow and All Russia </F> by special correspondents Aleksandr Kalinin and Dmitriy Shevarov  "at the patriarch's residence in Moscow"; date not given: "I  Wish Everyone Spiritual Peace"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We  know how badly you feel about the schism in the Orthodox Church  in Ukraine and the expansion of Catholicism in Belorussia  [Belarus]. In recent days relations with Ukraine have reached  the danger mark. Do you intend to undertake any efforts to  avert schism in the family of Slavic peoples?    [Aleksiy] Schism is always a tragedy, always a sorrow. And  in church life schism is pernicious when people tear themselves  apart and differ mainly over political, not church issues. We  have felt keenly, and still feel keenly, what has happened in  Ukraine. But we are glad that, nevertheless, 5,000 parishes have  remained true to the church headed by Metropolitan Vladimir, and  only 400 have broken away. Moreover, many of these are actually  returning today, and a process of returning to the fold is under  way in various places. We have granted the Orthodox Church in  Ukraine and Belorussia autonomy in affairs of internal  administration, allowing for the fact that the Orthodox Church  exists in conditions of sovereign states and under the laws  adopted in these states; but the preservation of organic unity  is essential.    As for expansion, the Catholic expansion occurred several  years ago in the western oblasts of Ukraine; Polish Catholic  priests are very active in Belorussia. And were it not for the  process of the integration of Moscow and Minsk, the ideology of  the Western world would reach Smolensk.    We are not calling for crusades, but we must consolidate  Orthodox eparchies and revive the parishes which were destroyed.  Unfortunately, there were many parishes destroyed in Belorussia.  It was supposed to be the first atheist republic. And this plan  was systematically implemented. Therefore, the loss which  Belorussia suffered on the church plane is huge. And to restore  everything which was destroyed is not so easy. This is our task  -- to return people to their Orthodox roots. And then it will  be easier to counter the expansion which is going on.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] You have been talking with alarm for  many years about the wave of foreign missionaries and preachers  that has swamped Russia and the perniciousness of the spread of  sects, but the situation seems to be becoming increasingly  forlorn. It is obvious that the Russian Orthodox Church has  proved to be unprepared for such strong propaganda pressure from  all sides.    [Aleksiy] Unfortunately, we are not on equal terms with all  the foreign missionaries and priests who have flooded into  Russia today. I have received many letters appealing to me:  Surely you have someone you can send on to television; why do  we have to watch Korean, Japanese, and American priests on three  television channels on a Sunday? We have people to send, and we  have frequently raised the question of being granted airtime.  This question is moving forward, but it is difficult; meanwhile  foreign missionaries and priests have paid for airtime up to the  end of the year.    The archbishop of Vladivostok recently told me that  Vladivostok has been inundated with protestants from China,  Japan, and South Korea -- souls are being bought. The highest  price is a tanned fur coat; the usual is a humanitarian aid  package.    Once again we are not in an equal position. For instance, in  the Cathedral Church of the Epiphany in Moscow the only thing  that we are able to do for our fellow citizens for Easter is to  bake and hand out around 3,000 Easter cakes to the needy.

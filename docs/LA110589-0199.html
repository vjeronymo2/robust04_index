			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOICES OF THE PAST MAY HAUNT RAMS  </P> <P> The site of so many Rams crises through the years -- playoff losses in 1969,  1974, 1976 and 1988 -- provides an excellent setting for the latest one, a  three-game losing streak that could become four faster than a Ram blocker might  say, "There goes Keith Millard!"  </P> <P> It hasn't gotten any easier for the Rams here, just warmer. The Minnesota  Vikings used to freeze the Rams out of contention. Now, in the Metrodome, they  just shout 'em out.  </P> <P> Last year's wild-card playoff game against the Rams came complete with such a  deafening roar that quarterback Jim Everett had to use a silent snap count,  apparently only audible to Viking safety Joey (Dog Ears) Browner, whose two  first-half interceptions led to touchdowns in a 28-17 Minnesota win.  </P> <P> How important is it to hear in football? Last summer, the Rams dominated the  same Vikings, 24-14, in an exhibition game at Anaheim Stadium in which Everett  used the staggered count expertly, drawing Minnesota's fabulous front four  offside several times, while keeping the group off balance throughout the game.  </P> <P> The Rams have come to Minnesota this weekend in need of a win in the worst way,  but are armed this time with a new league rule designed to keep crowd noise in  check.  </P> <P> The Rams' John Robinson said something had to be done eventually.  </P> <P> He said of some stadium video scoreboard displays: "I don't know if it was  choreographed by somebody but those stadiums all flashed (NOISE!) to start it  and newspapers commented on it, and visiting coaches are asked about it. So  there was a clear environment established, and maybe this (rule) will make that  less."  </P> <P> Still, the Rams were working on their all-mime offense again this week.  </P> <P> "I don't think there'll be the same intensity," Robinson said. "It's not a  playoff game. But I do think we have to recognize it's an indoor stadium and  noise will be a factor."  </P> <P> Surprise, surprise, though, the Vikings haven't run away from the pack in the  National Football Conference, despite having acquired tailback Herschel Walker  from Dallas on Oct. 11. Walker was supposed to be the missing piece, but the  Vikings appear to have lost a few puzzle parts in the interim.  </P> <P> After Monday night's 24-14 loss to the New York Giants, Minnesota Coach Jerry  Burns gave quarterback Tommy Kramer the hook and will be starting Wade Wilson  against the Rams. Wilson, an NFC Pro Bowl pick last season, opened the season  as the starter before breaking a knuckle on his left hand against Tampa Bay on  Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Wilson was the the NFC's 12th-rated passer, with three touchdowns and five  interceptions, before he went down, so this wasn't like losing one of this  year's stars such as, say, Don Majkowksi.  </P> <P> The Vikings' offense, operated by the independent-thinking coordinator Bob  Schnelker, may need some rethinking. How can an offense with wide receiver  Anthony Carter and Walker in the same lineup be so ineffective?  </P> <P> Walker carried only 12 times against the Giants, which is one popular theory,  and Carter, a capable one-man wrecking crew, has only six receptions in his  last three games.  </P> <P> "We haven't been getting him the ball and he hasn't been dominating the game as  he's got the capability of doing, but the fault lies not always with him,"  Burns said of Carter. "Sometimes he runs an excellent pattern and the  protection breaks down, or we can't get the ball to him, because sometimes he  might not be running the pattern. There's so many problems that surround our  ineptitude."  </P> <P> Remember, Mike Lynn, the Vikings' general manager, admitted that the Walker  trade was a short-term proposition for his team, and that anything less than  the Super Bowl the next few years would prove the trade a mistake.  </P> <P> The pressure's in your court, Mr. Burns.  </P> <P> "I don't think you'd be in the game if you weren't either used to it,  anticipated it, or expected the pressure," Burns said. "I'm sure John Robinson  isn't going to be happy batting .500. He wants to get in there, get to the  playoffs and win the Super Bowl. That's the object of everybody. The pressure's  there to do it. If we don't do it this year, it's going to be next year. If you  do it this year, there's pressure to repeat it again. What the hell you going  to do?"  </P> <P> Play ball, and let the crises begin.  </P> <P> "I think they're going to come in here hungry as hell, and mean as hell," Burns  said of the Rams. "I think we're in the same position, we're both 5-3, and both  hopeful to win our division. If we don't get there, we're fighting for a  wild-card spot. It's a critical game for both teams."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Henry Ellard has led the Rams in receiving in nine consecutive regular-season  games and, with 51 catches through eight games, is on a pace to break his own  franchise record for receptions in one season, 86, which he set in 1988. . . .  Sack update: The Vikings are averaging 7.2 sacks a game the last four weeks and  lead the league with 42. Defensive tackle Keith Millard leads the league with  13. . . . The Rams have just 16 sacks for the season. They had 39 through eight  games in 1988. . . . The Rams are averaging 2.6 yards a rush the last three  weeks, after averaging 4.6 the first five weeks.  </P> <P> . . . In case you haven't noticed, Tony Slaton and Duval Love are sharing the  right guard position, equally, alternating every third series. After a long  summer holdout, Love still hasn't regained the starting position he won after  Dennis Harrah's retirement in 1987.  </P></p>

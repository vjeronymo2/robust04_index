			<p>Election:               Socialists Lead But Face Coalition Problems                                  SUMMARY      Leading in all the major polls on the eve of the May  parliamentary election, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) is  apparently poised to make a remarkable comeback despite its  liabilities as the successor of the former ruling communist  party's reformist wing.  Since the party is expected to fall  short of an absolute majority and lacks close allies, however, it  is by no means certain that it will lead the new government  coalition.                                 END SUMMARY      All recent polls indicate that the MSZP, whose popularity has  climbed considerably over the past year, is the strongest party  going into the 8 May election and will emerge as the victor after  the second round of balloting on 29 May.  According to a  Hungarian Gallup Institute poll, based on data collected the  middle of March, of those who indicate a party preference--29  percent are undecided--31 percent would vote for the MSZP, four  percent more than in the previous month (Magyar Hirlap, 5 April).  Two other major public opinion research organizations, polling  those who say they are "certain" to vote, also put the MSZP in  first place.  According to the Szonda Ipsos organization's March  findings, 23 percent of those "certain" to vote choose the MSZP  (Magyar Hirlap, 25 March), while the Median organization's March  data show that in the same category, the MSZP has the support of  21 percent (Heti Vilaggazdasag, 2 April).      While none of these polls give the MSZP an overwhelming lead,  their data tend to confirm that the party has a clear advantage  over its nearest competitors.  All three polling organizations  indicate that the two liberal parties, the Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ) and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz)  are running neck and neck, well behind the MSZP:      -- According to Gallup, among those who have a party preference,  Fidesz has 15 percent support and the SZDSZ 14 percent (as  opposed to the MSZP's 31 percent).      -- According to Szonda Ipsos, Fidesz and SZDSZ each have 10  percent support among those who are "certain" to vote (compared  to the MSZP's 23 percent).      -- According to Median, the SZDSZ and Fidesz have 11 and 9  percent support respectively among the "certain" voters (compared  to 21 percent for the MSZP).      The big loser appears to be the main party in the present  governing coalition, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF).  The  three polling organizations are virtually unanimous in reporting  drastically decreased support for the MDF--which in 1990 got  close to 25 percent of the vote in the first election round and  ended up with 42 percent of the parliamentary seats--with Gallup  giving the MDF 10 percent, Szonda Ipsos 9, and Median 7.  Two  other parties are given a good chance of reaching the 5 percent  threshold necessary for entering parliament: the Independent  Smallholders Party (FKGP) and the Christian Democratic People's  Party (KDNP).      Polling Reliability      Although polling agencies in Hungary did not forecast the  decisive victory of the MDF in the second round of balloting in  1990, they were fairly successful in assessing the parties'  relative standing prior to the vote.  According to a table in the  14 December 1993 issue of the weekly 168 Ora, the major polling  organizations operating then--Gallup, Median, and the Public  Opinion Research Institute (a now defunct organization, many of  whose leading personnel currently work for Szonda Ipsos)--all  correctly identified the MDF and the SZDSZ as the leading  contenders, all correctly predicted that the MSZP would be  soundly defeated, and all correctly predicted that Fidesz and the  KDNP, along with the MSZP, would be the smallest parliamentary  parties.  Even discounting probable improvements in polling  procedures since then, it is likely that the pollsters are now at  least roughly accurate in gauging the parties' relative strength.      Moderate Spectrum      While the alignment of parties in the new government is expected  to change, the new parliament will comprise essentially the same  parties that were voted into office in 1990.  With the possible  exception of the Smallholders, an agrarian party that has tended  to be fractious and unpredictable, all the parties that have a  good chance of gaining entry to parliament fall into a relatively  narrow political spectrum, all advocating integration with the  West and privatization, despite their bitter debates over the  process and pace of change.  The polls all indicate that  extremist parties such as the far right Hungarian Justice and  Life Party of Istvan Csurka or the far left Hungarian Workers  Party--the remnant of the Kadarist Communist party--are unlikely  to surmount the five percent threshold for entry to parliament,  although Magyar Hirlap noted on 21 January that Csurka may have  some "hidden" support that goes beyond the "less than one  percent" registered by Szonda Ipsos.  According to the polls, the  only minor parties that have some chance of gaining enough votes  to enter parliament are the Entrepreneurs Party, the Republic  Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Agrarian Federation-  -all moderate parties close to the political center.      Coalition Scenarios      Although the MSZP will probably have considerably more  parliamentary seats after the election than the next largest  party, it is highly unlikely to have a majority and will almost  certainly face serious problems when it tries to form a  government, because it has no natural allies among the other  parties.  It is quite possible, as a journalist noted in the 20  April issue of the centrist daily Magyar Hirlap, that the  socialists, the liberals, and the parties of the present right-  of-center coalition will each have one third of the seats,  creating a situation in which "it will be difficult to form" any  government.  Since it would be virtually impossible for the MSZP  and the MDF to bridge their differences--Horn said that it would  be "equivalent to deceiving the electors" if the MSZP formed a  coalition with the MDF (Nepszabadsag, 1 April), while Prime  Minister and MDF leader Peter Boross has said that his party  would "by no means" form a coalition with the MSZP (MTI, 13  April)--the formation of a governing coalition would seem to  depend on the willingness of the liberals to cooperate with  either the left or the right.  Even though a left-liberal or a  right-liberal coalition appears to be the most likely outcome,  forming either coalition will be a difficult feat:      MSZP-SZDSZ-Fidesz      The party that is most likely to enter a coalition with the MSZP  is the SZDSZ, but it is certain to drive a hard bargain.  Aware  of its difficult position, the MSZP has indicated that it is  prepared to make major concessions to the SZDSZ, possibly even  giving up the post of prime minister.  Asserting that his party  does not rule out supporting SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate  Gabor Kuncze after the election, MSZP chairman Horn has said that  it is "not a key issue" for his party "that the leader of the new  cabinet should come from the MSZP" (Magyar Hirlap, 5 January).  Recently, prominent MSZP economic expert Laszlo Bekesi also  indicated that his party "does not exclude" supporting a prime  minister "from outside the party."  Calling Kuncze "an excellent  person," Bekesi said that he saw no objection to Kuncze as prime  minister (168 Ora, 19 April).  However, the MSZP and SZDSZ may  not by themselves win a majority of the parliamentary seats,  which they would need to form a government.  Moreover, the SZDSZ  has indicated that being given the post of prime minister would  not, by itself, be enough to draw it into the coalition as a  junior partner.  Signaling a hardening of the SZDSZ's position,  at a press conference on 1 April SZDSZ campaign chief Balint  Magyar "stressed" that the SZDSZ would take part "only in a  coalition that has a liberal majority" (Magyar Hirlap, 2 April).      As long as the SZDSZ insists on a liberal majority in the  coalition, Fidesz, the other main liberal party, could be in a  position to make or break a socialist-liberal coalition, even if  the MSZP and SZDSZ  alone could form a majority government.  Except in the unlikely event that a small centrist party such as  the Entrepreneurs Party gets into parliament and helps the MSZP  and SZDSZ form a majority, the MSZP's prospects will depend to a  great extent on Fidesz--and the top Fidesz leadership is openly  hostile to the MSZP.  After the wing of Fidesz that tended to  pull more to the left went over to the SZDSZ last fall as the  result of acrimonious intraparty struggles, Fidesz chairman  Viktor Orban made it increasingly clear that although his party  is highly critical of the right of center MDF government, it  considers the post-communist left to be less acceptable  politically than the right.  Orban said in a recent interview  that it would be "impossible" for his party to join a coalition  with the MSZP because the Hungarian public would "not forgive"  the SZDSZ and Fidesz, which were the "most radical anti-communist  parties" four years ago, for abandoning their principles.  Responding to the interviewer's comment that there is a "war of  messages" between him and MSZP chairman Gyula Horn--whom Orban  holds to account for taking part in the armed suppression of the  1956 anti-communist uprising--Orban accused the MSZP of  threatening to take "revenge" on "everyone, especially us."  At  the same time, Orban acknowledged that there is some "difference"  between him and one faction of Fidesz regarding cooperation with  the MSZP (Magyar Hirlap, 20 April), suggesting that he may be  under pressure to consider entering a coalition with the  socialists if the liberals gain significant concessions.      SZDSZ-MDF-Fidesz-KDNP      Although there is deep animosity between the SZDSZ and the MDF,  they still might join forces against the MSZP.  With the rise in  the MSZP's popularity, the MDF has reluctantly come to the  conclusion that the SZDSZ is the lesser of two evils.  Contradicting an earlier statement by MDF spokesman Karoly  Herenyi that the MDF would not join a coalition with either the  MSZP or the SZDSZ "under any circumstances" (Magyar Nemzet, 28  December 1993), MDF parliamentary group chief Ferenc Kulin said  that a coalition of the two liberal and two conservative parties  is "possible" (Magyar Nemzet, 14 January).  Moreover,  Prime  Minister and MDF leader Peter Boross recently made a distinction  between his party's two main rivals, saying that while he has  "serious reservations" about the SZDSZ, he does not reject it  outright as a prospective coalition partner as he does the MSZP  (MTI, 13 April).  For its part the SZDSZ has not declared that it  is willing to cooperate with the MDF, but it appears ready to  consider alternatives to the socialists.  Prime ministerial  candidate Gabor Kuncze acknowledged in the April issue of the  monthly Kritika that the SZDSZ has "reservations" about the MSZP,  saying that his party is concerned that the MSZP's close ties to  the powerful trade unions would undermine economic reform and  that MSZP rule would encourage the "dangerous" spirit of  "revenge" that has developed among former communists.      While it is unlikely that the MDF and SZDSZ alone would gain  enough seats in parliament to form a government, if they managed  to come to terms with each other they would probably be able to  draw Fidesz and the KDNP into a liberal-right coalition.  Although Defense Minister and MDF chairman Lajos Fur has  complained that Fidesz speaks "lightly" of the MDF, making it  difficult to find a "basis for cooperation" (Magyar Hirlap, 20  April), both Fidesz and the MDF have indicated that they are  striving to overcome their distaste for each other in the  interest of cooperating against the left.  Similarly, although  the KDNP has recently tried to "distance itself" from the MDF  (Magyar Hirlap, 19 March) and has balked at the MDF's attempts to  speed up privatization, for the most part the KDNP has been a  reliable coalition partner of the MDF and shares many of its  policy positions, making it highly probable that MDF-KDNP  cooperation will continue.      Implications      It is entirely possible that the MSZP will not lead the next  Hungarian government, even if it wins the election.  Although  strains between the SZDSZ and Fidesz--caused mainly by  disagreement over whether the liberals should be closer to the  left or the right--have weakened the liberals, if they manage to  draw together they may well be in a position to determine whether  Hungary's next government is a left-liberal or right-liberal  coalition.  Because the SZDSZ is likely to emerge as the stronger  liberal party in the elections--polls show that SZDSZ supporters  are more likely to vote than supporters of Fidesz (Magyar Hirlap,  5 April) and that fewer voters reject the SZDSZ completely (Heti  Vilaggazdasag, 2 April)--it may end up with the post of prime  minister in either a left-liberal or right-liberal scenario.  Although the MDF would be less likely than the socialists to give  up the post of prime minister in the interest of forming a viable  coalition, it might yield if SZDSZ moderates, supported by  Fidesz, are persuasive in urging anti-left cooperation.     In any case, SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze  appears to be well suited to conducting his party's negotiations  with either the left or right.  The pro-MDF paper Pesti Hirlap  (16-17 April) has said that Kuncze was chosen by the SZDSZ as its  candidate because he is a "presentable and even likable person in  the center who can be accepted by the country's public,"  suggesting that he may have considerable strength as a  conciliator.  It is far from certain, however, that he--  or anyone else--will be able to hold together Hungary's next  governing coalition, which is likely to include far more  disparate political elements than the present government.

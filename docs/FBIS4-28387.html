			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Talks to reopen the border with  Cambodia's Poipet township scheduled to begin yesterday have  been postponed indefinitely, Col Ongkon Thongprasom, head of the  Border Coordinating Office, said yesterday.    Col Ongkon said he had been informed by Banteay Meanchey  Governol Gen Duong Khem of the request to postpone the talks  because his side has not yet completed the relevant paper work.    The Khlong Luk-Poipet checkpoint has been closed since April  9 following fighting between Cambodian government forces and  Khmer Rouge guerrillas. In most cases, shells and gunfire  strayed across the border threatening Thai traders.    Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaiyasit yesterday met Thai traders  to inform them of the postponement of the talks. He also told  them of a plan to renovate Ban Rong Khlua market which was  destroyed by fire on April 8.    The checkpoint closure has hit the border trade and doubled  consumer prices to Cambodians in Battambang, Siem Reap and  Banteay Meanchey provinces.    Informed sources said that most traders wanted the border  reopened so that trade could resume as usual. Some influential  traders however wanted it closed indefinitely in order that they  could engage in smuggling.    Thailand last month told Cambodia it wanted the checkpoint  to  be permanent with both countries stationing immigration officers  on a permanent basis. It also wanted Cambodia to guarantee  safety and security in the region of the checkpoint and to agree  to the setting up of a special committee against crime along the  border.</p>

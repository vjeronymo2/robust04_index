			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Convention hopes dented in flat trade Wall Street HOPES that the Republican convention in Houston would boost the stock market were dented yesterday when a lack of investor interest left share prices little changed, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.05 down at 3,324.89, having spent the day moving within a narrow range. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.83 at 420.74 and the Nasdaq composite 0.71 easier at 572.47. Turnover on the New York SE was typically light for a midsummer session at just 152.8m shares. Before trading opened, analysts had suggested that prices would start firmer on the belief that President Bush's popularity could gain a big boost from the week-long convention. There was also talk that the possible renewal of conflict in the Gulf might also help the president's poll standings. These hopes never translated into buying, and with many institutional investors staying out of the market during the height of the summer doldrums, share prices drifted uneasily in light trading. Analysts, however, noted that the ex-dividend trading of several large stocks meant that the Dow was a few points lower than it might have been on an ordinary day, and that another sharp fall in bond prices kept optimism in check. The one bright spot was the airlines sector, which attracted strong demand after Mr Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley, a leading industry analyst, was reported to be recommending that now is the best time to buy airline shares, in view of the generally negative coverage of the industry. Among those receiving a boost were UAL, up Dollars 2 at Dollars 109 1/4 , Delta, Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 51 7/8 , and USAir, Dollars 1/2 ahead at Dollars 13 1/2 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost an early gain to end a net Dollars  1/8 down at Dollars 59 1/8 . On the American Stock Exchange, amid heavy selling Wang Laboratories plunged Dollars  7/8 further to Dollars  3/4 in turnover of 3.2m shares on speculation that the troubled company will not get an agreed cash injection from IBM that could have been worth as much as Dollars 75m. IBM was up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 88 5/8 . Eljer Industries jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 10 after a court ruled in its favour on an appeal of a judgment about insurance coverage for a polybutylene plumbing system. American Health fell Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 26 after the company restated its second-quarter results from a profit of 54 cents a share to a loss of Dollars 2.07 in the wake of a Dollars 54m writedown. Canada TORONTO showed a bias to higher levels in continued moderate trading. The TSE 300 index finished 11.3 firmer at 3,379.8, while rises outpaced declines by 286 to 231 after volume of 22.2m shares. PWA, off 4 cents at CDollars 2.90, rejected a merger proposal from Air Canada and said it would again seek an alliance of its Canadian Airlines International unit with American Airlines. PWA also reported a second-quarter loss little changed at CDollars 34.4m. Air Canada, which late on Friday announced wider second-quarter and six-month losses, shed 20 cents to CDollars 4.30. TransAlta Utilities, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 14 1/8 , posted slightly higher six-month earnings.</p>

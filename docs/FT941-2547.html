			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: The Pinter spell is cast again / Review of 'The Birthday Party' Among the many and haunting ambiguities of Harold Pinter's plays is this uncertainty: how real are these characters? The dream-logic (or nightmare-logic) with which they converse (or fail to converse) has long been famous, but as we watch a Pinter play we start to be unsure about whether they themselves are meant to be naturalistic or not. Realistic figures suddenly appear surreal. Ordinary people turn, for a while, into caricatures, and then back again. They may well undergo more than one such change. Watching them, we never know for long where we are; and that is part of Pinter's spell. Watching Dora Bryan in the National Theatre's new staging of The Birthday Party - a brilliant piece of casting - we constantly shift in our take on Meg, the married landlady she plays, and thereby also in our take on the whole household she runs. Bryan has been famous, for decades now, for investing silly provincial working-class female characters with a certain cartoon-like brightness. She brings to them her own funny energy and quavery nervousness, and makes them as memorable as characters in Dickens. What is marvellous in her Meg is that the play makes you sense strange and dark causes for her customary fretfulness, fussiness, and stupidity. Even her brightness starts to register as a kind of escapism. And yet she is still funny. Petey, her husband, explains to her that the show currently at the Palace has no music or dancing. 'What do they do then?' she asks in the manner of one who is just learning that there is no Santa Claus. 'They just talk,' he replies. Bryan, registering this information, observes a properly Pinteresque pause. Then she just says 'Oh.' Her eyes (downcast but wide with alarm), mouth (sinking), and voice (tremulous) all convey the same uncomprehending distaste; and the audience guffaws. We laugh partly because Pinter is joking at the expense of his own kind of theatre, of course, but also because of how the single word 'Oh' sums up Meg's narrow mind. A show without singing or dancing belongs to that part of the world - like the mysterious wheelbarrow of which she is terrified - which she chooses to avoid. Meg's little fears are just part of The Birthday Party's strange fabric of menace and terror and evasion. She insists that it is the birthday of her lodger Stanley, though he insists it is not. She throws a party for him, though he spends most of it in blank non-participation. Later she says it was a lovely party, though during it he physically threatened both her and the play's other female character, Lulu. He in turn is threatened, and finally abducted, by two strange visitors, Goldberg and McCann (both of whom have their own fits of fright). Sam Mendes, directing, heightens Stanley's occasional violence to women; and he makes Lulu the kind of cartoon bimbo blonde we encounter in Dennis Potter's fictions, with breasts pulled up so high by her bra that they point upwards like telescopes. Mendes has assembled all the ingredients for a first-class staging, not all of which had coalesced on the first night. Anton Lesser traces all the various moods of Stanley - the play's principal victim - with convincing skill, but makes an altogether less forceful impression than Bryan. As Goldberg, the play's most menacing figure, Bob Peck certainly has force; he neatly conveys the character's elements of suave deceit; and, after cuddling the buxom Lulu on his lap a while, he adds a hilarious touch of embarrassment, getting her to get up and crossing his legs. But his manner is too elaborate; his is an unrelaxed performance that keeps signalling its every effect to us. Trevor Peacock (Petey) and Nicholas Woodeson (McCann) are both impeccable, and Woodeson's grasp of the play's fluctuations of threat and alarm is very fine. Emma Amos gives Lulu a nicely bizarre comic brightness to match Bryan's Meg. (They both remind us how close Pinter can sometimes seem to Joe Orton.) Tom Piper's designs not only create an effectively realistic 1950s interior, but also introduce it with a drop-curtain of this town's sandy seaside beach (where Petey works) and frames this particular house against a background of other identical houses. This is just one house among many. Is this house normal or abnormal? Who is to say what goes on in the others? In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Xie Fei, secretary  of the Guangdong provincial party committee, said on Wednesday  [13 April] that his province anticipates more investment from  Japanese entrepreneurs.    In his meeting with a Japanese economic delegation, he said  that the investment conditions in Guangdong have been greatly  improved and the market enlarged. "Guangdong looks forward to  expanding economic and technological cooperation with Japanese  counterparts," the secretary said, adding that the prospect for  future cooperation is bright.    The top party official of the province noted that since  China  adopted the policies of reform and opening up, Guangdong's gross  domestic product (GDP) has increased by 13 percent annually over  the past 15 years, with the GDP in 1993 up 21 percent over 1992.    Guangdong now has three special economic zones, four  state-approved economic development zones, six new- and  high-technology development districts and four free trade zones.    There are eight airports and a dozen express highways,  including those under construction, in the province.    Xie Fei said that in 1992, foreign investment in Guangdong  amounted to 4.8 billion U.S. dollars, and in 1993, investment  was 9.6 billion U.S. dollars. The two years' total is almost  equal to that in the previous 13 years.    More overseas investment would help tackle Guangdong's newly  emerged problems in its efforts to link up the local economy  with the world's, Xie said, noting that overseas management  experience and skills are also needed.</p>

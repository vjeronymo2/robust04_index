			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover: defeatism and short-termism Sir, So Rover is to be sold to BMW, just a few years after it was 'rescued' by British Aerospace. The statement from BAe, at the time of purchase, that there was much synergy between aerospace and car manufacture ranghollow then and subsequent statements that Rover was a core business ring hollow now. All the talk about BMW investing in Rover and possible resurrection of the 'great names' from the past is probably just that. It is designed to minimise the outcry. Take Ford and Vauxhall as examples. Gradually, the engineering and design skills have been moved out of Britain and into Germany/US leavingBritain as little more than a location for low-cost assembly. The trouble with low-cost countries is that there is always another one coming up behind and companies have few qualms about shifting production elsewhere to remain competitive. Nobody is denying that the history of Rover/BLMC/BL/BMC is littered withmistakes and gross negligence, nor that much remains to be done (three of its models - the 800, the 200/400 and the Metro - are overdue for replacement). Nevertheless, Rover appears to be sound and worthy of further investment. That it should be starved of such investment by BAe shows up the latter's problems more than it does Rover's. I make no apology for saying that Rover should remain underBritish control. Once again, the failings of this administration and of the City are shown up. The mindless pursuit of short-term profit and cash to satisfy the latest five-year corporate plan and 'vision/mission statement' is distinctly at odds with managing for the long term. It is left to the Germans, the French and the south-east Asians not only to have a long-term vision but to holdto that vision and to ensure that, come the end-game, they will be around. Regrettably, Britain will not be and I despair of our prospects. S W de Looze, 2 Gables Close, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 0PR</p>

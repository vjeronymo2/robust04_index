			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Secrecy of activity in Civil service FURTHER proposals for removing unnecessary secrecy about the activities of civil servants and ministers are expected to be announced before the end of July, Ivor Owen writes. This was revealed in the Commons yesterday when MPs gave an unopposed second reading to the Right to Know Bill. The move was against the advice of Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for identifying areas of excessive government secrecy. The bill is a private member's measure, introduced with cross-party support by Mr Mark Fisher, the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.</p>

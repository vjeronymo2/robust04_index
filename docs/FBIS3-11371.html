			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from Tuxtla Gutierrez, </F> Chiapas State]    [Excerpt] We are now going to hook up with Juan Carlos  Santoyo, Radio ACIR's special correspondent in Chiapas. Right  now he is in Tuxtla Gutierrez and has all of the day's  information, including statements by the governor of Chiapas.  We will also discuss with him today's statements in the media  by Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN], who commented on the possible political aspirations of  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas.    Subcommander Marcos said Camacho Solis can, if he so  desires,  declare himself a presidential candidate, but Marcos warned that  this would hurt his credibility. In addition, Marcos has sent  Camacho Solis a message saying the EZLN is not willing to be  used as a political stepping stone. Is that about it, Juan  Carlos?    [Santoyo] Yes. Good evening everyone. Without a doubt,  these statements by Subcommander Marcos show there is a certain  degree of uneasiness in the negotiating process. We have  reports that indicate the second round of internal EZLN  negotiations are due to begin on Saturday or Sunday in the  Lacandona jungle to decide the EZLN's reply to the government's  proposal as presented by Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis  during the first stage of the dialogue.

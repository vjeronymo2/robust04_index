However, final decisions adverse to the recipient are not issued until it is clear that the matter cannot be resolved through further exchange of information and views. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Under various HHS statutes or regulations, recipients have the right to appeal from, or to have a hearing on, certain final decisions by HHS awarding agencies. (See, for example, subpart D of 42 CFR part 50, and 45 CFR parts 16 and 75). Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section set forth the standards HHS expects its member agencies to meet in issuing a final decision covered by any of the statutes or regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The decision may be brief but must contain: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A complete statement of the background and basis of the awarding agency's decision, including reference to the pertinent statutes, regulations, or other governing documents; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Enough information to enable the recipient to understand the issues and the position of the HHS awarding agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The following or similar language (consistent with the terminology of the applicable statutes or regulations) should appear at the end of the decision: ``This is the final decision of the (title of grants officer or other official responsible for the decision).

ADR often is effective in reducing the cost, delay and contentiousness involved in appeals and other traditional ways of handling disputes. ADR techniques include mediation, neutral evaluation and other consensual methods. Information about ADR is available from the HHS Dispute Resolution Specialist at the Departmental Appeals Board, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC 20201. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subparts G&hyph;AA_[Removed] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Russian Prime-Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin today met the leaders of the United Technologies  Company, U.S. to discuss aspects of a series production of the  Russian wide-body airliner IL-96M with American Pratt &amp;  Whitney  engines.    The discussion centered around the organisation of joint  Russian-American enterprise on the basis of AO Permskiye Motoriy  (Perm Engines Joint-Stock Company) for the mass production of an  aviation engine. The new engine, based on the Russian PS-90  will be installed on the IL-96M liners capable of carrying 380  passengers and on other new Russian aircraft.    The Russian-American engine will be built using the best  technologies designed in the two countries. Ten IL-96M  airliners equipped with jointly produced engines have already  been ordered by 10 foreign and 30 Russian airlines. The new  engines are expected to be considerably cheaper and  technologically more advanced than the Pratt &amp; Whitney  engines.</p>

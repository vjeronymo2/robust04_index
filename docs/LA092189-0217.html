			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEER CLEANUP OF 21 COUNTY BEACHES SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY  </P> <P> Officials expect 500 to 600 people to pitch in and clean local beaches in  California's Coastal Cleanup Day, a statewide effort sponsored by the  California Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Regional Sanitation District is coordinating the cleanup  locally. The state has targeted 21 public beaches in Ventura County, from  Rincon Beach south to Point Mugu and the Los Angeles County line.  </P> <P> Last year Ventura County volunteers picked up 17,863 pounds of garbage, nearly  one-fourth of the total collected statewide, said Pandee Leachman, who is  coordinating the county's cleanup effort this year.  </P> <P> "It's not that our beaches are more polluted than those in other counties, but  that people in Ventura County really are concerned about their beaches and are  willing to help clean them up," she said.  </P> <P> The cleanup is the focal point of California's monthlong "Coastweeks"  celebration, a statewide campaign for public awareness of coastlines, beaches  and wetlands and the environmental dangers facing them.  </P> <P> The cleanup will take place from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday. Those interested  in participating can call (805) 658-4632 for information.  </P></p>

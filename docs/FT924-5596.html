			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Farmers clash with riot police in Paris MORE than 50 French police were injured yesterday in clashes with demonstrators as French farmers massed in Paris to protest at the European Community trade agreement with the US. CRS riot police fired tear gas and made repeated charges at militant farmers who in turn let off fireworks and threw iron bars and crowd-control barriers. Five police were taken to hospital and 12 protesters were arrested. By last night the crowd was dispersing. Earlier about 3,000 farmers had converged on the Esplanade des Invalides and the nearby National Assembly as parliament debated whether to reject the accord. Workers at the National Assembly peered nervously out of windows behind the safety of police barriers. Trading was interrupted on the Paris Stock Exchange when farmers broke in, unfurling banners and setting off firecrackers. Coachloads of farmers from all over France poured into the Invalides throughout the afternoon. They chanted anti-American slogans and carried banners emblazoned with 'Tomorrow, US food, Japanese cars, Asian textiles and French job losses' and 'No to the US green army'. An elderly farmer stared forlornly at the scarred shields of the riot police. 'Whatever happens, French farming is finished,' he said. 'It's not a question of whether we'll be ruined, but of when. That's why we can't give up without a fight.' There were other demonstrations elsewhere in France. Farmers in Clermont-Ferrand burnt piles of tyres outside the local McDonald's fast-food store in protest against the US-owned group and the British flag was burnt in Boulogne and Calais. Farmers blockaded the home of Mr Andre Bourgeois, Belgium's agriculture minister, late yesterday and set tyres alight in the street in protest at the trade deal, Reuter reports from Brussels, quoting a local news agency. Paramilitary police moved the 200 farmers and their 50 tractors.</p>

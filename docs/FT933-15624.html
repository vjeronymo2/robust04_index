			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / People: Nuclear role for Heller Jonathan Heller, previously head of European development at Prudential Investments, part of the UK insurer, has become the secretary-general of the Brussels-based European Atomic Forum, FORATOM, the European nuclear industry's trade body. He combines this with his own consultancy practice, advising life insurance and fund-management companies, actuaries, brokers, accountants and software companies on how to develop their presence in continental Europe. While acknowledging that this combination of activities is 'a little unusual', he points to the precedent of Georges-Yves Kervern, director of strategy at UAP, France's largest insurance company, a one-time leading figure in the French atomic establishment.</p>

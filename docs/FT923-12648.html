			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Battle for town rages despite ceasefire order: The latest Bosnia peace moves SERB and Moslem forces exchanged artillery fire at the embattled Bosnian town of Gorazde yesterday long after the leader of Bosnia's Serbs had ordered a ceasefire there. Serbs besieging the town were ordered to cease fire by Mr Radovan Karadzic, who is in London for the European Community-sponsored peace negotiations chaired by Lord Carrington. But according to Reuter newsagency reports, the order appeared to have little effect on the ground. Sarajevo radio editor Zoran Pirolic said he had been in contact with Gorazde by short wave radio more than six hours after the London announcement and fighting continued unabated. Serb forces were meeting fierce resistance, he said. Gorazde is a town of 37,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them Moslem. EC diplomats in London said Serb irregulars were besieging the town as part of a plan to 'ethnically cleanse' the region and annex eastern Bosnia to Serbia. Mr Karadzic told reporters that he was proposing a l4-day truce agreement by the three sides at the London negotiations, which he said would enter a third day today. Despite differences and the fact that all three sides did not meet, Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC mediator, said: 'I am not that pessimistic.' Mr Karadzic denied Serb forces were involved in deportations, expulsions, and killings, despite numerous eye-witness accounts. 'What we want is a Bosnia-Hercegovina which is based on three constituent states. With this in mind, we support the current EC negotiations,' he said. He said these three ethnic states would consist of Moslem, Serb and Croat regions. Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister, said he wanted a unitary state, adding that the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic lines would fail to take into account mixed marriages, as well as those who perceived themselves to be Bosnian. 'What Serb extremists are doing in Bosnia today is what the Nazis did in world war two. Identity and ethnicity are being imposed on innocent civilians,' he said. In an open letter to Lord Carrington, and Mr Cutileiro, Mr Silajdzic asked the EC to stop the flow of weapons into Bosnia from neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats and a close ally of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, said he would support the EC Lisbon plan of March 9 which stipulated that Bosnia would be composed of several national units, but that the current borders of the republic would remain intact. However, EC diplomats in London said Croatia and Serbia were working on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina between them, as witness the recent declaration of a Croatian-run state within a state in western Hercegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- The Food Agency on Monday  [29 March] showed reluctance to take legal action against a  Tokyo-based electrical appliance discount chain store which on  Sunday sold unblended brand-name domestic rice in defiance of  its instruction to stop the sale. Agency officials did not  disclose the reason for the apparent reluctance to file a  criminal complaint with law enforcement authorities.    Jonan Denki Co. sold some 12 tons of domestic rice at one of  its stores in Tokyo without a government license. The Food  Agency had repeatedly warned the chain to call off the plan,  saying that selling rice without a license is a violation of the  Food Control Law.    Over 2,000 people rushed to buy the rice, which sold out  within three hours.    The officials said Monday the sale was regrettable, but they  did not say the agency would file a criminal accusation against  the company. They said the agency will "persistently continue"  to instruct Jonan Denki to stop such sales.    The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the  village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture. It plans to sell the  remaining rice at another of its Tokyo stores next Sunday.    The government has imported foreign rice to make up for  shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since February  many consumers have queued at shops selling domestic rice.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Fingers crossed as Digital gets to grips: The US computer maker's struggle to halt a string of losses They used to call it the 'Digital handshake': arms folded, index fingers extended in either direction, indicating that responsibility lay anywhere other than with the individual concerned. Today fingers are pointing at the senior management of Digital Equipment, the struggling US computer manufacturer, as it prepares to announce its fourth consecutive set of annual losses, including roughly Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.04bn) of charges to cover 20,000 job losses, cutting 10m sq ft of manufacturing and office space, and asset write-offs. The Massachusetts company is also preparing to abandon matrix management in favour of a simpler system conferring greater accountability for decisions. How serious are Digital's problems? Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of the newly constituted computer systems division, underlines the urgency: 'The company must return to profitability in the next two quarters. We are not running out of money - we have a strong balance sheet - but if we fail, the confidence of our employees, our shareholders and our customers will sink to a point that will be very serious for us.' The fear is that continuing losses and a failure of confidence will eventually pitch the company into a financial death spiral. Crucial to the resuscitation of the group is the performance of Mr Pesatori's division, essentially the heart of Digital's traditional business. Medium and large computer systems are losing money because the cost of supporting large engineering, manufacturing and sales operations remains out of line with anticipated rev-enues. Mr Pesatori, 53, joined Digital last year from Groupe Bull of France, to revitalise the PC operations. Following the surprise resignation in April this year of Mr Edward Lucente, head of worldwide sales and marketing, Mr Pesatori was promoted to his present position, essentially number two to chief executive Mr Robert Palmer and carrying most of the responsibility for Digital's recovery strategy. Digital's traditional computer business, a source of strength in the 1980s, is now its biggest headache. Since May, Mr Pesatori and other senior executives have put together a five-point plan to enable the division to break even by the end of this financial year. If it works, he argues, the company will be comfortably in profit through its other activities. His analysis reads like a catalogue of the mistakes Digital has made over the past years: First, he says, the division has to focus on important markets: 'We have been all over the place in engineering and in the industries we served. We have not focused on our strengths.' Second, there has to be an new emphasis on low-cost, high volume products, the bread and butter of the new computer industry. 'Our engineering capabilities have become isolated from the market. We excelled in niche markets, but niche players employ 5,000 people, not 90,000.' Third, Digital has to restore a credible distribution policy based on a reliable network of dealers, systems integrators and value added resellers (VARs). The company had an excellent network in the 1980s, but threw it away because of fears about loss of account control and smaller shares of the gross profits. Now the plan is that only the largest 1,000 customers worldwide will be serviced directly. The remaining 7,000 will be handled by VARs and dealers. In the UK, for example, only 100 of the company's 800 customers are still serviced directly. Fourth, accountability. The new management structure should ensure that executives are responsible for their decisions. Mr Pesatori notes: 'We have to open up a complex, layered structure. We have to penetrate robust layers of management that are resistant to change.' Fifth, profitability. Mr Pesatori believes there is no magic in the business model for the modern computer industry: 'You have to have a 40 per cent gross profit margin; general administrative expenses should not be above 22 per cent and research and development should not cost more than 12 per cent of revenues.' It is generally acknowledged that its overheads and engineering costs are twice as high as some rivals'. The dilemma for Digital is the decline of revenues from its traditional, proprietary systems while customers ponder moving to newer, lower cost industry standard systems. The company was slow to embrace standard systems, then shot itself in the foot with a panicky campaign to persuade customers to move quickly to the newer technology. Mr Pesatori hopes to stabilise the migration, creating a more predictable and manageable loss of revenues from Digital's proprietary hardware. Nobody discounts the difficulty of the task Digital's management is attempting: 'Between here and there is a tremendous implementation problem,' admits Mr Pesatori, 'but we have contingency plans and our strategy is based on very pessimistic estimates of our revenues.' Digital has been its own worst enemy since its troubles became apparent four years ago; this latest offensive may be its last chance to avoid a spiral of decline.</p>

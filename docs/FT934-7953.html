			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Plan for European security conference soon THE European Union plans to host a European security conference in the first half of 1994, aimed at settling latent frontier and minority problems in eastern Europe, diplomats in Paris said yesterday, writes David Buchan. Plans are far advanced for the 12 members of the EU to use their Brussels summit next month to launch the initiative for a European 'stability pact', first broached several months ago by France, the diplomats claimed. They described the plan as 'an exercise in preventive diplomacy', designed to deal with unresolved ethnic and border problems in east European countries that 'have a vocation to join the European Union or be very closely associated with it', rather than existing conflicts in the Balkans or the Caucasus. Invitations to attend the conference would probably go to members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europea (CSCE), including the US, Canada and Russia, but excluding those in the Caucasus and central Asia. However, the geographical scope of the 'stability pact' would be limited to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and the three Baltic republics. The planned EU initiative would take the form of an opening conference, followed by bilateral negotiations between East European countries on 'good neighbourly' accords. Such agreements would form part of the 'stability pact' which, if all went well, could be adopted by a winding-up conference in 1995. The final document would be deposited with the CSCE. The Belgian presidency of the EU had sounded possible participants in the conference and drawn a generally favourable reaction, the diplomats claimed. Hungary was described as being the most enthusiastic about the idea because of the possibility of improving the lot of the large ethnic Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia. A key doubt had been the possibility of whether Russia would want to deal with the issue of the large ethnic Russian minorities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania bilaterally with those new Baltic republics. But President Boris Yeltsin was said to have recently confirmed to Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who first raised the stability pact idea in April, that Russia would negotiate minority issues in the Baltic region in a multilateral forum. The stability pact is designed to be on the Twelve's first joint foreign policy initiatives since their Maastricht treaty came into force this month. According to diplomats here, the Twelve hope the prospect of entry into the EU will serve as a political incentive for East European countries first to settle differences among themselves. 'But the stability pact is not a strict pre-condition for East European countries joining the EU,' said one diplomat.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> WHIMSY, MAGIC CREATE WONDROUS 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND'  </P> <P> The Peter Pan Players' production of "Alice in Wonderland" has enough whimsy  and magic to make Lewis Carroll proud.  </P> <P> The troupe's staging at Iglesia Community Park in Laguna Hills follows Alice's  fantasy romp through day-glo daisies, past a smiling Cheshire cat, a bellowing  queen and a break-dancing king. Directed by Saul Siedman, the show includes 58  local children, some of whom shared characters with another cast that took over  after intermission.  </P> <P> The one-hour show, targeted for very young children, featured Courtney Weber  and Monica Bromberg as Alice, Kimberly Reed as the White Rabbit, Angela Gage as  the Queen of Hearts and Nathaniel Dawkins as the King.  </P> <P> Children in the audience giggled through the show's flights of fancy, including  Brett Levisohn's delirious Mad Hatter, the Cheshire cat's glow-in-the-dark  smile and the shrinking Alice. After a bite of the mushroom, Alice disappeared  behind a fungus and emerged as a girl half her size (played by 3-year-old  Danielle Martino).  </P> <P> The play was choreographed by Jill Kaplan, costumes were created by Jena  Bouvion and Patricia Reed and scenery was designed by Helen Danielson.  </P> <P> The show is sponsored by the Orange County Department of Harbors, Beaches and  Parks.  </P> <P>  "Alice in Wonderland" continues this weekend at Iglesia Community Park, 24671  Via Iglesia, Laguna Hills. Performances at 1 and 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m.  Sunday. Tickets: 50 cents for mat seating and $1 for chairs. Information: (714)  830-8318.  </P> <P> </P></p>

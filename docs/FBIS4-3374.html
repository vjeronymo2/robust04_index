			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A five-day working  conference on mainland-Taiwan economy, presided over by the  State Council, ended in Beijing today.    Communist Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao  Shi, Hu Jintao, Li Lanqing, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Luo Gan and  Wang Zhaoguo attended the conference.    Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted that the reunification  of  China is the historical mission of the Chinese people and it is  the will of all Chinese people and an irresistible historical  trend.    He said that in recent years, the economic relations across  the Taiwan Straits have been developing rapidly and have a sound  basis.    He stressed that enhancing the economic exchanges and  cooperation on the two sides of the straits will promote common  development and common understanding and facilitate the  development of economic relations of the two sides and  reunification of the country.    Premier Li Peng said that the economy on the two sides can  complement each other.    He said that the economic cooperation between the two sides  benefit the people both on the mainland and Taiwan.    He called for improvement in the investment environment on  the mainland and stressed the importance of infrastructure  construction and cultural and ethical construction.    He said that the State Council will enhance coordination of  the development of mainland-Taiwan economic relations and in due  time solve any problems in the sector so as to promote the  healthy development of the mainland-Taiwan economic relations.    Thus, he said, Taiwan businessmen's investment in mainland  will fit in with the mainland's industrial policy and the  businessmen will be able to make profits.    He said that only through economic cooperation would the  mainland and Taiwan achieve common prosperity.    After reviewing work on the mainland-Taiwan economic  relations in recent years, the conference noted that under the  guidance of the basic principle of "one country, two systems" of  the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the State  Council has formulated and adopted many effective policies and  measures in recent years.    With the efforts of local governments and departments,  Taiwan  compatriots gradually lost their misgivings about trade and  economic activities with mainland counterparts. They broke  through the Taiwan authorities' various limitations and  contributed to the development of mutually complementary and  beneficial economic and trade relations and common prosperity of  the two sides of the straits.    Now all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities  have  Taiwan businessmen-funded enterprises.    The conference pointed out that the mainland's economic laws  and regulations concerning protecting Taiwan businessmen's  lawful rights and interests are improving.    It noted that the rapid economic development, establishment  of a socialist market economic structure and the vast market on  the mainland constitute a unique opportunity for the continuous  economic development in Taiwan.    The conference pointed out that while Taiwan  businessmen-funded enterprises are encouraged to operate well on  the mainland, the comprehensive economic exchanges and  cooperation will be promoted.    The conference called on the mainland and Taiwan to enhance  cooperation in opening up international markets and cooperation  in agriculture and technological industry.    It also called for direct exchange of mail service, trade  and  air and shipping services between the two sides across the  Taiwan straits.    The conference stressed implementation of the law on  protection of the investment of Taiwan compatriots, solution to  problems in consultations on information, policies and laws in  economic activities for Taiwan businessmen, raising work  efficiency and improving service quality so as to provide more  convenient conditions for Taiwan businessmen.

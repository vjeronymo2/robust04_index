			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide by </F> an unidentified FOCUS correspondent; place and date not given:  "The Military's Game Is Over"]    [Text] [FOCUS] What will you do first when you return to  Haiti?    [Aristide] First of all, there must be reconciliation with  my  enemies and a judicial reform to reestablish justice. At the  moment, one can still buy justice. Without money you will not  get any justice.    [FOCUS] The military will not give up so quickly after the  "Tontons Macoutes" have been reorganized.    [Aristide] Judging from my seven months in office, it is  certainly possible to rule Haiti democratically. You can see  this alone by the fact that after my election, those Haitians  who fled under Duvalier returned. I claim that at the moment,  99.95 percent of the population support me. Many have fled  abroad again and are just waiting to be able to return.    [FOCUS] Nevertheless: Are all the military officers and  other  terror troops not a constant threat to you?    [Aristide] Many of these people are abused by the Army  Command. They are just afraid that they themselves will be  killed. As soon as they realize that there is no point in  fighting against the world, they will stop.    [FOCUS] Will you put the military leaders on trial?    [Aristide] No. First of all, I will issue a political  amnesty. I have committed myself to that on the basis of  Article 147 of our Constitution.    [FOCUS] What role does the United States play in the Haitian  conflict?    [Aristide] With Haiti, the United States has one of the  poorest countries right on its front door. Almost 76 percent of  our foreign trade is conducted with the United States. In  addition, more than 1 million Haitians live in the United  States, who send about $300 million back to Haiti. If the  United States, together with Haiti can revive democracy, this  would be a positive signal for the entire region. In the end,  the security of this hemisphere depends on what is happening now  in Haiti. Just think of Venezuela. There the military wanted  to stage a putsch along the lines of Haiti, but, fortunately,  they failed.    [FOCUS] Did you not expect more help from the United States  and the United Nations after your ouster?    [Aristide] We have decided in favor of a non-violent path.  With this, we have gained respect.    [FOCUS] But recently you demanded a military  intervention....    [Aristide] No, I have never spoken up in favor of that. I  still think of a solution with the help of the international  community. We must finally separate the police from the Army,  an Army that consists of 7,000 men but devours 40 percent of the  entire budget. At the moment, there are 10 soldiers for 10,000  Haitians, but only 1.8 doctors. There is no sense to that.    [FOCUS] Recently, you spoke of a "surgical intervention"....    [Aristide] I just wanted to say that the international  community should not just discuss the matter but also do  something. Only a total embargo can shorten my people's time of  suffering. Unfortunately, this was imposed only recently. Now  the military's game is over.</p>

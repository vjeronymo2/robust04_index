			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IMF urges cut-off point for benefit A CUT in the length of time during which unemployment benefit is paid in Britain is urged by the International Monetary Fund, which also warns that the UK is facing the deepest recession of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The IMF's suggestion of the benefits limit is a part of a package of measures intended to curb the UK's high level of wage increases. In its World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that action is needed to increase the responsiveness of British wages to market conditions and to promote labour mobility. It also suggests 'increasing training programmes and improving the functioning of labour exchanges' to prevent a rise in unemployment in the recession similar to the sharp increase witnessed in the early 1980s. Britain must maintain monetary and fiscal policies 'conducive to a substantial downward adjustment in the growth of wages,' the IMF says. While warning of the depth of the recession, the IMF says there is 'little scope for a significant reduction in UK interest rates' unless this is fully justified by sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and clear signs that underlying inflation is falling. IMF projections point to a sharp 2.1 per cent drop in UK gross domestic product this year. Growth next year is forecast at around 1.9 per cent. However, unemployment will keep on rising in 1992 and is expected to average 8.5 per cent of the labour force next year compared to 7.5 per cent this year and just 6 per cent in 1990. Britain faces several years of slow growth, it indicates. Between now and 1996 the IMF expects GDP growth in the UK will lag slightly behind the average annual increase of 2.1 per cent which was seen in the 1980s. The IMF did not elaborate on its suggestion for a cut-off point on unemployment benefit. The government said yesterday that it was keeping the impact of the benefit system on the labour market under review but insisted that it was not considering any proposals to cut the duration of unemployment benefit payments. Basic unemployment benefit, currently Pounds 41.40 a week, is paid in Britain for up to a year, but after that individuals who have no savings can claim indefinite income support at only a slightly lower weekly rate. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said: 'It would be wrong to think that a cut in the period of unemployment benefit would, of itself, bring lower unemployment.' Mr Blair endorsed other comments in the report, saying: 'I would agree with the IMF in the importance of better training, a better employment service and, in particular, we believe it is right now to adopt a temporary work programme to prevent the unemployed becoming long-term unemployed.'</p>

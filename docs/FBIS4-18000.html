			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan April 29 TASS -- A ceasefire in the zone of  the Karabakh conflict is not observed, ITAR-TASS learnt here on  Friday from Manvel Sarkisyan, adviser of the Nagorno-Karabakh  foreign minister.    He noted that the Karabakh side agreed on Thursday [28  April]  to cease fire during the last night, provided the mediator --  the Russian Federation -- receives a similar reply from the  opposing side -- Azerbaijan.    In the meantime, there was no confirmation of such a reply,  Sarkisyan said. Besides, the diplomat stressed, the Azeri side  massed combat materiel and weapons near the north-eastern border  of Nagorno-Karabakh and was regularly shelling the Mardakertskiy  district from artillery during the last night and this morning.    Despite the cloudy weather, the situation is very tense at  that section of the front, noted the adviser representing his  ministry in Armenia.</p>

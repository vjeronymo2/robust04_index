			<p>BFN     [Text] At this time, the KBS station has sent a relay  broadcasting car to Myongdong street in Seoul to hold interviews  with people regarding the present situation on the Korean  peninsula, as well as their feelings on the ROK Army's readiness  to deal with North Korea. We have news from reporter Kim  Han-chu regarding the people's feelings on national security.  [Reporter Kim] This is reporter Kim from Myongdong. Now,  Myongdong Street, where a darkness is deeply closed, is  overflowing with citizens, who want to enjoy their early summer  time in the middle of the city. The street is very active as  ever, and, also, is very crowded with customers, who visit  stores, as well as many cars that visit there. I feel the  citizens' calmness from their walk on the street. The Myongdong  street is very active and as calm as ever compared with the  overseas atmosphere that has been rapidly changing as a result  of the North Korean nuclear issue. However, citizens do not  seem indifferent to the North Korean nuclear issue. I will have  conversations, for a moment, with citizens who walk on the  street regarding their feelings on the present situation, which  is recently being called a crisis situation based on rumors of  war. How are you? People say that the present situation on the  Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that war  may break out on the peninsula?    [Unidentified man-on-the-street #1] I don't think that a war  can break out. Also, I don't think that North Korea or the  United States are reckless. It is important for North Korea to  maintain its system. Therefore, North Korea will not easily  invade South Korea.    [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula,  what do expect will be the result?    [Unidentified man #1] I think that we can easily defeat  North Korea. As one a military reservist, I, in my view, think  that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces combat capability is more  superior to that of North Korea.    [Reporter Kim] They say that people are very indifferent to  the present situation on the Korean peninsula. What do you  think?    [Unidentified man #1] I also think that people are too  indifferent to it. I think that the key reason for people's  indifference to the present situation is due to the military  leadership's intervention into politics in the past, or due to  politicians' abuse of national security for the preservation of  their power. Anyway, I think that we should be fully ready to  deal with North Korea in order to avoid a war.    [Reporter Kim] I will have an interview with another man.  You came to the Myongdong street with your family. I have one  question for you. People say that the present situation on the  Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that a war  may break out?    [Unidentified man #2] You mean a war. I don't think that a  war will break out.    [Reporter Kim] Do you have a special reason for such an  opinion?    [Unidentified man #2] If a war breaks out, we can win a  victory because of our strong national power. Anyway, I don't  think that a war will break out on the peninsula.    [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out, what do you expect its  result will be?    [Unidentified man #2] I don't know about the result.  However, because of our strong national power, we can win a  victory.    [Reporter Kim] I will have more interviews with people.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified man #3 ] I think that Kim  Il-song will never break out a war as long as he is not crazy,  because we should live together on the peninsula.    [Unidentified woman] I don't think that a war will break  out. I think that our national power has been strengthened  enough to avoid it.    [Unidentified man #4] I think that because the North Koreans  are aware that we are strong, they cannot break out a war.    [Unidentified man #5] I believe that it is highly possible  that a war will break out, because North Korea faces economic  difficulties.    [Unidentified man #6] I don't think that North Korea can  easily start a war because of Japan or the United States. [end  recording]    [Reporter Kim] Most people believe that a war will not break  out. Of course, the people's opmistic view that a war would not  break out originates from their ardent desire that a war must  not break out on the Korean peninsula.</p>

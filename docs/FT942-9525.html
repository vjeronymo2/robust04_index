			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Major in his bunker You have to admire John Major's insouciance. He is the prime minister of Britain, and has made a pig's ear of it. Is he despondent? Not on your life. He is getting quite bolshie, as witnessed by his recent declaration, outside 10 Downing Street, that if any usurpers from his own party had a mind to topple him, there he would be, togged up and waiting - ready to repel them. You can judge the perilousness of Major's position by the fact that virtually his only supporter in the media is dotty Woodrow Wyatt. There can be no danger in calling Wyatt dotty, given the eclat with which he prods and punches those around him - even fellow columnists on The Times. On Tuesday, Wyatt accused poor old Smoggie, William Rees-Mogg, of making a 'daft suggestion' - replacing Major as prime minister with Michael Heseltine and appointing Major foreign secretary. (On austere newspapers, columnists do not swipe at each other like that. They treat each other respectfully, with a wintery smile or a nod; there is certainly no rudery.) So worried was I by Wyatt's latest encomium on John Major's behalf that I rocked up to Downing Street to see Major myself, as I do occasionally. These visits are always jolly. We enjoy a large supper of bacon, chops, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and fried bread. And then I try to persuade Major to walk the plank - to quit gracefully, and silently, for the good of the country. He wasn't there. But the visit was not wasted, for I came to hear of the extreme measures being taken by the PM to turn 10 Downing Street into a fortress. My informant was a cove named Major Julian Summerbee, allegedly loaned by the army to help the prime minister dig himself in. Readers of a literary bent may imagine there to be similarities between Major Julian Summerbee, whom I met at 10 Downing Street, and the major in John le Carre's latest novel, The Night Manager - Major Corkoran, assistant to le Carre's arms dealer, Dicky Roper. Perhaps there are similarities, though that is not something on which I could comment. When I encountered him, Major Summerbee was smoking a Turkish cigarette and studying various lists. 'Hello, love,' he said. 'You seem forlorn and lost.' 'Am I?' I riposted. 'I am looking for the prime minister.' 'Not here, sweetheart,' said Summerbee. 'He 'coptered off an hour ago. Probably something and nothing.' 'So what do you do?' I asked. He replied: 'Readying for the siege, dear. I'm an expert on survival. You are talking to the man who wrote the survival manuals for the SAS, the paras and the Royal Marine Commandos. Traps. Tools. Weapons. Wilderness first-aid. Minimising water loss. Ropes and knots, of course. Signalling and navigation. Coping with Mother Nature. Terrain. Movement. Shelters. I'm a pan-specialist, actually: tropical, desert, temperate - polar, if you like. They are all the same at heart, heart.' 'What are those lists you've got?' He puffed out a smoke-wreath. 'Weapons and traps, old love. I'm prioritising our plans. You would be amazed, dear, at the lack of readiness in this building. Here we are, about to be assaulted by crazed and vengeful Tories, and no thought at all has been devoted to weapons and traps.' 'Traps?' 'Deadfalls, mainly, triggered by tripline release action. Also a few spear traps. They are quite delicious. I also want snares and noose sticks, though time is running short.' 'Weapons?' 'Bows and arrows, lover. I've stipulated yew staves 4ft long, tapering from a central width of 2in to  5/8 in at the ends. There's a yew table upstairs which the servants are cannibalising. For the string, always use rawhide. Arrows are easy, heart: 2ft long,  1/4 in wide, smooth and straight as possible, notched at one end, with arrow flights made from feathers, paper, light cloth or trimmed leaves. Arrow-heads? I can see you are gasping to hear. Answer: tin, flint, bone or hardwood. Personally, I love tin.' I reeled into the night. The determination with which John Major is digging himself in had caught me unawares. As I retreated down Downing Street, Major Summerbee blew a kiss and puffed another smoke-wreath.</p>

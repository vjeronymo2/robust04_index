			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Pound gets lift from Bank governor's comments Sterling rallied against the D-Mark in early trading yesterday on the back of comments by Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, writes Philip Coggan. Although the pound weakened in the afternoon, it still finished in London at DM2.4452, up from Friday's close of DM2.4379. Speaking in Dubai, Mr George said UK interest rates would have to be increased if the economy did not start to slow down of its own accord. The UK's gross domestic product grew by 4.2 per cent in the year to the third quarter, according to figures released on Friday. Mr George's comments revived expectations of an early UK interest rate rise, which had dwindled last week on the back of low infla-tion data and weaker than expected retail sales statistics. Short sterling futures lost some of their recent gains, with the March contract fall-ing six basis points to 92.95. The pound did not make any progress against the dollar, ending the day at Dollars 1.5681, from Friday's Dollars 1.5690. But on a trade-weighted basis, sterling edged up to 79.9 from 79.7. Yesterday's modest strength follows the pound's continued weakness during November. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'There was a big build-up in sterling positions in advance of the last Clarke/George meeting but expectations of a rate rise were disappointed.' In his view: 'An over-exaggerated move in the market has been corrected.' Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro Bank, said that since the interest rate differential between the UK and US has disappeared sterling has dropped from Dollars 1.64 to Dollars 1.57. 'The market is reluctant to believe that UK/US interest rates can drop to parity and sterling can remain stable,' he added. The US dollar edged up against the D-Mark but slipped slightly against the yen, in what is expected to be a quiet trading week ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The only significant US economic statistic will be tomorrow's publication of durable goods orders for October. In London, the US currency closed at DM1.5594, against DM1.5539 on Friday, and at Y98.375 from Y98.525. It finished in New York at DM1.5564 and Y98.30. The dollar has generally been much stronger against the D-Mark than the yen in recent weeks. On the cross-rate, the D-Mark fell yesterday to Y63.07, from Y63.40 on Friday, its lowest level for around two months. 'This D-Mark weakness is an unwinding of the euphoria in October on the re-election of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. 'Expectations remain strong that the German authorities will move to a variable rate repo when they meet on Thursday and this may keep the D-Mark subdued ahead of the meeting,' said Midland's Mr Geddes. 'Meanwhile, whenever the dollar rallies, we are seeing heavy sales for yen by Japanese exporters.' Mr Norfield thinks that 'most people do not think the dollar is going to fall to DM1.50; therefore, there is a bias to test the upside. Were the dollar to hit the DM1.58 level, that would be potentially decisive, since it would threaten to break out of a downtrend that had been in effect since January'. The Australian dollar reached its highest point since June 1992, climbing above 76 US cents. The currency has been boosted this year by commodity prices, which firmed again last week, and yesterday it gained on expectations of another interest rate rise. Australia already has 'one of the highest real yields in the industrialised world', according to IBJ's Mr Hannah. The Italian lira and Irish punt held up well in the face of political difficulties. The lira was unchanged against the D-Mark at L1,025 after a poor performance by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party in local elections. The punt edged up to IPounds 1.013 against sterling, from IPounds 1.014, in the wake of Saturday's election of former finance minister Mr Bertie Ahern as leader of Fianna Fail. The Bank of England gave the UK money markets help of just Pounds 52m at established rates, compared with a forecast shortage of Pounds 150m. Overnight rates moved within the range of 5.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.</p>

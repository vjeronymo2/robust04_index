			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISES BRING SYLMAR PROJECT CLOSER TO REALITY  </P> <P> A giant industrial park proposed for a Sylmar hillside moved a step closer to  reality Tuesday when a city committee and the developer agreed on several  compromises.  </P> <P> But the committee deferred action on the most serious debate -- whether  developer and landowner John Symonds should be allowed to sandwich offices and  manufacturing buildings on land between two earthquake faults.  </P> <P> The 262-acre project would be on rural land north of Foothill Boulevard and  east of the Golden State Freeway. It would include 33 houses, a park and a  child-care center in addition to up to 2 million square feet of industrial  space.  </P> <P> Larry Friedman, a city planner, told members of the Planning and Land Use  Management Committee that it is unwise to allow building between fault zones  "if it can be reasonably avoided."  </P> <P> The Planning Commission decided in September, 1988, to bar development on that  land, which encompasses about one-third of the project and lies along the  northern edge, near the Angeles National Forest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seismic Experts  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the committee, said  seismic experts should be asked to testify before the City Council rules on  development in the fault zone. Rather than hold the entire appeal in committee,  Bernson said it would be sent to the City Council with no recommendation on  that issue.  </P> <P> The committee sided with the developer in his appeal of the Planning  Commission's limit on building height to 45 feet -- three stories. Mark  Armbruster, speaking for Symonds, said that in some parts of the project,  industrial buildings could reach as high as six stories, about 75 feet, without  intruding on neighbors' views.  </P> <P> "Those areas would be the areas farthest away from homes and least visible,"  Armbruster said.  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who, with Bernson, represents people living nearest  to the proposed development, agreed to the higher heights "as long as there's  open space around them, not wall to wall."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Group Representatives  </P> <P> Representatives of various Sylmar homeowner and civic groups attended the  meeting and supported the compromises. Most had opposed the development when it  was first proposed more than three years ago, but in the interim they have  worked with the developer and city officials to make the project more  acceptable.  </P> <P> During those negotiations and through the city review process, Symonds has  agreed to preserve large expanses of open land, include access for horse  riders, use wrought-iron fences instead of chain-link and finance several road  improvements to reduce the effect of truck and commuter traffic caused by the  industrial park.  </P> <P> Bernardi applauded Symonds' approach, saying, "The cooperation with the  developer has been excellent."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sergey Yushenkov, secretary of the faction Russia's  Choice, has disapproved of the decision of Finance Minister  Boris Fedorov to leave this faction of the State Duma and to  join the deputies group "Union of December 12" (leaders --  Aleksandr Braginskiy, Irina Khakamada, and Viktor Bushmin).    During his conversation with journalists Yushenkov  underlined  that "there is an ethical aspect in Fedorov's decision because  he has been elected on Russia's Choice federal list and has not  informed members of the faction about his decision."    Commenting on rumors stating that Gennadiy Burbulis also  intends to leave the Russia's Choice faction, Yushenkov  indicated that Burbulis faces the same ethical problem because  Burbulis was also elected to the State Duma from the list of the  Russia's Choice bloc. There will be quite another situation if  the Russia's Choice faction itself adopts a decision to be  divided into two factions in order to receive an additional vote  in the State Duma Council and in order to help the deputies  group Union of December 12 receive the necessary number of  members (not less than 35) so this association can be registered.    Yushenkov reported that a session of the bureau of Russia's  Choice faction had discussed this issue but Sergey Kovalyov,  Boris Zolotukhin, and several other prominent members of this  faction opposed its division into two factions. As a result of  this discussion, Yushenkov reported, the faction has increased  the number of its members from 76 to 78. However, now its  number is 77, as Fedorov has left the faction.    Yushenkov underlined that there exists such a point of view  which was expressed yesterday that after Yegor Gaydar leaves the  government, many members of the faction would deem themselves  free of any obligations to Russia's Choice and can adopt a  decision to leave this faction.    The same day prominent lawyer Andrey Makarov, a member of  Russia's Choice, reported to INTERFAX that he had left the  faction and joined Union of December 12. Makarov refused to  explain his move, stressing that an official message would be  made public on Tuesday evening.</p>

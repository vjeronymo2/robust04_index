			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Lecturers set to adopt new stance in contracts dispute The annual conference of the Natfhe lecturers' union, which starts tomorrow, could signal a turning point in the union's long and disruptive dispute over new contracts. Earlier this week the union announced that members had voted decisively against re-electing the general secretary, Mr Geoff Woolf, in a result that was widely interpreted as a rejection of his handling of the contracts dispute. The eventual winner, Mr John Akker, built his campaign around opposition to what he saw as poor handling of the dispute. He said the union would make a 'new start' to the contract negotiations under his leadership. Natfhe changed its negotiating tactics from national to local bargaining after the High Court ruled earlier this year that its ballot of members over a national strike had been unlawful. At its conference, it is expected to unveil an agreement with one large college to introduce contracts which the union considers acceptable. However, other principals believe the college's contract could fall foul of government regulations and lead to a reduction in its grant. The Department for Education yesterday said the introduction of new contracts was going well. Further education minister Mr Tim Boswell said: 'I hope that Natfhe will now reconsider their campaign of industrial action and return to constructive dialogue with the Colleges' Employers' Forum.' The new contracts, which employers have been trying to introduce for more than 12 months to allow greater flexibility after the removal of further education colleges from local authority control last year, are fiercely opposed by lecturers. They would cut annual holiday entitlement in half and add an hour to the working day. Two smaller unions, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, and the Association of College Management, have signed national agreements to the contracts. The conference takes place in Southport, Merseyside, and ends on Monday.</p>

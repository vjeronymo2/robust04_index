			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Bundesbank rejects further rate cut FURTHER cuts in short-term interest rates could lead to a 'stop-go' policy for the German economy, risking higher long-term rates and endangering jobs, the Bundesbank warns in its latest monthly report. There was no sense in making counter-cyclical cuts in rates in an attempt to revive the economy, the report adds. The weakening of the western German economy became clearer towards the end of last year. Gross domestic product in the final quarter fell by an adjusted 1.5 per cent from the previous three months and by 0.5 per cent against the last quarter of 1991. In manufacturing the seasonally adjusted production figure for the fourth quarter was 5.5 per cent down on the comparable period in 1991. Separately, the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin said yesterday that west German GDP was likely to fall by a real 1 per cent in the first quarter this year against the last quarter of 1992. But the Bundesbank said there was no cause for undue pessimism. Manufacturing industries were not representative of the economy as a whole: construction and services in general were doing better than those sectors hard hit by falling exports. It said that in contrast to many other countries Germany was not suffering the delayed effects of overheating in the late 1980s. Shares and property prices had not collapsed in Germany, nor were there problems in the financial system. Long-term interest rates were far more important for German industry than the short-term rates set with reference to the Lombard and discount rate which the Bundesbank cut two weeks ago today. The discount rate was cut by 25 basis points to 8 per cent and the Lombard rate by 50 basis points to 9 per cent. Over 80 per cent of bank credits in Germany were provided on a long-term basis, the Bundesbank pointed out. These rates had fallen 'extraordinarily sharply,' dropping 1.5 per cent to under 7 per cent since September, the Bundesbank said. This fall reflected the markets' confidence that the German central bank would ultimately be successful in its battle against inflation, which reached an annual rate of 4.4 per cent in January.</p>

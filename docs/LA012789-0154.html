			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Speaking of Daum-Johnstown, its troubled parent -- Dallas real estate investor  Southmark Corp. -- is in the news again.  </P> <P> The company still owes a whopping $2 billion after going on a spending spree in  recent years.  </P> <P> Many company watchers suspect that Southmark may soon start selling some of its  jewels, like J.M. Peters Co. Inc. -- the immensely profitable Newport Beach  home builder of which Southmark is majority owner -- and perhaps even less  stellar performers such as Los Angeles-based Daum-Johnstown.  </P> <P> Or Southmark itself could be acquired. Southmark says that it has had inquiries  from "many organizations," some of them -- the company suspects -- looking for  fire-sale prices.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Peters says the home-building company still hasn't been told  what its fate will be. A small chunk of Peters is already traded publicly, and  Southmark put the rest on the block last year, but a deal with Denver's MDC  Holdings Inc. fell through.  </P> <P> Arthur G. Weiss, the new Southmark chairman, said in a letter to shareholders  Thursday that he had begun reviewing the company's tattered financial condition  and that any decision on the sale "must await the completion of the  examination."  </P> <P> But it apparently was rumors of a sale at Daum-Johnstown last fall that helped  push the 50 or so employees in Orange County to defect en masse to Scher-Voit.  </P></p>

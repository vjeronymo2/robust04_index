Russia Handles Sarajevo Crisis in Seven Days"]    [Text] The West was unable to resolve the Sarajevo crisis  in two years. Moscow has handled the task in seven days.    However two weeks ago the U.S. leadership and NATO circles  did not even think of Russia being able to make a decisive  contribution to resolving the Bosnian crisis. This was manifest  particularly clearly when the ultimatum was being delivered to  the Bosnian Serbs. Admittedly, the West suddenly had a thought  and authorized the British prime minister during his visit to  Moscow to slightly ease the awkwardness. Paris LE FIGARO wrote  the following on this score: "The task facing the head of the  British Government is no easy one: He has to find a compromise  that will enable Moscow to save face and once again enter into  dialogue with the West regarding a settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina after the double insult for Russia of the  NATO ultimatum and Bill Clinton's statement to the effect that  the Kremlin's position does not pose a 'major problem.'"    You can see from Western press articles how formal Major's  mission was in this respect. The same LE FIGARO wrote in an  article headlined "Yeltsin's Dilemma: Between the West and  Serbia": "For Moscow it is a question of the need to find the  elusive solution [prizrachnoye resheniye] that would enable it  not to alienate the West and not betray the 'Slav brotherhood'  linking Russia with the Serbs. That is why, after the  announcement of the NATO ultimatum, Russian leaders have made --  so far with relative success -- a series of attempts to avoid  inflicting air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs' positions."    Moscow's involvement did not, however, prove at all  "elusive." As soon as the ultimatum was adopted the Russian  Foreign Ministry gave notification that it regards it as  "illegitimate and not in line with UN decisions," and during a  conversation with John Major Boris Yeltsin spoke in even more  forthright terms: "Some people are trying to resolve the  Bosnian issue without Russia's involvement. We will not permit  that."    Bill Clinton was forced to promise Boris Yeltsin 11 February  during a telephone conversation that finally took place after  several abortive attempts that he would persuade the Muslim  government of Bosnia not to quit the negotiating process in  Geneva in exchange for the Russian president trying to persuade  the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery and tanks from  Sarajevo.    There is every indication that the U.S. President made this  promise lightly since he had little faith that Yeltsin would  indeed have any success in this endeavor.    However, Moscow's involvement proved more than vigorous, it  proved crucial.    Thursday morning Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's  special representative, gave Radovan Karadzic, leader of the  Bosnian Serbs, and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic a  personal message from Boris Yeltsin.    The text of the message indicated that Moscow had pondered  everything down to the psychological nuances.    Treating Serbian leaders with respect, the Russian president  made no demands on them. He asked them to withdraw their heavy  artillery and tanks from Sarajevo and in exchange proposed that  400 airborne troops from the Russian battalion of the UN  peacekeeping forces stationed in Eastern Croatia would take up  the positions they would vacate in the village of Lukavica near  the Bosnian capital. (Incidentally, the Russian word "prosba"  [request] sounds very mild in Serbian, where it is "molba").    The Serbs realized straightaway that the Russians had  proposed to offer their lives as a guarantee of peace in  Sarajevo. After all, if NATO forces inflict air strikes, the  bombs could land on Russian airborne troops and that would  immediately bring a fundamental change in the situation  throughout Bosnia.    President Clinton could not contain his amazement, primarily  at Yeltsin's decision to send his peacekeeping contingent from  Croatia to Sarajevo (his administration's spokesman Myers  announced this).    Nor was it coincidence that Moscow did not say a single word  about the NATO ultimatum. What is more, when the Russian Air  Force Press Service announced Saturday 19 February that Russian  airborne troops would not be redeployed until NATO lifted its  ultimatum, the Russian Defense Ministry immediately issued a  rebuttal, saying that the Russian Air Force Press Service had  overstepped its authority.    At 1500 hours Thursday the Serbs gave their consent to  Yeltsin's proposal. Friday 18 February they began withdrawing  heavy arms from Sarajevo, and at midday on Saturday Russian  airborne troops began moving from Croatia to Bosnia. They  arrived on the spot Sunday evening after a day's march through  the mountains in heavy snow.    As it is customary to say in such cases, there are no  winners or losers in Sarajevo, peace is the victor. However,  this popular expression is hardly appropriate here. Things are  not like that in politics.    The Serbs have clearly won by withdrawing their heavy arms  from Sarajevo: Now in the event of renewed explosions in  Sarajevo no one wil be able to blame Serb artillerymen or tank  personnel for this.    Having obtained peace in their capital, the Muslim  leadership  of Bosnia-Herzegovina has lost an opportunity to lift up its  hands to the West asking it to inflict air strikes as punishment  on the "infidels" who are allegedly annihilating civilians.    The West has obviously won; it does not now have to get  embroiled in the adventure of outright military confrontation  with a staunch and bellicose people, with the threat of creating  a second Vietnam for itself (whether this applies to France or  the United States). Henceforth efforts can be focused solely on  finding a truly peaceful means of settling the conflict.    Moscow has unexpectedly found itself ahead; for a week it  demonstrated to the international community the exceptional  diplomatic potential of a great power.    So, many people have gained, although not everyone.    But it is nonetheless hard to get away from the impression  that this turn of events is not to everyone's liking.    At first Moscow's initiative was greeted by the West with  obvious (and seemingly sincere) relief: It would not have to  become embroiled in an adventure involving air strikes Monday  and put its head on the block.    The point is that, according to Western intelligence  services, the Serbs' armed formations in Bosnia have a large  number of long- range fixed-site antiaircraft missiles with a  range of up to 40 km and an even larger number of  shoulder-launched infantry missiles for use against aircraft.    What is more, the Americans well remember that in Vietnam  the  U.S. Air Force incurred its greatest losses not from missiles  but from massive antiaircraft fire from the ground, against  which the electronics that they used successfully in Iraq are  powerless. In order to avoid losses from that kind of fire  fighter bombers would be forced to fly at a higher altitude, but  the accuracy of the aggressor's fire is dramatically reduced as  a result of that kind of maneuver.    However, when the first shock of Moscow's resounding  diplomatic success had passed in the West, the United States  seemed to switch to ways of blocking the new Russian peace  initiative.    In particular, when on Friday Andrey Kozyrev, building on  the  success achieved Thursday, forthwith suggested convening an  international peace conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina next week  in order to find a full solution to the Bosnian problem. The  West attempted to "scupper" this new Moscow peace initiative:  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that long and  careful preparations are needed for such a conference, which  will take a great deal of time.    Following this Washington, the BBC reported, has made great  efforts to persuade the Croats and Muslims to remain in a single  Bosnian state. A very well thought-out move. If it was  successful, the Serbs in Bosnia would be left totally isolated.  In that case the territories they are holding could be declared  occupied and the Serbs could thus continue to be kept outside  the world community. They could thus be pressured with a view to  forcing them to leave the territories they control.    There is every indication that Washington is trying to put  its own plan into practice. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate  Granic and Bosnian Prime Minister Big Haris Silajdzic had a  separate meeting in Germany Saturday to discuss a possible  solution to the Bosnian problem.    The meeting bore no fruit. That is not surprising. A month  earlier Bosnian and Croatian Presidents Alija Izetbegovic and  Franjo Tudjman met in Germany for the same purpose and were also  unable to reach any agreement. It is not only that the  interests of these two forces in Bosnia are diametricaly  opposed. It is hard to imagine these two political forces being  able to exist within a single state after two years of mutual  enmity and after mercenaries from other Muslim countries being  involved in the Bosnian Muslims' combat operations against the  Croats.    The question does of course arise: What is the origin of  this treachery? Clinton did after all promise to put pressure  on the Muslims, propelling them toward peace, but U.S. diplomacy  has begun to take the exact opposite course. Why?    The answer must be sought in public opinion. It now has a  very strong influence on both Yeltsin and Clinton.    The BBC reports that, according to the results of a  Russia-wide public opinion poll, over 66 percent of Russian  citizens would regard NATO strikes on the Bosnian Serbs as an  attack on Russia. And over 77 percent of respondents opposed  NATO's threat to bomb Serbian heavy guns in positions around  Sarajevo.    What realistic politician could have ignored such an  explicitly expressed opinion from his own people?    It is the same in the United States. Clinton's promise to  put pressure on the Muslims had not had time to be made known to  the U.S. public at large before U.S. newspapers bristled with  headlines describing what the U.S. President said as "ominous"  and his position "an utter disgrace."    Nonetheless there is every indication that it will be very  hard to stop the Bosnian peace settlement process after Russia's  initiative. Friday Radovan Karadzic said: "We think that the  war in Sarajevo is finally over." And Sunday 20 February  Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special spokesman in  the former Yugoslavia, voiced an even more optimistic opinion of  the situation, saying that the Bosnian crisis as a whole may  come to a peaceful close over the next few weeks.</p>

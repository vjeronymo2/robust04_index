			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Proposals target small investors LABOUR is seeking to steal the Conservative's claim to be the party of wider share ownership with proposals for encouraging investment in the UK economy by individuals. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, the party's City spokeswoman, yesterday told a London conference that contrary to the impression given by the government, small investors were being 'systematically squeezed' out of the market. She blamed 'harsh' commission charges and the government's failure to provide 'even reasonable protection' for consumers. Labour proposals for the small investor are aimed at creating a framework for encouraging individual share ownership and a stable source of development finance. Proposals include simplifying documentation and lowering transaction costs. There would be a greater emphasis on training in the financial services industry and a stream lining of the system of self-regulatory bodies in the City.</p>

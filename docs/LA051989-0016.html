			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RABIN RULES OUT GOOD-WILL MOVE FOR PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday ruled out good-will gestures to  improve conditions in the occupied territories and to encourage Palestinians to  accept Israel's peace plan.  </P> <P> Speaking on the eve of a 10-day visit to the United States, Rabin said Israel  is not now ready to release prisoners, reopen universities and public schools  or take other measures to improve the climate as the uprising by Palestinians  in the occupied lands stretches into its 18th month.  </P> <P> "The present situation leaves no room for gestures," Rabin said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Rabin specifically ruled out releasing large numbers of the 6,300 Palestinian  security prisoners or reopening 11 Palestinian universities and colleges in the  West Bank with a total enrollment of 17,000. They have been closed since  February, 1988.  </P> <P> He said two attempts were made to restart classes at 1,194 grade schools and  high schools in the West Bank. But he said violent clashes immediately began  between students and soldiers.  </P> <P> "Once the schools were closed, there was a sharp reduction in the number of  youngsters who were injured or worse," he said.  </P> <P> Rabin suggested that Israel might be willing to show flexibility on the  election participation of 140,000 East Jerusalem Arabs, international  supervision and other unresolved questions about balloting if Palestinians  first indicated agreement in principle to Israel's proposal.  </P> <P> "If there will be acceptance in principle of (the plan) by Palestinians in the  territories, we can go on and tackle other problems which are related to the  matter of elections," he said.  </P></p>

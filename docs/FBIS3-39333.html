			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Spain said here Monday  [14 February] that it did not want future members of the  European Community to influence a decision over whether or not  to go ahead with an early currency union and an EC single  currency.    Spanish Finance Minister Pedro Solbes told journalists after  a meeting of EC finance ministers that Sweden, Finland, Norway  and Austria should not be allowed to vote for a possible  currency union between 1997 and 1999.    The four countries are negotiating to enter the EC by  January  1, 1995, two years ahead of the earliest possible date for  currency union. But Solbes said he wanted the single currency  decision limited to the EC's 12 current members. [passage  omitted]    Spain is worried that the EC newcomers, being relatively  wealthy, would fulfill the currency union membership criteria  and produce a majority to go ahead with the single currency,  leaving other members like Spain behind.    It has also complained that the newcomers would raise the EC  economic averages of inflation and interest rates, making it  more difficult for the poorer countries such as Spain to qualify  for economic union.    But the chairman of Monday's meeting, Yannos Papantoniou of  Greece, said the Spanish position had no general support.  German Finance Secretary Johan Eekhoff said there was nothing  in the Maastricht Treaty to support it.    The meeting expressed general support for an EC plan to  fight  unemployment by launching a massive ECU120 billion (132 billion  dollar) infrastructure investment scheme, and by deregulating  the labour market.    Several ministers, particularly Philippe Maystadt of Belgium  and Marianne Jelved of Denmark, stressed the need for greater  monetary cooperation to prepare the ground for a single currency.</p>

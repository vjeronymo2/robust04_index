			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "Fighting Continues in Gorazde"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic said in Pale, Serb's stronghold in Bosnia,  Tuesday [19 April] that Serbs "really want Gorazde to become a  demilitarized region," blaming the fighting on a UN failure to  disarm Muslim government troops.    At a press conference, Karadzic said the Serb attack was not  aimed at taking the entire town, but just the south bank of the  Drina river, "which has always belonged to us." The river  divides Gorazde.    But reports reaching here said that Serbian forces shelled  UN  buildings in Gorazde Tuesday, showing no signs of honoring  pledges to stop their attack on Gorazde, a Muslim enclave  suffering one of the worst assaults in Bosnia's two-year war.    UN officials lost contact with aid workers and military  observers in Gorazde late in the day when their building was hit  by shells.    In Washington, President Bill Clinton met with his national  security advisers to examine military and diplomatic options for  dealing with the Serb defiance.    In Moscow, the Russian government, angered at the Serbs'  broken promise to halt their attack on Gorazde, also announced  it was shelving its longstanding bid to get UN sanctions against  the Serbs lifted.    The developments were seen as a major break between Moscow  and the Serbs, fellow Slavs with whom it shares historical and  religious ties.    "The conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina is on the verge of  dangerous escalation despite the energetic diplomatic efforts of  Russia taken in conjunction with the United Nations and other  members of the international community," President Boris Yeltsin  said in a statement issued by his office Tuesday night.    "The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given  to Russia, stop the attacks and pull back from the town of  Gorazde," he said.    The Serbs attacked Gorazde just a day after Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said they had promised to halt their  offensive. His assurances led NATO to cancel plans for new air  strikes against the Serbs.    Russia has 1,300 soldiers serving in the UN force in former  Yugoslavia and is eager to avoid direct confrontations with the  Serbs. It sent 200 more paratroopers to the war-torn region on  Tuesday to replace other Russian peacekeepers.    Serbs' SRNA News Agency reported Muslim-Serb fighting near  Brcko, which is the narrow point of a corridor linking Bosnian  Serb territories in the northwest and northeast. State radio in  neighboring Croatia also said Serbs were reinforcing their  forces near Brcko.    According to another report, on Sarajevo's southern fringe,  as many as 150 Serb soldiers brushed aside 30 French  peacekeepers at the Lukavica barracks and took back 18  anti-aircraft guns they had surrended under a NATO threat of air  strikes two months ago.    NATO officials responded cautiously Tuesday to a request  from  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for broader authority  to call in air power to protect the six UN-designated "safe  areas" like Gorazde.</p>

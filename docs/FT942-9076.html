			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Schneider creditors face Pounds 1.8bn losses Bank creditors to Germany's failed Jurgen Schneider property group stand to lose up to DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.8bn) - nearly all the DM5bn of debts outstanding and nearly double the initial estimates when the company collapsed early last month. Mr Gerhard Walter, the administrator in charge of the group's bankruptcy proceedings, said the 121 properties owned by Schneider had a market value of only DM3bn to DM3.5bn. He was speaking after the first meeting of creditors to the Schneider group since it filed for bankruptcy. The first official estimate of Schneider's deficit suggests that banks are set to lose far more than was believed in the immediate aftermath of the collapse. It was then thought that banks would lose a maximum of half of their outstanding loans. The company's head, Mr Jurgen Schneider, has been missing since just before the company's collapse. Although the figures confirm the Schneider case as the worst property collapse in Germany since the second world war, bankers said that the estimates and the assumptions behind them may be unduly pessimistic. Losses will not crystallise for years, if at all, until such time as the Schneider properties are sold. Mr Walter said in calculating the deficit, he had taken into account the further cash the banks will have to invest to bring the properties into marketable condition, as well as rolled-up unpaid interest which will accumulate on the outstanding debts. The 15 largest properties will need a further DM1bn spending on them over the next two years to bring them to completion. He estimated that a second tier of properties would need further expenditure of DM600m to DM650m. Rolled-up interest would amount to a further DM1bn. If this is deducted from the group's remaining financial resources, the total potential exposure mounts to DM7.5bn. The deficit is the difference between the DM7.5bn and the DM3bn to DM3.5bn which could be raised from the sale of the properties. Mr Walter said the calculations were based on a further deterioration of the German property market over the next two years. The scale of the deficit is such that craftsmen and trade creditors stand to lose up to DM250m owed to them by the Schneider group. Individual banks, however, have agreed to complete Schneider developments and have promised to pay off trade creditors.</p>

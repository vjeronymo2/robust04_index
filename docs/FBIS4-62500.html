Military sources report that on 16  May Russian border guards foiled two attempts by small groups of  Tajik [opposition] fighters to cross the border in the Pyandzh  and Khorog sectors. A day earlier, in the Shuroabad sector of  the Moskovskiy border troop detachment, Russian border guards  eliminated a group of Tajik fighters who penetrated into  Tajikistan in order to perpetrate acts of sabotage. In the same  sector, Russian border guards discovered a major clandestine  arsenal of rockets belonging to the Tajik mujaheddin.</p>

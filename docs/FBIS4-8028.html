			<p>BFN     [Text] President Berisha received General George Joulwan,  supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and chief  commander of the U.S. Forces in Europe.    Your visit is a very important event for Albania's  cooperation with NATO. First, I want to greet you and Admiral  Boorda personally for the successful operation in the skies of  Bosnia, which will remain historic, as it marked the beginning  of the functioning of NATO in a new role, President Berisha said  to General Joulwan.    I want to show you, President Berisha continued, that the  Albanian Army feels deep admiration for NATO as a defender of  democratic values, security, and peace. The Albanian military  are persistently working to adopt the standards of this  alliance. We were the first to request NATO membership and  today we powerfully support the Partnership for Peace as a  dynamic and natural process for achieving membership of this  Alliance.    Albania is determined to take part in all NATO structures  defined by the Partnership for Peace and is ready to conduct  joint maneuvers with countries or groups of countries which are  members of NATO. Albania seeks NATO assistance to prepare  peacekeeping troops or forces participants in humanitarian  operations and it also reconfirms its readiness to ensure NATO  access to all air and port facilities on the Albanian territory  to accomplish the mission of the alliance.    General Joulwan stressed that he admires Albania's great  changes in these two years and considers that the work done for  the deep transformation of Albania from a dictatorial into a  democratic state was a patriotic deed. He pointed out that  Albania has a broad and key strategic position for NATO, and in  this framework, the alliance is open for cooperation with  Albania.    Regarding the situation in Bosnia, President Berisha said  that we have supported the federation as a road that leads to  peace, but we are worried because Serbia is refusing this  solution. We think that it would help the peace if Russia could  manage to convince the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Washington  agreement, which presents a real option for the establishment of  peace in Bosnia. This will complete the political solution to  the crisis in the region.    Regarding the situation in Kosova, it remains tense and on  the eve of conflict. In this direction, the presence of U.S.  forces in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] and the increase of this presence in the region is  very welcome. Albania, the president continued, is engaged to  avoid the conflict, but every violent cleansing of Albanians  implies regional conflict.    On his part, General Joulwan offered the Alliance's support  for Albania's active engagement in the Partnership for Peace  framework and its gradual integration into all NATO structures  and levels.</p>

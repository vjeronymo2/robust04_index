			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas and former presidential hopeful --  even before the nomination of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- has sent a  letter to Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate.  Camacho Solis sent this letter on his personal letterhead. The  letter reads as follows:    The 1993, 1994, and current political options are similar.  We need to have stability and peace for Mexico to have  progress, justice, financial stability, and democracy. The  options for achieving this stability will determine our  political future. First of all, we might fall prey to the  illusion that the fastest way to guarantee order is through the  display of hatred, exclusion, intolerance, and rejection of  disparate views. On the contrary, we could, from a profound and  serene recognition of the source of the problems, the  aspirations of society, and an appropriate perception of the  nature of the conflicts, reach the conclusion that such a  climate of stability and peace will only arise from respecting  individual and human rights, and that in order to produce it we  need to garner the initiatives of nongovernment and civic  organizations, respect freedom of expression, and accept  disparate views.    Stability requires the strict implementation of the law, not  only to control society but also to impose limits on state  actions. This is required in any democratic and free nation.  There is increasingly less and less time and room to attempt to  find a balance by separately taking parts of one political trend  or another. Faced with the facts, we must wield our options.    Manuel Camacho Solis tells Zedillo Ponce de Leon: Your  responsibility is a very serious one. I urge you to use all  your intelligence, honesty, and patriotism to place yourself  above any interests and to focus your initiatives on the path of  peace, justice, and democracy. It is necessary to consolidate  the PRI candidacy to prevent the national situation from  worsening. You have and will have my support as long as a  republican and democratic government plan is being implemented.  The democratic option requires national unity; unity that  involves all the political forces and citizens that strive to  build a more just Mexico.    Signed: Manuel Camacho Solis</p>

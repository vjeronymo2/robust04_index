			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointing response to record Pounds 3.25bn gilt auction THE BANK of England held one of its most disappointing gilts auctions yesterday since they were first used in 1987. However, the fundamental attractions of the UK gilt market enabled it readily to shrug off the supply pressure of what was also the biggest ever auction. The Pounds 3.25bn sale of 8 per cent stock due 2003 had been aimed at international investors who have been heavy buyers of UK paper on the back of low inflation, low growth and the prospect of sterling appreciation. However, over the past week, gilt prices have risen sharply and the pound has raced ahead against a number of European currencies. Yesterday's auction was covered only 1.1 times, the lowest level since January 1988. When the auction details were announced, long gilt futures for September plunged  5/8 to 106 5/16 and both medium and long-dated bonds were sharply lower. Nevertheless, prices began to creep higher very quickly and by the close, the September gilt contract was almost half a point higher on the day at 107 13/32 . The fundamental attractions of the market enabled the Bank of England to announce a further Pounds 800m of new stock late yesterday afternoon. The tap of 9 per cent stock dated 2008 and priced at 108.75 per cent will be more attractive to UK institutional investors, which prefer longer-dated issues. THE BURNING issue of whether Germany will or will not cut key interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting today continued to exercise continental European government bond markets. However, the German bund market drew no inference from the inscrutable Bundesbank and traded sideways for most of the day. Bund futures rose only 6 basis points to close at 95.86. Dealers said the strength reflected investors switching out of the French government bond market, which many feel has risen high enough in the short term. The rate cut pessimists pointed to the derisory reduction yesterday in the repo rate, which was shaved by only one basis point to 7.58 per cent against vague hopes earlier that it might have come down to around 7.55 per cent. However, the enthusiasts believed that the fiscal package announced on Tuesday and due to be approved by the Cabinet in two weeks' time would provide the Bundesbank with the impetus it needs. The government wants to make spending cuts totalling DM25.25bn. FRENCH government bonds were flat as the market digested the most recent unemployment data, which came in at 11.5 per cent for May against the market's expectation of around 11 per cent. French bonds started sluggishly, with today's auctions of franc-denominated OATs and of Ecu-denominated OATs also weighing on futures as dealers set up hedges for the tender. The September contract was down at around 119.68 at one stage but recovered later in the day to close unchanged at 119.82. IN THE high yielding European government bond markets, Italian bond futures hit a record high before profit-taking saw the contract edge slightly lower on balance. Foreign investors, who have been prepared to take the country's political uncertainty on board for the attractive returns of government paper, were encouraged by positive tax news. The treasury has signed a decree introducing a new system for repayment of withholding tax on coupons to eligible foreign investors. The finance ministry said the time for repayment could be cut to 35 to 40 days with the new computer-based system. At present, the repayment of the 12.5 per cent tax can take up to a year. BTP futures for September ended the day 0.61 point higher at 103.24. US TREASURY prices were little changed in quiet trading as dealers and investors prepared for tomorrow's jobs data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 105 25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was steady at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.993 per cent. Trading was lacklustre throughout the day, primarily because most participants chose to stay on the sidelines until tomorrow's June employment report. Expectations centre on a rise of between 100,000 and 150,000 in non-farm payrolls - an increase that would be regarded as indicative of a still-struggling, but slowly expanding, economy. Initially, losses were concentrated at the long end and were attributed to end-of-quarter selling by institutions, and reports that a large number of Congressional Democrats want President Bill Clinton to drop the energy tax from his deficit-reduction package. The long end, however, bounced back from its losses mid-afternoon. News of a 1.4 per cent fall in May factory orders and a virtually flat Chicago purchasing managers' index had no discernible affect on prices.</p>

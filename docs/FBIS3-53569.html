			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Phalangist Party Leader Dr. George Sa'adah has  again warned against allowing political calculations to  overshadow the ongoing investigations to uncover the identity of  those who bombed the Phalangist Party headquarters along with  the masterminds and instigators. He said that we will be lying  in wait to foil such attempts. At an expanded meeting of the  Phalangist Party Political Bureau and Central Council members at  the headquarters in al-Sayfi at 1700 today, he said: Frankly  speaking, we can see no difficulty in uncovering the details of  the crime. In fact, we are sure that we will uncover them. The  possible perpetrators are limited because the parties who are  capable of preparing such operations are few, and those with  places where bombs are prepared and those who have interest in  this crime are all well known. There is evidence. The security  agencies are active and sincere and our judges are competent,  and it is not difficult for them to solve such an easy case.    Sa'adah said: What we fear are decisions dictated by  political calculations. There is justification for our fear  because there are attempts to acquit certain parties through  tacit political decisions. We will be lying in wait for such  decisions because this case exceeds our personal safety and  involves political freedoms and the homeland's security and  destiny. [passage omitted]    On the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva yesterday, Dr. Sa'adah  emphasized its importance at this stage in particular. He said  that it was a successful and important summit, noting that the  Lebanese issue was discussed during the summit. All we hope, he  said, is that the Lebanese Government will follow up on the  results with sound diplomatic and political moves and benefit  from its positive aspects.</p>

Mr. Advani, reading various reports from talks with several  people, said that he has learned officials in the state  government are, one way or another, encouraging terrorism in the  state. He said that such disgraceful persons should be uprooted  without haste. Mr. Advani was addressing a public meeting at the  parade grounds.    Comparing the situation in the valley with Punjab, Mr.  Advani  said that the most important step needed to improve the  situation in the valley is to give a free hand to officers in  dealing with terrorism. He said that when such an arrangement  was made in Punjab, the situation had improved rapidly.  Additionally, the Central Government was watching Punjab closely  during the terrorism era.    Mr. Advani said that the situation in Jammu-Kashmir is very  different. Even the governor's mandate is not obeyed in the  valley. The BJP leader told the Central Government that it  should not hesitate to take strict action in Kashmir. Mr. Advani  reminded his listeners that the Indian Government, despite  international objections, had taken steps to test nuclear  weapons in Sikkim, Goa, Hyderabad, and Pokhran. India has never  bowed down to international pressures. Why, then, should it bow  in the context of the valley?  *</p>

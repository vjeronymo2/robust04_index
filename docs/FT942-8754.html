			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Labour poll silence broken Labour's silence on leadership campaigning broke down yesterday as the party's former publicity director was accused of campaigning for Mr Tony Blair by a supporter of Mr Gordon Brown. The allegation, levelled by Mr Nigel Griffiths, consumer affairs spokesman, at Mr Peter Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool, was quickly withdrawn after protests from Mr Brown's office. Aides said Mr Brown was 'upset' by the allegation, which was not approved by his office. 'Gordon is trying to act with some decorum about this,' a friend said. 'He can't stop MPs talking about the contest, but no one is authorised to speak on his behalf.' Mr Mandelson, who ran Labour's press and communications office until the 1992 general election, said he would make no comment about the leadership until after the funeral of John Smith tomorrow. The row illustrates the growing problems which Mr Brown and Mr Blair will face in maintaining their long-standing alliance as leaders of Labour's 'modernist' wing. The two men are expected to address Labour's Welsh rally on Sunday, but neither has decided whether to launch their candidacy then. A poll of 70 Labour MPs by Tribune, the centre-left weekly newspaper, suggested that support is growing for Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. There was less support for the two other potential candidates of the left, Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader. There is growing support among MPs for a wide slate of candidates which would ensure a full debate on the issues facing the party. However, some MPs said the results would be 'too unpredictable' since the winner could be a candidate who failed to gather more than 50 per cent of first preference votes. In a sign of increasing tensions among MPs, a leaflet was being circulated urging candidates not to announce their candidacy until after the European elections on June 9.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Fujimori shuns easy route for 'revolution': Peru's president faces a tough task despite his absolute powers PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori's overthrow of democracy in Peru last week was not just another textbook Latin American coup. First, Mr Fujimori is not a puppet of power-hungry generals. It is becoming clear he plotted for months with an inner circle of advisers before striking down Congress and the judiciary on April 5. 'This was a palace decision, with the military brought in at the last moment,' an ambassador in Lima says. Secondly, the coup was bloodless and there were only a handful of arrests. Press censorship was lifted after 48 hours. The president is basking in opinion polls giving him more than 70 per cent support, and few Peruvians appear to be mourning democracy's demise. Yet the events in Peru pose a moral and policy dilemma for an international community contemplating sanctions against Mr Fujimori's military-backed dictatorship. No one could fault his stated objectives: to rid his country of terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption. What is open to question is whether Mr Fujimori, as he claims, had no option but to shut down Congress and the judiciary and whether he can succeed in his aims, having taken absolute power. The Organisation of American States (OAS), which met yesterday in Washington, hopes to turn back the clock by sending a diplomatic mission to Lima to reconcile Mr Fujimori and the disbanded Congress. The mission is unlikely to succeed, but it will buy time for the US as it weighs the political costs of isolating Peru and withdrawing its anti-narcotics agents and military advisers. The hiatus will also give Mr Fujimori a breathing space in which to persuade creditor nations, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that his 'emergency government' is merely temporary. He will be sending Mr Carlos Bolona, his finance minister, and other members of his cabinet on a world tour to plead for resumed aid flows, which are pivotal to the economic stabilisation programme. Many doubt whether Mr Fujimori will stick to his two-year timetable for the restoration of democracy. 'Fujimori planned this coup almost from the day he was elected,' says an intelligence officer close to the president. 'It will be more like 18 years before he relinquishes power.' The president owes little to the political class he has overthrown or to the business establishment now trying to win his favour. He is an outsider, the son of Japanese immigrants whose rallying call of 'austerity, probity and sacrifice' struck a chord with millions of Peruvians desperate for change. The coup was forged with a campaign to discredit judges and politicians. In this the president needed little help; most Peruvians already believed judges to be corrupt and Congress irrelevant. He then nurtured the armed forces, promoting officers loyal to him and raising salaries. 'Fujimori then deliberately engineered a crisis with Congress,' says Mrs Lourdes Flores, a deputy of the conservative Popular Christian party. 'He refused to negotiate draft laws with the opposition and, lacking a majority in parliament, took every amendment as a personal insult.' The president accused Congress of busting the 1992 budget and sabotaging his economic reforms. In fact the Conservatives and the left offered little effective opposition to reforms. 'How can a president who issued more than 53,000 norms and decrees in 22 months accuse Congress of obstruction?' asks Mrs Flores. The timing of the coup - a day before parliament was due to resume work after its summer recess - appears to indicate that Mr Fujimori feared a more hostile opposition led by Mr Alan Garca, Peru's former president and leader of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra), the largest party in Congress. Mr Garca is now in hiding. It is unclear how the new regime will aid the military's 12-year war against Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) Maoist guerrillas. Emergency powers already give the armed forces freedom of action over 40 per cent of Peru's territory. The real constraint comes from a chronic shortage of resources - a situation exacerbated by the suspension of US military aid. The armed forces may take comfort from Mr Fujimori's pledges to reform the judicial system. The government says that judges, intimidated by the Sendero Luminoso, have freed thousands of guerrilla suspects. But while Mr Fujimori says he will sack 'corrupt' judges, he has said nothing about stopping Sendero vengeance. He has also announced measures to crack down on Peru's drugs trade. But while the armed forces remain his main ally, Mr Fujimori might be reluctant to purge military officers known to be involved in the drugs business. Like most authoritarian leaders, he boasts of leading a 'popular revolution' that will build 'a new democracy'. As a technocrat, he admires the economic transformation wrought by Gen Augusto Pinochet in Chile. His success will depend on winning the war against Sendero and drugs, and on the continued backing of creditor nations and multilateral agencies. On all three counts Mr Fujimori stood a better chance had he chosen to reform Peru's institutions within a democratic framework. 'Mr Fujimori's popularity may start to evaporate once Peruvians begin to count the cost of international isolation,' says Mr Hernando de Soto, a leading economist and former aide to the president. MR James Baker, US secretary of state, yesterday warned President Alberto Fujimori of Peru that the US would not accept the destruction of democracy in his country, but stopped short of recommending economic sanctions, writes George Graham in Washington. 'The US understands the difficulties that Peru has faced and is facing; both the economic difficulties and the security difficulties. But having said that, I think we have to recognise that you do not destroy democracy in order to save it,' Mr Baker said. He was speaking ahead of a meeting in Washington of the Organisation of American States to discuss what action to take over Mr Fujimori's decision last week to suspend Peru's constitution. The OAS was expected to hear both Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, Peru's foreign minister representing the Fujimori government, and vice-president Maximo San Roman, who has joined the opposition to the president.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Wickes - Other Companies Wickes: The DIY and timber retailer is forecast on Wednesday to announce a doubling of interim profits from Pounds 4.1m to between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m before tax. Wickes UK enjoyed a like-for-like sales increase, which excludes new stores, of 11 per cent in the first quarter, thanks partly to its 1,000 price cuts launched in January, and Hunter timber is expected to return to profits. The problem area is Malden Timber, still expected to produce a loss.</p>

Prof. Saitoti told the press at the Treasury  Building that volume one of the census which was launched  contains data by district at sublocation level. It also  describes population by sex and age, by sex and education, by  sex age and literacy and by tribe.    The vice president allayed some speculation that the  government had anything to hide on the census figures. He  asserted that the truth is that the govenrment was concerned  that in a number of areas, wananchi [citizens] reported that  they were not reached at all by census enumerators. However, he  reiterated, whereas the national average for undercount was 6.3  percent for some districts, the undercount was more significant,  comparing favorably [as heard] with other censuses in the world.  He cited the U.S. 1990 mail census with an undercount of 15  percent recorded.    According to the report recorded as per August 1989, the  population figure stood at 21,443,636 comprised of 10,628,368  males and 10,815,268 famales. The Rift Valley Province leads  with 4,981,613, followed by Eastern 3,768,677, Nyanza 3,507,162,  Central 3,116,703, Western 2,544,329, Coast 1,829,191, Nairobi  1,324,570 and Northeastern Province with 371,391.

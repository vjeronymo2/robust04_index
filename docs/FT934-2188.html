			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A debatable argument on censorship Sir, Nigel Andrews ('Why videos are not so nasty'. December 3) seems to be sure that no extremes of violence, horror, evil or vice portrayed on screen in the home can harm anybody except, perhaps, 0.1 per cent of the viewers, who, he admits, might imitate what they saw. Of some 50m, that is rather a lot of people. His argument that all the evils of society should be represented in our culture is at least debatable. Represented how, and to whom? Adult intellectuals may be unharmed or, indeed, enlightened by literature that could put evil ideas into more feeble-minded folk and would cause children to act out undesirable situations. Few would deny that Jude the Obscure offers what Nigel Andrews might call cultural insight, but would he like small children to watch, on the screen, one child hanging two others and then himself behind a bedroom door? And that very act, in the story, was, as the doctor said, because a child had seen the terrors of life before he was old enough to have the staying power to resist them. Whatever the argument about censorship, it must be obvious that the screen in the home throws enormous responsibility upon parents, many of whom are at least careless, if not thoughtless or even feckless. A caring society should bear them and their children in mind as well as being concerned with intellectual freedom. Perhaps Nigel Andrews has had less experience with children than your ex-teacher correspondent Diana Schomberg (Letters, same date).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the Foreign Politics Desk: "Which </F> Reality?!"]    [Text] Some time ago, an 11-member delegation of diplomats  in New Delhi travelled to Kashmir Province after extensive  publicity by the Indians.    The Islamic Republic of Iran's ambassador in New Delhi, who  was one of the members of this delegation, criticized the  obstructionist behavior of the Indian officials and their  attempts to prevent the main objective of the trip, which was to  assess the true situation in Kashmir.    In view of this stance, the Indian External Affairs Ministry  summoned the Iranian ambassador and informed him that "his  allegations were not in conformity with the facts."    We wish to draw the attention of the Indian authorities to  two important points:    1. The Indian authorities for many years have opposed the  visit by Iranian journalists to the crisis-ridden Kashmir  region. Now that a diplomatic delegation has gone to that  region, the Indian Government is trying to cover up the pressure  it is exerting on Kashmiri Muslims by resorting to fallacious  propaganda and "disseminating news without any truth," despite  the fact that every day there are alarming reports of disastrous  occurrences in Kashmir.    2. It appears that the Indians did not expect anyone to  react to the actions of the Indian Armed Forces in Kashmir.    Why should the free statements of a diplomat regarding  Kashmir upset the Indian authorities? If the Indians are  apprehensive about the revelations of their atrocities in  Kashmir, they should seek a path other than intimidation.    Their allegation that "the Iranian ambassador was the only  one who complained" does not change anything, as the Indian  External Affairs Ministry has not refuted his allegations.    In any case, the Indian officials should know that one  cannot  cover up facts for a prolonged period of time and that the only  path is to officially grant rights to the people of Kashmir.</p>

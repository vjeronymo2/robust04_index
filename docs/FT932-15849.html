			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Fairfax buoyed by Kerry Packer bid speculation SHARES IN John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, rose 5 cents to ADollars 1.97 yesterday as speculation mounted that Mr Kerry Packer is preparing a takeover offer. The speculation followed the purchase of a 5 per cent stake in Fairfax by Ord Minnett, a Sydney stockbroker, for ADollars 75.6m (USDollars 54m). The buyer was not identified, but Ord Minnett has acted for Mr Packer in the past. If the buyer is Mr Packer, the purchase would increase his stake in Fairfax to almost 10 per cent. Nine Network Australia, a television network controlled by Mr Packer, bought a 4.98 per cent stake last month for ADollars 49.7m. Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH), Mr Packer's privately-owned master company, refused to comment, but analysts said the purchase was almost certainly made by CPH or a subsidiary company. The identity of the buyer must be revealed to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) today, unless the new owner of the shares is a private company. In that case, the buyer could remain unidentified until next week. Mr Packer has said that he would like to control Fairfax, which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age, the Australian Financial Review, and a chain of magazines and provincial newspapers. He was a member of the Tourang consortium, which acquired the group from the receiver for ADollars 1.4bn in 1991, but withdrew before the completion of the sale after regulatory authorities launched an inquiry. The remaining partners in Tourang were Hellman &amp; Friedman, the US investment bank, and The Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Hollinger, Mr Black's Canadian master company. Hellman &amp; Friedman has a 5 per cent stake in Fairfax, and The Telegraph has 15 per cent and management control. The government will rule shortly on an application by The Telegraph to increase its stake to 25 per cent. Under Australia's cross-media ownership law, Mr Packer will be limited to a 14.99 per cent shareholding in Fairfax unless he reduces his stake in Nine Network from 48 per cent to less than 15 per cent. Mr Packer would have to convince the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) that he could not exercise control of more than one leading media group with the assistance of associates or other shareholders. Mr Black said he would regard an investment in Fairfax by Mr Packer as a vote of confidence.</p>

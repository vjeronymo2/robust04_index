			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORS MUST GIVE OK FOR REBUILDING  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has adopted an interim policy to require 15 property  owners to win approval from their neighbors before they can begin work to tear  down or substantially rebuild their homes.  </P> <P> The 15 projects were left in limbo last week when the council adopted an  emergency ordinance that limits the floor area of single-family dwellings to  60% of the lot area. The projects, which exceed that limit, cannot proceed  until neighbors either approve plans or fail to comment after being notified by  letter.  </P> <P> If a project is controversial, the matter may be appealed to the City Council,  a process that planning officials said can take several months.  </P> <P> Several property owners objected to the new procedure, but Mayor Katy Geissert  defended the approach. "It's been a tough issue," she said. "There are people  who are really up-tight on both sides. . . . We are honestly trying to be  fair."  </P> <P> The interim policy will apply to only those 15 projects. Any new proposals that  exceed the 60% limit will be unable to proceed until the city completes a study  on permanent size and height limits for single-family homes.  </P></p>

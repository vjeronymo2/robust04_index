			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel A. Liendo] </F>   [Text] Merida--President Rafael Caldera has said that  Venezuelans who want something that a majority of the country  does not are behind an anti-Venezuela campaign. He said this at  a news conference in Merida where he was attending the  ordination of Monsignor Juan Maria Leonardi Villasmil, the  auxiliary archbishop of Merida.    President Caldera asked the media "to stop echoing foreign  campaigns and publicizing this negative campaign because it is  detrimental to the country and its interests." He added that  such campaigns come from very unimportant U.S. concerns  [empresas] and organizations that are not well recognized.    The president addressed media concerns about the national  economy and reports that circulated regarding the risks that the  country could entail to foreign investors.    That campaign has repercussions in Venezuela because certain  sectors are echoing it with intentions and interests unknown to  me, he added. "Actually, behind the campaign are certain  Venezuelans who want something that a great majority of the  people do not: to see the government that I head fail to comply  with commitments made to the Venezuelan people."    The U.S. Government, he added, as stated explicitly by its  ambassador accredited in our country, has no role in or the  slightest liking for that negative campaign, because this  government recognizes and proclaims the efforts that my  government is making for Venezuela, democracy, and the entire  American Continent.    Caldera said that in the United States Enrique Iglesias,  president of the Inter-American Development Bank [IDB], "has  very clearly recognized the efforts being made by the current  government, and this is confirmed at meetings with important  government officials. Iglesias made this statement after having  serious and thoughtful study; morover, the IDB, World Bank, and  IMF have also conducted similar studies of the Venezuelan  situation."    He added: Thus, I urge my country's media, which sometimes  publishes excessively large headlines on any opinion issued by  any unimportant organization that is virtually unknown in the  United States, to realize that they could hurt the country and  the very interests they represent.  <H5>  Taxes </H5>   [Reporter at news conference] How will your government  control any wave of speculation? How will it control tax money  to ensure it is truly channeled to solving the country's  important social and economic problems?    [Caldera] No one likes to pay taxes; it is not pleasant to  collect them either. The need for them is determined by the  serious budget crisis facing the country that is worsened by a  drop in the price of our main product, petroleum. The measures  that will be adopted are important, and they very clearly  reflect the concern for social justice that governs this  government's activities.    He recalled his commitment to eliminate VAT [value-added  tax]  at the consumer level and to shift the burden of taxes to those  who are economically able to pay them.  <H5>  Salary Increases </H5>   The president said that he trusts that there will be no  price  increases because, in his opinion, it would be unjustified. We  think, he added, that it is an indispensable obligation to  increase the minimum wage of all Venezuelans who do not earn  enough to meet their basic needs.    He said that the economic guarantees were supressed and that  the powers granted to the government by those measures have not  been exercised with much prudence, but we know that there are  prospects for eliminating any outrageous abuses that might  further worsen the already difficult economic situation facing  Venezuelan households.    When asked whether his government will define a true policy  for foreign investments, Caldera said that very important people  in the international economic world and in developing countries  trust our economy, the course it is following, and the  guarantees it offers.    [Reporter] Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of  Associations  and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] fears inflation will  result from the announced increase in wages and salaries; the  CTV [Confederation of Venezuelan Workers] demands them. When  will that announcement be made? What is your opinion on the  position of the business leadership?    [Caldera] Salary increases are not enacted to create  inflation but because there is inflation. My administrations's  main goal is to fight inflation.</p>

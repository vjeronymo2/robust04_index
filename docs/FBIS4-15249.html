			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Bagrov report: "Oleg Soskovets Versus SEGODNYA. </F> First Vice Premier Works as Usual"]    [Text] Responding to accusations that First Vice Premier  Oleg Soskovets had unlawfully bought shares in the Novosibirsk  tin combine, members of his staff stated yesterday that there is  no documentary evidence of the charges. In the meantime some  versions of the appearance of the scandalous information have  been put forward in government circles.    The crux of SEGODNYA's charge against Oleg Soskovets is that  he allegedly bought shares in the Novosibirsk tin combine which  are distributed through private subscription. Not being a  member of the work collective, the vice premier had no right to  make such a purchase.    Yesterday, members of the first vice premier's staff stated  to a SEGODNYA correspondent that there is no documentary  confirmation of the fact that shares were bought and that Oleg  Soskovets has absolutely nothing to do with this affair.  According to the vice premier's aides, he reacted quite calmly  to the publication and continues to work "as usual."    From the cautious remarks by members of the government  apparatus, one can put together two versions of the appearance  of the publication against the vice premier. The first is that  the publication had been inspired by a side that had suffered in  some scandal between the tin combine's shareholders. Some  staffers of the Russian Federation Metallurgy Committee cashed  in on this dissatisfaction in order to take vengeance on their  former chief.    The second version has to do with the struggle between  various conceptions of the post-voucher privatization in Russia.  In this case, charges against Soskovets, according to a theory,  have primarily a political-economic meaning: They are aimed at  weakening the first deputy premier's influence in the final  stage of check privatization and at decreasing his activism in  working out strategy of the next stage.    By the way, the Magnitogorsk metallurgical combine is  supposed to become a proving ground for privatization methods  not controlled by Anatoliy Chubays.</p>

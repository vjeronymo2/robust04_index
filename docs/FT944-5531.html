			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Taiwan holds local elections Taiwan goes to the polls today to elect mayors for its two largest cities and a provincial governor in what are widely seen as the most important elections since the island threw off the yoke of military dictatorship seven years ago. These are the most senior positions yet to be decided by popular vote, and today's poll marks the penultimate stage in a process of democratisation that will culminate in presidential elections in early 1996. Debate has raged over a gamut of issues, starting with the fundamental issue of Taiwan's future relationship with China, but feelings have also been running high over the need to wipe out vote-buying and garbage collection in Taipei. In the election for provincial governor, the ruling Kuomintang's well-entrenched and well-financed party machine is expected to carry the day.</p>

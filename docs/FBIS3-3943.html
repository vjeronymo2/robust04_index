During this period, the changes in China's rural areas  have been profound and the results obtained remarkable. I think  that the most important changes in rural areas have been in the  following aspects:    The first change is the change in the form of management and  the distribution of land. The basic means of production, that  is to say the production relationship, has been readjusted. In  essence, the past structure of the so-called people's commune of  being large in size and collective in nature, eating out of the  big pot, and egalitarianism has been changed, and various forms  of responsibility system linking remuneration to output with  household contracts as the dominant factor have been instituted.  Management rights over land, a means of production and a basic  factor of production, have been given to peasants and the idea  of land to the tiller has been realized. This is the greatest  and most profound change in China's rural areas during the  socialist construction period, and it is also the foundation of  all other changes. This has enabled peasants to have the right  to make decisions about land management and the right to handle  most agricultural produce freely. This has given economic  benefits to the peasants and has greatly aroused their  enthusiasm for production. Land management rights, the right to  freely handle one's own produce, and economic benefits are the  essence of rural change.    The second change is that we have gradually abolished the  long- standing policy of a state monopoly in the purchase and  marketing of agricultural produce. At present, with the  exception of a few kinds of agricultural produce, such as  cotton, cured tobacco, and silk cocoons, which are still under  state monopoly, price restrictions on all other agricultural  produce have been basically removed and prices are regulated by  the market. Restrictions on the price of major agricultural  produce, such as grains, edible oils, and meat have been removed  across the country.    The third change is that we have used the viewpoint of macro  agriculture to guide agriculture. In developing planting, we  have enthusiastically developed forestry, animal husbandry,  fisheries, and various kinds of sideline production. In the  1980's and even at the beginning of the 1990's, not just  planting developed greatly: Forestry, animal husbandry,  breeding, and various kinds of sideline production also  developed very fast in China's rural areas. We have corrected  the long-standing one-sided practice of taking grain as the key  link and have used the viewpoint of macro agriculture and the  viewpoint of the comprehensive development of agriculture,  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries  to guide agriculture. This is one of the main reasons why our  rural economy has developed quite rapidly.    The fourth important change is that in developing  agriculture, we have energetically developed township-run  industry and village-run industry and have encouraged peasants  to enter the field of commodity circulation and to move toward  nonagricultural production. I estimate that by the end of this  year, the total income provided by township and town enterprises  in China will exceed 2,500 billion yuan, and the number of  peasants working in these enterprises will be about 110 million.  Such a rapid development of township and town enterprises  basically depends on accumulation by the collective economy and  by the peasants, and the state has invested nothing in them, but  has only assisted by granting some bank loans and implementing  some preferential taxation policies. At present, we can say  that the township and town enterprises have developed into a  powerful support for the rural economy and have become an  important part of the whole national economy. I think that they  will soon constitute half of the entire national economy.    Of China's 1.1 billion-strong population, peasants account  for 800 million. What road should China take to realize  modernization? The development of township and town enterprises  has enabled us to view the hope of rural modernization. Since  the birth of township and town enterprises, they have not  enjoyed any preferential treatment from the planned economy, but  have been guided by the market economy. Therefore, they have  powerful vitality. The development of township and town  enterprises has not only injected new vitality into the rural  economy in China, but has also created rich experience for  reforming state-owned enterprises. I think that if our  state-owned enterprises can really master the operational  mechanisms of township and town enterprises and can transplant  such mechanisms for their own use, reform of our state-owned  enterprises will make much greater progress and their economic  results will also be greatly improved.    In developing the rural economy, we have also encouraged the  integration of planting and breeding with the industry of  processing agricultural produce, the integration of agriculture  and industry with commerce, and the integration of agriculture,  science, technology, and education with the improvement of the  quality of laborers. Of course, we have not yet done sufficient  work in this respect, and such work should be carried out at a  deeper level. However, we have made a good start.    At the symposium, various specialists and scholars have put  forward some issues which we should further resolve and should  pay attention to in the reform and development of China's rural  areas. I think they are very important and are also important  issues which we should study and resolve in deepening reform in  the future. For example, the issue of extending peasants'  rights to use and manage land is an issue peasants are most  concerned about. In the beginning, the contract period was  usually limited to 15 years. Now that 15 years has passed,  should we fix another time limit or should we state clearly that  the land is being given to the peasants for their long-term  management and use. I think this issue is worth studying. I  think that if we state clearly that land is being given to the  peasants for long-term management, the peasants will carry out  intensive and meticulous farming and will pay even great  attention to inputs to the land. This would also be an  effective measure to curb the practice of some government  departments of randomly occupying and misusing land.    Another example is that after agricultural produce is  regulated by the market, the issue of how to maintain steady  growth in major agricultural produce is also very important. To  resolve this issue, it may be necessary to adopt measures to  protect producers and consumers in addition to providing the  peasants in good time with relatively accurate information on  market supply and demand. For example, after a bumper  agricultural harvest, we should set a protective lower limit for  prices of agricultural produce; and if output of agricultural  produce decreases and market prices rise abruptly, the consumers  should be given certain corresponding subsidies. I think that  after practicing market regulation, it is necessary for us to  study the adoption of similar measures.    Another issue is the rising gap in incomes between urban and  rural residents. This is also an important aspect affecting the  peasants' enthusiasm for production. In the early and  mid-1980's, the increase in peasants' incomes was fast, and the  gap between urban and rural income was greatly reduced.  However, by the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the  1990's, we can say that peasants' income was in a state of slow  growth. After the gap between urban residents and rural  residents had been reduced for some time, it became bigger  again. If such a situation is short and temporary, we need not  worry. However, if such a situation continues in this way, this  would be dreadful and will become a factor of social instability.    It is very important and necessary to appropriately raise  agricultural produce prices, but this is not the only way. What  is important is to readjust the structure of agricultural  production and to optimize the product mix of agriculture. We  call it the development of high-output, high-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture. The third measure is to raise  labor productivity in agriculture. While energetically  developing secondary and tertiary industries, we should, in  localities where conditions are available, energetically promote  land management on a considerably large scale, including  household farms, collective farms, and state farms. Besides, I  quite agree with the viewpoint put forward by various  specialists. The most fundamental thing in resolving rural  issues is to improve the quality of rural laborers and to raise  the educational level of the peasants. I have been in charge of  agriculture for a long period and have been to many localities.  I have come to the conclusion that any village which is led by  a person with a relatively low educational level or without much  schooling is a relatively backward village, its economy develops  slowly, and even the problem of food is not completely solved  there; and any village which is led by an educated person, be he  a person with a medium educational level, a middle school  graduate, or an ex- serviceman who has been to other places and  has wide experience, develops fast. This can be said to be a  general law. Without energetically improving the cultural  quality of the peasants, it will be very difficult to turn  existing and practical science and technology into productive  forces.    Besides what I have mentioned, we have also put forward many  other good suggestions, such as on the issue of environmental  protection, the issue of population, and so on. We should  seriously study all of them.    I think that this international symposium is a great success  and will play a positive role in promoting and deepening rural  reform.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES FOR LIMITS ON FSX DEAL WITH JAPAN  </P> <P> The House voted Wednesday to attach some restrictions to the U.S. agreement  with Japan for joint U.S.-Japanese development of that country's proposed FSX  advanced fighter aircraft -- risking a possible veto and a serious  confrontation with the White House.  </P> <P> The resolution, passed on a vote of 241 to 168, is identical to one that the  Senate passed last month. While approving the FSX deal in principle, it would  prohibit the United States from providing Tokyo with the technology for  building the engine for the new plane.  </P> <P> It also would put Congress formally on record as insisting that U.S. firms be  awarded "at least 40%" of any contracts if the fighter ever actually goes into  production. The new aircraft would be patterned after the American-made F-16.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tougher Changes Rejected  </P> <P> Senate passage of the measure last month initially was regarded as a victory  for the Administration. The Senate last month and the House on Wednesday both  rejected tougher amendments that would have rejected the entire accord. The  measure now goes to President Bush.  </P> <P> But the White House has said since the Senate vote that Bush regards the  language as too restrictive and an intrusion on presidential negotiating  authority and has warned that he is likely to veto the resolution in the form  that it has been passed by Congress.  </P> <P> At the same time, the key votes on the restrictive language suggest that  opponents of the FSX deal in both houses may now be able to muster the  two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto, thus forcing Bush  to live with the language.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether the Administration would decide to go  ahead with the FSX project if Congress were to override a presidential veto, or  whether Bush ultimately would feel forced to ask Japan to renegotiate the  arrangement to take account of Congress' desires.  </P> <P> Administration officials said they would have to study the language more  carefully.  </P> <P> White House advisers have been warning that Japan may refuse to continue with  the project if it requires that the deal be renegotiated. Tokyo initially  wanted to build the fighter entirely on its own and acceded to co-development  only after strong U.S. pressure.  </P> <P> Wednesday's vote in the House came amid a torrent of anti-Japanese rhetoric by  lawmakers of both parties, who argued that Japan should have bought the  U.S.-made F-16 instead to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Depriving U.S. Firms  </P> <P> But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) warned that forcing the Administration to ask Japan  to renegotiate the FSX accord would only prompt Japan to go to European  aircraft makers instead, thus depriving U.S. firms of some $2.3 billion in  likely contracts.  </P> <P> U.S. aircraft makers have said the American firms participating in the FSX  project were likely to earn almost as much from co-development of the project  as they would if Japan had bought the F-16. Development costs for a fighter far  outweigh production costs.  </P> <P> The key vote in the House on Wednesday came as the lawmakers endorsed, 252 to  155, an amendment proposed by Rep. Terry L. Bruce (D-Ill.) that added the  restrictions to the resolution. The Senate vote on a similar amendment was 72  to 25.  </P> <P> Earlier, the House approved, 320 to 98, a measure by Rep. Gerald B. H. Solomon  (R-N.Y.) that would have blocked the FSX accord entirely. However, that  resolution was discarded when the Bruce provision was approved.  </P> <P> The Bruce provision -- and an identical amendment proposed in the Senate by  former Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) -- were intended as  compromises. Opponents of the FSX deal had conceded in advance they did not  have the votes to block the accord completely.  </P> <P> The FSX arrangement has become a focal point for a major debate over U.S. trade  and economic relations with Japan -- specifically, whether the United States  was "giving away" valuable commercial secrets in the deal that Japan could  later exploit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sophisticated Technology  </P> <P> Opponents, both within the Administration and in Congress, charged that the  accord would give Japan sophisticated technology that it later could use to  build a civilian aircraft industry that would topple the United States as the  leader in the field.  </P> <P> But Defense Department officials -- as well as executives of several U.S.  civilian aircraft manufacturing companies -- said the technology involved in  the FSX was primarily military and would not be transferable to civilian  aviation.  </P> <P> The accord was negotiated over 18 months by the outgoing Reagan Administration.  The Bush Administration had been expected to accept it intact, but wound up  renegotiating the deal once after Congress and the Commerce Department raised  concerns about commercial issues.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A LOT OF HUSH, TOO LITTLE RUSH FOR COWBOY JUNKIES  </P> <P> "Shhhhh."  </P> <P> That's what was printed on Cowboy Junkies souvenir T-shirts for sale Friday  night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, where the Canadian band was  making its first appearance in Orange County.  </P> <P> An unusual slogan for a rock band, but one that was true enough: "Shhhhh"  pretty well states the method of a group that has won acclaim for bringing a  kind of hush back into pop music.  </P> <P> At the Coach House, Cowboy Junkies demonstrated the considerable virtues -- but  also fell at times into the obvious pitfalls -- of restraining sound and  emotional expression to the point where they almost seem to be held inside.  </P> <P> The resounding eloquence of quietness has seldom been better illuminated than  in the Toronto band's version of Neil Young's "Powderfinger." Played as an  encore during the 90-minute early show, the song provided one of those  transcendent, unforgettable moments that are a music fan's Grail.  </P> <P> Young's original is a full-bore countrified rocker, a classic song with an  exploding riff that is one of the signal expressive events in the annals of  rock 'n' roll guitar.  </P> <P> The Cowboy Junkies played "Powderfinger" as a quiet, Appalachian-flavored folk  ballad.  </P> <P> It featured mandolin and an accordion that turned the rawness of Young's  original riff into caressing softness that gave comfort to Margo Timmins'  tremulous yet dignified singing.  </P> <P> Thus muted and stripped down, the Cowboy Junkies' inspired interpretation got  to the psychological and narrative core of "Powderfinger," a mythic song about  a young man confronting something beyond his experience, something that can't  be comprehended, much less controlled. In the song, the youth acts on instinct  and feeling, challenging that mysterious something -- a sinister gunboat -- and  dying in the attempt.  </P> <P> Timmins' fitting dedication to "the people in the streets of China" added to  the deep grace and emotional tug of the song. (What's really incomprehensible  is how some swine in the audience could yell "Party!" midway through this  pearl.)  </P> <P> The Cowboy Junkies' muted approach was not always appropriate, such as their  failed attempt at the Rolling Stones song "Dead Flowers," about someone lashing  out fearsomely over romantic rejection. In the original, making a wrongdoing  lover bleed with mocking words was not nearly enough for Mick Jagger. He was  going to dope himself with heroin as well, as if defiant self-destruction would  be the ultimate revenge.  </P> <P> A staid reading that turned "Dead Flowers" into a routine country lament hardly  did those raging emotions justice. Some feelings just can't be expressed  quietly.  </P> <P> When the delicate, wistful-looking Timmins sings, the words sound like thoughts  drifting and flickering in a bone-weary mind that is barely resisting sleep.  Sometimes, that sad and pretty internalized voice was just right: On meditative  songs such as "Misguided Angel" and "30 Summers," Timmons sifted through deep  wells of thought and emotion, evoking a profound sense of love strained and  embattled. But at other times, as sameness of vocal tone set in, the listener's  attention drifted.  </P> <P> This would have been a widely uneven show if Timmins' talent was the crux of  Cowboy Junkies. But the band's essence is really the wonderfully responsive and  inventive instrumental work of the six men playing behind Timmons on a stage  decorated by candles flickering in shallow glass holders.  </P> <P> Restraint was the watchword instrumentally as well as vocally. But Cowboy  Junkies' interactive ensemble playing led to shifts and shadings of tone and  small surges in dynamics that introduced a fine, low-key energy into most of  the songs. A few quietly smoldering blues songs early in the show were  especially effective.  </P> <P> But at any given point, whether the song was based in blues, folk or country  music, something inventive and lovely was happening: a perfectly placed  mandolin shimmer, fiddle weave or sharp but muted harmonica cry from  multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird; a bit of pretty accordion embellishment from  Jaro Czerwinec; a spare solo or gently twanging rhythm part from guitarist  Michael Timmins, Margo's brother.  </P> <P> Kim Deschamps' pedal steel guitar work was a special pleasure. As a soloist, he  summoned understated, mysterious dread during the Robert Johnson blues "Me and  The Devil," and applied a strange, mad meander to Patsy Cline's "Walking After  Midnight." Playing with the ensemble, Deschamps seemed to dab on just the right  hues, for just the right durations, as he took the pedal steel guitar far  beyond its standard honky-tonk sighs and keens.  </P> <P> As a front woman, Margo Timmins was charismatic in her introverted way.  Clinging to her microphone stand with both hands, she seemed deep in reverie.  </P> <P> Timmins snapped out it enough between songs to display a wry sense of humor,  but the wan tone in her speaking voice maintained a distance.  </P> <P> By making an audience want to be drawn in, so that the distance can be bridged  with concentrated listening, Cowboy Junkies achieved something unusual and  fine. But if "Shhhhh" turns out to be more dogma than jest, something that  sounded fresh the first time could easily turn into something pretentiously  ascetic.  </P> <P> It would not be a bad sign if, the next time around, Cowboy Junkies souvenir  stands sport T-shirts that say, "Let It Rock."  </P></p>

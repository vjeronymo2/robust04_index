			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (15): 'We've nothing to hide' - Profile, Dow Chemical ON A crisp April morning, under a clear blue sky, Midland Michigan seems like the most pristine place on earth. Walking past the daffodils and crocuses in Dow Gardens, just down the road from the Dow-funded arts centre, it is hard to believe that one of the world's biggest chemical plants is just a mile away. Spring is a good time to visit Midland. In the summer, when the central valley location causes an inversion of the humid air, Dow's presence in Midland can seem less benign. 'I was born in Midland but I moved away a few years ago because of the smell,' says a 36-year-old gas station attendant in a nearby town. 'In the summer, we kept the doors and windows shut all the time.' But it was not just the smell of Midland that convinced Dow it had to do something about the environment. 'In the mid-1980s, we were asked to look at public perception of the chemical industry,' says Mr Ron Pingel, Dow's director of environmental affairs and responsible care. 'After polling the public, chemical company employees and Dow employees, we found a huge gap between how the industry perceived itself and how the public perceived the industry. We realised we had to do something.' That something included improving its notoriously combative relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency, which had reached a nadir in 1985 when Dow went to the Supreme Court, charging the agency with violating its privacy after the EPA took aerial photographs of the Midland plant during an air pollution investigation. The company's public relations problem was made doubly difficult by its reputation from the 1960s, when Dow was the maker of napalm and Agent Orange used in Vietnam. Dow's efforts to embrace its former adversaries extend beyond co-operating with the EPA and meeting the guidelines of the Chemical Manufacturers Association's responsible care programme. Dow established a board of outside specialists in 1991 to guide its environmental policy, giving it access to confidential documents and information. Dow has also initiated a number of internal programmes to convince itself, and the public, that Dow is serious about the environment. Like other big chemical companies, Dow has cut its toxic emissions substantially in recent years. The company says the greatest decline was in the 1970s, before the figures were made public. In the US, the company says its air emissions, as required by the Toxic Relief Inventory, have dropped from 10,893 tonnes in 1989 to 8,212 tonnes in 1991. By 1995, Dow expects its emissions to be closer to 5,000 tonnes. Signs of Dow's greener face are scattered throughout corporate headquarters, from the recycling bins in the dining room and offices to the memo pads embossed with the Responsible Care logo. When the CMA introduced Responsible Care in 1988, it was quickly endorsed by Dow's senior management who realised the company needed to improve its image. At the operating level Responsible Care met with less enthusiasm. 'When it was first mentioned to local plant managers, fear was in their eyes,' says Mr Dave Buzzelli, Dow's vice president for environment, health and safety. Dow's waste reduction efforts centre on its WRAP (Waste Reduction Always Pays) programme. The WRAP goals include reducing waste to the environment, recognising employee efforts to cut waste, encouraging employees to think about reducing waste at its source and measuring and tracking progress. The company says many WRAP projects help save fuel, raw materials and environmental costs. 'Instead of asking a group of environmental experts, we ask the business teams to come up with ideas,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'For most business people in the US, the environment has always been seen as a peripheral. We're trying to change that so our business managers make decisions about products.' Nevertheless, the overall cost component of Responsible Care is significant. Dow's environmental, health and safety operating expenses were Dollars 600m in 1992, including Dollars 200m for environmental capital investments. It hopes the investment will pay off in the long run by reducing environmental clean-up costs. Perhaps the biggest change at Dow has been its efforts to open its facilities to local communities. 'We're opening the gates to the public because what you can't see, you imagine and what you imagine, you often fear,' says Mr Buzzelli. 'We're showing that the company has nothing to hide.' The company has set up local community advisory panels to encourage dialogue with its neighbours. 'Dow has been more than willing to discuss our concerns, whether they are business concerns or environmental,' says Mr Shirley Clowers, president of Midland's Chamber of Commerce and a local panel member. Others on the panel are more sceptical. Ms Mary Sinclair, a Midland environmentalist and long a critic of Dow, says: 'Mostly, people tend to just sit back and let Dow tell them what it wants to tell them. Dow did a very good job of getting a cross-section of people for the panel, but it's a company town.' Ms Sinclair is frustrated by Dow's decision to burn dioxins in Midland in spite of the concentrations of the highly toxic chemical in the region's soil and recent findings by the EPA that dioxin may be more dangerous than previously thought. 'I'm able to get information out to the community through the panel. When we discussed siting an incinerator in the community, Dow didn't want to do any explaining of the environmental issues. I was the one who had to bring up the issues.' Ms Sinclair is also worried about Dow's refusal to endorse an air quality report by the International Joint Commission, a US and Canadian group which advises governments of both countries. The latest report recommends that incineration facilities in the region be phased out or required to eliminate the production and emission of dioxins and other toxins. Dow has also been criticised by local environmental groups for fighting Right-to-Know legislation. Ms Tracy Easthope of the Ann Arbor Ecology Center's toxics reduction project says: 'Dow may be one of the more progressive companies, and some of the quotes from the chief executive and Dow officials are impressive. But they need to act on their words.' Other environmentalists have criticised Dow's methods of measuring waste reduction, noting that incinerated material is not part of the toxics release inventory which Dow uses to make claims of reduced waste. 'What Dow has done is essentially to transfer where the waste goes, so that it has reduced the amount of dioxin in the water through filtration but the sludges from filtration either end up in a landfill or get incinerated. It goes somewhere,' says one critic. Dow's executives are not oblivious to these issues. 'Chemicals by their nature are reactive so they all have some degree of hazard,' says Mr Pingel. 'We live here too. We use these products. The debate is our debate. I believe we can research, manufacture, develop and sell chemicals in ways that don't expose people to undue risk.'</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Matchsticks, a spending mess and the Union Sir, Your editorial, 'Conservatives and the Union' (April 7), is quite incorrect in criticising John Major for believing autonomy for Scotland can be stopped 'by just saying no'. Quite a substantial amount of people in the centre-right of the Scottish political spectrum have been taken in by the SNP's vision of independence for Scotland. This 'opinion poll' support seems to have drifted somewhat in recent days and I believe that one of the reasons for this is that potential voters have been scared off by the thought of the SNP (in the words of Jim Sillars) 'realising their socialist dreams'. The unfortunate reality is that, by voting for Labour, the people of Scotland are merely delaying the process of independence by means of a half-way house that will, as your editorial quite correctly says, bring far-reaching changes to the entire UK constitution. The 'west Lothian question' will substantiate the irresistible move to federalism and the consequent break-up of the UK as we know it. That is why the Conservatives' stance on the Union is one that should have great bearing on the way that people place their 'x'. Why vote away a constitution that has made the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the envy of the world? The Scots have always been nationalistic - as have the English, Welsh and Irish - but why we should suddenly now feel that the last 285 years have been sheer hell is, quite frankly, beyond my comprehension. Should Scotland's endeavours of the last three centuries be dismissed out of hand? The sad thing is that the Labour party, having jumped on the band wagon in order to try to please everybody, has once more given evidence of its lack of responsibility and backbone. By 'just saying no' the Conservative party stands out as a party of principle and reliability. Qualities such as these should not be scoffed at, especially when the issue concerns the preservation of the Union.

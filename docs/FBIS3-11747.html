			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 22 Mar (Notimex) -- National Police  sources disclosed today that approximately 3,000 Guatemalan  union members have closed off the highway over the "Melendez"  bridge leading to the Mexican border in the western department  of San Marcos. Actions initiated about a month ago at the "El  Carmen" and "Tecun Uman" border passes are part of a demand for  a 40 percent wage increase or the granting of a 300 quetzals  (more or less $50) monthly bond.    The takeover caused long car lines, which had to wait for  the  highway to the Mexican border to be cleared. The National Police  (PN) also reported that security at the "La Aurora" airport had  been increased given a possible takeover by state workers, who  have threatened to take futher steps. Terminal Director Colonel  Elfidio Diaz Solis stated that only passengers carrying travel  documents as well as passports are being allowed to enter the  airport.    Last week, at least 300 public employees blocked all entries  and exits to the airport for more than five hours, which caused  considerable discomfort to foreign and national tourists. Five  weeks ago, almost two months ago, the National Federation of  State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) began measures pressuring for a  40 percent wage increase. So far, the government has said it is  unable to approve the wage increase because of insufficient  funds. Union workers have rejected these claims with their own  evaluations indicating that the government does have sufficient  financial resources.</p>

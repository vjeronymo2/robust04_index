			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 8  February 1994.    The Central Reserve Bank today reported that 42 percent of  El  Salvador's overall exports go to Central America, 30 percent to  the United States, 7 percent to Germany, while the remainder are  distributed among several other nations. The bank also reported  that Guatemala is El Salvador's main trading partner.  Meanwhile, exports to Mexico doubled over the past two years  from $8 million to $16 million in 1993. The bank also reported  that the GDP rose 5 percent in 1993, and it is expected to  increase 6 percent in 1994. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2047  GMT 1 Feb 94)    An economic analysis indicates that exports have doubled  from  1989 to 1993, going from $600 million to more than $1.1 billion.  This translates into a better standard of living and more  resources for the people and the nation. Overall export growth  has been driven by an increase in nontraditional exports,  particularly in the assembly plant sector. Also, while coffee  prices have fallen, coffee exports have increased. (San  Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 4 Feb 94)    Roberto Orellana, president of the Central Reserve Bank,  reports the Multisector Investment Bank will open its doors  within the next few days with capital amounting to 300 million  cordobas. The bank's goals are to contribute to economic growth  and to generate jobs by financing capital investments in the  private sector. Orellana reports that the bank will receive a  $30 million credit from the International Development Bank to  implement a program to bolster small businesses. This new  banking institution will only grant loans to the private sector  for investment projects. (San Salvador LA PRENSA in Spanish 4  Feb 94 p 3)    The agricultural sector has moved from a severe, decade-long  recession in the 1980's to growth in the 1990's. Among those  product groups that have shown signs of growth are basic grains,  coffee, and sugar cane. An increase in the number of manzanas  cultivated nationwide helped increase the overall harvest from  18.4 million quintals in 1989 to more than 21 quintals in 1993.  In addition, credits to the agricultural sector have increased  from 1.3 million colones in 1989 to 3.2 million colones in 1993.  (San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 13)</p>

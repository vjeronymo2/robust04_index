			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter from Guangzhou" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i </F> (5170 2556 0308): "Guangdong Goes All Out To Eliminate Pirated  Compact Discs"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 21 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- At 1300 on 19  April, according to prior arrangements, the departments in  charge of copyrights, public security, industrial and commercial  management, culture, and urban management in cities such as  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou in Guangdong Province acted  simultaneously in a joint and concerted effort to thoroughly  inspect audiovisual stalls, mounting a vigorous offensive  against audiovisual product piracy.  <H5>  Pirated Products Cost Little, But Earn Big Money </H5>   The copyright law in China only has a short history of two  or  three years. Although the start was late, the development has  been rapid. China started out by first promulgating the PRC  Copyright Law on 1 June 1991, and by 30 April 1993, China had  already joined the Bern Copyright Convention, the Universal  Copyright Convention, and the Cassette Products Convention, thus  incorporating copyright protection in China into the  international copyright system. When Dr. Bogsch, director  general of World Intellectual Property Organization, visited  China early this year, he described China's copyright protection  as "from zero to everything."    It was under the conditions that propaganda was inadequate,  management was lagging behind, and copyright piracy and  infringement was given room to grow that the legislation was  adopted. The audiovisual business developed only in the last 10  years or so, and in particular, compact discs (CD) and laser  discs (LD) spread and became popular at a surprising speed,  while pirated CD's and LD's also developed simultaneously.  According to people in the trade, it costs only three or four  yuan to pirate a CD, then sell it at the price of the original  CD if the packing is good and the quality is not bad.  Generally, it can sell at 10 to 20 yuan. Low prices naturally  attract many consumers, and some Hong Kong and Macao residents  also go to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou to buy a large number  of them. Lured by the low cost and the high profits, many  audiovisual manufacturers and individual operators have  participated in the production and sale of pirated CD's and  LD's. Taking into account the smuggled goods pouring in from  outside the province, even before inspection, the prices of  pirated CD's and LD's in Guangdong had already dropped to 8 to  10 yuan and 160 yuan respectively. The smooth production and  sales channels enabled piracy in the audiovisual market in  Guangdong, and even in the whole country, to become increasingly  rampant, and this not only seriously disrupted the local  audiovisual publication market, but also caused concerns in Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. At present, seven departments,  including the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, China  Press and Publications Administration, and State Copyright  Bureau have issued a joint notice, demanding strengthened  management of work in duplicating CD's and LD's, as well as  serious efforts to handle copyright piracy.  <H5>  Some Shops Close Doors </H5>   Guangdong carried out six inspections of the audiovisual  market last year, but the main goal was to wipe out "poisonous  pornography" and counterfeit products. During the unified  inspection campaign this time, over 1,600 stalls selling  audiovisual products in the province were inspected in one day  alone, over 140,000 pirated CD's and 1,300 LD's were seized and  sealed for storage, and more than 80,000 videotapes were also  seized. During the inspection campaign in Guangzhou, the  relevant personnel made a special effort to inspect some  electric appliances markets such as Yifa Mall in Panyu City,  Haiyin Electric Appliances Concourse in Dongshan District, and  Xicheng Electric Appliances City in Liwan District, and when  they arrived at some stalls which refused inspection by closing  their doors, they took compulsory measures. Thus, in one day,  over 60,000 CD's were seized. In Zhuhai and Shenzhen, where the  situation pirated CD's was rather serious, they also seized over  20,000 CD's. This morning, the Guangzhou City Copyright Bureau  and the relevant departments took the lead in using a  steamroller to crush some of the seized CD's and audiovisual  products -- about 20,000 pieces -- in front of the public.    The emergency action in Guangdong Province is still going  on.  Today in Guangzhou I have visited some popular spots which sell  electric appliances, such as the Haiyin Electric Appliances  Concourse and Huifu Road Electric Appliances Street, and I found  that the often busy electric appliances markets have been  deserted, some shops have shut their doors, and the windows  which used to display numerous pirated CD's are empty or have  only a few original CD's and LD's, while the shelves which were  specifically used to keep pirated CD's are now being used to  keep blank cassette tapes. Some stall owners told me that in  the past, they knew generally that sales of pirated audiovisual  products were not permitted by the state, but the profits were  high, and the business had become popular in Guangdong, and they  never received any notice saying that this was unlawful behavior  and must be strictly banned, so they dared to do it. They also  said that the confiscation this time did not really cause great  economic losses to them, but they would not wantonly sell  pirated CD's and LD's for a short period to come.  <H5>  Copyright Law Badly Needs To Be Publicized </H5>   Looking at this mighty unified inspection campaign, various  social quarters in Guangdong have responded differently. The  departments in charge of culture and publications have hated  this kind of copyright piracy and infringement for a long time,  and a manufacturer of audiovisual products said that this kind  of behavior, which infringes on the legitimate rights of  copyright holders, should have been severely punished through  legislation a long time ago. A person in charge of Guangdong  Provincial Copyright Bureau said that the current 23 CD  production lines in 16 factories inside the province will be  included under press and publications management, and the China  Press and Publications Administration will soon promulgate  regulations on the registration and examination of CD  copyrights, while the relevant departments will coordinate  efforts with the customs department in cracking down on the  smuggling of pirated CD's and LD's. Regarding the stalls or  wholesalers which sell audiovisual products, a management method  of "first permit, then license" will be practiced; that is, they  must first apply for permits from the administrative department,  then apply for licenses from the industrial and commercial  management department. As for the manufacturers and retailers  who stubbornly go the wrong way, they will be punished according  to law. This move is not to restrict the development of CD's,  but to guide the production of audiovisual products onto a  healthy track of development.    When the public saw piles of CD's being crushed to dust by  the steamroller, the first response of many citizens was: Too  bad. Some citizens said that original CD's, especially some new  ones, are too expensive, whereas pirated CD's suit the  purchasing power of the ordinary citizens. They added that some  Hong Kong and Taiwan singers have also relied on pirated CD's  and tapes to become popular on the mainland.    Here we can see that it is an urgent task to crack down on  copyright piracy and infringement, and to protect intellectual  property; and that the relevant quarters must adopt  corresponding measures to publicize the sense of the copyright  law and establish the correct values among the citizens.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JURY SAYS TRANSIENT UNFIT FOR TRIAL IN GIRLFRIEND'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A 22-year-old transient who told jurors that he is a "fallen angel" and has  conversed with Jesus was found incompetent to stand trial in the stabbing death  of his girlfriend.  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated for about three hours before  deciding that Christopher Michael Rowland is incapable of cooperating with his  attorney and assisting in his defense as required by state law and the U.S.  Constitution.  </P> <P> Rowland is accused of stabbing 18-year-old Roberta Mosentheim in a Van Nuys  motel on Feb. 12. The couple had known each other only eight days but were  planning to be married, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Judge James M. Coleman ordered Rowland to return to court on Dec. 17, when he  is expected to be sent to a mental health facility recommended by county health  officials.  </P> <P> An earlier jury charged with assessing Rowland's competence deadlocked, 9 to 3,  in favor of finding Rowland incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> During the second hearing, Rowland reiterated his claims that he had spoken to  Jesus and was a fallen angel. Three psychiatrists, called as witnesses by  Rowland's attorney, testified that Rowland is a paranoid schizophrenic and  suffers from severe depression.  </P> <P> Rowland insisted that he is competent to stand trial and accused the public  defender's office of working with prosecutors to lock him away in a mental  hospital.  </P> <P> Mosentheim's body was found in the Chateau Motel in the 6700 block of Sepulveda  Boulevard with Rowland's T-shirt draped over her head. Family members said  Mosentheim fell in love with Rowland after being introduced to him by her  brother, who brought Rowland home after meeting him on a bus.  </P> <P> Rowland had been released on parole from state prison in Chino two months  before the killing after serving four years for assault, police said.  </P> <P> Rowland's attorney, Deputy Public Defender William Thornbury, said Rowland will  probably undergo treatment with medication and counseling. If he later is found  to be mentally competent, he will be returned to stand trial.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guido Passalacqua: "Maroni: `Yes, Forza Italia </F> Asked Me To Betray'"]    [Text] Varese -- The war between [League Secretary Umberto]  Bossi and [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi is still  raging. Last Monday afternoon [21 March], in Turin, the  League's leader was bombarded with telephone calls from  Berlusconi, who was trying to soften his positions, but Bossi  steered full steam ahead. Yesterday, in Novara, he said: "We  have nothing in common with Berlusconi." In his TV appeal to  voters, which had just been recorded, he made no concessions.  His ideas are clear-cut: "There are those who do not want to  change anything, namely the Left; those who want to change  something, namely Forza Italia; and those who want to carry out  a revolution, namely the League." In short, nothing has changed  between the two halfhearted allies. To complicate matters even  more, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has been courting the  bandwagon's [League nickname] colonels -- first and foremost  Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader].    Maroni, have you received any offers from Forza Italia to  change sides? "No explicit offers," Maroni replied. Bossi's  "adopted son" (the nickname was coined by Bossi himself), who is  also the League's number two, did not pull back, did not hide  behind words or deny the allegations. No explicit advances were  made, but advances were made at any rate. Maroni explained:  "Suggestions were made. However, it was not Berlusconi who made  them, but other people." And what did you reply? The League's  "Doctor Subtle," who is notoriously a staunch Milan soccer team  supporter, answered in jest: "Tell the Knight that, given that I  am supporter of the Devil [Milan soccer team nickname], I will  join him only if he obtains for me the number 10 jersey in the  Milan team, the one worn by Savicevic. I would be happy to play  at San Siro [stadium] just for 10 minutes." Maroni laughed and,  in response to a journalist who cast doubts on the truthfulness  of this reply to Berlusconi's overtures, he said: "This is  exactly what I said. Why, do you find it unbelievable?"    In short, feelers and offers have been put forward, and  these  were addressed not only to Maroni and [League's Milan Mayor]  Formentini, but to many others too. Maroni then went on to  repeat the recent jibe about Berlusconi's candidacy for the  premiership: "If he fails to get elected in Rome, standing  against such a nonentity as [Budget Minister] Spaventa, he will  have to give up becoming prime minister."    For weeks, League outgoing deputies and high-ranking  officials have been bombarded with phone calls and even faxes  inviting them to leave the Bandwagon and rally to Berlusconi's  tricolor symbol. This has been a large-scale recruiting  campaign, aimed at weakening the League and transforming it into  a submissive spare tire of Berlusconi's project. This explains  Bossi's campaign against Berlusconi, including the circulars,  signed by the Bandwagon's leader, against conducting a common  electoral campaign with Forza Italia. Maroni calmly explained:  "A recruiting campaign? Of course. An avalanche of faxes.  But those who received them, or who were made an offer,  immediately reported them to us. This is how the League's  supporters are -- in politics they follow their hearts, they are  not interested in personal profit."    Maroni was not unduly upset, he almost took for granted that  the League's ally would wage this kind of offensive. "It is  only natural. Berlusconi regards the League as one of his  businesses, one among many. However, the League is a political  movement which was built by its activists with their blood and  tears. Within a company, officials can be turncoats, they can  be bought, it is enough to offer them more, and they can also be  fired on the spot. However, the League is not a company. We are  not managers, we are political leaders who believe in  federalism. Berlusconi's men are exclusively rational,  calculating. We are emotive, personally committed. They  believe the League's supporters can easily be won over by making  rational offers, but we are not at all like this."    What about those who have already changed sides, those who  have joined National Alliance [AN]? Maroni gave a prompt reply:  "Any party can be infiltrated by agents, but, you see, as far  as they are concerned, no recruiting campaign was necessary.  They were all ready to leave anyway."    Senate floor leader Enrico Speroni, speaking from Rome, made  the same point, though his tone was somewhat different:  "Opportunists and venomous snakes are well advised to leave,"  he said, commenting on the departure of a number of former  deputies, town councilors, and party officials, who followed  Fini's [secretary of the Italian Social Movement, MSI] call.  Speroni also had some cutting remarks in store for Senator  Gianfranco Miglio, the independent League supporter and  theoretician of a bandwagon moving steadily toward secession.  In fact, in a recent interview Miglio was self-critical: "The  alliance with Berlusconi was a mistake. I was in favor of it,  but today I must recognize that it would have been better to go  into the elections on our own." However, arguing against  professor Miglio, who believes that many former League  supporters will vote tomorrow for National Alliance, Speroni  said: "Those who chose the League did so because they believe  in federalism. Therefore they can join anybody they like, but  certainly not the statist and centralist MSI. These guys really  understand nothing at all."    For his part Maroni, addressing AN, made a mock overture:  "If Fini accepts federalism, then we can talk, but in order to  do so he will have to disown 40 years of his past, and all the  days spent on his electoral campaign, his speeches, and his  statements."</p>

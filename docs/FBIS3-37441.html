He said the country's mass media are on the decline  and Russia is facing the possible loss of its national  television, because "it costs three trillion roubles a year, and  the Finance Ministry wants to drop it from the budget".    Poltoranin, who is now heading the House Committee on  Information Policy and Communications, said a law on television  is being drafted, and hearings about the economic situation of  the mass media will be held in the parliament at the end of  February.    Poltoranin said parliamentary correspondents are deprived of  any possibility to cover the activity of the State Duma because  the Duma Council, factions, groups and committees have developed  a practice of meeting behind closed doors. Journalists are  therefore unable to get any first-hand information.    The Duma decided to consider a draft federal law "on the  coverage of the activity of the bodies of state authority of the  Russian Federation by the mass media" before March 21, 1994.</p>

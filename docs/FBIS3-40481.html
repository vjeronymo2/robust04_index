			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corporation (PNC) has completed the loading of internal core  fuel assemblies (108 units) in the prototype fast breeder  reactor (FBR) ``Monju'' (rated output 280,000 kilowatts), which  started on 13 October, and it began evaluation tests on flow  distribution in the core on 4 November. In these tests,  instruments to measure flow will be installed in the reactor and  the flow of natrium circulating among the fuel assemblies will  be measured and evaluated.    To cool the ``Monju's'' core efficiently, the coolant  natrium  is circulated in response to the amount of heat generated by  core fuel assemblies and blanket fuel assemblies, important  components of the core. Evaluation testing will continue until  around the beginning of February 1994.</p>

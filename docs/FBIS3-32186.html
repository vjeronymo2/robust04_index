Jean-Louis denounced  occupation of the Senate seats by the 18 January  parliamentarians, protesting that their presence in the Upper  Chamber is prejudicial to its proper functioning. The following  is a report by Daly Valet.    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] Whereas everybody would  like to see the national institutions become strong so they can  work to resolve all the problems caused the country by the 30  hurricane [as heard]. The Senate of the Republic finds itself in  a garden full of bears without the prospect of a solution.  Before that, there was the phenomenon of abnormality. Then there  was the August 1993 normalization that allowed the election of  Firmin Jean-Louis as Senate President and the ratification of  Robert Malval as prime minister. Today, what is being observed  is denormalization. All the changes in the Senate office have  failed. The cause of all these problems is the 18 January  parliamentarians who many legitimate parliamentarians consider a  blight bequeathed to the country by the de facto Marc Bazin  government. According to some senators, Bazin, who was in charge  of resolving the country's crisis, further complicated it with  the 18 January elections. The crisis has recently reached a new  turning point with the ad hoc office set up by Ebrane Cadet,  which parallels the office of Firmin Jean-Louis. This office  includes some 18 January parliamentarians. What is being done in  the Senate is illegal; there are no sessions; the 18 January  parliamentarians have occupied the Senate. This is a statement  by Firmin Jean-Louis, who added that Sen. Ebrane Cadet has  assured him that there is no second office in the Senate.    [Jean-Louis] The places have been occupied by the  controversial 18 January parliamentarians. The seats have been  filled by Sen. Cadet who pretends to be conducting sessions. But  he has told me in letters he has written me and in all his  contacts with me that there is only one office, the one presided  over by us. The senator himself said so. [passage omitted]    [Valet] What is being said and what is being done are two  different things. Everybody can see that the ad hoc office of  Ebrane Cadet, which is occupied by the 18 January  parliamentarians, is gaining ground in the Senate. They voted  resolutions, are preparing other resolution projects, are making  statement after statement, and are holding meetings after  meetings. Firmin Jean-Louis protested and stated that this de  facto situation has blocked the Senate in its constitutional  work. [passage omitted]    As for the question of parliament's dissolution, the Senate  president said he does not take this matter seriously. The  senator said the parliament could be dissolved only by another  coup d'etat or if the men, the powerful men, decided to kill all  parliamentarians. [passage omitted]    We must inform you that while the 18 January  parliamentarians  occupy the session room of the Senate with Ebrane Cadet and  other Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion parliamentarians,  Firmin Jean-Louis holds formal meetings in his office. located  at the former premises of the National Office of Tourism from  time to time with the other senators who remain faithful to him.

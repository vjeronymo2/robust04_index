			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banks' reference system to change - In a Nutshell Businesses seeking bank credit references on potential or existing clients must prepare to change their ways. For decades banks have played their part in the provision of 'one bank and two trade references' which have been the sum total of many companies' credit management systems. But from yesterday, the clearing banks require suppliers to approach their customers' banks for a reference. Until now suppliers have approached their own banks who in turn went to the customers' banks for the reference. The change has a number of implications. Banks supply some customers with the reference service free of charge but the new references will cost the supplier at least Pounds 8. More importantly, it could damage relations with potential customers. Before giving a reference the customer's bank will need its client's permission which in turn means the supplier will need to seek permission for that reference. Some suppliers may find this awkward in the middle of a sales pitch. Companies may decide a more comprehensive service is available from the specialised credit information suppliers for very little extra cost.</p>

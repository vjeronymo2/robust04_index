			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canadian investment for French gas utility Gaz de France is injecting CDollars 100m (USDollars 75.2m) into Noverco, the holding company that controls Quebec's regulated natural gas distributor and several non-regulated businesses. This gives the French utility 24 per cent of Noverco, which has been looking for a strategic partner for some time. It becomes a partner in Noverco with Soquip, a Quebec government energy agency (38 per cent), the Caisse de Depot (30 per cent), and Levesque Beaubien (8 per cent). Noverco and Soquip control gas production in western Canada and the gas pipeline between Montreal and Quebec City. The Caisse de Depot, with assets of nearly CDollars 45bn, manages the Quebec public sector pension funds. Gaz de France said its investment was part of its international expansion. The two groups have had technical partnerships for some time. Noverco's gas distribution unit, Gaz Metropolitain, has a pipeline network covering more than 5,000 miles (8,000km) in Quebec and Vermont. It bought New England Gas last year and plans to become a significant force in the north-eastern US. Its long-term strategy includes using the St Lawrence Valley as a distribution hub with direct pipeline connection to the Boston area. For the year ended September 30, Gaz Metro had sales of more than CDollars 1bn and profit of CDollars 111.4m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A media briefing took place in Moscow today.  Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays, chairman of the State Committee  for Management of State Property, spoke at it. The majority of  his talk was devoted to the plans for privatization and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly. You  can hear the second part of Anatoliy Borisovich's news  conference tomorrow. But now we shall tell you about, we shall  dwell on, the other no less important and urgent questions which  Anataoliy Chubays touched upon.    [Begin Chubays recording] A few words about the Duma's  amnesty decision. Overall I must say that this decision of  course qualitatively alters the situation, in the sense that the  Duma and its leader, Rybkin, have revealed their true colors,  and have called a spade a spade. Everything can now be seen in  its true light. Any illusions which existed before on this  matter have now been dispelled. Everyone should be clear about  this.    To tell the truth, I am concerned not only about Khasbulatov  and Rutskoy, personally -- good luck to them. What I am worried  about is that the decision in the form in which it has been  adopted, this decision essentially saves actual murderers -- and  I use these words advisedly -- actual murderers from any  punishment at all. There is, for example, a certain  Shtukaturov who, it was established during an investigation,  personally fired a grenade launcher at Ostankino. Four people  died as a result of that shot, including one video engineering  and three cloakroom assistants.    Totally innocent people died. Their blood is on the hands of  the murderers. Since the moment the amnesty decision was made,  the blood is also on the hands of those who voted for it.  Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov personally, have blood on  their hands and so have their groupings.    I would like to ask Zhirinovskiy personally, and Zyuganov  personally, to go and meet the families of the people who died  -- if only the families of the cloakroom attendants and the  video engineer -- and to explain their actions and how they can  justify their decision. What they will have is not an abstract  vote in the Duma but a conversation with living people, the  relatives of those who died at the hands of murderers who will  be at liberty tomorrow, and who did not use cold steel -- a  knife or a pistol -- but fired a grenade launcher in the capital  in broad daylight on a Sunday. This man is to be freed tomorrow  thanks to the decision of the State Duma. [end recording]</p>

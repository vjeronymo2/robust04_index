			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities stunned by latest Wall Street sell-off - Market Report The UK stock market posted its fifth heaviest fall this year as the big sell-off on Wall Street, which started on Monday, gathered pace, triggering further sharp losses across world markets. At the end of a trading session fraught with anxiety, the FT-SE 100 Index closed a further 51.2 or 1.6 per cent lower at 3,027.5. Since the start of the week the index has fallen 103.5 points or 3.3 per cent. The weakness encompassed the second liners and smaller stocks, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index losing 56.5 or 1.6 per cent at 3,488.8. The market's negative trend was reinforced by a massive derivatives operation - believed to be the single largest in UK options - carried out by NatWest Securities. The house bought more than 20,000 puts giving the right to sell the Footsie at 2,800 in January. Dealers commented that the trade probably did not represent the view that the Footsie would fall to that level. It was seen as part of an arbitrage possibly enabling the house to go short on the Footsie and buy into an overseas market, possibly the Nikkei or the Dow. However, it still represented a gloomy view of London's prospects. The extent of Wall Street's weakness on Tuesday evening shocked analysts. The 91-point drop in the Dow Average came in the wake of a 46-point slide on Monday, leaving the Dow with a fall of above 3.6 per cent on the week to date. And there was more bad news for international markets, including London, when the Dow slid more than 30 points shortly after the US market opened yesterday. Marketmakers in London were in no mood to absorb stock at the start of trading, and dropped their opening prices to head off any large-scale selling. The Footsie opened around 40 points lower and staged a brief rally to the 3,042 mark. However, support quickly crumbled and the index was soon back on the downward path as traders picked up the scent of another retreat by Wall Street. At its worst the FT-SE 100 was down 68.6, and the market was alive with wild rumours that Wall Street was about to stage a fall of 1987 proportions. 'For a while the market got very spooky indeed,' said a dealer. Wall Street's opening, although weak, brought a measure of relief to the market here, and shares stabilised and then edged up to close well above the day's lows. Trends in international bond markets gave a measure of support to equities. US Treasury bonds responded to the success of the latest auction of five-year bonds, German bunds rose sharply in the wake of better than expected money supply news in Germany, and gilts made rapid progress. Turnover reached 710.8m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 55 per cent of the total. Customer business was 'poor', with trading between marketmakers, always anxious to avoid carrying large lines of stock on their books in such volatile conditions, said to have been exceptionally heavy. There was some comfort for the market with news that the strategy team at UBS, one of the more bearish securities houses, has increased its mid-1995 FT-SE 100 target by 200 points to 3,200 and its end-1995 target by the same amount to 3,400, after positive revisions to its UK economic forecasts. UBS's Mr Bill Martin has raised his forecast of UK growth in GDP by 1/2 percentage point to 4 1/4 per cent, cut his inflation forecast by 1 1/4 percentage points to 3 1/2 per cent and, most importantly, cut his end-1995 forecast of UK base rates by 2 percentage points to 8 per cent. Dealers are hoping for a period of calm in European markets, which they expect to trade quietly during today's Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Wall Street opens for a half day on Friday. 'We are not looking for many fireworks until the Budget on Tuesday,' said one.</p>

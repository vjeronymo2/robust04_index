			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Bulgaria said that 250,000 ethnic Turks have applied to emigrate to Turkey and  150,000 already have passports allowing them to leave. In Sofia, a deputy  foreign minister said about 50,000 "Bulgarian Muslims" have crossed the border  into Turkey in the past month. In keeping with Bulgarian practice, he refused  to speak of ethnic Turks. The estimated 1 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria,  about one-ninth of the country's population, have been forced to adopt  Bulgarian names since 1984 and have seen their language and religion banned.  </P></p>

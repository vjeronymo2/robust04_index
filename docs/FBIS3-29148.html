Some 1,000 people including Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi  Takemura attended a government-sponsored ceremony at the  National Education Center in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward.    Takemura read out a congratulatory message from Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who is currently in Washington for  talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.    "To gain more trust from the international community, we  have  to go the limits to fulfill our responsibilities," the message  said.    Also present at the ceremony were House of Councillors  President Bumpei Hara and House of Representatives Vice Speaker  Hyosuke Kujiraoka.    However, lower house Speaker Takako Doi, who has been  criticizing the February 11 national holiday as an attempt to  revive the Meiji- era empire day, celebrated until the end of  World War II, missed the ceremonies due to other commitments.    A rally organized by the Social Democratic Party and  citizens  backing the country's pacifist Constitution criticized that  Japan almost 50 years after the war has not "correctly"  recognized its war responsibilities nor paid compensation to  victims of Japanese occupation.    None of the six SDP cabinet members nor SDP Chairman  Tomiichi  Murayama was present at the meeting.    Some 450 people demonstrated in Shinjuku ward against the  emperor and empress's use of a Self-Defense Forces aircraft to  visit the Ogasawara islands from Saturday to pay respect to the  souls of fallen Imperial Japanese Army troops.</p>

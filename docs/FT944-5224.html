			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: When smoke gets in passengers' eyes Imagine sleeping away the overnight flight from San Francisco to London in a comfortable, non-smoking Upper Class seat on a Virgin Atlantic jumbo - only to be woken by waves of smoke puffed out 3ft away, writes John Westbrooke. It happens because Virgin Atlantic has replaced a central block of Upper Class seats with a lounge: a circular table surrounded by chairs but not partitioned off. In line with the airline's hedonist philosophy, the area is used for massages and manicures - and for smoking, though the seats on either side are non-smoking. This can be a rude awakening for any traveller. The airline says it is constantly monitoring passenger opinions on the question of smoking. For example, included in its new interactive video system, which is not yet available on all routes, will be questionnaires which Virgin hopes will enable it to canvass passengers' opinions on such topics, and respond promptly. Nonetheless, Virgin is - uncharacteristically - lagging behind the non-smoking trend. The leader is Delta, which from January 1 will outlaw smoking on any route, anywhere. The response to its first non-smoking trials a year ago was so favourable that, though it expects to lose some passengers, it is going ahead with a complete ban. The fact that Delta is an American airline no doubt helps. A bill banning smoking on all transatlantic flights is on its way through the US Congress. But it will be some time before anyone bans cigarettes on Middle East or East Asia routes, and some third-world airlines still split aircraft into smoking and non-smoking sections down the middle. Canada and Scandinavia are among those that bar smoking on internal flights. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN body, wants a worldwide ban by 1996, but this will be voluntary. Other airlines say they are responding to customer wishes without aiming at ultimate smokelessness. When it has two flights a day between two cities, British Airways makes one of them non-smoking. All its services to Australia, and all short flights to and from Continental Europe, are already smoke-free. On the other hand, Scandinavian airline SAS last year imposed a trial ban on international flights and had to call it off after only two months, as passengers complained. Feel free to tell your airline what you think about this issue: it will listen. Meanwhile, if you want to take your mind off your exposure to passive smoking, next year Virgin will introduce mail-order shopping and credit-card gambling on its entertainment channels.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Delors reshuffles the European Commission pack: David Gardner and Andrew Hill examine the prospects for success of the Community's new team at the top in Brussels THERE WAS no blood detectable on the carpet of Brussels' Egmont Palace yesterday morning after Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, shuffled the portfolios and gave his 16 fellow commissioners their jobs for the next two years. Prior expectations inside the Eurocracy of histrionics and tantrums were misplaced. A mere ceremonial 15 minutes did the job because by last weekend the hard bargaining had been completed. What has emerged is a reasonably balanced Commission, with a strong foreign and trade policy team, a marginally higher political profile, a pragmatic approach to competition and industrial policy, tight budgetary control, and little sign of priority being assigned to areas such as environment and social policy, which the previous executive had high hopes of developing. Mr Delors, of course, remains the primus inter pares of the 17-member college. But now he is flanked by four or five political heavyweights, against two or three at most in the outgoing Commission. The heaviest hitters will be Mr Hans van den Broek, until this week the Dutch foreign minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, until now in charge of competition policy and a former British cabinet minister under Mrs Thatcher. They divide between them the job that overwhelmed Mr Frans Andriessen, the departing Dutch external affairs commissioner. Mr Van den Broek, a Christian Democrat who chaired the council of ministers in the run-up to Maastricht and handled the early stages of the Yugoslav crisis, has two more big challenges. He will both develop the Commission's contribution to the EC's emerging common foreign and security policy, and be in charge of enlargement, opening negotiations next year on EC entry with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and probably Norway. Sir Leon, one of the most powerful members of the last Commission, will be in charge of trade policy, and economic relations with the industrialised world, China, east and central Europe, and the former Soviet Union. He had wanted charge of enlargement too. But the federalist majority of the 12 - suspicious of the UK's attempts to 'widen' the EC at the expense of 'deepening' it - felt more comfortable with the integrationist Mr Van den Broek, even though Sir Leon's communautaire credentials are now well-established. Both men, however, are Atlanticist and free-traders, boding well for relations with the US. Senior Brussels officials say they themselves agreed on their share-out last week, and should be able to work in relative harmony. Mr Manuel Marin, a Spanish socialist, takes full charge of development and humanitarian aid, adding relations with the south Mediterranean, Middle East, Asia and Latin America to his previous responsibilities for the Lome convention countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Conventional wisdom yesterday was that the loser in this share-out was Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the well-regarded former conservative Portuguese foreign minister. Formally he will be in charge of relations with a strengthened European parliament, and 'with member states with regard to openness, communicaton and information'. Mr Pinheiro, however, wanted this job and could bring a high political profile to selling the EC as a more democratic body which is responsive to its citizens - a sensitive task if the EC is to recover from its current unpopularity. Competition policy goes to Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian socialist who can claim high credit for liberalising EC transport policy, and, after the departure of the flamboyant Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, for preventing a wholesale roll-back of EC environment policy. Mr Van Miert is a pragmatic socialist like Mr Delors, with whom he is closely allied. A transfer of the powerful competition portfolio was a top priority for France, which felt Sir Leon's approach was too doctrinaire, and impeded development of a French-style industrial policy. Mr Van Miert's appointment does not mean such a policy is coming; it does mean pure competition will not be the overriding priority it was under Sir Leon. Mr Martin Bangemann, a German liberal who yet raged against Sir Leon's 'ayatollahs' in the competition directorate, adds telecommunications and information technology to his industry portfolio. This falls far short of his ambition to create an EC version of Japan's Miti by adding trade policy to industry. But it gives a small fillip to efforts to develop an EC-wide industrial strategy. So too does the regrouping of part of training with basic research, under the new Italian socialist commissioner, Mr Antonio Ruberti, a former research minister and rector of La Sapienza University in Rome. Mr Henning Christophersen, a Danish liberal, stays in the economic policy job he has done competently, which will become more important if Maastricht is now ratified, and economic and monetary union is reaffirmed as a central EC goal. Mr Peter Schmidhuber, a German Christian Democrat, keeps control of the budget, adding the new Cohesion Fund for the poorer member states. But most of the new 'cohesion' money will be managed at the regional policy directorate by Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour secretary of state for Scotland, who stays in a job he has done with the quiet efficiency of a Scottish accountant. Social affairs, which the Greek socialist and UK bete noire Ms Vasso Papandreou is vacating, goes to Mr Padraig Flynn, a former Fianna Fail Irish justice minister, along with a new job monitoring EC immigration policies. Mr Flynn achieved notoriety at home for his views against abortion, divorce and on the role of women, and his appointment was greeted with reserve in the Brussels social affairs directorate. Environment goes to Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, a conservative former Greek finance minister. A senior official who will be working with him was sanguine yesterday, but pointed out that last time round his boss had to be revived with brandy on hearing of the appointment of Mr Ripa di Meana - who put environment policy on the EC map.</p>

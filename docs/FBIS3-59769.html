			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute,  Nagoya, has developed process technology in which a  titanium-aluminum powder is injection-molded and sintered. This  development is based on the development project entitled ``Super  Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials'' under MITI's Next  Generation Industrial Basic Technology R&amp;D System. It is a  technique for freely deforming and processing intermetallic  compounds, which are notoriously hard to process, into complex  shapes. GIRI, Nagoya, established this technology in a series of  manufacturing steps by first using an injection molding machine  to mold commercial titanium-aluminum powder and then sintering  it in a vacuum furnace. GIRI, Nagoya, plans to develop new  materials in the future with this process.    The Super Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials  Project is an eight-year project running from 1989 to 1996, and  development proceeds through an industry-academia-government  joint structure. The intermetallic compounds targeted for  development are strong at high temperatures such as  titanium-aluminum (1100&deg;C), niobium-aluminum (1800&deg;C)  and the like. Their applications are likely to include  aeronautics and space, such as the super plane that is expected  to appear in the 21st Century, new forms of energy, etc. GIRI,  Nagoya, conducted its R&amp;D on injection molding and metallurgy  with powders of intermetallic compounds based on the injection  molding process for ceramics that it developed from 1981 through  1988.    This new process consists bringing together commercially  available titanium-aluminum powder, an injection molding machine  used for plastics, and a vacuum furnace. Researchers mixed wax  and resin as binders with the powdered alloy at 150&deg;C,  formed pellets, injection molded, removed the binder by  evaporation, and sintered the product in a vacuum furnace.  Injection molding of metal powders has been performed with  stainless steel for use as parts in watches, etc., but this is  the first time it has been accomplished with an intermetallic  compound.    Because the main goal of this project is not development of  new materials, the sample pieces do have good material  properties, but the fact that this manufacturing process enables  titanium-aluminum injection molding is a major step forward.  Researchers plan to continue studies from the standpoint of  material properties by adding strengthening elements, etc., in  the future. The features of this injection molding/sintering  process are that the work environment is good, material losses  are small, complex shapes are possible, etc. It is attracting  attention as a new method to be used in place of precision  casting.</p>

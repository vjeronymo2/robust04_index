			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- On the first day of  February this year, when newly-appointed director of the money-  losing Shanghai No. 12 Woolen Textile Mill Wan Deming assumed  office, he was chased by crowds of creditors and workers asking  for payment.    Within one month Wan had cleared up the debts and the mill  had earned a net profit of 90,000 yuan. In the second month  this had risen to 180,000 yuan and in the third to 500,000 yuan.    The 56-year-old Wan attributed this success to his  experience  at the Shanghai no.2 woolen textile mill, a noted profit-making  enterprise where he serves as concurrent director.    "The main reason why the No. 12 Woolen Textile Mill had been  in the red for five years running and lost 61.52 million yuan  was because its accounts were not in order and a few employees  fished in troubled waters," said Wan who became an apprentice at  a textile mill at the age of 16 and completed a college course  through self- study.    Soon after Yang Guangjie from the Shanghai No. 25 Cotton  Textile Mill, a profit-making enterprise, became the head of the  Shanghai Hongzhang Cotton Textile Mill, he was mocked and left  out in the cold. Many professional skilled workers had  transferred to other work units.    While reforming the labor and income distribution systems by  selecting and putting talented people in important positions,  Yang concentrated on developing new products and setting up  joint ventures in co-operation with Hong Kong and Taiwan  business people.    As a result, the mill has resumed its vitality, and the  average employees' wages are expected to reach the middle or top  levels of Shanghai's textile industry this year.    To get experienced managers to work in money-losing  enterprises is one way to help these factories to extricate  themselves from their difficult position, according to Jiang  Yiren, vice-mayor in charge of industry.    "While supporting state enterprises with better economic  results," he said, "we must help the struggling ones change  their operational mechanism and make profits in line with their  conditions."    By the end of last November Shanghai had 277 money-losing  state enterprises, accounting for 28.9 percent of its total.    "The general debility of state enterprises hampers the  national economy and the people's livelihood," said Wu Bangguo,  member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of China (CPC) and secretary of the CPC's  Shanghai Municipal Committee.    "State enterprises are the backbone of the national economy,  and have contributed 80 percent of the state's 500 billion yuan  tax revenues over the past four decades," he said. "Shanghai's  economy can hardly develop without these enterprises."    Under the old central planning system state enterprises used  to make products according to the plans of the government, which  offered them production materials and took charge of disposing  of all the products.    As the government encouraged market economy, a number of  major state enterprises did not known what to do or how to adapt  to the market.    One example is the Shanghai heavy machinery plant, a major  state enterprise with 10,000 employees, which was at a loss what  to do and daily getting deeper in debt.    It was at this time that the government sent an official to  the plant to turn it to market-oriented production.    "We used to wait for state contracts," a plant official  said.  "Now our salesmen positively go out to collect orders and our  employees voluntarily work extra shifts to fulfil orders ahead  of schedule. We also offer after-sale service, and the sales  volume this year is scheduled to reach 600 million yuan-worth."    This year 46 money-losing industrial enterprises in Shanghai  are expected to begin making profits. Meanwhile, some which  have been in the red for a long time and of which the property  can hardly pay its debts in kind, will close down, merges with  other enterprises or go bankrupt.</p>

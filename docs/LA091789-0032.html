			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SOBERING THOUGHT  </P> <P> Gregory Harrison, who "Bares Soul to Help Drug Abuse Victims" ("From Addict to  Role Model," by Lynn Simross, Sept. 5) also bares a considerable ego. As a  two-year member of Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous, he must surely  have heard the 11th tradition of the fellowship, which is read at every  meeting: ". . . we need always to maintain personal anonymity at the level of  press, radio, and films."  </P> <P> MICHAEL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

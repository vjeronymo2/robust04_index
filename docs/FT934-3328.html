			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Observer: Yesterday's man So what does Sir Peter Thompson, Britain's leading disciple of wider share ownership, make of the latest developments at his old company, NFC? Yesterday's Pounds 263m rights issue means that NFC is even closer to losing its status as one of the few companies where the employees have some control over events. When Observer finally caught up with Sir Peter, en route to the annual dinner of his current hobby horse ProShare, he was reluctant to pass judgment. He had not seen the announcement and insisted that he was 'no longer the keeper of NFC's soul'. However, he expressed some sadness at the steady dilution of the NFC employees' shareholding. 'It is something I fought very hard for,' says Sir Peter, who now admits that it is very hard to resist commercial pressures when a company is floated on the stock market. He didn't sound quite so dispirited when he brought NFC to market in 1989.</p>

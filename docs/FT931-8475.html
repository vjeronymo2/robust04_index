			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Quotes of the day The latest joke from New York is that the new definition of the wealthy is anyone who isn't homeless.  -Mr Mike Cowan, chief administrative officer at Merrill Lynch in London I'm a Republican, but this represents an honest attempt to deal with the underlying problems of the US. I'm going to be a loser and so are most of the other people I know, but I live pretty well.  - Mr Edward Streator, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in London I'm not all that upset about the increase. Living in the UK for a year and a half I realise that we Americans have had a very low rate of tax in the past. - Mr Bruce Lassman, head of the US tax desk at accountants Ernst &amp; Young in London I'm a supporter of Clinton and I always felt tax increases were necessary. For 12 years we've been getting away from the social problems, the homelessness. . . state health care has to be improved, the deficit has to be attacked and I think Americans will accept that.  - Mr Jeff Burke, who works for a US investment bank in London I'm concerned about tax, but you have to strike a balance between taxes and spending. In the past 12 years the administration has done nothing to help the distribution of wealth. These are bold steps.  - Mr Joseph V. Missett, who moved to London to trade crude oil It will affect me deeply. I'm shattered. We're already paying high taxes - I'm paying at least 31 per cent.  - Marianne, a currency trader in New York</p>

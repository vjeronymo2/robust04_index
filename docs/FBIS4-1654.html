			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Foreign Economic </F> Relations and Trade and the Ministry of Finance Concerning the  Administration of the International Economic Cooperation Fund"  -- promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation in Beijing on 5 October 1993]    [Text]Chapter 1 General Provisions    Article 1. The purpose of the establishment of the  "International Economic Cooperation Fund" (called the "Fund"  hereafter), sanctioned by the central government, is as follows:  To support the development of China's cooperation with foreign  countries in the fields of economics and technology and to  provide part of the working funds (Chinese or foreign currency)  for the International Economic Cooperation and Technological  Company (called the "Company" hereafter) and relevant units that  contract projects abroad, operate wholly-owned enterprises or  joint ventures, or work in coordination with bilateral or  multilateral technical aid projects given gratis to China.    Article 2. The main resource of the Fund is the sum returned  to China from countries that received loans from China during  the period from 1984 to 1988.    Article 3. The Fund is administered by the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT]. The actual work  is conducted by the Bank of China (foreign currency) and the  Bank of Construction (renminbi). Financial administration is  guided and supervised by the Ministry of Finance and the banks  concerned.  <H5>  Chapter 2 Loan Procedures </H5>   Article 4. All companies and other relevant units, which are  sanctioned by the State Council or MOFERT, are entitled to loans  from the Fund for contracted projects abroad, wholly-owned  enterprises or joint ventures, and bilateral or multilateral  technical aid projects given to China. The conditions for  receiving loans are as follows:    1. The contracted projects abroad, the wholly-owned  enterprises, and the joint ventures should have sound economic  returns;    2. The borrowing unit should have the capacity to  repayment and should be able to guarantee repayment of loans and  payment of service charges on schedule;    3. The borrowing unit should be able to provide a  letter of guarantee from the financial department of the  ministry or state commission in charge, or from the planning  commission or financial department of a province, autonomous  region, or municipality;    4. The borrowing unit may apply for the loan only  after it has fully utilized its own funds and bank loans and its  financial means are still insufficient. Projects encouraged by  the state are given priority for loans.    Article 5. The principles for use of a loan are: The  borrowing and repaying units must be the same entity and must  pay back both the loan and all charges. The interim annual  interest rate for renminbi is 3.0 percent, and for foreign  currency 4.0 percent, both of which include a 0.2 percent bank  service charge. If the loan is in foreign currency, the service  fee is calculated according to provisions of the Bank of China,  and collected once every six months. If the loan is in  renminbi, the service fee is calculated according to regulations  of the Bank of Construction.    Article 6. In case a borrowing unit is unable to repay a  loan in time, it generally must apply for postponement of the  payment to MOFERT and the bank concerned. If the reason is  justified, the postponement will be approved. If the reason is  not regarded as justified, the postponement will be denied and  the service charge will be raised by 50 to 100 percent of the  original charge rate after it becomes overdue. If necessary,  the bank can act upon the agreement by directly deducting the  sum from the borrowing unit's bank account. Or MOFERT can order  the guaranteeing unit to pay back both the loan and charges.    Article 7. The borrowing unit must abide by the principle  that the loan must be used for the approved purpose; it should  not be used for any other purpose. Otherwise, the loan will be  taken back within a limited period of time, and the service  charge will be doubled. If necessary, the borrowing unit will  be deprived of the right to future loans.  <H5>  Chapter 3 Loan Procedures </H5>   Article 8. In applying for a loan from MOFERT, a borrowing  unit must first submit a written application (see the form  attached to these Provisions) and a letter of guarantee from the  guaranteeing unit. Duplicate copies of the application and the  letter should be sent to the bank concerned. In the  application, the reason for the loan, its purpose, amount, time  limit, and repayment schedule should be stated. Then it should  be signed and sealed before submission. The guaranteeing unit  should state in its letter of guarantee that it shall be  responsible for repayment in case the borrowing unit fails to  clear the debt.    If the loan is used for a joint project abroad, a  certificate  of approval issued by the State Council or MOFERT should be  submitted. In case of a labor service or contracted project  abroad, a duplicate copy of the contract signed with a foreign  company should be produced.    Article 9. Upon receiving the written application and  guaranteeing unit's letter, MOFERT must immediately examine them  (if necessary, the Ministry can examine them together with the  Ministry of Finance and a bank, or entrust the bank to do the  examination) and determine the amount of the loan. Once the  application is examined and the amount fixed, the Ministry  should notify the applicant to go to the bank to go through the  necessary paperwork.    Article 10. Before the loan is approved, the bank and the  borrowing unit should sign a contract in duplicate--one for the  bank, the other for the borrowing unit. Copies of the contract  should also be sent to MOFERT, the Ministry of Finance, and  departments concerned.    Article 11. MOFERT, the Ministry of Finance, and the bank  have the right to supervise and examine the use of the loan, for  which the borrowing unit should provide the necessary  information and materials.  <H5>  Chapter 4 Supplementary Provisions </H5>   Article 12. MOFERT should draw up an annual plan covering  the revenue and expenditures of the Fund and final accounts, and  submit them to the Ministry of Finance. Operational expenses  for necessary activities, such as investigation, research, and  printing of certificates, conducted by MOFERT should be covered  by the service fees.    Article 13. These interim provisions shall go into effect on  January 1, 1985.  MOFERT Ministry of Finance October 24, 1984</p>

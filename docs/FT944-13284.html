			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Boredom test sorts out the Freds from the Wilmas A former Royal Navy deck officer has devised a way to identify those who can cope with long spells of boredom at work while staying alert for the unexpected, and weed out those who tend to nod off. The test is being marketed for use in recruitment for jobs such as airline pilots, train drivers and security personnel. Mr Martin Dyer-Smith, a researcher at the University of Northumbria, said the test was capable of sorting people into two categories that he had named 'Freds' and 'Wilmas', after the Flintstones cartoon characters. ASE, the firm of occupational psychologists, is marketing the test which involves computer screen tasks that look for vigilance and certain thinking abilities. Mr Dyer-Smith said Fred was a butterfly character not well suited to long periods of vigilance, whereas Wilma - his cartoon wife - had the concentration and attention to detail necessary for the job. He stressed that there was no gender issue, however, and that there was no shame in being a Fred. 'You may well be an absent-minded and dithering genius given to flashes of brilliance one minute and periods of complete inactivity the next,' he said. Mr Dyer-Smith, who worked out the test with a colleague, Mr Dave Wesson, told delegates at the Harrogate conference that he had developed his theories while serving in the Navy. Disasters at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, he said, could have been prevented had there not been a series of human errors in environments where the belief was that 'nothing could go wrong'. Mr Dyer-Smith said that in circumstances of low stimulation the natural human response was to slow down. The extension of this was to fall asleep. He asked: 'Who hasn't nodded off in a boring lecture?'</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REARDON TO STAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR AS RIO MESA COACH  </P> <P> John Reardon, Rio Mesa High's football coach for the past 22 years, has decided  to return for at least one more season. Reardon, 54, had considered retirement  during the fall when the Spartans posted a 4-6 record.  </P> <P> "I was thinking about retiring because there aren't too many people my age  still coaching football," he said. "But I didn't have a gut feeling about  leaving. I still enjoy working with the kids."  </P> <P> Although Rio Mesa is set for next season, 3 other Valley-area schools are  looking for football coaches. Crespi will select a replacement for Bill Redell  from among varsity assistants Jim Benkert, Tim Lins, Joel Wilker and sophomore  coach Rich Fong, all of whom have applied for the job. Interviews will begin  next week with a decision expected in 2 weeks.  </P> <P> St. Genevieve Principal Rudy Trujillo has set a Jan. 20 deadline for  applications in his search to replace Kevin Kane.  </P> <P> Westlake Athletic Director Bob Fisher has yet to set a deadline for candidates  to replace George Contreras, but Fisher has selected a swim coach. Ingrid  Daland, who runs a youth swim club in Thousand Oaks, will coach the school's  boys' and girls' teams this spring.  </P> <P> Fisher remains stymied in his search for a boys' tennis coach. Westlake  advanced to the Southern Section 4-A Division final last season under Coach  Jaime Barajas, who resigned after the season. JOHN LYNCH  </P></p>

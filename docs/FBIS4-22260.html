			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Elections: Who Made It to the Second </F> Round?"]    [Text] At a press conference in the Mariinskiy Palace  yesterday, City Electoral Commission Chairman V.I. Fomichev  announced the preliminary results of the elections to the St.  Petersburg City Assembly.    Of the 3.8 million eligible voters in the city, 932,000, or  25.6 percent, turned out at election precincts on 20 and 21  March.    The commission currently counts the elections as valid in 25  electoral districts in the city. It is possible that after the  final vote count this number will rise to 26. And here is the  rating of electoral coalitions. According to preliminary data,  the right to participate in the second round was won by 19  candidates from Democratic Unity of Petersburg, six candidates  from the All Petersburg bloc, five from The City We Love, two  from the Our City--Our Home bloc, one from Unity for Progress,  and 16 independent candidates.    Vladimir Fomichev reported that the city commission is  currently looking into numerous complaints and comments from  various election precincts. There are questions regarding the  integrity of ballot boxes during the night of 20-21 March.    An unusual situation happened in the 22nd Electoral  District,  where Lev Karlin from the Democratic Unity of Petersburg and  independent candidate Vadim Zhimirov qualified for the second  round. District voters [line(s) missing] in the city. There was  not enough for everyone, though, and so complaints flowed in  both from ordinary voters and electoral coalitions. Many  consider this charitable act a violation of the Statute on  Elections, since this way propaganda for candidate Zhimirov was  conducted on election day. Because even price tags with  unbelievably low prices said in large letters: "Almaz."    Well, what about out-of-town students and fixed-term  military  servicemen, permitted to vote by the mayor's decision of 21 were  they included on voter lists? To this question Vladimir Fomichev  provided a rather vague explanation. It turns out that the main  voter registration list is put together 30 days before the  elections. As to the supplemental lists, where the new category  of voters were written in, they were put together at the  precincts as out-of-town students and military servicemen showed  up. The commission does not know the total number of such  persons in the city. Their inclusion on the lists of registered  voters, however, could substantially change the picture of  population turnout at electoral precincts. This situation will  certainly come up more than once as a subject of various  inquiries.</p>

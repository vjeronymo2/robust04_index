			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Italian unions buoyed by mass protests 'After the floods, it's a human tide,' observed Mr Sergio Mangano as he looked down on a sea of demonstrators in the Circus Maximus, the ancient Roman chariot track, which on Saturday was the scene of the largest of the three anti-government demonstrations staged in Rome. Mr Mangano, a metal worker from Brescia, had like many given up his weekend to come to Rome. He had arrived complete with ear-plugs to permit him to blow a high-pitched whistle almost continuously. 'Berlusconi cannot ignore this,' he said, well content with the day. According to the three union confederations who organised the demonstration against the 1995 budget, 1.5m took part. The police put the figure at 1.2m. Whatever the figure it was Italy's biggest post-war demonstration. Because of last week's devastating floods in northern Italy, the unions had expected under 1m people to take part. In terms of numbers and planning (more than 8,500 buses and 50 special trains were involved), it was an extraordinary achievement, underlining the unions' formidable organisational skills. Equally remarkable was the way the protest passed off virtually without incident. But what next? The right-wing government's initial reaction has been to pretend that it is business as usual. The hawks are now expected to argue that the unions do not have enough public support to escalate their protest. Indeed a confrontation may even play into the government's hands. Following last month's four-hour general strike, the government made some concessions to its pension reform plans in the budget - the main specific object of protest. To concede more would undermine the original shape and aims of the budget, which is aimed at holding the public sector deficit to 8 per cent of GDP. As it is, the budget looks unlikely to meet planned targets. To keep the coalition together the government is already calling confidence votes. The first will be today on a scheme to introduce a pardon for buildings built without proper planning permission. The unions themselves face a dilemma. They must now decide whether they wish to be the central driving force of an anti-Berlusconi movement; or limit themselves to protecting their members who risk losing out by cuts in pensions and health benefits. Perhaps, the very success of Saturday's demonstration will force the unions to become both more political and more unified. Seeing the government coalition seriously weakened by its own errors and by internal divisions, the temptation to frighten Mr Berlusconi by staging more street protests and a general strike might be irresistible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F> by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given:  "Our Kamikaze Government"]    [Text] [LIDOVE NOVINY] Mr. Minister, how do you explain  the fact that the voters dumped you after four years?    [Jeszenszky] We made a mistake in communication; we did not  manage to put across our successes. Some people have claimed  that, during the past month, we have been conducting a clumsy  propaganda campaign of success. However, we were merely  informing the people of what we have achieved. For instance,  many people got back their property, something they did not even  dream of in 1990.    Moreover, a campaign was waged in our country for four years  claiming that we were not succeeding. It was also claimed often  that we have no experts. At the same time, no Hungarian  Government has ever had so many educated people, people with  academic titles. It was thought that the previous communist  government had the experts and that these people would be  necessary.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Did you not lose because you behaved in too  authoritarian a manner, because you, for instance, discharged  hundreds of journalists critical of the government from public  radio and television?    [Jeszenszky] In no way; these journalists were not  discharged by the government or the Hungarian Democratic Forum.  The government cannot interfere in these media. Many people,  especially Hungarians living abroad, are not satisfied with  television and radio. They complain that these media only  present our country in a bad light.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What is your opinion of the victorious  Socialists? Is it possible to talk about the return of the old  communist structures or is there a young, liberally endowed left  wing at the head of this party as there is in Poland?    [Jeszenszky] There are about 20 more of these Hungarian  Socialists than Polish socialists and, according to some  observers, they are in an even worse situation than in 1990.  That is, they have no Pozsgay or Nemeth. However, I am keeping  my fingers crossed for them and hope that they come up to  scratch and keep their promises.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Why did people vote for them?    [Jeszenszky] This was a typical protest vote against the  government; the people did not want us to carry on. They  succumbed to illusions. Hungarian communism was, during its  last 10 years, more moderate than in your country. Gas and  bread were cheaper then than they are today and people believe  that they will again become less expensive.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will you do after the elections? Will  you return to history, to your original field?    [Jeszenszky] I would like to. I have given a lecture once a  week for four whole years. However, I will probably have to  remain in parliament and supervise government policy. Former  Prime Minister Antall was my history teacher, I had known him  since I was 15, and I feel obliged to carry on his ideas.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Observer: Cuba libretti Political appointees in Washington are getting their CVs ready and lobbyists are rewriting their address books. But the Cuban-American lobby has made sure its bread is buttered on both sides. The king of the Cuban lobby, Jorge Mas Canosa, long ago set up in business with the president's son Jeb Bush. Jeb denies he pulls strings with his father. 'But from time to time I pass on messages.' If Bill Clinton makes it to Pennsylvania Avenue, the messages will no doubt be carried by Maria Rodham. A Cuban-American herself, she's also married to Hilary Clinton's brother. No surprises then that the traditionally Republican ex-Cubans contributed at least Dollars 125,000 to the Clinton campaign.</p>

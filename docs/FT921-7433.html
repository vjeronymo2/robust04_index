			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa braced for tough year LUFTHANSA, the German airline, said yesterday it expected its financial woes to continue this year after a poor start in January. It told employees to brace themselves for a round of cost-cutting, job reductions, and intensified efforts to sell more seats and cargo space. 'Economic weakness, competitive pressures, and overcapacity amid aggressive worldwide competition will make life hard - even more so than in 1991,' the management board said in the house magazine. The airline, which is 52 per cent state-owned, has already said its losses for last year would total around DM400m (Dollars 250m). It never managed fully to offset the high losses of the first quarter, which was badly affected by the effect of the Gulf war. The board said demand in January 1992 was still well below expectations, and that the month produced a similar loss to that of December. It had therefore decided on a package of measures to reduce costs and improve performance. This will involve pulling more aircraft out of service and not taking delivery of some for which orders were in prospect for 1993 and putting a block on most hiring and consideration of early retirements. Other measures would require all departmentsto cut budgeted 1992 costs by a further 3 per cent. Passenger and freight business would also be improved so that seat-load and cargo-use factors return to 70 per cent from between 60 and 65 per cent last year.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Productivity in manufacturing up 5.3% in 1993 US manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of 7.8 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 5.3 per cent during 1993 as whole, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The rapid growth of productivity - output produced per hour - helps explain the accelerating pace of economic recovery in the fourth quarter, when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent. In sectors other than manufacturing, productivity growth was less rapid, but still impressive. For all non-farm businesses, productivity grew at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 1.6 per cent during 1993 as a whole. Last year marked the second year of unusually strong US productivity growth. Manufacturing and non-farm business productivity grew by 4.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively in 1992. The productivity gains are helping put downward pressure on inflation. In non-farm businesses, unit labour costs rose 1.9 per cent last year, against 2.0 per cent in 1992, a sharp deceleration from previous years. In manufacturing, unit labour costs declined by 2.4 per cent last year after a 0.1 per cent gain in 1992. Productivity growth is typically robust in the early stages of an economic recovery. But many economists believe the exceptionally strong gains of the past two years also reflect structural changes: extensive corporate restructuring in response to more intense foreign competition in an increasingly integrated global economy. During much of the 1980s, non-farm business productivity grew at an annual rate of 1 per cent or less.</p>

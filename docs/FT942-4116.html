			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Walker's signature 'forged' in transaction The signature of Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman and chief executive, was forged when Pounds 11m of the company's money was laundered through an Isle of Man bank, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr William Cowie, a former managing director of the Royal Trust Bank, was being questioned over two transactions the prosecution claims were at the centre of the alleged conspiracy to inflate the profits of the Brent Walker group. Mr Walker and Mr Wildred Aquilina, a former finance director of the Brent Walker group, are both accused of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts, theft and false accounting. Both men deny the charges. In one transaction handled by the bank in 1987, Pounds 7m went from Brent Walker through three intermediary companies and back to Brent Walker. In the second transaction, in January 1988, a further Pounds 4m was transferred from a Tunisian bank to one of the intermediary companies and then on to Brent Walker. The prosecution alleges these transactions were part of an attempt to pretend that Brent Walker's film division had earned Pounds 19m by selling film rights to the three intermediary companies when the money used for the bogus purchases in fact came from the parent company. Cross-examined by Mr Colin Nicholls QC, for Mr Walker, Mr Cowie agreed that the trans-actions amounted to money-laundering. However, he had accepted assurances from Mr Donald Anderson, a former director of the film division, that they were genuine transactions. He had been dealing with a public company and well-established customers, he said. The people he had dealt with over the transactions were Mr Anderson and Mr John Quested, another former director of the film division. The prosecution alleges both were party to the conspiracy with Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina. Mr Cowie agreed that the signature of Mr Walker on a document authorising part of the money-laundering now appeared to be a forgery, but he had not appreciated this at the time. The trial continues.</p>

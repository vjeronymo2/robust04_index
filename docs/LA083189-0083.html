			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK OKS PLAN TO REDO ATLANTIC SQUARE MALL;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES PROJECT DESPITE COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> Three years after work began on the idea and months after residents first  raised detailed arguments against the plans, the City Council on Tuesday  approved a major overhaul of Atlantic Square Shopping Center.  </P> <P> In a series of votes taken after eight hours of debate Monday and Tuesday  nights, the council granted Champion Development Inc. of Long Beach approval  for the $27-million to $30-million project. It will be a joint venture with the  city's Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Fulfill Pledges  </P> <P> "This project will enhance Monterey Park . . . and become one of (the city's)  richest assets," Mayor Patricia M. Reichenberger said.  </P> <P> Council members say the project on South Atlantic Boulevard at Floral Drive  will fulfill their pledges to restore a quality, general interest shopping  center to the city, which in recent years has lost a number of restaurants and  department and grocery stores.  </P> <P> As the revamped center provides added variety in shopping, Councilwoman Judy  Chu said, it will also boost the city's sagging sales tax base. Monterey Park  has among the lowest returns per capita on sales tax in the San Gabriel Valley.  City officials say that is because residents shop at malls in Montebello,  Arcadia and West Covina. In the last year, Monterey Park also lost its biggest  generator of sales tax, a car dealership.  </P> <P> "We're really excited and we took a lot of effort to create a  pedestrian-friendly shopping center," developer Bob Champion told the council.  But he said, "'It's been a long, arduous road to get here."  </P> <P> City Manager Mark Lewis said, "This project resembles, just barely, the project  that was originally submitted."  </P> <P> Based largely on complaints from neighbors of the center, the developer made  dozens of revisions in the original plans. Even Monday and Tuesday, 12  residents criticized the plans, on which the Planning Commission had attached  more than 70 specific requirements.  </P> <P> "We had an outhouse back in Minnesota that looked better than (those plans),  and we also had part of the universe on it. We had a moon on the door,"  resident Len Gustafson told the council.  </P> <P> Champion seemed to take the criticism in stride, saying: "As a developer, it is  our goal to get overall acceptance by as many people as possible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighborhood Concerns  </P> <P> Criticisms have varied from concerns about traffic, parking, pollution and  congestion to placement of trash bins, truck delivery locations and walkways.  "We have a right to ask questions," resident Lucy Ammeian told the council  Tuesday. "We just want the best for our community."  </P> <P> The plans call for a Mediterranean-style center, with fountains, arches and  tree-lined walkways. City officials say construction may begin as soon as  January, with a completion date of Thanksgiving 1990. The city still must buy  the center from Mex-Am Shopping Centers.  </P> <P> In the plan, Champion will double the size of the supermarket and include  additional anchors of a drug store, sporting goods store and a major  restaurant.  </P> <P> Even with all the changes, Councilman Christopher F. Houseman said, "I have big  concerns about this." Houseman said he still thought Champion had not ensured  the center will be revived in the manner the city and nearby residents deserve.  He was the only council member to vote against major approvals required for the  project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Councilman's Situation  </P> <P> Houseman's involvement and his possible conflict of interest became part of the  debate. At the beginning of Monday's meeting, the council adjourned to a closed  session. Assistant City Atty. Stephanie Scher said later that she advised  Houseman not to participate in discussions on Atlantic Square, except as a  private citizen in the audience, because of two possible conflicts of interest:  </P> <P> Houseman acknowledged that, during the last year he had received a consumer  loan from MPR Auto and Truck Repair, which is owned and, in part, operated by  Stephen Tan, a member of the Planning Commission. Tan, also in the insurance  business, owns insurance offices in a shopping center across the street from  Atlantic Square and therefore, Scher said, could be directly affected by the  economics of the shopping center project. Tan has consistently excused himself  in Planning Commission deliberations about Atlantic Square.  </P> <P> Scher said she also was troubled by comments Houseman made at a contentious  Planning Commission meeting that lasted until 3:15 a.m. July 14. At that  meeting, the commission voted 3 to 0 to approve the project. After that  meeting, three planning commissioners wrote the city manager, saying they  believed Houseman "has prejudged the matter and therefore has disqualified  himself from voting on the case."  </P> <P> Houseman refused to stay out of the debate. He said the California Fair  Political Practices Commission had advised him that only "a very limited and  very strained" interpretation of its rules would suggest he not vote on the  Atlantic Square project. "I know I don't have any conflict or financial  conflict" as far as the loan goes, Houseman said.  </P> <P> He said his opposition before the Planning Commission referred only to the  project "as it was at that time. In no stretch of the imagination was that  prejudging or showing bias. I urged (the Planning Commission) not to rush into  a decision in the wee hours of the morning."  </P> <P> Scher told Houseman it was his decision whether to vote, and she advised the  council to give no more weight to his comments than to a member of the  audience.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: SPLITSVILLE  </P> <P> Basinger Case Takes a Twist: There are probably a few Hollywood celebrities  with more than a casual interest in the divorce case of sultry Kim Basinger,  one of the hottest stars of the past few years, and her soon-to-be ex-husband,  Ron Britton. The two start negotiations next week leading to a divorce  agreement, and the New York Daily News reports that Britton is threatening to  take the case to trial, where he says he will name men romantically involved  with his wife if Basinger does not give him a multimillion-dollar settlement.  Basinger, who has never been shy about her life style, has been linked with  "Batman" co-star Michael Keaton, producer Jon Peters and rock star Prince,  among others. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

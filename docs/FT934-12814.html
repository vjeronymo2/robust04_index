			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Arts: Campus cathedral designs to enshrine Ruskin's legacy - Architecture John Ruskin (1819 - 1900) had a slightly confined view of architecture. He had an acute perception but sometimes his interest in the separate parts obscured, or at least clouded, his view of the whole. In his calmer periods he would often say that architecture had lifted him out of his depression. Towards the end of his life he was elevated out of a degree of gloom by visits to the great cathedrals of France - Rouen, Amiens, Chartres and Beauvais. Only one book came of all his enthusiasm for these cathedrals as repositories of history, religion, and architecture - it was called 'The Bible of Amiens'. It was much admired by Proust who, in a curious way, shared with Ruskin that poetic sense of perception, memory, and meaning. It was his extraordinary facility as a descriptive and emotive writer that brought the stones of Venice to life. His writings on the close relationship between architecture and sculpture demonstrate his intuitive understanding of both those arts. It is encouraging news for anyone interested in Ruskin as an intellectual and artistic influence to learn that a new foundation is being established to unify the care of two important Ruskin collections and to build a new Ruskin Library. The owners of the large collection of watercolours,manuscripts printed books and other material associated with Ruskin are The Education Trust Ltd. The Trust owns Brantwood, near Coniston, in the English Lake District, which was Ruskin's home, as well as the great collection of Ruskiniana that has been housed for a long time at Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. The fact that the mass of material cannot any longer remain at the school has precipitated the need for the new Ruskin Foundation, which is a partnership between the Education Trust and the University of Lancaster. A new Ruskin Library will be built on the campus of the University of Lancaster to house the Bembridge material, thus bringing it near to Brantwood and the Lakes. The University of Lancaster is the leading centre for nineteenth century studies and is a natural home for all the Ruskin material. Professor Michael Wheeler is the Professor of English and Director of the Ruskin Programme at the University of Lancaster, and with the chairman of the new Ruskin Foundation, Sir Richard Parsons, he is masterminding the building of the new library and the future for all the elements of what will undoubtedly be the world's foremost Ruskin Collection. He has already reached the halfway point in his fundraising and he needs to raise another Dollars 500,000 in the next six months so that the building of the library can start. Ruskin was undoubtedly the greatest British art critic and social commentator of his time and his spirit is bound to be observing the efforts which are being made to design a suitable home for this internationally important collection. It is a difficult task for the architect and the University of Lancaster have chosen Mr Richard MacCormac, the immediate past President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. I have always admired the work of Mr MacCormac and I last wrote in this column about him when his brilliant new chapel for Fitzwilliam College Cambridge was completed. He has produced a remarkable design for the Ruskin Library. The site for the library is on an escarpment on the western boundary of the university campus. From the site there is a remarkable view of the sea. Lancaster is one of the new universities of the 1960s and it was designed by Bridgwater, Shepheard and Epstein and Tom Mellor and Partners. The masterplan allowed for a pedestrian spine and randomly grouped concrete and brick buildings along and around it. It is not unsuccessful and has some good pedestrian areas, such as the main Alexandra Square. The Ruskin Library clearly comes from the same architectural stable as the Fitzwilliam chapel and, like that chapel, it is designed to enshrine some eternal truths. Ruskin's truths were about art and architecture rather than about religion but it is right for the architect to plan a building based upon the idea of tall, curved encircling and enclosing walls sheltering a rich treasury. The elliptical building will be seen on its site as an island - the architect decribes it as a metaphor for Ruskin's Venice. Within the outer walls is an inner enclosed archive which will appear as a giant treasury for the archives, paintings and other Ruskin relics. Not for nothing is the plan of the whole building like that of a church - the entrance, archive and reading room can be seen as the narthex, choir and sanctuary. There is an upper gallery for exhibitions and a meeting room which will have a dramatic high view of the sea. The final choice of materials is yet to be made but the architect is thinking of ways to suggest something of the stratified appearance of some of the Italian cathedrals and churches that Ruskin liked and drew. The general plan of the library promises to be an example of what Ruskin would have said 'depends for its dignity upon arrangement and government received from human mind'. But architects today find it difficult to conceive of the kind of ornament that Ruskin so passionately admired and understood. No building can do more that suggest the richness of what lies within. Mr MacCormac has been wise not to try to imitate Ruskin. His new library promises to have a clarity, dignity and a sense of light and drama within that Ruskin would have liked and understood. All any architect can do is to create the appropriate memorial presence in a building like this and to trust that it will also throw light upon the great mind of Ruskin.</p>

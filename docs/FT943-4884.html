			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan struggle to escape the import impasse A 70.3 per cent rise in Japanese vehicle imports last month should bring cheer to US trade representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese trade minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, as they meet in Washington today for critical talks on the bilateral framework negotiations. The Japan Automobile Importers Association yesterday said total vehicle imports were 23,391 last month. Of these 21,297 imported cars accounted for 10.7 per cent of Japan's overall car sales. Imported vehicle sales for the year are expected to reach 250,000, compared with 201,480 last year. Ford, arguably the most aggressive exporter, though not the biggest, more than doubled its exports from America last August to 903, while Chrysler achieved a 72 per cent gain from a year earlier to 1,007. The reversal in Ford's fortunes in Japan is precisely the kind of change the framework talks were designed to bring about. But there is little hope in Japan that these changes will help to break the impasse in the trade talks by inspiring the US to soften its demands that Tokyo commit itself to ensuring greater foreign imports in certain priority markets. 'There is a recognition in both the US and Japan that the framework talks are the most important in managing the US-Japan relationship. Nevertheless they have dragged on because of US insistence on a results-oriented approach to which Japan cannot agree,' says a Japanese foreign ministry official. Ever since the two countries agreed to launch the talks, the issue over what the Japanese government will or will not do to help foreign imports penetrate Japan's markets has been the central stumbling block to an agreement aimed at removing a particularly prickly thorn in bilateral relations. As the fourth Japanese trade minister since the talks began meets his US counterpart, the issue of whether Tokyo will ensure a significant increase in imports of foreign products and services ranging from cars and flat glass to insurance, and in government procurement of medical and telecoms equipment, remains a formidable barrier to an agreement. 'The position of both sides is so far apart,' concedes an official at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 'If things continue like this we will just be running along parallel lines.' Both sides have agreed that no specific deadline for conclusion of the talks should be set, but on September 30 the US is committed to deciding whether to name Japan as an unfair trade partner and start sanctions procedures under the Super 301 trade bill. A discouraging outcome to this week's meetings will not do much political good for a hard-pressed President Bill Clinton or for the shaky coalition of Japan's prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama. The optimistic view is that given the risks involved, both sides will work at all costs to avoid a further rift in relations. Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador to Japan, said yesterday that the US hoped to avoid imposing sanctions on September 30, but that Japan needed to show a stronger commitment to reducing its trade surplus with the rest of the world. 'We need to make solid progress on the economic agenda,' Mr Mondale said in a speech in Washington. He said there had been progress on government procurement and insurance issues, but the question of cars and car parts was not close to a settlement. Raising expectations of a high-level bargaining session at the last minute before the September 30 deadline, Mr Mondale also said that President Clinton would meet Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's deputy prime minister, at the United Nations later this month. Japanese authorities hope the US will agree to work out a partial deal that will at least enable the two to avoid a showdown and continue negotiating in areas where significant differences remain. On the vital issue of government procurement, the main point that precludes agreement is again whether Tokyo will commit itself to a 'significant increase' in foreign penetration or whether it will be allowed to get away with a promise of 'change'. The danger is that, given the incentive to reach some kind of agreement and avoid a further fall-out, the issue will be resolved by simply fudging the wording so that each side can read the agreement in a way that suits its purposes.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Ukrainians prosper as state withers away: A three-part series on the ex-Soviet republic - Ukraine Stirs On paper, Ukraine is on the brink of economic collapse. Production fell by more than 40 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The government has no official budget, but if it keeps on spending at its current rate it will have a deficit of more than 30 per cent by the end of the year. Officials at the Ministry of Finance estimate hidden unemployment at 2.5m people. But in defiance of these dire statistics, Ukrainians appear to be living quite well. The streets of Kiev and other big cities are jammed with flashy western cars and lined with new, well-stocked shops and expensive restaurants. The countryside, once squeezed dry to finance Soviet heavy industry, is now gripped by a construction boom as Ukrainian farmers replace their modest cottages with sturdy, three-storey brick houses. 'The people we talk to are absolutely flabbergasted at the difference between the image of Ukraine and the reality,' says Mr Andy Bain, an American businessman based in Kiev, who believes that 'right now in Ukraine you can buy attractive assets for pennies to the dollar.' 'I keep asking myself what we're missing,' admits a perplexed official from a western financial institution. 'It's really a mystery how this country keeps on going.' Part of the answer, he suspects is that 'no matter how hard you try, you just can't turn this country into a Zaire.' One reason why official statistics are a poor yardstick for measuring the Ukrainian economy is that, 70 years after the Bolshevik revolution, one of Marx's promises is finally coming true: in Ukraine, the state is withering away. In other east European countries, like the Czech republic or Estonia, the transition from communism to a market economy has been a fairly well-ordered process, guided by governments with clear plans for the future. But in Ukraine, the state, laboriously and bloodily constructed over seven decades of Soviet rule, is being dismantled by default rather than by design. Thwarted by byzantine government regulations, Ukraine's nascent private sector - which according to the vastly conservative measure of official statistics accounted for more than 30 per cent of GNP in the first quarter of this year - is thriving by circumventing the state. 'Maybe this is a relic of the stubborn mentality of Ukrainian peasants,' explains Mr Oleksandr Tkachenko, a Kiev journalist in his 20s who left a secure job with a western news agency to found a private television production company a few months ago. 'We have a tendency to go ahead and build our houses and maintain our gardens no matter what the external circumstances.' Increasingly, Ukrainians like Mr Tkachenko are doing just that: toiling steadily in their own business patch despite a government which at times has seemed determined to create the worst business climate possible. Ukraine's shambolic, frequently amended tax code can, depending on how you count, eat up more than 100 per cent of an enterprise's profits. Exporters, who ought to be a privileged group in a nation burdened by a negative trade balance, face particularly intimidating legislative obstacles: quotas restrict their room for manoeuvre, and the compulsory sale of half of hard currency revenues to the state at artificially low rates means exporters often come out making a loss. But Mr Mikhail Chertkov, president of a financial company in Odessa, explains of regulations, 'Those who are smart find ways around them, those who aren't have just stopped working.' At local level, where the government's writ runs weakest, market reforms are making the most headway. Over the past six weeks there has been a wave of small-scale privatisation in half a dozen of Ukraine's most progressive cities. It was made possible, explains Ms Roberta Feldman of the International Finance Corporation, which advised on the project, when municipal governments found a way to work around Ukrainian legislation which blocked privatisation. Ms Feldman predicts that in the six cities where it is being employed this strategy will allow all small and medium-size enterprises to be sold to private owners by the autumn. While the more agile private sector is quietly getting on with business, many of the state-owned behemoths which were the pride of Soviet central planners are dying a slow, lingering death. Their executioner is Mr Viktor Iushchenko, who since January has been the author of a monetary policy which even western financial institutions describe as 'draconian'. Apart from a wave of new credits last month, granted primarily to farmers, Mr Iushchenko has simply shut down the printing presses. As a result, inflation, which at the end of 1993 was exceeding 100 per cent a month, is down to 5 per cent in June. As Mr Iushchenko admits, this macro-stabilisation 'is fragile because it is the result of monetary measures alone. Unfortunately, other economic reforms  -restructuring, privatisation - did not occur to shore up these developments.' In the absence of more fundamental reforms, many Ukrainian factories are effectively going bankrupt: they keep their workers on the books, but have not paid them for months; theoretically still functioning, they have slashed production to almost nothing. These are the forces behind plummeting industrial production, but some businessmen think it no bad thing. 'Our state officials would never intentionally kill the big state enterprises but unintentionally that's what they've been doing,' explains Mr Chertkov. 'We have a Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest.' The challenge for Ukraine's new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, if he hopes to make good his pledges to his people - and recently to the International Monetary Fund - to reform the Ukrainian economy, will be to resist the temptation to revive his country's dying industrial dinosaurs. Instead, he must, as he has promised, remove government impediments to the growth of the resilient private sector and to the survival of those state enterprises able to adapt to the market. If he does, he may find Ukraine prosperous enough to support those people who will become formally unemployed when inefficient state factories close their doors.</p>

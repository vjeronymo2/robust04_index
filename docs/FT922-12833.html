			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Output rise gives boost to UK recovery hopes HOPES THAT the British economy might be recovering from recession were given a boost yesterday by news that industrial production and manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in February. The increase, which caught economists by surprise, brought the seasonally adjusted index of manufacturing output back to the levels last seen in the autumn. It also helped to push sterling to a six-month high against the D-Mark of just under DM2.92, before closing in London at DM2.9125 compared with Monday's DM2.915. In late New York trading it stood at DM2.9145. The government received somewhat less encouraging news on inflation. The output price index for home sales of manufactured goods increased by 0.8 per cent between February and March, lifting the year-on-year inflation rate for goods at the factory gate to 4.5 per cent last month from 4.4 per cent in February. Economists said this slight upwards movement in output price inflation reduced still further the prospect of an early cut in UK bank base rates from their current 10.5 per cent level. In spite of February's growth in output, manufacturing production was down by 2.9 per cent in the three months to February compared with the same period a year ago. Comparisons of production trends in the latest three months with the three months to November last year also show an economy still stuck in recession. Output of the energy industries fell by 2 per cent, due mainly to February's milder weather, while manufacturing output between the two latest three month periods declined by 0.5 per cent. However, a 0.8 per cent rise in output of consumer goods in the latest three months led to some speculation that a consumer-led recovery might be imminent. Production in the engineering industries suffered a 1.1 per cent drop in the latest three months, despite higher car production in February. The rise in industrial production in February came after several recent tentative indicators of recovery. Treasury officials said that with election uncertainties out of the way February's manufacturing production level might now be a platform for further output growth. Some increase in output prices had been expected last month because the government increased excise duties in its March 10 Budget. A 0.4 per cent increase in the output price index excluding food, drink and tobacco between February and March suggested that manufacturers' prices rose for other reasons too. However, the Treasury saw little reason to fear a resurgence of output price inflation. Input prices were subdued. The price index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between February and March and rose 0.1 per cent in the 12 months to March.

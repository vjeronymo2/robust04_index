			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Four companies fined Y4m each over bid-rigging Japanese legal authorities yesterday convicted and fined four printing companies for violating anti-monopoly rules by rigging bids for contracts with a government agency. The Tokyo High Court convicted Dainippon Printing, Japan's largest printing company, as well as Toppan Moore, Hitachi Information Systems and Kobayashi Kirokushi of rigging bids for sticker supply contracts with the Social Insurance Agency and imposed fines of Y4m (Pounds 25,100) each. The conviction comes against a background of persistent criticism by the US that Japan's anti-monopoly rules were too lax, and pressure to strengthen enforcement of its anti-monopoly act particularly against exclusionist trade practices such as bid-rigging. US officials have been particularly critical of alleged bid-rigging by Japanese construction companies of public works contracts. However, no conviction has ever been made against bid-rigging in the construction industry despite several orders by the Fair Trade Commission against construction companies to stop such practices. Judge Masayoshi Kondo described the case as particularly serious because the convicted parties continued to rig bids in defiance of the FTC order and with the sole purpose of sharing the profits among themselves. The bid-rigging by the companies cost the agency and taxpayers Y420m in damages in fiscal 1992 alone, he said. The fine of Y4m each is close to the maximum Y5m for cases brought prior to January when the maximum penalty was raised to Y100m. The US has been highly critical of the Japanese practice of designated bidding, which creates an environment that easily allows bid-rigging. The High Court in its ruling noted that the Social Insurance Agency had inadvertently co-operated by narrowing the number of designated bidders and basing its assumed successful bids on the estimates submitted by them.</p>

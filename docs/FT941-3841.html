			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Clintons' friend quits as Justice Department aide Mr Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney-general and a close friend of US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, resigned yesterday after a dispute with his former law firm. He had been accused of overbilling clients at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he and Mrs Clinton held partnerships. 'I believe . . . that the distractions on me at this time will interfere with my service to the country and the president's agenda and that my family . . . is being harmed,' he said in his resignation statement. However, Mr Hubbell, number three at the Justice Department, has been linked to the Whitewater affair, which involves the Clintons' financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. Mr Hubbell's father-in-law borrowed heavily from the Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution at the centre of the controversy, and failed to repay more than Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 335,000). He did some work for federal thrift regulators, although Rose had once also represented Madison Guaranty. Another of the Clintons' friends, Mr Bernie Nussbaum, was forced to resign as White House counsel earlier this month when it was revealed that he met Treasury officials to discuss an investigation of Madison. A third of the Clintons' friends, Mr Vince Foster, another White House lawyer, was found dead last summer, in an apparent suicide. Mr Hubbell's resignation comes just as the administration seemed to be taking the offensive in the Whitewater affair. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the new White House counsel, was co-operating closely with Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel investigating the Clintons' financial dealings and all related issues. Mr Hubbell, the subject of conservative attacks even before he took office, was a golfing partner of the president. In Little Rock, where he had served as mayor, he was seen as a reformer. He also headed the state lawyers' association's ethics committee. He has denied any overbilling, and said he was co-operating with a Rose internal probe. Ms Janet Reno, US attorney-general, praised his work at the Justice Department, saying he was 'a tireless crusader' who had worked to make the department more accountable. Mr Clinton said he agreed with Mr Hubbell's decision to quit, adding: 'It's the right thing to do.' Mr Hubbell had been portrayed as the Justice Department's political fixer for the White House. He had also come to symbolise the supposed cronyism of the Clinton White House, with its numerous Arkansas operators out of their depth in Washington. Joe Rogaly, Page 24</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance lifts dividend BRITANNIC Assurance, the life assurance company, yesterday announced an improvement in its interim dividend to 3.85p, against 3.433p. 'We anticipate that the life assurance business will be strong this year,' said Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, explaining the dividend increase. Britannic, like other life assurance companies, is not required to release interim profits figures. Shareholders are currently entitled to 9.7 per cent of the profits of the with-profits pool, and Mr Shaw noted that 'the market expectation is that we will move to 10 per cent by the year end.' That level, he said, is in line with the industry average and is already reflected in Britannic's share price. Several proprietary life assurance companies have recently taken steps to give shareholders a greater proportion of the profits reserved for policyholders. Britannic said that its general insurance businesses had sharply reduced underwriting losses for the six months ended June 30 to Pounds 1.43m, against Pounds 2.3m last year. Premium income increased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 17.9m, while investment income rose marginally to Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 1.57m). Mr Shaw said that losses paid out on theft claims on home insurance appear to have steadied to last year's levels. However, the company is still paying out roughly 60 per cent of premium income in theft claims - up from the historical level of 30 per cent. In its life business, Britannic reported strong rises in premium income in all branches, although its industrial branch business - in which premiums are collected door-to-door - experienced smaller rises. In ordinary branch business, pensions sales surged from Pounds 57.8m to Pounds 68.6m, while in unit linked business, sales of life assurance products roughly doubled to Pounds 7.33m.</p>

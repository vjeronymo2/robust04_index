			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Singapore plans big refinery project BRITISH Petroleum, Caltex and a Singapore company have announced plans to invest SDollars 1.3bn (Pounds 548m) in a refinery project in Singapore. The project involves construction of a residue catalytic cracker at an existing refinery off the main island of Singapore. The new complex will upgrade low-value fuel oils to high-value motor gasoline and diesel fuels which form a growing segment of the market in the Asia Pacific region. Singapore Petroleum Company, owned jointly by Singapore and foreign interests, and Caltex will be the lead investors in the project, with BP taking a smaller share. Singapore is the world's third largest refining centre after Rotterdam and Houston, with a total refining capacity of more than 1m barrels per day (bpd). The project, due for completion towards the end of 1995, is the latest step in a multi-million dollar upgrading programme at Singapore's refineries. Oil industry analysts say that, with the considerable investments in new plant and equipment, Singapore is ensuring it retains its position as Asia's main refining centre.</p>

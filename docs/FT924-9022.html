			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Time for the revenge of the nerds - London Markets TRADITIONALLY, the Chancellor's autumn statement of public expenditure for the 12 months from April, due next Thursday, lacks the excitement of Budget day: the red box, the beer-and-fags populism, the jokes about mobile telephones. Instead, it is dominated by haggling over footnotes and obscure methodological debates about which definition of public sector borrowing is least misleading. This is an occasion only a gilts analyst could love. Usually. This year, though, things are different. Locked in the purdah normally associated with planning a Budget, Norman Lamont has been working on a November Surprise. Of course, it may not be a pleasant surprise. It is pretty clear by now that the statement will contain what one cabinet minister described as 'horrendous' figures for public borrowing next year; it may also contain some accounting jiggery-pokery to allow local authorities to spend money which does not show up in the government spending total. On the more positive side, the City is expecting it to usher in another cut in interest rates - anything from half a percentage point to the full two points of cuts that the markets are discounting by the end of the year. What is not clear, though, is whether there will be other measures as well: a kick-start to the housing market, some tax concessions, a handful of fairy dust. The equity market - standing up remarkably well this week to a barrage of political uncertainty on everything from the future of John Major's government to the collapse of the world trading system and the tax treatment of UK companies in post-Clinton America - is currently more interested in evidence of a serious commitment to growth than in worries about public borrowing. So, even if the borrowing figures are as awful as that cabinet minister predicts, the market could well respond favourably to a package that promises deeds as well as words on growth. The bankruptcy figures out yesterday - revealing that in the 12 months to September one in every 38 companies went to the wall - give further impetus to the desire for action. Still, though company chairmen remain almost universally gloomy, the most recent figures do not seem quite as dark as the public mood: car sales in October were 8 per cent higher than a year ago. Profits are also showing an encouraging turn. This week's results included interim figures from Sainsbury (up 19 per cent); third-quarter figures from BAT (up 60 per cent, thanks to a recovery at Eagle Star, but doing well in tobacco also); better-than-expected third-quarter figures at BP (up 33 per cent on a replacement cost basis); and a 9 per cent increase in third-quarter profits at Unilever. If the economic climate is indeed improving - albeit imperceptibly - Tomkins may prove to have timed its friendly bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall nicely. This week, the rival bidder, Hanson, dropped out, unwilling to raise its offer of Pounds 790m to match Tomkins' Pounds 935m. The stock market seems to be overcoming its misgivings about the Tomkins bid: its shares closed at 226p on Friday, safely above the 200p price of the rights issue to finance the bid. At that price, its share offer for RHM is worth only  1/2 p less than the 260p cash alternative. Hanson's shareholders have viewed the short-lived struggle with mixed feelings. Since Lord Hanson launched his bid for RHM, his company's shares have outperformed the market by 4 per cent: an indication, perhaps, that investors like to see a flash of the old Hanson acquisitive spirit, but would really prefer him to avoid the messy business of actually making a purchase. Another entrepreneurial businessman, Alan Sugar, has decided that the ups and downs of the stock market are too much to bear. On Friday, he offered to buy back the public's 64 per cent of shares in Amstrad, the computer and hi-fi company he founded, at a price of 30p a share. He sold 7 1/2 per cent of the company in March 1991 at 80p a share. Intriguingly, Alan Sugar is putting Amstrad's money where his mouth is: the biggest single chunk of the financing for his purchase of shares comes from the company itself, in the form of a Pounds 50m loan. (The second-biggest chunk comes from Lloyds Bank, with the Sugar family piggy-bank a poor third.) 'There is a lot of necessary action that has to be taken with regard to Amstrad,' he said on Thursday. Shareholders might be forgiven for thinking that action was what he was being paid to take on their behalf. The week was also notable for two nostalgic souvenirs of the past. One came from British Telecom, as it announced a tentative agreement to sell its 22 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile-phone company, to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. BT, which bought its 35.8m shares in 1989 for Dollars 1.5bn, is selling out for Dollars 1.75bn. The nostalgia element in the proposal, of course, is the way in which it brings back memories of BT's international ambitions, all of which seem to end in a whimper. Increasingly, the company seems to be forced back on its domestic base as a source of profits. The second nostalgic moment came in the revelation that Bernie Cornfeld, that once-potent figure of the 1960s share price boom, is trying to get back into business. Cornfeld, whose mutual fund empire collapsed spectacularly two decades ago, is hoping to buy MGM from Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which lent the studio far too much money in the 1980s. So far, the bank seems to be treating Cornfeld with a certain amount of disdain. Still, if it succeeds, the bid will provide an object lesson in how a once-discredited financial figure can rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the world: talk big and throw lots of money around. Norman Lamont, are you listening?</p>

POLICE ARE NOT SURE IF THE SAME MAN IS  RESPONSIBLE.  </P> <P> Parents and police in two beach cities were on alert and Hermosa Beach school  officials prepared Wednesday to close a campus to outsiders after apparent  kidnaping attempts against four schoolchildren in the last week.  </P> <P> Police said they are uncertain if the same man is responsible for the four  separate incidents in Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach because the  descriptions of the suspect differed slightly in each case.  </P> <P> All four children, ranging in age from 7 to 14, escaped unharmed when a man  approached them and asked them to take a ride in his pickup truck.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach police released three composite drawings after the three children  who were approached in that city described the man. Police said they came up  with different likenesses because more than one man could be responsible for  the abduction attempts, the children might have given inaccurate descriptions  or the man could have altered his appearance.  </P> <P> The three Hermosa Beach children and an 8-year-old girl from Manhattan Beach  said the man who approached them was in his 20s or early 30s, about 6 feet tall  and thin. His hair was variously described as red, blond and brown. Three of  the children said the man had a mustache, while one said he was clean-shaven.  Two children said the man drove a red pickup, while two said the truck was  white.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we are dealing with one person or more than one," said Hermosa  Beach Police Cmdr. John Mebius.  </P> <P> On March 7, the 8-year-old Manhattan Beach girl was walking to Pacific  Elementary School when a man called to her from his white pickup truck, police  said. As she walked by, the man opened his door and appeared to be masturbating  inside, Sgt. Jack Zea said.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, a man driving a red pickup pulled alongside and tried to speak  to a 10-year-old boy walking home from Hermosa Valley School, said Hermosa  Beach Police Sgt. Spike Kelly.  </P> <P> On Friday, a man walked onto the playground at the same school and told a  7-year-old girl that her mother wanted her to ride home with him.  </P> <P> And on Tuesday, a 14-year-old boy told police that he was walking home from  Mira Costa High School when a red pickup truck pulled up and the driver told  him to get in.  </P> <P> In all four cases, the children ran off and reported the incidents to their  parents or school officials.  </P> <P> More parents have been escorting their children to school this week, school  officials said. Police said they plan to have plainclothes officers patrol  around schools in both cities. At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Hermosa Beach  Mayor Roger Creighton called on citizens to be extra vigilant. And Wednesday  night, the Hermosa Beach school board was expected to close Hermosa Valley  School to everyone but students, teachers and visitors with passes. The campus  had been open to provide residents access to the beach.  </P> <P> "We don't know everybody walking across campus," said Principal Shalee  Cunningham. "We feel we need to close the campus to make security 100%  effective."  </P> <P> The school has sent out two notices alerting parents to the incidents.  </P> <P> Police said these precautions and the safety training that students receive in  school have paid off. "These kids are great," Mebius said. "They did exactly  the right thing. When they were accosted, they ran."  </P></p>

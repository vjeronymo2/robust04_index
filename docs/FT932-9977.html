			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD and other precious metals closed easier on the London bullion market, with the New York markets failing to provide any new impetus, dealers said. Gold fixed at Dollars 356.80 a troy ounce in the afternoon, 55 cents up on the morning fix as the market absorbed the Gold Fields Mineral Services survey showing record jewellery demand last year. Dealers said the market had definitely found a new base for itself with good support around Dollars 352. London's robusta COFFEE futures were unable to sustain early gains with roasters largely remaining sidelined except for a few enquiries for June and July shipment Brazilian supplies. Dealers noted there continued to be reasonable interest in options both in London and New York. Recent sharp price swings in both directions have increased trade interest in using the options market to hedge their physical supplies. On the LME three-month ALUMINIUM was again hindered by overhead resistance above Dollars 1,150 a tonne, with business mostly taking place below this level. However, news that March IPAI producer inventories were down by 27,000 tonnes helped to restrict the downward reaction. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angel Porras Robles] </F>   [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National  Human Rights Commission [CNDH], acknowledged to the head of the  executive branch, President Salinas de Gortari, that the  organization's main problem is the partial fulfillment of 51  percent of its 796 recommendations, 103 of which are due to a  "negligent" attitude. He emphasized that "we do not count on  the decided support of all the governors or the judges," in the  struggle against torture, adding that in 34 penal institutions  there is a lack of "courage and willingness" to put an end to  corruption, drug trafficking, and self-governing groups inside  penitentiaries.    During the presentation of his annual report, the ombudsman  indicated that when the time comes, he will speak out about the  46 complaints he has filed on the Chiapas conflict, "without  attempting to harm the institutions." On Luis Donaldo Colosio's  murder, he emphasized that the CHDH mission is not to cover up  criminals nor to hide arbitrary actions, it is simply to foster  respect for the Constitution.    Madrazo Cuellar reiterated that Mexico has the largest human  rights organization in the world, however, what it seeks is to  become the most efficient. To achieve this, he emphasized, it is  indispensable, among other things, for the governors to  reinforce their support to the local commissions so that these  can efficiently fulfill their duty. Several of these  commissions, he warned, face "severe financial problems," as  well as a lack of technical and human resources, such as the  case of Oaxaca.    During the reporting period, the Nonjurisdictional National  System of Human Rights' Protection received 24,096 complaints;  of these, the CNDH attended to 8,804. This represents an  average of 24.1 per day. He added that in four years, 27,841  charges have been presented, of which 26,393 have been  investigated. He reported that the CNDH's current capacity to  act is 94.8 percent.    In this regard, he emphasized that based on a socioeconomic  study of victims, it was established that 70 percent are people  of very low income. He said: "It is very satisfactory that the  institution is giving support to those who have less and with  whom we have the greatest justice."    He later indicated that the most frequent complaints concern  violations of inmates' rights, abuse of authority, arbitrary  detention, delays in legal action, denied access to medical  services, false accusations, denials of the right to petition,  public service responsibilities, and torture.    With regard to this last complaint, he emphasized that the  accusations are decreasing; last year only 141 complaints were  filed. Nevertheless, he explained that he had not received  support from some governors and judges. With regard to the  governors, "suffice it to say that one fourth of the federal  institutions in the country still use torture as a form of  punishment and much less have laws to prevent or to punish it."    With regard to judges, based on the CNDH's recommendations  made during the reporting period, there are 53 cases of torture  or homicide awaiting trial. He mentioned that only six of these  cases have resulted in prison sentences; however, 26 denials or  cancellations of arrest warrants have been issued. In seven  cases, sentences have not yet been handed down; in 13 cases,  arrest warrants have been issued; and one release resolution was  issued.    Meanwhile, the CNDH president indicated that the authorities  most willing to resolve the complaints through mutual, friendly  agreement are the Attorney General's Office and the justice  prosecutor of Mexico City, the Secretariat General of Protection  and Viability, the Security and Social Services Institute for  Government Workers, and the Department of the Federal District.    Madrazo Cuellar indicated that the current status of the 267  recommendations issued this year are as follows: 49 have been  totally complied with, 196 have been only partially complied  with, 12 have been accepted and are waiting for evidence to be  presented, three have been accepted without evidence, 22 are  pending a response, and seven have not been accepted by the  officials involved.    In discussing this matter further, he reported that these  cases involve the head of Santiago Ixcuintla Municipality in  Nayarit, the governors of Aguascalientes and Baja California,  the head of Sinaloa State's Higher Court of Justice, the  agrarian reform secretary, and the trust fund manager of the  National Low-Income Housing Fund. The previous Oaxaca  legislature also is included in this list, the CNDH official  indicated, because it knowingly let time elapse despite having  accepted the recommendations. "This is scandalous behavior  devoid of any ethical basis," Madrazo Cuellar noted.    Of the 796 recommendations issued in four years, Madrazo  Cuellar noted that 376 were fully complied with and 404  partially complied with; three were accepted, but there is no  evidence of compliance; and two were unsatisfactorily complied  with. Also, 12 are at the stage of submitting evidence; there  is still time to reply to 22; and 16 were not accepted.    In addition, he noted that 101 of the 404 recommendations  that were partially fulfilled fall under this category because  the arrest warrants have not been enforced, or, in some cases,  even issued by the judges. The CNDH, he added, knows that 426  arrest warrants issued on the basis of its suggestions and which  correspond to federal or local jurisdictions have not been  complied with or issued.    Also, 145 recommendations that have been partially complied  with deal with prison matters. In order for these to be fully  enforced, many need the allocation of financial resources to  build, expand, or repair prisons -- "something that takes time,  of course." The CNDH chairman explained that a lack of courage  or commitment to stamp out corruption, drug trafficking, and the  persistence of self-governing groups is noticeable in 34 cases.    Later, when referring to 103 recommendations that were  partially heeded, he noted that, based on the dates on which  they were issued and the records contained in the respective  files, they must be regarded as cases in which there has been  "negligent noncompliance."    He enumerated the recommendations falling under this  category  that were sent to different governors: 15 to the Oaxaca  governor, 13 to the Michoacan governor, nine to the Guerrero  governor, eight to the Mexico State governor, six to the  Chihuahua governor, five to the Morelos governor, five to the  Puebla governor, four to the San Luis Potosi governor, three to  the Baja California governor, three to the Chiapas governor,  three to the Guanajuato governor, three to the Sonora governor,  three to the Tamaulipas governor, two to the Colima governor,  two to the Durango governor, two to the Tabasco governor, two to  the Yucatan governor, one to the Aguascalientes governor, one to  the Jalisco governor, one to the Nayarit governor, one to the  Nuevo Leon governor, and one to the Tlaxcala governor. One was  also sent to the agrarian reform secretary.    He warned that the recipients "must be aware that each case  is a complaint for an act of injustice, arbitrariness, impunity,  and it is in their hands to resolve these cases and make  amends.... Whoever has the authority to resolve an act of  injustice and fails to do so becomes an accomplice of the  perpetrator."    During the period mentioned in the report -- from May 1993  to  May 1994 -- more than 539 public officials -- 330 federal and  209 state employees -- were punished, but since the CNDH has  been functioning, a total of 1,848 officials were subject to  disciplinary actions. He affirmed that in the struggle against  impunity there can be no exceptions.    After recounting the CNDH activities -- contained in a total  of 5,083 pages, which he summarized in 14 pages -- Madrazo  Cuellar noted that the armed conflict in Chiapas represents the  most important challenge for his organization. He added: "We  are working in an objective and impartial manner in conducting  the investigations and collecting evidence, because without  these efforts we could not make pronouncements. We are working  to rectify errors and to make amends for violations perpetrated  by those who disobey orders, and we are doing this without  seeking to harm any institutions."    Regarding the complaint filed by the Mayorals, who were  coimplicated in Colosio's murder, he said the CNDH will maintain  the opinion that the perpetrators of the most serious offenses  are entitled to their individual rights, but society "must not  become confused." He added, "Just as all Mexicans, the CNDH  wants the whole truth to be known and those responsible to bear  the full weight of the law" for the "deplorable homicide."    The CNDH's mission, he added, is to enforce respect for the  law at all times, even during the most difficult and painful  moments, under the terms of the Constitution.</p>

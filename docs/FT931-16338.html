			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs push losses at Stanhope Props to Pounds 215m EXCEPTIONAL items of Pounds 184m related to write-downs on the company's property pushed pre-tax losses from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 215m at Stanhope Properties in the year to June 30. Net asset value fell from Pounds 391.1m to Pounds 42.2m. The company has also concluded a refinancing of its bank debt, without which the asset value decline would have resulted in breaches of loan covenants. The agreement extends a revolving credit facility of Pounds 160m due for repayment December 1993 to December 1996. It will be reviewed in 1994. Interest will be capped for two years. The share price yesterday fell 6p to 17p. An extraordinary meeting will be held on January 29 to amend the articles which restrict borrowings to two and half times the adjusted share capital and reserves of the group. The board is proposing a maximum specified amount of Pounds 300m to cover existing borrowings. The company has debt of Pounds 220m resulting in an increased interest charge of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 11.6m). Last November its banks agreed to a refinancing for its joint venture company Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments (RSD), which built the Broadgate office complex in the City of London. Its net asset value has fallen from Pounds 341m to Pounds 103m. Stanhope's joint venture partner Rosehaugh went into receivership shortly after the RSD refinancing was agreed. Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive, said: 'We have tried to be realistic. With hindsight it would have been better if the board had embarked on a disposal strategy at an earlier stage in the business cycle.' Since the year end, RSD has sold three buildings and Stanhope has sold its building at Knowle Green, Staines. The board said that the banks' support would enable it to undertake a measured debt reduction programme over the medium term, in line with an expected improvement in property values. Turnover increased to Pounds 56.9m (Pounds 42.9m). Annual costs have fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 8m. The number of employees at the end of June was 83, but has since been reduced to 42. Losses per share rose to 128.6p (40.09p). There is no dividend.</p>

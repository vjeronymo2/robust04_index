The program recognizes that states and local jurisdictions have experienced substantial increases in jail, prison and juvenile confinement populations in recent years, resulting in escalating costs and serious difficulties in managing overcapacity correctional populations. Because of these constraints, correctional systems have often been unable to implement new programs, develop alternative confinement strategies, or open new facilities. This program seeks to provide funds to address the immediate needs of correctional facilities and programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In particular, the program emphasizes the need to make available both conventional jail and prison space for the confinement of violent offenders and to ensure that violent offenders remain incarcerated for substantial periods of time through the implementation of truth in sentencing laws. Accordingly, Subtitle A directs the Attorney General to award grants to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities, including boot camp facilities and other alternative correctional facilities that will free secure prison space for the confinement of violent offenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifty percent of the total amount of funds appropriated each year will be allocated for Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants and the other 50 percent will be allocated for Violent Offender Incarceration Grants, 85 percent of which is to be distributed by specified formula with the remaining 15 percent available for discretionary grant awards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula amount available to carry out the grant programs for any fiscal year will be allocated to each eligible state based on Part 1 violent crime data reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for use in the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). If such data is unavailable, applicants may also utilize figures as reported in publications by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). (See, e.g., ``Census of State and Local Correctional Facilities, 1990.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute contemplates the availability of $7.9 billion in funding over six years, beginning with $175 million authorized in fiscal year 1995. It is important to note, however, that Congress appropriated only $24.5 million for Subtitle A programs for fiscal year 1995. Moreover, the Appropriations Act limits these funds to a discretionary grant program for the construction of correctional boot camps. Specifically, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 are to develop, construct, or expand boot camp programs which include coordinated, intensive aftercare services following release. It is anticipated that program guidelines and information outlining the application process for adult and juvenile boot camp fiscal year 1995 grant awards will be available in January 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of the Problem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State and local prison populations continue to grow. Moreover, there are a number of states and local jurisdictions under court order because of overcrowding in their correctional facilities. The majority of jurisdictions operate above the total rated capacity for their correctional facilities. Those facilities under court order for overcrowding which have taken steps to control their burgeoning inmate populations tend to operate at or near capacity in order to remain in compliance with the court orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Correctional systems faced with rising prison populations and court-ordered ceilings have responded in various ways. Some have implemented population management task forces to ensure that violent criminals are not released as a result of accommodating nonviolent offenders. Others have simply released offenders when their institutions reach a certain population level, without significant controls over the security classifications of the inmates. Still other systems under court order have implemented statutory release programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

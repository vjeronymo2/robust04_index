			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Moscow tries to limit MMM fallout: No taxpayers' money to compensate those who bought shares in tottering company The Russian government sought over the weekend to limit the damage caused by the threatened collapse of the MMM finance house - in which millions have invested in the hope of huge returns - by saying it would not use taxpayers' money to compensate those who had gambled and lost on MMM shares. The company, however, continued to proclaim its solvency, and yesterday sought to prove it by raising the price of shares from the Rbs1,000 it had announced on Friday - cut from the previous high of Rbs115,000 - to Rbs1,125. It also told pensioners and invalids that it would redeem their shares at the previous high price on the receipt of a written request. The ground round the MMM office in a Moscow suburb yesterday was, once again, crowded with people on a brilliant summer day - with touts doing brisk business selling pensioners and invalids ordinary pieces of paper for Rbs100 - a new high-water mark of the market economy - on which they could write their requests for refunds. Mrs Frida Prosyanikova, a pensioner receiving Rbs80,000 (about Pounds 27) a month, said she had one share for which she had saved for a year, and did not know whether or not to sell it or retain it in the hope of the shares climbing again. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, speaking from Petrozavodsk in the Karelian republic, said there would be no compensation because 'people could only be repaid by those who had not bought MMM shares'  -showing a now typical concern for the interests of the taxpayer. Ramming the point home in a TV interview on Saturday, Mr Andrei Kazmin, a deputy finance minister, said, 'The market economy means above all the direct personal responsibility of each individual.' Mr Chernomyrdin softened the blow by acknowledging that the government was at fault for failing to bring in legislation on the securities market, and blamed the Finance Ministry and its senior officials for failing to use what rules and regulations there were. 'We cannot stop people buying the shares but we were obliged to explain to them what was behind this,' he said, and promised 'punishment' for those responsible. The Finance Ministry, now preparing a set of regulations in record time, said it would insist on an audit of MMM and all similar companies now operating in the market. One such company is Telemarket, whose shares fell over the weekend from Rbs30,000 to Rbs16,000. However, it blamed the mass media for continuing to broadcast and publish MMM advertisements after the publication of a presidential decree in June offering investors protection from irresponsible advertising. For his part Mr Sergei Mavrodi, MMM chairman, promised a meeting with representatives of the shareholders on Saturday, then failed to turn up. The company says it will open its selling points tomorrow and again trade in the shares at the new price of Rbs1,125. The black market price of the old shares continued to enjoy a substantial premium over the new issues, hovering between Rbs6,000 and Rbs8,000. This was widely interpreted to indicate people's refusal to believe they will not be redeemed. A poll taken by the Institute of Sociology on Saturday gave some comfort to the government, which has tended to be blamed for MMM's threatened crash because of warnings it delivered on its viability 10 days ago. The poll showed that 25 per cent of the Muscovites questioned said they would blame the company for the crisis, while 21 per cent said the shareholders 'gullibility and naivety' were to blame - against 13 per cent blaming the government and the taxation service. The poll showed that only 7 per cent had investments in MMM, while 46 per cent had shares in other companies - probably as a result of the widespread distribution of shares during the first stage of the privatisation process. Less than 2 per cent of shareholders, even MMM shareholders, said they would contemplate protest action against the government if the company went bankrupt. The newspapers have largely reflected an anti-government tone in the affair, with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, its sharpest critic, weighing in at the weekend with a headline which read 'Mr Mavrodi had acted in the same way as Chubais (the privatisation minister) but with more flair'. It quoted Mr Chubais saying that 40m shareholders in privatised companies were now an irresistible political force, and contrasted this with Mr Mavrodi saying his shareholders were now also an aroused mass which could bring down any government which gainsaid it.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (3): It pays to be choosy - Relocation companies JUDGING from the small ads in the property columns of local newspapers, there are hundreds of specialist firms eager to help companies and their employees relocate. Do not be fooled. Many are small, under-employed, local builders more than ready to fill in the empty hours house-sitting and showing prospective buyers over a property for an absent owner. The bulk are perhaps redundant or pregnant estate agents, 'keeping their eye in' while working from home. Professional nationwide specialist assistance is available, however, on a scale large enough to cope with a large company headquarters move. In the last three years, two trade associations have even sprung up: the CBI Employee Relocation Council, with more than 200 members, half drawn from corporations, half from removals companies and relocation agencies; and the Association of Relocation Agents with 300 members specifically dealing with employers. Six or seven groups dominate the field: market leader is widely thought to be Black Horse Relocation Services, an offshoot of Lloyds Bank's Black Horse estate agencies, with nine years experience; next, thickly bunched, come Nationwide, Hambro Countrywide and Hamptons, the estate agents; and finally, two with US parentage - PRIcoa Relocation Management, a subsidiary of Prudential of America which took over the worldwide realty interests of Merrill Lynch some three years ago, and PH Home Equity which continues to specialise primarily in trans Atlantic relocations. Each of the six would argue that its particular approach and techniques sets them apart from the rest, but the similarities are more striking than the differences. And these are determined by the complex range of problems to be solved in a company move. In today's depressed housing market, for instance, there is widespread agreement that the traditional techniques of putting employees up in a hotel until they sell their old homes, or alternately providing a bridging loan are no longer practicable. Bridging loans result in horrendous bills for the employer as employees lack the motivation to sell their old properties in a falling market. Hotel accommodation means money bleeding out of the business at upwards of Pounds 30 a head per night, in addition to the disruption to the employee's family life. The leading relocation agencies today offer a variation of the scheme described by Michael Lansley, managing director of Hambro Countrywide Relocation: 'We arrange for two valuations of the old home and buy the property at a price midway between the two, leaving the employee with the benefit of becoming a cash purchaser. Any profit goes to the employee; any loss is made good by the employer.' The funds, in Hambro Countrywide's scheme, come from Barclays Bank at typically 0.75 to 1.75 points above LIBOR compared with the usual bringing loan premium of four points over base rate. The employer, needless to say, services the interest charges. (In some other schemes, the employer provides all the funds, but the principle is the same.) The relocation specialist then actively markets the property while maintaining it in good order, keeping the garden tidy and carrying out any essential repairs. During 1991, even at the bottom of the property market, Mr Lansley says that his company took an average of four to five months to sell properties bought under the scheme - much faster than most individual home owners have managed in this market. HC's advantage is a network of 2,000 estate agents nationwide, including its own 470, on whom it can exert direct pressure. Like Hambro Countrywide, PRIcoa strongly emphasises the need for regionalised marketing to exert effective pressure on local estate agents as well as to provide the large number of other local services involved in a move of several hundred families. As might be expected from a US-owned operation, PRIcoa makes a special feature of helping spouses rebuild their careers in a new location by offering guidance on job applications, interview techniques or the pool of potential new employers nearby. Michael Tagg, the national sales manager, also emphasises the importance of what personnel managers call 'education counselling.' One family may want to move immediately to settle children into new schools; another might want their offspring to complete exams in a familiar school before moving. No wonder corporate moves are such a lengthy process. Two to three years is not uncommon in PRIcoa's UK experience, which, under one name or another, spans just over 20 years. Eighteen months ago PRIcoa was appointed by Conoco UK to help the oil company move its headquarters and 600 staff from London to Warwick. The exercise, which involved a special management task force, is still going on. In 1989, PRIcoa helped HJ Heinz move 200 employees from Hayes Park, west London to Wigan. At the time the key challenge was to reassure employees worried that they might never be able to re-enter the London property market in the future. By the time all had moved (in the first half of 1991) the price differentials had been somewhat eased by the savage fall in housing values in the south-east. Other problems arise where the company is moving from a low cost to a high-cost housing area. There too, specialist advice is useful for the employer. The Inland Revenue permits employers to assist employees financially to move to similar properties in the new area, but the assistance cannot be paid as a lump sum and must be spread over a period of years on a declining scale. The complexities of the regulations call for professional interpretation. Professionalism will be even more at a premium as the European Single Market tempts more companies to relocate operations outside their country of origin. Most of the leading relocation specialists are busy at present building up a network of professional contacts across Europe in order to be able to offer the same local expertise as they do at home where they offer panels of solicitors, estate agents and mortgage providers to help incoming employees find a new home. Despite the solid case to be made out for the specialists' relocation skills, only 20 per cent of companies who move use their services. Whether this suggests great growth potential in the field may become clear within a couple of years of the Single Market. It may instead fuel the growing diversification of the big six accounting firms away from their traditional auditing and accounting base. For each of them offers a strategic relocation advisory service through their management consultancy arms. At present, companies tend to appoint, say, Price Waterhouse or Touche Ross, as project managers to monitor the specialist relocators. With increasing experience of the subject, however, the management consultants may feel confident of carrying out the secondary role themselves. But that is a story for another day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Lazaro Avila Soleno, head of  the Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, has emphatically stated:  "We have always respected the established command."    The second in command within the Honduran Armed Forces has  responded briefly to the reporters' questions, presuming the  Army commander in chief is the one who is authorized to speak.    Nevertheless, the reporters insisted on knowing his position  on the new regulation that may be established for the  recruitment of military personnel.    He has said all Hondurans must be aware of their  responsibilities, regardless of their area of expertise.    He added that as members of the Armed Forces and as  soldiers,  the military is concerned about situations that may emerge at  any moment and which might require the Army's support, "but the  Armed Forces will always fulfill its institutional mission," he  has said.    Avila has said no conditions have been established for  acceptance of the proposal on educational and voluntary military  service, because Honduras' top authorities will make the  decision via Congress. He has said history will judge those who  make the decision.    Avila has reiterated he could not express personal opinions  out of respect for the mandates of the Constitution of the  Republic and the highest authorities.    Regarding a possible weakening of the Armed Forces when the  new recruitment model is implemented, Avila has said he could  not predict the future, but he assured that the Army is a solid,  constitutional, and permanent institution that is not in any  danger.    Avilo trusts the legislative branch's decision will be the  most advantageous, indeed the best for the country.    He has said there may be options if voluntary recruitment  fails; "for every great crisis or problem there are great  solutions," he has said.    Avila has said various options have been examined in depth:  "We always examine in peacetime what may happen in a crisis,"  he has said.</p>

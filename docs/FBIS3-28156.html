However, North Korea still refuses  to accept nuclear inspections, leaving the issue unresolved.  SANKEI SHIMBUN reporter Katsuhiro Kuroda has exclusively  interviewed Yi Tong-pok, former special assistant at the Agency  for National Security Planning, to ask about the prospects for  the nuclear issue. Mr. Yi is said to have had profound  experiences in negotiating with North Korea at the North-South  talks since 1970. He is also known to have been South Korea's  toughest negotiator with North Korea.    Mr. Yi resigned as the special assistant in late 1993  following an incident involving his ignoring a presidential  directive to South Korean negotiators at the North-South talks.  It is said that the incident occurred because of a discord  within the South Korean Government. In the exclusive interview,  Mr. Yi said:  <H5>  Concession Means Weakness </H5>   It is said that I resigned because of a confrontation  between  hard- and moderate-liners [in the South Korean Government], but  it is not true. It is better to say that I resigned because of  differences between professionals and amateurs on North Korea.  The Kim Yong-sam government's attitude toward North Korea  appeared to be reconciliatory at first, but its attitude has now  become tough after experiencing reality. There is no need to  worry about the government's attitude toward North Korea.    There are some lessons for negotiating with communists. For  example, in principle, no "agreement" should be reached with  them that leaves room for them to interpret things their way.  The agreement would be scrapped because of differences over the  interpretation or the communists would press their counterpart  to make concessions. The agreement must be phrased  unequivocally and specifically.    A book entitled "Tactics for Negotiating With Communists,"  written by U.S. Admiral Joy [name as published] who was a chief  delegate to truce talks with North Korea during the Korean war  (1950-53) pointed out that North Korea used the tactic to  tenaciously repeat its assertions and prolong the truce talks  with the aim of getting its counterpart tired. North Korea is  invariably using the same tactic.    In his book, Admiral Joy pointed out that 1) we must not  ease  our pressure; 2) we must not be impatient, but we must conclude  talks with communists in a short period; 3) we must not make any  concessions to which they do not reciprocate; 4) we must not  step back from our original political aims; and 5) we must  indicate that we will not hesitate to go to war with them if  talks are broken off. I agree with his suggestions.  <H5>  North Korea Has the Capability To Build Two Atomic Bombs </H5>   It is wrong to view that North Korea has simply used the  nuclear issue as a diplomatic card. Given the nature of the  present North Korean system, North Korea is firmly determined to  develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea has extracted plutonium  from the operation of a 5-megawatt reactor since 1986, that  country could now have about 15 kg of plutonium. This plutonium  is enough to manufacture two Nagasaki-type atomic bombs.    If international nuclear inspections are put back on track,  North Korea would no longer extract the plutonium. Fuel samples  should be checked to determine how much plutonium North Korea  has extracted and at the same time, international nuclear  inspections need to be undertaken at North Korea's undeclared  nuclear waste disposal sites.    For now, the United States and the IAEA appear to be  intending to keep North Korea from extracting additional  plutonium by having North Korea accept the international nuclear  inspections on its declared nuclear facilities and to deal  tenaciously with plutonium in the hands of North Korea with the  determination of risking North Korea's manufacturing nuclear  weapons. As a precedent, South Africa has dismantled its  nuclear weapons after developing them.  <H5>  Economic Sanctions in Near Future </H5>   In negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea has accepted only  one-time inspections of its undeclared nuclear sites. The third  round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks may be held, but the  talks will face an impasse because of North Korea's continued  opposition to both special and normal inspections.    North Korea will try to negotiate at every stage of  inspections and to buy time. In response, argument for imposing  economic sanctions against North Korea will grow and the  argument may lead the UN Security Council to decide on economic  sanctions against North Korea.    How long will the IAEA and the United States be patient with  North Korea's suspected nuclear development? In the near  future, North Korea will stand at a crossroad of making a hard  choice between its renunciation of nuclear development and its  formal withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Since the nuclear issue has arisen from North Korea's  system,  the issue cannot be resolved fundamentally without a qualitative  change in the system.    The United States is moving in the direction of increasing  its pressure on North Korea with the aim of causing the  qualitative change in the system.</p>

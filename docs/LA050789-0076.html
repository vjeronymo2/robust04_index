			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRIGHT SOLICITED FUNDS, S&amp;L WITNESS SAYS  </P> <P> A former savings and loan executive has testified that House Speaker Jim Wright  offered to block legislation that could hurt thrifts in exchange for $250,000  in contributions to a political action committee.  </P> <P> David R. Farmer was testifying Friday in the trial of three former savings and  loan executives on charges that they allegedly participated in what federal  prosecutors say was a conspiracy by the thrifts to evade federal laws by  channeling corporate contributions to political campaigns.  </P> <P> No direct evidence that Wright had made any such promise was presented.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Task Force Probe  </P> <P> Wright was not named in the federal indictment against the three defendants,  Robert Hopkins, Morton Hopkins and John Harrell, who were charged after  investigations by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.  </P> <P> The three are former executives of Commodore Savings Assn.  </P> <P> Farmer, former senior vice president and chief financial officer of Commodore,  said he gave a $1,000 donation to the East Texas First Political Action  Committee in 1985, then was told to file a false expense report to get the  money back.  </P> <P> Farmer said it was understood that Wright, the Democratic majority leader at  the time, had guaranteed that specific legislation unfavorable to savings and  loans would be blocked from making it out of committee. The former Commodore  executive did not cite the legislation.  </P> <P> "In return for the contributions, Jim Wright guaranteed the legislation would  not get out of committee," Farmer said. "Both John (Harrell) and myself were  amazed that as high ranking an individual in the Congress as he (Wright) would  be involved in something like this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says 10 Contributed  </P> <P> Under questioning, Farmer said 10 savings and loans were contributing a total  of $250,000 to the political fund.  </P> <P> In an interview after the court session, the New York Times reported, Harrell  did not dispute Farmer's testimony, but he said he never spoke directly with  Wright about raising funds and would not say where he got his information. The  newspaper said Farmer testified that he was told about the deal by Harrell, the  savings and loan's chief executive.  </P> <P> In other testimony last week, witnesses said Commodore employees gave donations  to a political action committee and were given raises in return.  </P> <P> A Commodore secretary testified that some of the money donated to the political  action committee was laundered through Vernon Savings &amp; Loan. On one check  the words "For Jim Wright" were written on the memo line, she said.  </P> <P> Calls from the Associated Press to Wright's Washington and Ft. Worth offices  went unanswered late Friday night.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sergey Ostankin and Andrey </F> Surzhanskiy]    [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- "The Russian Defence Ministry  has launched its full-scale peacemaking operation to overcome  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It is going ahead strictly  according to the programme and quite successfully," Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said at a press conference here  today.    According to Grachev, all forces and materiel, including  about 2,300 servicemen, to take part in the peacemaking action,  are now concentrated in the conflict zone.    Grachev also said that "a large number of U.N. observers,  who  are carrying out good work", has been functioning in the region.  He said he wished if other countries also took part in the  peace-making operation aimed at disengaging the conflicting  sides and promoting peace in Abkhazia. "We are ready to work  under the aegis of the U.N. and even under other commands," the  minister said. Grachev expressed regret that "there are no  prospects of the U.N. peacemakers' participation in the near  future". He referred to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's opinion voiced at their personal meeting.    According to Grachev, whether the Commonwealth of  Independent  States (CIS) will take part in putting end to the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, will be decided at a meeting of CIS  summit meeting scheduled for September. The minister also said  it is rather doubtful that any of the CIS states will allocate  bigger army contingent than Russia. According to him, one could  speak only about a small peacekeeping detachment. Nevertheless,  those CIS member-countries, which are only setting up their  armed forces, could contribute into financing the peacekeeping  operation in Abkhazia, Grachev said.    Touching upon his meeting with the NATO supreme commander in  Europe, Army General George Joulwan, Grachev named cooperation  in holding peace-keeping operations as one of the main topics to  be discussed in future. Among the major trends of such  cooperation, Grachev pinpointed joint planning and holding  peace-keeping operations, working out general criteria for their  material and technical supplies, and military personnel training.</p>

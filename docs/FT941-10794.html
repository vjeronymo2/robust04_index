			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Carlton considers digital channels Carlton Television is considering broadcasting an experimental digital television service in London later this year. The intention would be to demonstrate as many as three extra channels offering more local services and wide-screen television. A number of public places throughout the region, such as department stores, could be used for the experiment. Discussions are still at an early stage but any experimental service would be a collab-oration with National Transcommunications (NTL), the privatised engineering and transmitter arm of the former Independent Broadcasting Authority. NTL has been conducting experiments for the Independent Television Commission in the west of England. Using conventional transmitters and mainly broadcasting test cards, the experiments have proved that the technology works. The Carlton proposal has interested the Department of Trade and Industry. The cost of manufacturing the first batch of up to 20 digital receivers would be considerable. If the project were to go ahead, programmes would be broadcast from the London Television Centre on the south bank of the Thames and transmitted from Carlton's standby transmitter at Croydon. Turning the television signal into digital form allows it to be compressed, enabling several channels to be transmitted in the capacity now occupied by a single channel. Simultaneous broadcasting of existing channels would continue for many years alongside new channels because of the special receivers needed for digital broadcasts.</p>

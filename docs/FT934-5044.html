			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Incentives for entrepreneurs are increased - Investment The government announced measures to encourage investment in unquoted trading companies and increase availability of capital to such companies, and to increase incentives for entrepreneurs who run their own businesses. Among proposals are that any chargeable gain by an individual or most trustees could be deferred where it was reinvested in shares in a qualifying unquoted trading company. The limits on gains qualifying for retirement relief are to be raised. Both measures will apply to disposals on or after yesterday. In a statement, the Inland Revenue said: 'A new capital gains tax relief for entrepreneurs selling their own company and re-investing in an unquoted trading company was introduced in the last Budget. This allowed entrepreneurs to defer any chargeable gain on the sale of their company provided various conditions were met.' Under the chancellor's proposal, the re-investment relief is to be extended to make it available for all chargeable gains realised by individuals. All chargeable gains of trustees will also be eligible for the new relief except where the beneficiaries of the trust are not individuals. To qualify for re-investment relief, the chargeable gain arising on any disposal must be re-invested in eligible shares in unquoted trading companies or in the holding company of a trading group. The re-investment must take place within a period beginning one year before and ending three years after the disposal. The main exclusions from the relief are re-investments in companies which hold more than half of their chargeable assets as land, farming companies, subsidiaries and certain financial concerns. The existing relief for entrepreneurs also requires the entrepreneur to take a 5 per cent stake in the company. This condition will not apply for the extended relief and there will be no requirement on the investor to take a minimum holding in the unquoted company. Any deferred gain will be brought back into charge if the shareholder emigrates within three years of the acquisition, or if the company ceases to meet the qualifying conditions within three years of the investment being made. Tax on the original gain will otherwise remain deferred while the new shares are held. Relief will continue to be denied where shareholders are guaranteed a return of their investment at the outset. The extension of re-investment relief will cost between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m a year from 1995-96. Subject to certain qualifying conditions being met, relief from capital gains tax is available when an individual disposes of business and certain other assets on retirement. This relief is available to taxpayers who have reached the age of 55, or who retire earlier due to ill- health. The chancellor proposes to raise the limits applied to this relief so that relief is available for the first Pounds 250,000 (previously Pounds 150,000) of gains and half relief is available on gains between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1,000,000 (previously between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 600,000). The exemption is reduced if the individual has been running the business for less than 10 years. The limits apply separately to each individual who retires, so are effectively doubled for a married couple if each satisfies the qualifying conditions. The change will cost some Pounds 10m. In the Budget, the chancellor has also proposed: To raise by Pounds 50,000 the limit on profits below which companies pay corporation tax at the small companies rate of 25 per cent; the new limit will be Pounds 300,000; To raise by Pounds 250,000 the limit on profits above which companies pay corporation tax at the main rate of 33 per cent; the new limit will be Pounds 1,500,000. The increases will apply for the financial year 1994. The chancellor's intention is to allow more companies to benefit from the small companies' relief and retain more of their profits for investment and other purposes. The main and small companies' rates of corporation for the financial year 1994 are not being changed from 1993. The rate at which companies pay advance corporation tax (ACT) will, as announced in the March Budget, be further reduced from 22.5 per cent to 20 per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1994. This will give companies which pay dividends a cash flow boost of some Pounds 1bn in 1994-5. The proposed lower profits limit for the small companies' relief is Pounds 300,000: the proposed upper limit is Pounds 1.5m. A company with profits below the lower limit pays corporation tax at the small companies' rate (25 per cent). A company with profits above the upper limit pays corporation tax at the main rate (33 per cent). A company with profits between the lower and upper limits pays corporation tax at an average rate which rises from 25 per cent when its profits are at the lower limit to 33 per cent when its profits reach the upper limit. The increase applies for the financial year 1994 (the year beginning April 1 1994) and for subsequent years.</p>

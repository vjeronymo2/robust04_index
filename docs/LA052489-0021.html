			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LANGFORD SHARP AS SIMI VALLEY ADVANCES IN 5-A  </P> <P> Right-hander Rich Langford threw a six-hitter and struck out nine as Simi  Valley High defeated Baldwin Park, 5-1, in a Southern Section 5-A Division  second-round playoff game Tuesday at Baldwin Park.  </P> <P> Simi Valley (23-3) scored three runs in the second, two on wild pitches and  another on a double by Mike Jenkins. The Pioneers scored again in the fourth  when Tyler Nelson tripled and scored on the front end of a double steal.  </P> <P> Langford (7-1), who has overcome arm problems that plagued him early in the  season, had only one bad inning. The senior allowed three consecutive singles  in the fifth to bring Baldwin Park to within 5-1.  </P> <P> Jeff Sommer homered in the fifth, his fourth, to give Simi Valley a 5-0 lead.  </P> <P> Second baseman Jesse Anguiano tied a single-game school record with four walks.  </P> <P> The Pioneers will play Long Beach Millikan, a 4-3 winner over Culver City on  Tuesday, in the third round on Friday at Simi Valley. Millikan, the host school  in the first two rounds, must play the remainder of its games on the road.  </P> <P> Simi Valley defeated Millikan, 8-7, in the El Segundo tournament in March.  </P> <P> In another 5-A game:  </P> <P> Fontana 7, Newbury Park 4 -- A two-run double by Jim Quiroz keyed a four-run  third inning for Fontana in the second-round game at Fontana.  </P> <P> Quiroz's hit snapped a 2-2 tie. Mark Carter drove in Quiroz with a single, went  to second on an error by left fielder Brian Smith, and scored on Jerry  Jamillo's double.  </P> <P> Newbury Park (19-5-3) had tied the score in the top of the third on Chris  Marsden's single, Eric Greene's triple and Danny Madsen's sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Senior outfielder Geoff Black hit his seventh home run -- a two-run blast -- in  the fifth for the Panthers' other runs.  </P> <P> Jeremy Dewey (8-3), who shut out North Torrance, 11-0, in the first round, went  the distance for the Panthers. He allowed nine hits, struck out three and  walked two.  </P> <P> 4-A DIVISION  </P> <P> Hart 10, Walnut 5 -- For a while, it looked like a repeat of 1988 when highly  regarded Hart was ousted, 12-7, in the second round by Fullerton.  </P> <P> Hart trailed, 4-0, and stranded six runners in the first two innings but  managed to rally in a second-round game at Hart.  </P> <P> An error by Walnut shortstop Steve Martinez opened the door for four Hart runs  in the fifth. Hits by Jason Edwards, David Toledo and Jay Sanford keyed the  inning.  </P> <P> Hart (21-6) added five more runs in the sixth, two on a home run to center by  Chris Vasquez, his fourth.  </P> <P> Junior left-hander Andrew Lorraine (8-4) threw a six-hitter, struck out 13 and  walked one. After Walnut scored four times in the second, Lorraine settled  down, allowing a lone run in the sixth.  </P> <P> Hart will play top-seeded Buena, an 8-4 winner Tuesday over Lompoc, in the  third round Friday. Since both teams have played two home games, a coin flip  will determine the site.  </P> <P> 3-A DIVISION  </P> <P> La Palma Kennedy 6, Canyon 4 -- Corey Byars hit two home runs but Canyon lost  the second-round game at home.  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-0, after 2 1/2 innings, Canyon (14-12) narrowed the deficit to one  with three runs in the third.  </P> <P> Tim Rorick led off the inning with a single and Byars followed with his first  home run. One out later, Rod Markovich and Kevin Backes had consecutive  singles. Markovich went to third on a fielder's choice and scored on a wild  pitch.  </P> <P> Byars hit a solo home run with two out in the sixth for Canyon's other run.  </P> <P> 2-A DIVISION  </P> <P> St. Bernard 6, Agoura 4 -- Grant Hohman hit a one-out, two-run home run in the  ninth inning to give visiting St. Bernard the victory.  </P> <P> Trailing, 4-3, in the bottom of the seventh, Agoura sent the game into extra  innings when Zac Miller scored on an error by first baseman Al Ibarra.  </P> <P> With two out and Miller on third, Bobby Kazmirski grounded to shortstop Hohman,  who threw to first in time for the final out, but Ibarra dropped the ball.  </P> <P> St. Bernard held a 4-0 lead after 4 1/2 innings, but Agoura (14-8) rallied.  Mark Costas singled, stole second and went to third on Nelson Townes' single.  Townes stole second, then a double by Brian Smith scored both runners.  </P> <P> Costas and Smith each had three hits for Agoura, the Frontier League champion,  and teammates Josh Smaler and Dan Freedman each added two.  </P> <P> SMALL SCHOOLS DIVISION  </P> <P> Queen of Angels 8, Woodcrest Christian 7 -- Trailing, 6-3, in the bottom of the  sixth, Queen of Angels scored five runs to win a second-round game at Queen of  Angels.  </P> <P> In the sixth, Chris Wilson led off with a walk. After Felix Renteria singled,  Merced Marin was safe on an error to load the bases. One out later, Bernie  Osuna doubled down the left-field line to score Wilson and Renteria. Murillo  Hipolito singled home Marin to tie the score, and scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Osuna, a junior outfielder, was four for four with three RBIs and two runs  scored.  </P> <P> Junior right-hander Steve Steger (3-0) pitched the last two innings, allowing  three runs, to earn the win.  </P> <P> Queen of Angels will play Villanova Prep, a 7-5 winner over Chadwick, on  Friday.  </P> <P> Highland Hall 7, Mesrobian 6 -- Highland Hall's Tum Ratanatraiphob singled home  Ed Anastas with two out in the top of the 10th inning to lead the Hawks to  their 11th consecutive win in a second-round game at Mesrobian.  </P> <P> In the 10th, Craig Ernst led off with a walk and was sacrificed to second.  Anastas beat out an infield hit to third, with Ernst holding at second. One out  later, Ratanatraiphob singled to right-center to end the game.  </P> <P> Junior right-hander Bob Ramirez (14-3) threw a seven-hitter for the Hawks  (21-5), striking out 14 and walking four. Ramirez set single-season school  records for strikeouts (142) and wins.  </P> <P> Ratanatraiphob, Anastas, Ernst and Chris Sorensen each had two hits for  Highland Hall, which will play second-seeded Rosamond on Friday. Rosamond  defeated Abundant Life, 13-1, on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Camarillo Christian 9, Liberty Christian 2 -- John Boardman pitched a  seven-hitter, struck out six and walked one for Camarillo Christian in the  second-round game at Rio Mesa High.  </P> <P> Camarillo Christian (18-5) took a commanding 6-0 lead in the first inning on  seven hits and two errors. The Eagles had six singles and a double in the  inning and sent 12 batters to the plate.  </P> <P> Mike Hardy, Gerald Long, Marc Marshall and Boardman each had two hits for  Camarillo Christian, which has won nine consecutive games.  </P></p>

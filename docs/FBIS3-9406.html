			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Consumer Prices and Cost </F> of Living in February"]    [Text] Consumer prices rose in February, in comparison  with January, by only 0.2 percent. This was caused by the  moderate decline in prices of food (0.2 percent) and a marginal  price increase in the other groups, which amounted to 0.3  percent in public catering and in both nonfood items and  services equal to 0.4 percent.    The moderate decline in food prices was caused, above all,  by  the decline of prices of meat and meat products (by 1.3 percent)  and eggs (by 16.9 percent). The largest increase was registered  in the price of coffee (4.2 percent) and beverages (0.7  percent). In public catering, the prices of restaurant catering  rose by only 0.1 percent, while company food services went up  1.2 percent. Only a moderate increase was registered in the  prices of nonfood items, and that in practically all groups of  goods--prices of footwear and leather haberdashery rose most  (0.9 percent), followed by household appliances (0.8 percent).  Fuel prices remained at the level of January 1994, and tobacco  prices declined by 0.2 percent. In services, prices of water and  sewage rose most of all (7.0 percent), followed by garbage  removal (4.7 percent).    Over the first two months of the year (February in  comparison  with December 1993), the prices rose overall by 2.1 percent, of  which services increased most (8.4 percent--the result of the  increased rents, heating, and hot water in January), while the  prices of nonfood items rose substantially less, as did public  catering (1.4 and 1.1 percent, respectively). The prices of  food remained at the level of December 1993.    The prorated annual rate of inflation (the average for the  past 12 months in comparison with the 12 preceding months)  amounted to 18.7 percent in February.    In connection with the consumer price development, the  household expenditures of white-color workers rose in  February--from January--by 0.2 percent, and expenditures of  farmers by 0.3 percent. Because of the largest share of food in  the overall household expenditures of pensioners, their cost of  living did not change in February (in comparison with January  1994).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kennis Chu] </F>   [Text] Beijing plans to close all swap centres in the  country by April 1. The move follows the announcement on  December 29 that China was to scrap the dual exchange rate and  float the yuan from January 1 this year. However, technical  problems have prevented the new system from operating  immediately. The first quarter of this year will be a  transitional period when foreign exchange retention quotas will  be gradually phased out and an embryonic interbank foreign  exchange market will come into existence.    According to Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecture at Hong Kong  Baptist College, Beijing aims to connect all swap centres with  the new system in three months. By April 1, the National  Foreign Exchange Centre, located in Shanghai, will supplant  existing swap centres in China and will become a national  interbank market for appointed banks to trade and settle foreign  currencies. All enterprises will then have to exchange currency  with appointed banks. He said: "It needs a transitionary period  to transform swap-based currency trading into a bank-based one.    "By that time, Shanghai will become an interbank centre and  those banks appointed can buy and sell currencies in the  interbank market," added Mr Tsang, who has consulted a number of  Chinese officials from various authorities in Beijing. Alex  Tang, research director of Yamaichi International, said: "They  should have enough time to connect all swap centres."    Previously, there were three exchange rates in China -- the  swap rate (8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar), the official rate (5.7  yuan to one U.S. dollar) and the black market rate. Companies  with approvals traded currencies at the 100 swap centres while  foreigners and individuals with approvals exchanged the yuan at  appointed mainland banks at an official rate. Under the new  exchange system, all swap centres will be removed and approved  enterprises will buy and sell hard currencies at appointed banks.    Shanghai's National Foreign Exchange Centre connects  Beijing,  Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Chengdu. "At present,  the satellite network can provide information only. You can't  make any transaction through the network," said a Shanghai  source.    The national centre is supposed to play an interbank role.  Beijing has yet to announce the list of members that will be  allowed to trade at the centre. Mr Tsang estimated that only  the four specialised banks--the Industrial and Commercial Bank  of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China and  the People's Construction Bank of China--and the China  Investment Bank would be allowed to enter the centre. "The  centre can not handle too many banks," he added.    The new exchange rate will be based on the daily average  exchange rate traded at the centre one day before. Although the  new system has already been introduced, details are scant. Like  the old exchange trading method, the new system offers limited  access, catering only to companies that need foreign currency  for their operations.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: CSFB buys stake in Russian oil producer CS First Boston, the only western institution with a Russian securities licence, has bought 2.87 per cent of Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer, Reuter reports from Moscow. Bank officials said the stake was bought at a nationwide auction in April when Lukoil offered 7.42 per cent of its shares to the public in exchange for privatisation vouchers. The Lukoil conglomerate, based in Western Siberia, consists of three oil production enterprises which together account for about 15 per cent of total Russian crude out-put. It also has two oil refineries in Perm and Volgograd, marketing outlets, banking and other financial units and is talking to a number of foreign oil firms including Italy's Agip to set up oil production ventures abroad. The 45 per cent state-owned company has announced plans to sell more shares for cash at investment tenders later this year. Foreign investors can hold no more than 15 per cent of shares in big Russian oil companies. CSFB has already bought shares in over 30 Russian companies, bank officials say. They estimate that the bank has invested more than Dollars 300m in Russia's emerging equities and debt markets so far this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, Jan 4 (AFP)--A delegation of leading  Palestinians is hopeful that the PLO executive will agree to  make the organisation more democratic, one of its members said  Tuesday [4 January].    "The atmosphere is positive, but we are expecting difficulty  over several points," said Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat and member of a seven-member delegation holding  talks with PLO officials here since Sunday.    'Arafat, who is yet to comment on the proposals, has come  under increasing fire for his autocratic style of leadership.    'Amr told AFP the debate on democracy within the Palestine  Liberation Organisation "has chances" for coming out with  results.    A change in the composition and structure of the teams  negotiating with Israel over an autonomy accord signed in  September in Washington was among the demands that could bear  fruit, the Palestinian official said.    The delegation, headed by Haydar 'Abd-al Shafi who led  negotiations with Israel in Washington before the autonomy  accord, was to present Tuesday night proposals to the Executive  Committee on how to introduce more democracy and change the  conduct of the autonomy talks.    The proposals come in the framework of implementing nine  points included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent  Palestinian personalities and sent to 'Arafat last month.    Several Palestinian officials said that most of the  executive  committee members were for applying more democracy in the  organisation.    But the PLO leader has so far commented only on issues  related to the self-rule accord on which talks with Israel have  stalled due to differences over who should control the  international borders of the future autonomous zone, the  security of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and  the boundaries of the West Bank town of Jericho.    Asked on how to apply democracy, 'Amr said it was  "premature"  to comment on the issue. But he said he was confident that  positive results would be reached, taking into consideration  ideas of reform already presented to 'Arafat.    However, 'Amr said he expected some opposition to a proposal  calling for the creation of a consultative standing committee  made up of experts that would have a parallel role to that of  the executive committee and help it "accomplish the big  responsibilities it is facing at this stage".    Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab also expressed  optimism.    There is no opposition to the call for democracy among the  executive committee members. Some proposals have already been  considered by the PLO leadership, he said.    Among those proposals, al-Najjab referred to a draft  constitution for the future autonomy in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho which he said was currently being reviewed by the  committee charged with following up the autonomy talks with  Israel.    But other officials, close to the PLO leader, still doubt  that any result would come out from the democracy debate as they  consider the move itself a struggle for power only, rather than  a call for real sharing in the decision-making process.    'Ali Ishaq, an executive committee member, told AFP recently  that real democracy had never prevailed within the PLO. He said  such an "ideal" would only be achieved through free elections  for a "constitutional, democratic, independent Palestine".</p>

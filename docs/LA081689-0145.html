			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT UP A MODERATE .2%;  </P> <P> FED READS FIGURES AS SIGNS OF EASING INFLATION PRESSURE  </P> <P> Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2% in July, but the factory operating  rate remained flat, the Federal Reserve Board said today in a report that  indicated further easing of inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> Factory use held steady at 83.6% last month after declining 0.3 of a percentage  point in June, the central bank said. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3% last  December. Last month's operating rate was down from 83.7% a year earlier.  </P> <P> The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater  difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and  price increases. Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above  as an indication of inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Straddling Fine Line  </P> <P> The central bank has been straddling a fine line of keeping interest rates high  enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing growth so much that the  economy slides into a recession. It began letting rates drop in June as  inflation seemed to lessen.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index in July stood at  141.7% of its 1977 base, up from 141.4% in June.  </P> <P> The 0.2% increase last month came after revised 0.1% drops in both May and  June. Those were the first downturns since the index fell 0.2% in February,  which had been the first drop in a year.  </P> <P> The Fed said the July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of raw  materials and continued strength in business equipment excluding autos.  </P> <P> "In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and output of  construction supplies, on balance, remained weak," it said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Factory Operating Rate Dips  </P> <P> Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods  rose 0.2%. Output was up 0.3% at mines and oil wells and 0.8% at utilities.  </P> <P> The factory operating rate dipped 0.1 of a percentage point to 83.9% at  manufacturing plants, down from June's revised 84%. The rate had peaked at  84.7% in January.  </P> <P> The rate at factories producing durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to  last more than three years -- fell 0.3 of a percentage point from 82.6% in  June.  </P> <P> The rate at factories producing nondurable goods rose to 86.2%, from 86.1% in  June.  </P></p>

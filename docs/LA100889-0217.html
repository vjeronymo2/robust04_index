			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSSIBLE MOVE OF SALCIDO TO UCI IS QUESTIONED  </P> <P> A prosecutor has raised security concerns over the proposed temporary transfer  to UC Irvine of Ramon Salcido, charged in the wine country slayings of seven  people. Salcido's attorney wants the transfer so a brain scan can be conducted.  </P> <P> Sonoma County Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Bumerts filed a motion in Superior Court  alleging that the experimental brain scan, called Positron Emission Tomography,  has not been accepted as a court standard.  </P> <P> "We just want to make sure that for such a security risk there is a real reason  for this to occur," Bumerts said. A hearing has been set for Tuesday before  Judge R. Bryan Jamar.  </P> <P> Public Defender Marteen Miller said such a test is "critically important in  saving (Salcido's) life."  </P> <P> Salcido, 28, could face the death penalty if convicted of the April 14 killing  rampage, which resulted in the deaths of his wife, two of his three daughters,  other relatives and a co-worker.  </P> <P> A preliminary brain test has indicated that Salcido has a right temple lobe  disturbance, Miller said, although he did not elaborate on that condition.  </P></p>

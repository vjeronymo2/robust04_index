			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister-designate German Correa by </F> Raquel Correa; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] Why did  [President-elect Eduardo] Frei choose you for the cabinet's most  important position?    [Correa] He should answer that question, but he told me he  thought it was a gesture on the part of the state -- a gesture  for the future -- to offer the most important portfolio to a  Socialist. He said this will erase the ghosts of the past,  putting a definitive end to "banned" areas. He said the fact  that a Socialist -- who is currently the president of the party  -- was chosen for that the post reflects the maturity of our  democracy. Second, because he recognized my personal qualities,  my ability, and the experience I acquired in the cabinet of  President Patricio Aylwin. Generation factors also played a  role: Two men of the new political generation beginning a new  phase in the consolidation of our democracy.    [EL MERCURIO] Malicious people have said it is a way to keep  the Socialists totally tied to the coalition and to the  government.    [Correa] There is no room for such malicious thoughts. To be  strong, a coalition like ours needs to share the  responsibilities of the government. And this must be done for  better or for worse. That is part of government work. It is not  a matter of burning either the Socialists or me, but of sharing  the responsibility for all the good and the bad the next  government may do.    [EL MERCURIO] Did the Socialists want the interior  portfolio?    [Correa] Not at all. Our political analysts believed it  would be politically unfeasible. A Christian Democratic Party  member would have been the most obvious choice for the post,  which is so close to the president and is so trusted by him. It  was a surprise for my party. I frankly wanted to continue to  lead my party, but when the president repeatedly offered the  most important post... Had it been any of the other 20  ministerial posts, I would have continued to say no. But this  is a historic step, an extraordinarily important, symbolic and  political gesture. I had to properly appraise it, and so did  the party. [passage omitted]    [EL MERCURIO] This ministry is in charge of public security,  and as such is in charge of repression.    [Correa] This ministry is responsible for both public  security and the immense task of regionalization and  decentralization of the country, which must be set in motion now.    [EL MERCURIO] Will you suggest to Frei names for mayors and  governors?    [Correa] Of course. As of 2 January, part of my job is to  help the president-elect create his team of under secretaries,  governors, and to fill the other public posts.    [EL MERCURIO] Will you do it with a calculator, counting the  votes of each party?    [Correa] No. I believe political factors are much more  important for cabinets, which rely on their political support.    [EL MERCURIO] The next cabinet is criticized for being more  political than technical.    [Correa] Genaro Arriagada has publicly said that this will  be  a highly political cabinet for which excellence will also be  taken into account. Excellence also applies to politicians.  The designation of some politicians to technical portfolios was  strongly criticized a few days ago. Yet I believe we did  nothing wrong. [passage omitted]    [EL MERCURIO] You said you will have photographs of Frei,  Aylwin, and Allende in your office. Which would you prefer in  the presidential chair?    [Correa] Salvador Allende, without doubt, so that he could  complete, within a different context, the dream we started in  1970; the dream that was thwarted by the convulsed reality in  the country due to our mistakes and the great national and  international plots.    [EL MERCURIO] You mean the dream of leading the country  towards a socialist system?    [Correa] But a socialist system designed for Chile, with a  lot of democracy and freedom, which Allende had in mind. I  think many socialists at that time did not understand the  socialism Allende offered.    [EL MERCURIO] Do you aspire to materialize that dream or is  it something of the past...?    [Correa] The dream is unchanged. The form of expression,  however, is quite different. It is a very democratic, very  libertarian, participative, and very fair socialism. We will  always aspire to achieve Allende's dream. He was unable to  achieve it, but...    [EL MERCURIO] It was a socialism against market freedom,  private property, which promoted expropriations...    [Correa] Precisely... We are suffering the consequences of  those mistakes. [passage omitted]    [EL MERCURIO] Will yours be a hard or soft policy?    [Correa] A democratic policy. Fully respecting human rights  and the peoples' dignity as well as the institutions in charge  of safeguarding public order that risk their lives to do their  job. Speaking frankly, we will promote the necessary changes  regarding procedures and training of the Investigative Police  and the Carabineros. We must continue the great task started by  President Patricio Aylwin's government.    [EL MERCURIO] Will the Investigative Police and Carabineros  be placed under the Interior Ministry?    [Correa] From the political and congressional viewpoint,  that  might not be feasible, but I will make every effort to achieve a  consensus with the opposition that will allow us to progress in  that direction. There are several reasons against this and we  must assess them carefully. This issue involves matters related  to the public order policy and also very legitimate issues such  as belonging to certain social security plans, being linked to  other Armed Forces' branches. There are all sorts of symbolic  aspects to be taken into account. It will be my duty, when we  tackle this issue, to take all these aspects into account.  [passage omitted]    [EL MERCURIO] How can you guarantee public order if you were  involved in disrupting it?    [Correa] Well... That was when the country was ruled by a  government that was not elected sovereignly by the people  through free and informed elections; by a regime that  systematically violated human rights; which imposed itself by  force. Therefore, it was legitimate to fight against this  illegal government. I would do so again if the country faced a  similar situation again. We now live in democracy, in a state  of law, with all its faults. I promote democratic means of  struggle which excludes the use of armed violence.    [EL MERCURIO] Had you been interior minister last 11  September, would you have authorized the demonstration by  extreme leftists at La Moneda on the anniversary of Allende's  death?    [Correa] Yes. I did not agree with the mayor's decision. By  authorizing the demonstration he could have reached direct  agreement with the leaders, thus preventing violent  demonstrations. Minor groups willing to unleash violence use  the excuse of a ban like that to exercise violence, as was the  case that day. [passage omitted]</p>

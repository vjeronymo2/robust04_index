			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press conference by Wu Yi, Gu Yongjiang, Shi Guangsheng, </F> and Liu Shanzai of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation, MOFTEC, with Chinese and foreign correspondents at  the State Council's Information Office in Beijing on 28  January--recorded]    [Text] [Wu Yi] As you know, the volume of China's foreign  trade in 1993 totaled to $195.72 billion, an increase of 18.2  percent over the preceding year. Of this, exports were $91.77  billion, and imports $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29  percent respectively over 1992. The increase of imports was 21  percentage points higher than exports, leaving a trade deficit  of $12.18 billion. In 1993 the country took a giant stride in  absorbing foreign investment. Foreign investment in China in  1992 was equal to the total investment in the previous 13 years  since the policy of reform and opening was instituted. In 1993  foreign investment was double that of 1992, and was again equal  to the total amount of the previous 14 years. Last year China  approved some 83,000 foreign-funded projects, with a total  contractual value of $110 billion; the actual amount of foreign  investment was $25.7 billion. Foreign investment in China last  year had four characteristics: 1) the scale of investment was  further expanded; 2) the proportion of capital- and  technology-intensive projects increased; 3) more and more large  foreign companies and multinational corporations invested in  China; and 4) the area of investment was gradually extended to  the hinterland. Businessmen from 126 countries and regions have  now invested in China. In the remaining time, friends are  welcome to ask questions.    [Correspondent] I am from CHINA DAILY. Would Vice Minister  Gu please tell us about the progress in negotiations for  restoring China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariff  and Trade [GATT]? What are the core issues at present? And  does China have a specific timetable for rejoining GATT?    [Gu Yongjiang] As you may know, China, a founding member of  GATT, withdrew its membership for various reasons. In 1986  China applied for the restoration of its status as a GATT  signatory. In 1987 negotiations began for China to rejoin GATT.  So far, the China Work Group under GATT has convened for  several sessions. During the sessions, the Chinese delegation  gave detailed reports on the progress of China's reform and  opening up, especially reform in its foreign trade system. In  1992 discussions on the protocol on reinstitution of China's  membership began. Hence, the negotiations have entered a  substantive stage. China also submitted lists of (?samples)  during the Uruguay Round of trade talks. China will ultimately  sign a comprehensive agreement on the Uruguay Round and become a  founding member of the world trade organization, which may be  inaugurated in the middle or latter part of next year. Before  the inauguration of the world trade organization, China should  be a GATT member.    [Foreign correspondent speaking in English with simultaneous  Mandarin translation] I am Webber from NEWSWEEK. My question  is about the protection of intellectual property rights [IPR].  U.S. officials have hinted the next trade dispute with China  will probably be in the field of IPR protection. Therefore, I  would like to ask the minister about measures to be taken by  China to avoid conflict with the United States.    [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum  of understanding on IPR protection in Washington on 16 January  1992. The Chinese Government has earnestly carried out the  memorandum, and the U.S. Government has expressed satisfaction  with the Chinese Government's efforts to implement it. The  level of IPR protection in China has surpassed the average world  level. However, I must frankly admit that problems do exist in  China's implementation of the IPR protection accord. As you  know, China is a country with a population of 1.17 billion. To  make everyone understand the law on IPR protection, it is  necessary to conduct extensive education. As for the measures  to be taken in IPR protection, we will first conduct universal  education at different levels to enable people across the  country to understand the importance of IPR protection. IPR  protection is not only the demand of various foreign countries,  but also of our own. We also need to protect our own IPR. What  is important now is to begin with education on IPR protection  throughout the country. Second, we will actively suggest the  establishment of local IPR courts in some key cities. People  with clear evidence of their IPR being infringed upon may file  lawsuits with the IPR court. The U.S. Government does not  understand the Chinese Government's positive measures on IPR  protection. It is extremely unwise for the U.S. Government to  apply pressure.    [Correspondent] I am (Gu Yunlong) from the Central  Television Network. Minister Wu Yi, China's trade deficit in  1993 was over $12 billion. What were the causes? In 1994, or  in the future, what will China do to maintain a balance between  imports and exports?    [Wu] I think the reasons for the problem of China's  suffering, a $12.18 billion trade deficit in 1993 were very  simple. One of the reasons was China's high-speed economic  development and high domestic market demands; hence there was  need to import some foreign equipment and materials. The second  reason was the great development of sino-foreign joint ventures,  cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises in  1993 which caused the need to import a large amount of equipment  and some other materials for investment in those enterprises.  Viewed from another perspective, it shows that China is a  market of huge potential and that China's market is open to the  world. On the issue of trade balance, China, of course, wants  to maintain a balance between exports and imports. But seen from  a philosophical viewpoint, balance is relative. It is  impossible to achieve an absolute balance. The Chinese  Government's attitude toward balance in foreign trade is  positive. It strives to solve the problem of trade balance  through expanding its exports and not through the negative way  of reducing imports. Therefore, we say we seek a balance  through development. I can tell you that China obtains over 80  percent of its foreign exchange through exports. If we are  unable to achieve a balance in exports and imports and if the  trade deficit keeps growing, then we will not have much  available foreign exchange, which will affect imports.  Therefore, we hope relevant countries and relevant industrial  and commercial circles will actively increase imports of China's  commodities so as to achieve a coordinated and balanced  development in bilateral trade.    [Correspondent] I am (Anrisen) from TASS. My problem is  that, Minister Wu, what are your views on the prospects of the  development of the economic and trade relationship between the  two countries this year?    [Shi Guangsheng] In 1993, the total amount of exports and  imports between China and the Russian Federation reached $7.68  billion, an increase of 30.8 percent over the same period of  1992. Th amount of China's exports was $2.69 billion, an  increase of 15 percent; and the amount of imports was $4.99  billion, an increase of 41.4 percent. As all know, China and  Russia are two close neighboring countries. Both countries  enjoy geological advantages. The two countries have a strong  complementary nature in economic terms. As long as both sides  base their relationship on the principle of equality and mutual  benefit and increase exchanges and enhance ties, the economic  and trade relationship between us will make further development.    [Correspondent] I am from GUOJI SHANGBAO [International  Commerce News]. Would you please talk about the effect of  reform of the foreign exchange structure on China's foreign  trade?    [Liu Shanzai] The recent reform of the structure of foreign  exchange was crucial to our reform of the foreign trade  structure. The reform of the structure of foreign exchange will  further expand our export and import trade, will make the reform  of our foreign trade structure more compatible with the  conditions of GATT, and will make our foreign trade structure  more compatible with the operating mechanisms of common  international practices.</p>

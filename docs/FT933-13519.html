			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (9): Loans that change their spots - The secondary market in distressed corporate debt RELATIONSHIPS between banks and big companies have become increasingly fragile over the past few years. Most banks have increasingly felt the need to pursue profit, which has had a number of consequences, not all of them pleasant, for companies. Banks have, for example, diversified into new businesses, such as investment banking. It has been quite common for one of these new investment banking subsidiaries to give advice to a bidder in a takeover battle whose target has been one of the bank's own clients. Needless to say, the client under attack is normally furious at what it sees as a breach of trust - the bank's argument that the investment banking subsidiary is acting as an independent entity, behind a 'Chinese Wall', cuts no ice. More recently, investment banking habits have been having an even more profound effect on the relationship between banker and corporate client. Investment bankers regard all assets in their balance sheets as tradeable. Trading these assets is normally easy, because most of the assets are in the form of securities. However, only a relatively small proportion of the assets of most banks are securities. Most of their balance sheets consist of loans, either to companies or individuals, which have traditionally not been tradeable. In the past, when a bank made a loan to a company or individual, it was in effect contracting to maintain a relationship with the borrower till the loan was repaid. But not any longer. Many banks now want to be able to sell these loans. The reason for this change is that the worldwide recession has left banks with little spare capital. The ability to trade in loans allows a bank to rapidly adjust the size of its balance sheet to a level best suited to its capital resources. Over the past decade, three different markets in banks' assets have grown up. Two of these are now relatively well established: the market in bank loans to less developed countries and the market in mortgages and consumer loans, repackaged as securities, or securitised. However, a third market is developing, the existence of which is having a very profound effect on the traditional relationship between banks and their corporate clients. This is a market in distressed corporate debt, or loans to companies which are experiencing financial difficulties. Until recently, when a company had financial problems, it would normally expect to negotiate a debt restructuring with the bank or banks which had originally granted its loans and which it felt it knew well. However, a number of companies in difficulties have recently discovered  - to their shock - that their banks have sold their loans to other financial institutions. In the past year, this happened to WPP, the advertising group, and to Isosceles, the supermarket operator. Such sales can complicate the process of negotiating a debt restructuring, because the buyers of the debt may need time to get to know the company and understand its problems. On the other hand, proponents of the new market argue that there can be a benefit stemming from such debt sales. A company's original bankers may have become so disenchanted with a troubled company that they will refuse to grant any new credit to that company. A new institution may, however, be rather less dogmatic. The market developed first in the US five years ago. M J Whitman, one of the leading brokers of such debt, estimates that distressed US corporate debt with a face value - not to be confused with its sale value - of Dollars 5bn was traded in 1992, double the level of the previous year. 'This year, between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 7bn is likely to be traded,' said Mr Peter Lupoff, who is in charge of corporate debt trading at the firm. When trading first began, the sellers were typically branches of non-US banks or smaller regional banks. They tended to sell their participations in syndicated loans granted to those companies with which they did not have a close relationship. However, over the past year some of the biggest US banks, including Citicorp, Wells Fargo and First Chicago, have started to make such sales, particularly of loans to property companies. 'Some of the sellers in the past year were the agents for loans,' said Mr Lupoff. In other words, banks have sold their interest in loans to companies even when they knew the company quite well. Citicorp has formally recognised that banks have now acquired a trading psychology by producing an index of bank loans to companies, which in theory allows banks to compare the return of making loans to companies with the returns available from investing in securities. The leading brokers in the debt, Whitman, Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer, are now trying to develop the market in the UK. There is also one new UK firm, Klesch and Company, specialising in the market. The UK market is still small. Like the US market in its early days, sellers are often foreign banks with branches in London - and they have tended to sell their debt participations in companies with which they do not have a close relationship. But there have been trades in the debt of several companies in difficulties, including Maxwell Communications Corporation, Brent Walker, Isosceles, WPP, Guinness Peat Aviation, Eurotunnel, Heron and Polly Peck. UK banks say they are hesitant to enter this market - though most are considering it. 'It is not something we would rule out,' said Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank. An additional factor in the slow growth of the market has been that UK investment institutions, unlike their US counterparts, have not yet emerged as very enthusiastic buyers of the debt. However, they are being lobbied intensively by the brokers. One reason for believing that a UK market may eventually take off has been the changing attitude of the Bank of England. Its associate director, Mr Pen Kent, said in a speech last November that he was concerned that selling the debt of a troubled company could impede attempts to rescue it. 'Selling debt in response to news that a company is in difficulty is not in keeping with one of the basic tenets of the London Approach (which is a Bank of England sponsored code of conduct for banks involved in rescuing a company).' However. in June his tone had changed. He said that the sale of bank debt, especially property loans, to new investors, had 'the potential for a beneficial and productive effect for a company in difficulties'. New investors might have expertise relevant to the company or might be able to take a longer term view of the returns to be made from the debt than the company's original bankers. Much as companies may feel uneasy at the thought that they may not be able to decide from which institution they borrow, the new market is probably here to stay.</p>

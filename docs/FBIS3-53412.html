			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is a strong reaction from Tunisia following  the accusations made by Amnesty International: the humanitarian  organisation claims in a report made public today that, despite  the government's pledges in the field of human rights, torture  and illegal arrests continue. Amnesty also specifies that the  repression affects not just the Islamists, but also the  government's detractors, notably members of the banned Communist  Party. There has been an immediate reaction from the  authorities refuting [these allegations] en bloc. Listen to  Secretary of State for Information Fathi Houidi, speaking to  Rida Boughezi:    [Begin Houidi recording] This is in complete contradiction  with the real situation experienced by Tunisians in an open,  tolerant country, where respect for human rights derives from a  free political choice which is reasoned and open to change. I  want to point out, in any case, that Amnesty's choice of a date  to publish this new report on Tunisia has not been made without  ulterior motives. It comes at a time when the country is  preparing for free elections, organised after an amendment of  the electoral law, which guarantees political pluralism within  the parliament, and at a time when an exceptional revision of  the electoral lists -- hailed by observers and the opposition  parties -- has just been made, and finally at a time when  Tunisia's success is being cited here, there and everywhere as  an example. It is this precise moment which Amnesty has chosen  to bring out this report and this communique, in which, in my  view, prejudice competes with an intention to wreak harm. We  knew that Amnesty had reached a point where it was not very  careful of the truth; we were not so aware that it had also  become so extensively manipulated by the fundamentalists,  because it is doing nothing other than embracing their ideas and  adopting all their arguments, which are false.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7(a)&hyph;6 addresses ``dormant'' accounts. The Board solicits comment on whether an institution should or should not be permitted to withhold the payment of interest for dormant accounts. (See comment 7(b)&hyph;4, regarding the forfeiture of accrued but uncredited interest for dormant accounts.) The Board also solicits comment on whether providing further guidance on the definition of a dormant account would be preferable to reliance on state or other law. And, if a uniform time period were to be adopted, what period of time would be appropriate to consider an account dormant?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(2) Determination of Minimum Balance to Earn Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;5 clarifies that when a consumer's account has a negative balance, institutions must use zero, and not a negative number, to determine the balance on which the institution pays interest and whether any minimum balance requirement has been met. The Board believes that the regulation prohibits institutions from using negative balance amounts for these purposes, regardless of whether a daily balance or an average daily balance requirement method is used. (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits the use of negative balances for calculating the interest figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;6 clarifies that for club accounts, such as ``holiday'' and ``vacation'' clubs, institutions cannot impose a minimum balance that could result in the nonpayment of interest for the entire club period. The Board believes a minimum balance that requires consumers to make the total number of payments or dollar amounts required under the club plan at the maturity of the account is tantamount to the ending balance method of calculating interest_a balance calculation method not permitted under the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Compounding and Crediting Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7(b)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may, by agreement with the consumer, specify circumstances in which the institution deems an account to be closed by the consumer. If an account is closed by the consumer, Regulation DD does not require an institution to pay accrued but uncredited interest, as long as this fact is disclosed. (See &sect;230.4(b)(2)(ii).) For example, institutions may provide in a checking account agreement that by writing a check which reduces the account balance to $0, a consumer is deemed to have closed an account, or that the account will be deemed closed if no activity occurs within 60 days of that transaction. (See proposed comment 230.4(a)(1)&hyph;1, which requires institutions to treat the acceptance of a deposit subsequently made by the consumer to that account as the opening of a new account.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 230.8_Advertising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to concerns expressed about the potential for misleading or inaccurate advertising on indoor signs, comment 8(a)&hyph;2 provides guidance regarding time accounts and tiered-rate accounts. The Board solicits comment on the approach taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulation prohibits institutions from using the terms ``free'' or ``no cost'' (or terms of similar meaning) to advertise accounts or account services if ``maintenance and activity fees'' can be imposed. The Board has received many questions about which fees trigger the prohibition. The Board believes that it is not possible to identify by name all fees that trigger this limitation. (See discussion for proposed comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1.) Instead, comments 8(a)&hyph;3 through &hyph;7 provide general principles institutions may use, regardless of what a fee may be named. The Board solicits comment on the proposed approach to provide guidance in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In defining the scope of ``maintenance and activity'' fees, comment 8(a)&hyph;3 addresses advertisements for ``free'' accounts with optional electronic services such as home banking. The Board believes many consumers consider electronic services such as ATM access to be an integral part of their accounts. Therefore, in its September 1992 rulemaking, the Board stated that institutions could not advertise an account as ``free'' if a fee is imposed for transactions at ATMs owned by the institution. Some institutions have questioned this approach arguing that ATM access is provided only upon a consumer's request and that consumers will receive information_including the cost of ATM access_before obtaining the service. The Board solicits comment on this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Survey of Marmara (1): Bustle in a former backwater - Turkey's fastest-growing region and industrial heartland is an important export centre that still needs to resolve infrastructural and pollution problems. This survey was written by John Murray Brown It is 10am and Bursa's silk bazaar is starting to stir, as farmers empty baskets full of tightly-spun white balls onto wooden trestle tables. Today, the cocoon auction, which in former times would have attracted the city's most powerful business names, lasts barely an hour and seems little more than a tourist curiosity. For across the Marmara region, as industries come of age, tradition is giving way to modernity. An area, which 30 years ago was a quiet back - water where Ankara civil servants took their well-earned summer holidays, has today become Turkey's fastest- growing region, an important export centre, the home of Turkey's best-known brand names, and a nursery for some of the country's most innovative public infra- structure projects. The reasons for the decline of the silk industry are not just that the region has cut down many of its mulberry trees. Merchants in the Bursa cloth arcades are doing a lively trade selling material from China. However, the real heart of the city's textile production is no longer to be found under the vaulted ceilings of the Koza Han, but in modern facilities on the dusty plains below the city. The Ottomans, before capturing Constantinople, established Bursa as their first capital, attracted by its thermal springs and good air. The environment may have suffered somewhat, but the city is now the centrepiece of Turkey's auto and textile industry, and the focus for the rapidly developing food processing sector. It is also the uncrowned centre of a region which abuts the Marmara sea, stretching from Istanbul to the Dardanelles to the west, and encompassing the vast indefensible Thracian plains on its northern shore and the orchards of Mustafakemalpasa on its southern reaches. Istanbul is not dealt with in detail here. Nonetheless, some mention of Turkey's largest city is vital to understanding the region. For what the authorities in Istanbul do, particularly in the disposal of their sewage, vitally affects the towns and villages which border on the Sea of Marmara. The Marmara, or the Propontis as the ancients called it, is caught like a bubble between the Black Sea and the Aegean. Its waters are already dangerously polluted. A project has been launched, with funding from the European Union, to monitor pollution levels using a mobile measurement and monitoring system. Attempts are also being made under the auspices of the Union of Marmara Municipalities to co-ordinate the policies of the region's 280 town halls, which encompass 10 provinces. But as Mr Fikret Toksoz, the union's secretary general sees it: 'The main problem is that no one knows what anyone else is doing.' The instances of co-operation between local authorities are all too rare. In Izmit, Thames Water, the privatised UK utility, is looking at a scheme to provide potable water not just to the Izmit municipality but also to Istanbul, where the supply of water has taxed city planners since Byzantine times. Agreeing terms has so far proved difficult. In Bursa, the municipality's main grumble is over tax. Mr Erdem Saker, the mayor, says that many of the industries in his region have their head offices in Istanbul. As a result, their tax payments, on which municipality funding is based in Turkey, go to boost the coffers of the Istanbul mayor instead of the Bursa city hall, which has to foot the bill to provide the infrastructure for these industries. At Izmit, there is another equally pressing problem. Mr Yuksel Baser, the head of the local chamber of commerce, says the region's economic growth rate, which is twice as high as the Turkish average, is providing a magnet for large-scale migration and putting a great strain on the city. Izmit, which was elevated to the status of a greater municipality last year, is a sprawling port town of 1m inhabitants. Mr Baser estimates the city will need an additional 100,000 new homes in the next five years. 'Normally, people come from other areas of Turkey but we are afraid that migrants will start arriving from Istanbul,' he says. Take the road east from Istanbul, the evidence is all too clear as the countryside is rapidly submerged by the onslaught of ramshackle development and new industry. The route skirts around the northern coast and past the old weaving centre of Hereke, a town which seems to have disappeared underneath cement factories and motorway flyovers. If Bursa is the region's private sector dynamo, Izmit by contrast has some of the qualities of a state sector sloth. According to the chamber of commerce, around 30 per cent of the city's working population is on the government payroll. Izmit bay is today the centre for Turkey's petrochemical industry and the site of one of the first paper pulp factories - government concerns which are now the target for Turkey's efforts to privatise some of its extensive public enterprises. Mr Baser is sceptical about the success of the privatisation programme. 'The problems will not be solved if the bureaucrats close this plant here so they can buy limousines in Ankara,' he says acidly. The contrast with the nearby Kentsa complex could hardly be more emphatic. Just on the outskirts of the town, on a piece of reclaimed marsh land, the Sabanci group, Turkey's second largest industrial conglomerate, has constructed one of the world's largest integrated tyre plants. The factories provide a striking reminder of the role of private sector capital in Turkey's recent development. As does the Koc group, Turkey's other big industrial player, which is also well represented in the region in a joint venture with Fiat in the car sector, and blazing a trail in the processed foods sector. But the Marmara region also has also thrown up its own generation of business tycoons. Although locally raised, many of them are first or second generation immigrants from Bulgaria and Greece, such as the textile magnates Ali Osman Sonmez, a Turk from Bulgaria and Mr Cavit Caglar, the former state minister whose parents came to Turkey from Greek Thrace in the 1940s. It is with the same entrepreneurial drive that local businessmen are now addressing the problems of the region's infrastructure. The development of the privately run port at Gemlik is a prime example of the endeavours of private sector initiatives in an area traditionally dominated by the state. The government is now looking at a series of privately franchised power and water projects using the Build Operate and Transfer model. For the region is a major energy corridor, carrying the gas pipeline from Russia to Turkish Anatolia. It is the site of the newly opened liquefied natural gas terminal at Tekirdag, the port town where Voltaire's Candide and Pangloss retire to cultivate their garden. It is on the crossroads of the region's principal highways. The sea itself is part of the vital trade route for the tankers taking oil from central Asia and for the newly independent Black Sea states, for which this is now the main route to western markets. The Istanbul peninsula is a choke point for transit and other truck traffic making its way eastwards. The congestion is again forcing planners to reconsider long-standing proposals to build a bridge across the Dardanelles to divert some of this heavy goods traffic. All the pieces are there. Some jobs have been lost, particularly in the car industry during the current economic crisis. But industrialists are confident they can switch production lines for exports and provide a cushion through this difficult period. When the recovery does come, Marmara will be the first region to take advantage of the change of climate.</p>

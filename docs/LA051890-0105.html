			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> CONTRA AIDE SCORNS DEADLINE TO DISARM  </P> <P> A senior Contra rebel leader said the June 10 deadline for disarming the  Nicaraguan insurgent force is "utopian" and that at least 10,000 rebels will  still be armed on that date. Contra political leader Aristides Sanchez said a  strike by Sandinista workers this week showed that President Violeta Barrios de  Chamorro is not in full control of the government and could not guarantee the  security of the disarmed rebels. "Whenever the Sandinistas want, they can  paralyze the country," Sanchez said.  </P></p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Regulatory hurdles may prove a stumbling block for Lloyds' bid - The Battle for Midland THE PRIME condition attached to Lloyds' bid is that it should have to run through no more regulatory hoops than its rival, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Yet it was far from clear yesterday that this would be possible because of the complexities of the two-tier UK and EC regulatory structure. Lloyds' fear is that, without this condition, its bid could run foul of the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the large share of the UK market which Lloyds/Midland bank would enjoy. On the other hand, the competing bid could sail through because of Hongkong Bank's relatively small share of the European banking market. 'This area is quite untested,' said Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, yesterday. 'This will be an early, big case.' Under EC rules dating from September 1990, a bid must be scrutinised by Brussels if the proposed merger exceeds a certain size, and a given proportion of its business is located within the EC. The Hongkong bid is already the subject of a four-week inquiry by Brussels to see whether it is 'compatible with the common market'. It is unclear whether a Lloyds/Midland bid would also fall within Brussels' ambit. Competition lawyers say the decisive factor will be whether the banks have more than two-thirds of their business in the UK. In that case, the deal would automatically fall under British jurisdiction. Commission officials refused to be drawn on their calculations about the Lloyds/Midland case. The crucial questions, though, concern what happens at the UK end. These are:  -Will the UK authorities investigate the bid? This will depend on the Office of Fair Trading, but the chances look high because of the two banks' large combined UK business. Together, they would have about 30 per cent of the market on many measures, compared with about 25 per cent each for NatWest and Barclays.  -If the OFT does recommend a referral to the MMC, would the UK also investigate the Hongkong bid, as Lloyds is demanding it should? For this to happen, Brussels would either have to decide that the case fell outside its authority and hand it back to the UK, or the UK could ask for it back on national interest grounds.  -If there was a UK monopolies inquiry, would the MMC judge the proposed mergers purely on the narrow grounds of competition? Or would it take into account the wider national interest, given the huge size of the banks involved, their key role in the economy, and the thousands of jobs at stake? During the 1980s, Mr Norman Tebbit, when trade secretary, sought to confine inquiries to competition issues. But the new trade secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, may have different ideas. Mr Heseltine is thought to be more interventionist and may prefer to return to a more widely based test of the public interest set out in the 1973 Fair Trading Act. This might include having regard to 'the desirability of maintaining and promoting the balanced distribution of industry and employment in the UK'. Lloyds' plans to shed up to 20,000 jobs from the merged bank might well fall foul of this test. There are no useful precedents to make the picture clearer. The last big wave of bank mergers took place more than 20 years ago, since when monopoly policies have changed radically, not least with the arrival of Brussels on the scene. The Bank of England takes a studiously neutral view of bank mergers  - at least in public. But regulators are generally thought to favour them because they soften competition and should result in more strongly capitalised banks. There are many possibilities as to what could happen next. If the Commission decides it has serious doubts about the effect on competition it can open a four-month in-depth investigation. If those doubts are confirmed, Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, can recommend that the deal should be blocked, or amended. It could be another five to six months before Hongkong Bank knows whether it can proceed with the deal. The Lloyds bid will face an investigation by the OFT (which could take anything up to a month) before the director general of fair trading can decide whether to recommend to the trade secretary that it should be referred to the MMC. An MMC investigation could take about three months, after which its recommendations would go to Mr Heseltine for his final decision. All in all the process could take six months. Because of the pre-conditions Lloyds has attached to its bid, the Takeover Code clock, which gives a bidder 28 days to post an offer document, will not start running. But Lloyds will still be subject to rules on acquiring and disclosing shares in Midland Bank. The bid would automatically lapse if it was investigated either by Brussels or the UK. But it could be many months before either bidder faces a clear road. Lloyds' advisers said they would be seeking confirmation from the Takeover Panel that in the event of a successful takeover for Midland it would not have to make a bid for 3i, the venture capital group, or a number of trade investments where its combined shareholding would be above the critical 30 per cent level.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE BANKS COMPARE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Lloyds              Midland 1989 Pre-tax loss                Pounds 715m          Pounds 216m 1990 Pre-tax profit              Pounds 591m           Pounds 11m 1991 Pre-tax profit              Pounds 645m           Pounds 36m Totals assets (at end 1991)      Pounds 51bn          Pounds 59bn Shareholder's equity           Pounds 2.48bn        Pounds 2.35bn UK branches                            1,915                1,830 UK staff                              58,500               51,200 Overseas staff                         9,400                6,400 Bad debt provisions                     2.8%                 3.3% Share of business market defined by  number of accounts*                     15%**                14% Market share by business customers  with less than Pounds 1m turnover       15%***               15% Market share by business customers  with turnover between Pounds 1m  and Pounds 10m*                         15%****              18%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * Industry sources   ** Natwest 28%, Barclays 27%  *** Natwest 27%, Barclays 28% **** Natwest 27%, Barclays 25%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

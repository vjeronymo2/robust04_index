			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (12): Travellers' guide Stockholm, built on a string of islands and promontories where the Baltic Sea meets the Malaren lake, is a beautiful city by any standard. Its wealth of handsome architecture and grand waterfronts make it one of northern Europe's most attractive centres. The relative compactness of the heart of Stockholm means that even a busy business visitor can savour much of what it has to offer. But to most outsiders it is still an expensive place with quirks that can catch out an unwary traveller. How to get about: Beware the Middle Eastern-style bazaar for taxis at Stockholm's main Arlanda airport. Most taxi companies offer a reduced rate for the 40km ride to central Stockholm - of not more than SKr300 - but you have to fix the fare in advance. If the driver runs the meter, you will pay up to SKr600. For those not pressed for time, the regular bus service to Centralen, the central rail station, costs SKr50. If you stay in town, many appointments will be within walking distance of your hotel. If you are anxious to cut taxi costs, the Tunnelbana underground system is simple to use, efficient and cheap. Where to stay: If you want to stay on the waterfront, the prime hotels are the Grand, the Strand and the Diplomat. All are within a short and pleasant walk of the main government offices and business area of the city. Two other big city centre hotels, the Sheraton and Royal Viking, can claim a waterfront view, but in reality are hemmed in by busy thoroughfares. For something cheaper and with more character try the Lady Hamilton or the Lord Nelson on Gamla Stan, the old town. Where to eat: If you are a fan of salmon and herring, Sweden is the place for you. Otherwise, standard fare tends to be dull. A good value option for lunch offered in dozens of restaurants is Dagens Ratt - a set menu, usually including a light beer, for SKr45-SKr50. Lunch-hour in Sweden is noon-1pm. Stockholm also boasts a range of quality, up-market restaurants. The Smorgasbord at the Grand Hotel is justly famous for its sumptuous spread. The Operakallaren at the Opera is good, but at lunchtime the Opera Bar is cheaper and more fun. Two good restaurants in beautiful settings are the Ulla Winblad on Djurgarden and the pricey Ulriksdals Wardshus on Edsviken. Be warned, however, that beer, wine and spirits prices in all restaurants are very high. Where to go: In summer take a boat trip to the islands. Look for the ferry company information and ticket offices in front of the Grand Hotel (for the archipelago) and the City Hall (for the Malaren). Vaxholm in the archipelago is a good destination for a day, or half-day trip. Take a lake steamer to the royal palace at Drottningholm for a summer treat and go to the opera at the 18th century Drottningholms Slottsteater - but tickets for the opera are hard to get at short notice. There are several good museums in Stockholm. In the city, Gamla Stan, the old town perched on an island, is a charming jumble of narrow streets and old houses where a little exploration will turn up interesting antique shops. Other tips: Always check museum opening times in advance; Swedish tourist attractions have an irritating habit of being closed in the summer because all the locals are on holiday, and restricted in the winter because it is not holiday time. In early August, Stockholm hosts its annual water festival - which is great fun, but also highly disruptive to normal business in the city centre. In July, the city is all but dead as Swedes go on holiday en masse. Do not plan a business trip then. In winter, there is no decent downhill skiing in the Stockholm area - but if you are a skater, visit in January and February. You could be in for the treat of your life - skating on the lakes and the sea. Finally, there is still a state monopoly on the retail sale of alcohol. If you want to buy it, look for branches of the Systembolaget. They are only open to 6pm on weekdays and are shut at weekends; most do not take credit cards.</p>

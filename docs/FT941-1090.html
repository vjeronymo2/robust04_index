			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: GM card offers new option - At a Glance Vauxhall's GM Card holders, who can earn points towards a rebate on a new Vauxhall car or van, can also take part in a new scheme to benefit company car drivers. Any user/chooser who drives a Vauxhall, or is planning to switch to one, will be able to swap points earned with spending on the card for vouchers useable in some high-street shops. Points worth up to Pounds 500 can be built up each year, for a total of up to Pounds 2,500 over five years. There is a redemption fee of Pounds 15 every time points are swapped for vouchers. However, this option is only available for company car drivers, unlike the rival Ford Barclaycard, which gives all card holders the choice between a rebate on a car or consumer goods and leisure breaks from a catalogue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Toubon] </F>   [Text] It has been said of Francois Mitterrand in  connection with the Socialist Party -- will Jacques Delors also  leave Europe in the very state it was in when he came aboard,  that is, prone to recurring crises and unable to find itself a  Commission president?    Ten years ago, Margaret Thatcher would not hear of  appointing  France's Claude Cheysson. Today, John Major vetoes the  appointment of Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene. It is no fluke that  the Brussels machine should once again be paralyzed by a loose  British cog. While beleaguered Tory governments have indeed been  in the habit of resorting to anti-European posturing to improve  their standing at home, such an explanation tends to fall  somewhat short of the mark and in any case clouds the real  issue: Twenty-one years after joining the Common Market, the  British have in no way given up their notion of a liberal Europe  wide open to the rest of the world, and they do not want to miss  the opportunity, so thoughtfully offered to them by the  Franco-German tandem, to remind the rest of Europe that the UK  is no more "interventionist" or "federalist" than it ever was.    To be sure, one can argue that Europe has known other crises  and that it will weather this one as it has previous ones.  Undoubtedly, but in what shape will it come out of it?  Because, unlike what used to happen when Europe bounced back  unscathed from one deadlock to the next, today each new  difficulty damages it further.    Europe is not in too good a shape, and it has only itself to  blame: While it was politically viable with six members, this  became a lot less true with nine, and then with 12 members. No  one knows how it can govern itself with 16 members, and a Europe  from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, as asked for by  Boris Yeltsin in Corfu, would -- at best -- never be more than a  broad free-trade zone. The founding fathers' spiritual heirs  may be saddened by this while Euroskeptics may rejoice, but the  fact remains that such an evolution is only natural. In the  political realm, the word for gluttony is voluntarism, but the  results are always the same: indigestion, followed by a forced  diet of lighter food. Because they wanted to go too far, too  fast, Jacques Delors and Francois Mitterrand may go down in  history not as self-styled initiators of the great European  breakthrough, but as sorcerer's apprentices who only presided  over a return to reality. Like the human body, history has its  own rhythms which seldom fit such a short period of time as one  or even two seven-year presidential terms.</p>

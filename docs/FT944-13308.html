			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / US travel agents row diffused The anti-trust division of the US Justice Department has announced an agreement which would end a threat by travel agents to boycott airlines, car rental agencies and other service providers which do not agree to pay specific minimum commission levels. The Association of Retail Travel Agents, a group representing 2,000 travel agents, had adopted a set of 'objectives' which included minimum commission levels and other demands, according to the Justice Department. The association said it would cease doing business with travel providers who did not agree to the 'objectives.' The Justice Department, which took legal action against the proposals, filed a proposed settlement in Virginia this week which would force ARTA to drop the threats and require it to conduct periodic reviews of anti-trust requirements with its officers and directors.</p>

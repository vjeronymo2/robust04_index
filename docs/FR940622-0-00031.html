			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> +&blank;``Transfer'' means the movement (including the discharge) of a patient to outside a hospital's facilities at the direction of any person employed by (or affiliated or associated with, directly or indirectly) the hospital, but it does not include moving a patient who has been declared dead or who leaves the facility without the permission of any person responsible for directing transfers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of these definitions, the term ``hospital'' means a Medicare facility certified as a hospital with its own provider number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not plan to define ``participating provider'' in part 489; 42 CFR 400.202 defines terms applicable to all of 42 CFR Chapter IV and already defines ``provider''. A provider by definition agrees to participate in Medicare. We proposed to add a definition of ``participating hospital'' and the remaining statutory definition, that of ``responsible physician'', to 42 CFR Chapter V (Parts 1001 and 1003), since these terms are used in conjunction with monetary penalties, which is under the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General. We discuss the proposed definition of ``responsible physician'' below under ``Civil Monetary Penalties.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We proposed to amend 42 CFR Parts 489, 1001 and 1003 to provide for types of sanctions that would be applied by the Department, as appropriate_ +&blank;Resolution of allegations and determination of liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the evidence available establishes that a hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to provide the appropriate screening and treatment or transfer as explained above, it would be subject to either termination of its provider agreement by HCFA in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act, or suspension of its provider agreement by the OIG. In addition, the OIG could also impose civil monetary penalties for knowing violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the Department receives a complaint, or any information or allegation, to the effect that a Medicare hospital did not appropriately comply with the emergency medical screening, stabilizing, treatment or transfer requirements, HCFA would, upon receipt of all available information and evidence, conduct sufficient review to determine whether the complaint falls within the jurisdiction of section 1867. If so, HCFA would consider the complaint a substantial allegation and would investigate the allegation thoroughly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If complaints allege acts of discrimination in violation of the civil rights laws, HCFA will refer them to the Office for Civil Rights. In the case of other complaints, HCFA would send each complainant a letter acknowledging receipt of the complaint, advising him or her of his or her rights to consider independently the civil enforcement provisions of section 1867 and stating that it will refer the complaint to other agencies if, during the complaint investigation, it determines that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of other agencies. Thus, HCFA would refer a complaint to the Office for Civil Rights if it determines that a hospital may be in violation of the Hill-Burton Subpart G Community Service regulations at 42 CFR 124.603(b)(1), which require Medicare participating hospitals that receive Hill-Burton construction grants and loans to provide emergency medical services to any person who resides (or, in the case of some hospitals, works) in the hospital's designated health service area. HCFA would, of course, inform complainants of the outcome of its investigations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA would notify State Medicaid authorities, State licensing bodies, the Office of Inspector General, appropriate PROs and the Office for Civil Rights concerning all complaint investigations and all termination actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA would determine whether the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to comply with the requirement of &sect;489.24 based on evidence of: (a) Inadequate treatment or treatment not being provided; (b) patients in unstable condition or in active labor not being properly transferred as defined in &sect;489.24(d)(2); (c) the hospital's actions, or lack of actions, causing a patient's or infant's death or serious or permanent impairment to a patient's bodily functions; or (d) a hospital's actions placing a patient's health in serious jeopardy. HCFA would determine the hospital to have been negligent if the hospital and its personnel failed to exercise care that should normally be supplied to a patient experiencing an emergency medical condition or active labor as defined in &sect;489.24(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Termination of a provider agreement by HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA's termination authority under this provision was designed so that quick action may be taken to protect Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals from any potential harm. The termination of a provider agreement was to be the initial action contemplated against a hospital that knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to meet the requirements set forth in &sect;489.24. This section would allow for the termination of the hospital's provider agreement under Medicare in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act. The termination requirement was to be contained in &sect;489.24(e). (The authority to terminate has been delegated from HHS through the HCFA Administrator to HCFA Regional Offices.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA was to revise &sect;489.53, Termination by HCFA, to include in paragraph (b) failure to comply with the requirements of &sect;489.24 as a mandatory cause for termination of a provider agreement. HCFA would also revise paragraph (c) to state that, if it determines that a hospital is in violation of &sect;489.24(a) through (d), HCFA would usually consider the violation to pose an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of persons presenting themselves to the hospital for emergency services and would terminate the hospital's approval for Medicare participation within 2 days of the determination unless the violation is corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those instances in which HCFA determined that a hospital was in violation of the requirements of the Act, it would initiate termination action. When that action was resolved, HCFA would refer the case to the OIG for possible imposition of civil monetary penalties. If the OIG, upon further investigation, discovered past violations that did not form the basis of the termination action, it could decide that a sanction is warranted and exercise its authority to impose a suspension against the reinstated provider. (See the next section.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In instances where HCFA found no violation, and therefore did not take an action, the closed case would still be transmitted to the OIG. If the OIG, upon reviewing the case file, believed that further case development was warranted, it would be free to do so. If OIG's investigation indicated that there were additional violations that were not reflected in HCFA's case file, it would refer the new case information back to HCFA with a recommendation on whether HCFA should terminate the hospital's provider agreement based on the new findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

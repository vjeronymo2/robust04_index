			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OZONE DEPLETION  </P> <P> As a veteran of 27 years in the aerosol industry, I most strenuously object to  the biased and unfair characterization that appeared July 16 (Letters).  </P> <P> Appearing above a reader's letter dealing with the city of Irvine's passing an  ordinance restricting the use of chlorofluorocarbons because of their  relationship to ozone depletion was a large picture of an aerosol can being  sprayed. The letter itself said nothing about aerosols, yet you saw fit to  include a picture.  </P> <P> Ninety-eight percent of the aerosol products sold in the United States do not  contain chlorofluorocarbons and have not for more than 10 years, yet you  ignored these facts along with placing a misleading editorial cartoon that had  nothing to do with the letter itself.  </P> <P> The only inference a reader could logically draw is that aerosols are harming  the environment because they contain CFCs. How about getting the facts straight  before you try and convict a responsible industry? Better yet, how about an  apology to the aerosol industry for your editorial error?  </P> <P> IAN R.

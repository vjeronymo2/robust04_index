			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / EC to boost Russian reform with food sales: Proceeds from Moscow and St Petersburg will go to poor THE European Community plans to sell Ecu200m (Pounds 142m) in food aid directly to Russian shop managers to help Moscow and St Petersburg cope with a the tough winter and harsh price reforms. Mr Michael Emerson, the EC ambassador in Moscow, said yesterday that aircraft, ships and trucks were arriving daily in the two largest Russian cities with deliveries of meat, milk powder, butter, vegetable oil and baby food. But with theft and poor distribution at the Soviet end plaguing previous deliveries of aid, the EC is deploying a novel system of distribution it hopes will assist the bold Russian economic reforms. Coming days after President Boris Yeltsin freed most prices in Russia, the aid will be sold at special sales to state shop managers, at a price to be determined by EC experts. The aim of the sales will be to help prevent speculative excesses in pricing by increasing supply in the face of huge demand. The shop managers will in turn be committed to selling the produce at their shops within a certain period at a price also agreed with the EC. Proceeds from the sales will go into special bank accounts held by city authorities to be spent on social welfare for those Russians most in need. Spot checks would be conducted at the stores, although Mr Emerson admitted this was no guarantee that food would not be siphoned off into the black market. Mr Emerson said the EC was determined to help Russia carry out its economic reform plan and to ease the hardships of the population in the transition to a market economy. The latest batch of aid, which includes 81,000 tonnes of meat and 28,000 tonnes of milk powder, was in response to a plea from Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, who said the situation in his city was particularly acute. But Mr Emerson suggested the aid could be diverted to other cities, say in the Urals, where shortages are also acute, if needs proved greater there. Another Ecu250m of aid is already being distributed directly to families and pensioners in need by western charities such as the German Red Cross and Medecins sans Frontieres. The present aid comes from EC food mountains, but Mr Emerson said east European countries were welcome to provide up to half the food which Russia and other republics would buy with EC credits and credit guarantees totalling Ecu1.75bn. The latter have not been used, and he expects them to last until the summer. Tass news agency, meanwhile, reported yesterday that 2.5 tonnes of baby food gathered by an American peace organisation arrived in Moscow on Thursday and was delivered to orphanages.</p>

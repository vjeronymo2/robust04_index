			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: National Power National Power's ultra-cautious accounting policies disguise the true strength of the its financial position. Despite cutting the workforce from 17,000 to 7,000 in three years, the company has found a further Pounds 150m of future restructuring costs which need to be provided for in the 1992 figures. It has also accelerated depreciation to take account of the shorter life of power stations. As always, purchases of British coal have been written down to world market prices - a policy which cost Pounds 545m in 1992. The company argues that it is now having to shut newer stations with higher book values, hence the extra provisions, while writing down coal stocks and adjusting depreciation is no more than prudent. All this is true so far as it goes, but the 16 per cent increase in dividend, 3.1 times dividend cover and gearing of 13 per cent give a better guide to the company's long term financial prospects. On projected 1993 figures, National Power has an above-market yield while its prospective price earnings ratio is around 10. Yet the company's capacity for above average dividend increases should ensure that its shares outperform the market in the medium term. If it can reduce its market share further, through a mixture of asset sales and making room for gas and nuclear plant, it may also avoid a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The regulatory risks, which have been the main brake on the share price, look overdone.</p>

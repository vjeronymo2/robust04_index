			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Decade of the deep discount: The rapid growth of cut-price chains may change the face of UK food retailing At Ed discount store in Maidstone, Kent, the message on the signs is simple: 'We've cut the frills to lower your bills.' But Ed, and hundreds of other discount stores opening all over the UK, are part of a trend that could change the way British consumers shop. Discount food shops are the fastest growing part of the UK retailing sector. From only two discount chains at the beginning of the 1990s, the number has now increased to 14. All are expanding rapidly and pose a serious challenge to the UK's established food retailers. 'This is a fascinating time in retailing,' says Mr Alan Treadgold, retail consultant at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'In the next 18 months we are heading for a real culture clash between the high-margin retailers of the 1980s and the new formats.' Share prices in the food retailing sector have fallen, on average, by about 10 per cent this year amid analysts' warnings that discounters will intensify competition and start grabbing market share from the UK's 'big three' - J Sainsbury, Tesco, and Argyll, owner of Safeway. These three had hoped that the end of the recession would bring a return to the rapid sales growth they enjoyed in the 1980s. Institutional investors, which paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in a series of rights issues in 1990 and 1991 to fund expansion by the superstore operators, are nervous about any sign that returns on investment may be less than projected. Mr Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said: 'Investors have been worried for some time about how much investment is going into food retailing. Since the City began to think the discounters might pose a threat to superstores' margins it has been pushing the sell button on the shares.' Both the established food retailers and the City have been surprised by the rapid rise of the discounters. In the 1980s, although many had tried and failed, the only successful discount chains of any size in the UK market were Kwik Save and Argyll's Lo-Cost. But in 1990, their effective monopoly was broken by the arrival of Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto. In the same year, Shoprite, an Isle-of-Man based company run by sons of one of the founders of Kwik Save, launched into the underdeveloped Scottish market. Later, several of the large grocery chains hit on the idea of converting older, underperforming superstores into discount outlets - spawning Gateway's Food Giant and Solo, Co-op's Pioneer and Shopping Giant, and Asda's Dales format. In recent months, the discount chains have accelerated their expansion plans. In January, Carrefour, the French retail giant, opened its first Ed (an acronym for Europa Discount) store in Maidstone, Kent. Costco, the third-largest operator of the US ultra-discount format known as 'warehouse clubs', signed up two sites in the UK, which it hopes to open by the end of the year. Kwik Save said in February it would expand into Scotland and increase its opening programme from 50 to 70 new stores a year. Aldi, having previously concentrated on the Midlands and north of England, announced a search for new sites in the south. In March, Netto said it was looking for 100 sites in Scotland. This month, cash-and-carry operator Nurdin &amp; Peacock said it would open two US-style warehouse clubs in the UK. The expansion of discount chains marks a move away from the style of food retailing that flourished in the 1980s. For nearly two decades after the abolition of resale price maintenance in 1964, when manufacturers lost the right to fix the price at which their goods were sold in shops, the UK grocery sector was driven largely by competition on price. That changed in the 1980s with the growth of 'value-added' retailing from superstores, as practised by the likes of Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. These retailers do not claim to have the lowest prices, but do claim to be highly competitive while providing the most attractive 'offer' - a concept that encompasses choice, quality, convenience, service, and shopping environment. They make their money from healthy operating margins (broadly speaking, a measure of how many pence, before tax and interest, retailers make on each Pounds 1 customers spend) which average close to 8 per cent - among the highest in European food retailing. But the recession has fostered a new price-consciousness in UK consumers. At the same time, the top end of the grocery market became so dominated by the big three that would-be entrants had to find new ways of operating. Enter the discounters, which work on the opposite principle. Typical operating margins are 2 per cent or less, but the stores make money by shifting large volumes of goods. Both start-up and operating costs are kept to a minimum by buying or renting cheap sites, spending little on technology and fittings - with goods often sold from cardboard boxes on warehouse racking - stocking only a limited range, and employing few staff. The formula can be a powerful one. Efficient discounters can turn round their entire stock every 20 days or less, so they have often sold stock before they pay their suppliers for it. That means their working capital for expansion is effectively provided by their own suppliers. City observers agree that discounters are likely to double their annual sales from between Pounds 3.5bn and Pounds 4bn last year, to Pounds 7bn to Pounds 8bn by 1996. Their share of the grocery market is forecast to rise from about 9 per cent to 14 or 15 per cent during the same period. That will have a big impact on the shape of the food market in the UK. Shoppers are likely to benefit from increased price competition throughout the sector. They will also be able to choose from an unprecedented range of formats, according to the relative importance they attach to price, choice and quality. For there are several different types of discounters, from the limited-range deep discounters which stock only 500 to 1,000 lines at the lowest prices, to the discount supermarkets who offer 1,000 to 5,000 lines at slightly higher prices but compensate by offering greater choice. Then there are the discount superstores, usually conversions of conventional superstores, which try to combine discount prices with the kind of range offered by a Sainsbury or Tesco. But increasing competition, limiting margin growth and damping food price inflation spell problems for existing retailers. Significant casualties are predicted as the discounters increase their market share  - although opinion is divided on which companies will be worst hit. Some believe it will be the big superstores. 'Discounters will have an increasing impact on the big three within a year or two,' says Mr Robert Clark, director of Corporate Intelligence Group, a retail research company. 'Even now there are individual superstores that are sweating badly.' The crucial question is whether limited line formats can make their prices so tempting that even committed superstore shoppers cannot ignore them. Bigger losers may be what analysts have termed the 'soft targets': small, independent grocers; the co-operatives; the struggling Gateway chain; and John Lewis's Waitrose group, which, as a partnership, does not have the same access to cheap money as quoted retailers on the stock market and is falling behind in terms of expansion and new technology. Mr Bill Currie, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, believes the toughest competition, however, will be within the discount sector itself, as more efficient limited-line operators continually lower prices in an attempt to drive out higher-cost competition. Whichever companies fall victim, the new focus on price is likely to shift the balance of power in UK food retailing. If the 1980s were the decade of the gleaming superstore and the delicatessen, Kwik Save, Shoprite and other discounters may make the 1990s the decade of the Day-glo sign and the warehouse rack.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              DISCOUNT FOOD STORES* THE THRILL OF NO FRILLS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Stores            Annual sales (Pounds m)                      Dec           Dec          Dec             Dec                     1992          1997         1992            1997  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Kwik Save            780           950        2,560           3,840 Aldi                  63           240          287           3,260 Solo                  47            47          170             210 Netto                 45           220          168             950 Shoprite              35           210          111             800 Food Giant            20            40          350             770 Pioneer               11            35          110             400 Discount Giant         7            20           64             200 Dales                  4            34           77             750 Ed                     1            80            4             370  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total              1,013         1,876        3,901           9,550  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Barclays de Zoete Webb Research  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

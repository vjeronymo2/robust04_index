			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Iceland finds enemy to replace Soviet N-subs: Robert Corzine reports on whaling's cold war THE Russian nuclear attack submarines which used to roam the waters off Iceland during the cold war no longer pose a threat to the country's prosperous isolation. Most of the 'floating Chernobyls', as they are known locally, lie rusting away in Russian ports, with only the occasional foray into the North Atlantic being picked up by Nato's surveillance system on the island. But something sinister still lurks beneath the waves, according to the Icelandic government, and that is the Minke whale. Officials in the capital, Reykjavik, believe an estimated 100,000 of the mammals are eating their way through the dwindling stocks of cod in Iceland's 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The fear of the Minke's impact on the country's dominant economic resource is such that Iceland walked out of the International Whaling Commission meeting in Glasgow in June, vowing to resume limited whaling next year. 'It would be a death warrant for Iceland unless we are allowed to continue as a hunting nation,' says Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, the foreign minister. 'We are prepared to fight for the principle of being able to use marine resources,' although he acknowledges that the threat of retaliatory sanctions or consumer boycotts of Icelandic products is real, particularly in the US and Europe. The pristine condition of the four whaling ships laid up in Reykjavik harbour may testify to the Icelanders' determination to resume the hunt for what their research suggests is not an endangered species. But the ships are old and likely to be the last of their line - new investment is reserved for modern freezer trawlers crammed with the latest in electronic gear, if not fish. The sensitivity of a small country to what it perceives to be outside interference explains some of the government's defiance on the issue. But its hard line over whaling and the right to exploit marine resources may also mask deeper fears that the international concern over whales and other marine mammals could eventually be extended to large-scale fishing generally. And that would call into question the economic viability of Iceland. The crisis in the fishing industry has caused a recession which is now in its fifth year, with the 'steepest decline ahead', according to Mr Hannibalsson. The stocks of cod, which account for 40 per cent of fish exports and which in turn represent 80 per cent of total exports, are close to collapse, according to the International Council for Exploration of the Seas. Last June it recommended a 40 per cent cut in Iceland's quota for 1993, a move which would have reduced sharply Iceland's foreign exchange earnings. The government shied away from such a drastic cut, but two months ago it slashed the 1993 quota by 27 per cent. Although the fishing industry employs only 5 per cent of the workforce, it is the base upon which Iceland has built an enviable prosperity for its 250,000 citizens, who enjoy an average annual income per head of about Dollars 25,000. Alternative export industries on the scale of the fishing sector are not readily apparent. The sharp decline in the cod catch in recent years prompted the government to promote fish farming, but the results have not been encouraging. A proposal to exploit Iceland's hydroelectric potential by laying one of the world's longest cables across 950km of ocean to northern Scotland, where it could plug into the European grid, is technically feasible. But the associated dams and direct current link would cost more than Pounds 1bn and take 12-15 years to build. Plans by a Swedish, Dutch and American consortium to build a second aluminium smelter to join a Swiss-owned one already operating on the island are in abeyance because of uncertainty over demand for the metal. Other industries, including steel and chemical companies, might also be persuaded to build plants. Some Icelanders, however, worry that more industrial schemes would hurt the country's reputation for having the most pollution-free environment in Europe. They fear it could also damage the growing tourism industry. 'If this becomes a long-term decline then we could lose our best people,' says Mr Hannibalsson. He points out that a third of the skilled work force has been educated abroad and that many could move relatively easily, especially to Europe. Icelandic membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) - which Mr Hannibalsson says should be approved by the end of the year - could facilitate any exodus. But without the EEA Iceland 'would be in danger of political isolation and of being excluded from European affairs', he says. The government's enthusiasm for closer formal ties to Europe is strictly limited, however, and there is no sign that it will follow other Nordic countries towards full participation in the EC.</p>

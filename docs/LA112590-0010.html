			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> THE REAL DIRT  </P> <P> To give a book as a gift to a gardener, it is best to first find out what kind  of gardener he or she is. They are not all alike.  </P> <P> If you are a gardener, you already know this and will instantly recognize the  various types, and I hope you will forgive the caricatures that follow.  </P> <P> There are, of course, casual gardeners with no particular penchant for anything  and no distinguishing marks. They grow marigolds next to roses and don't mind  at all the clash of colors and culture.  </P> <P> Mostly they come out in the spring and then aren't seen again at the nursery  until the following year. Their yearly purchase: a sack of fertilizer for the  lawn, that flat of marigolds, plus some bug spray for the roses. They water  everything with thumb clamped over the end of the hose.  </P> <P> These gardeners are frugal sorts (some even mow their own lawns) and for the  most part they limit their book purchases to Sunset or Ortho how-to books with  price tags of $9.95 or less, so they would be thrilled to receive The Gardens  of Southern California, with photographs by Melba Levick and text by Helaine  Kaplan Prentice (Chronicle Books: $35).  </P> <P> The gardens referred to all are public ones, so they can visit in person after  looking at the lovely photographs (there are no fewer than 25 public gardens to  visit between Santa Barbara and San Diego). At the end of the book there are  maps that roughly locate the gardens, plus the necessary addresses and phone  numbers, visiting days and hours. The text is quite well done and often  amusing. Another large group of gardeners is composed of transplants from other  climates. They formerly grew peonies and lilacs back home in the East or  Midwest and are in need of direction in California's very different climate.  </P> <P> They often read the wrong books, and go further astray. The book they need most  is the standard New Sunset Western Garden Book, which describes Western  climates, cultural practices and the plants we grow here, in no-nonsense text.  But for gift-giving, consider one of these:  </P> <P> The Pacific Horticulture Book of Western Gardening, edited by George Waters and  Nora Harlow (David R. Godine: $50), is perhaps the most exiting book of the  season, even though all of the material is from past issues of the magazine  Pacific Horticulture. This is cutting-edge material, though, since this  epicurean magazine is generally far in advance of current gardening trends.  </P> <P> In particular, this book makes the point that we are a Mediterranean climate --  not desert, not tropical, not temperate. Actually, every avid West Coast  gardener, not just transplants, should have this book; it will elevate anyone  to the level of sophisticated horticulturist.  </P> <P> The most surprising book of the season is called The Mediterranean Gardener by  Hugo Latymer (Barrons's: $35). This is the first book I have seen that tells  how people garden around the Mediterranean sea, and what they grow. It is not  specifically about California, but about a sister -- and namesake -- climate,  and as such is very interesting and inspirational. It is fun to see native  California plants, such as the ceanothus, called "outstanding" when they are so  seldom grown in their own native land.  </P> <P> Gardeners who like nothing better than to get their hands dirty will enjoy  Masters of the Victory Garden by Jim Wilson (Little, Brown: $19.95, paper)  because it is about really good gardeners and how they grow plants. The  transplants among us should ignore the sections on rhododendrons, hostas and  peonies, which don't grow here or are darned difficult, but the daylilies,  roses, lilies, peppers and other plants mentioned in this book do fine.  </P> <P> A growing group of gardeners sees the yard as part of the overall environment.  They are interested in native plants and wildflowers, and would be thrilled to  receive Butterfly Gardening, by the Xerces Society (Sierra Club Books: $18.95).  This is about butterflies and the plants they use for food, and how to set up a  garden that is as attractive to butterflies as Westwood is to teen-agers.  </P> <P> Collectors are quite another group of gardeners and more common than you might  think. You probably know one or two of them. To ferret them out, casually ask  these simple questions when the opportunity arises: What is your favorite  plant? What is your second-favorite plant? If the answer both times is African  violets, or cactus, or bromeliads, or orchids, you have uncovered a collector.  As a rule, they like one group of plants and have absolutely no interest in any  other. They are very difficult to buy books for because they probably already  own every one of interest. If you happen to know an orchid collector, however,  you might beat him to the bookstore for the brand-new edition of Home Orchid  Growing by Rebecca Tyson Northern (Prentice Hall Press: $45), one of the more  understandable of orchid books. Here is everything about orchids, from Acallis  to Zygostates.  </P> <P> Everybody loves roses, so books on roses have an almost universal appeal.  Although there are certainly rose zealots who grow nothing else, they were  clearly not the intended audience for The Glory of Roses, with photographs by  Christopher Baker (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $50). Author Allen Lacy  provides an interesting and amusing text and takes a stab at identifying the  various roses in the gorgeous photographs by Baker. But be forewarned: They  often go unnamed, which on occasion is quite frustrating if you are looking at  a rose you desperately want for your own garden. Never mind; in this case the  pictures alone may be worth the price.  </P></p>

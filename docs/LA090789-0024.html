			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER?  </P> <P> We suburbanites have tremendous interest but little say on how things go with  our Los Angeles city government. We suggest it may be time to at least consider  a city manager form ofgovernment. We have an able but extremely large and  provincially-concerned council. We havea most commanding and personable mayor  who makes an impressive greeter and head of state. We very much need a  100%-honest and dedicated city manager to efficiently act in the best interest  of our entire population , leaving our mayor free for good-will trips and  public, ceremonial functions.  </P> <P> JOHN ANDREWS  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

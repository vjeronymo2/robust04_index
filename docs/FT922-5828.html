			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Consultant's critique Sometimes it pays to go against accepted practice. Steele &amp; Company prefers to rent rather than buy computer systems. In accounting terms this make little sense. Since the rental company carries the depreciation charges, it must pass them on to the customer or make a loss. So the renter pays all the depreciation and has to add a profit margin on top. As a balance sheet manipulation technique, it has little to commend it either. Most auditors treat software as a form of consumable and write it off in the first year. Hardware is usually written down straight-line over three years. The residual value of three-year-old hardware is zero in most cases. It is only worthwhile if the rental adds some value. For short-term rentals this value is gained by the flexibility in obtaining and returning the equipment. Steele &amp; Co gains its value from rental by the ties it creates with the system provider. Getting support on computers, once installed and running, is notoriously difficult. By renting, Steele forces the vendor to be more attentive to problems. It also frees them from risks of failure in high-cost items. Steele has also reduced the maintenance costs by a third. Usually, support contracts cost 15 per cent of the original purchase price. Steele is paying only 5 per cent of the capital value. Software is more akin to a subscription than a purchase. Every major PC software package is updated annually. Each update costs Pounds 50-Pounds 99 which is typically 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the retail price. Most users take these upgrades without question, providing a steady stream of revenue to the software developers. The problems in accepting new technology that Hankey describes are typical. Computer systems are binary both in their construction and in peoples' attitudes - either on or off, with nothing in between. A new system is seen as a panacea by some and a threat by others. As with any tool, the gains are realised only by perseverance and practice. Kevin Grumball The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes</p>

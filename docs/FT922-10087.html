			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Bank signals early rate cut MOVES BY the Bank of England suggested yesterday that the government is set next week to sanction a cut in base rates by up to half a point in an effort to strengthen faint signs of recovery. The signals, which took the form of operations on money and gilt-edged markets, came amid fresh signs of a weak upturn in housing and retailing. The Bank's moves suggest Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, has decided to capitalise on sterling's recent strength by acting quickly on base rates, now at 10.5 per cent, rather than wait for further evidence that the economy may have turned up after the election. They also indicate Mr Lamont intends to gamble against the possibility of an imminent rise in German rates. There has been speculation that the Bundesbank might tighten rates - perhaps when its council meets on Thursday  -in an attempt to force down wage and price inflation. In the Bank of England's money market operations yesterday it cut - for the third day - the rates at which it lends to the money market through the purchase of long-term bills. It also announced the issue of Pounds 800m of short-dated 8.75 per cent gilts, maturing in 1997, when markets reopen on Tuesday. Given the rising gilt market, the bonds are unlikely to find buyers unless the Bank cuts rates on Tuesday or soon after. Meanwhile, the Nationwide Building Society said its house price index rose by 0.7 per cent in April, only the second increase in 10 months. The society's estate agents reported house viewings up about 35 per cent on last year. Even so, the average house last month was valued 3.7 per cent lower than in April 1991. As for retailing, the British Retail Consortium said revenues at many big shops had been higher than expected last month. Speculation about a rate cut pushed down the three-month interbank rate by about 1/8 point to some 10 1/4 per cent. Anthony Harris on gilts, Page 9 Currencies and rates, Page 15 Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Leathes joins board in Warburg reshuffle Simon Leathes, 46, chief financial officer of S G Warburg, has joined the board of the S G Warburg Group. His promotion is the latest sign that the next generation of managers is moving into place at Britain's biggest merchant banking group. Leathes, a chartered accountant who joined Warburg in 1980 from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, effectively replaces Michael Gore, 56, who had been finance director since the formation of the group in 1986. Gore, who remains a group vice chairman, handed over most of his financial responsibilities to Leathes just over a year ago when he moved to Tokyo to head the group's Asia/Pacific business. Although Sir David Scholey, 58, continues as chairman of the S G Warburg Group, several of the senior figures involved in the 1986 merger of Mercury Securities, Akroyd &amp; Smithers, Rowe &amp; Pitman and Mullens &amp; Co, have retired. Peter Stormonth Darling, 61, who headed the Mercury Asset Management business for many years, retired last year and handed over to Hugh Stevenson, 51. Next month, Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, 59, former senior partner of Rowe &amp; Pitman, retires as chairman of S G Warburg Securities and a vice chairman of the group. He will remain a non-executive director but hands over the chairmanship of S G Warburg Securities to Nicholas Verey, 51, the deputy chairman. Verey, whose cousin David heads Lazard Brothers, is a former Rowe &amp; Pitman partner. Meanwhile, Dutchman Herman van der Wyck, 60, is handing over the chairmanship of S G Warburg &amp; Co, the merchant bank, to Derek Higgs, 50, the deputy chairman. Van der Wyck remains a vice chairman of the group and becomes chairman of S G Warburg International, a newly-formed company which will concentrate on the development of the group's international business.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'AS NASTY AS THEY WANNA BE' ALBUM'S OBSCENITY TRIAL BEGINS  </P> <P> The debate over whether the lyrics of a recording by the million-selling rap  group 2 Live Crew are obscene moved to a higher level today with the issue's  first airing in federal court.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine if "As Nasty as They  Wanna Be," which has been removed from store shelves in several Florida  counties, should also be banned in Broward County.  </P> <P> The county ordered the ban. Lawyers for the Miami-based group then asked  Gonzalez to lift the ban.  </P> <P> Three of the group's four members -- David Hobbs, whose stage name is Mr. Mixx;  Chris Wongwon, known as Fresh Kid Ice, and Mark Ross, who performs as Brother  Marquis -- were present for the trial's start.  </P> <P> Leader Luther Campbell was expected later, said Debbie Bennett, a spokeswoman  for the group's record company.  </P> <P> The album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" has sold nearly 2 million copies, while a  toned-down version of the album has sold about 300,000 copies.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SETTING THE STAGE FOR A RICH HARVEST  </P> <P> Despite the grumbles from the political extremes, Bush's appointment of David  H. Souter to the Supreme Court has every indication of being a superb choice --  both substantively and politically.  </P> <P> What the country should care about is that the New Hampshire jurist -- by the  unanimous testimony of those who know him -- brings a powerful, superbly  trained legal intellect, disciplined work habits and genuine independence of  judgment to the issues before the high court.  </P> <P> The political finesse of Bush's first Supreme Court appointment is underlined  by the array of attractive options now open to him for those who may follow  Souter. After naming an easily confirmable conservative who shares his own New  England, Yankee, WASP heritage to replace Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Bush  has put himself into a position where he can play tough but rewarding ethnic  and ideological politics with subsequent Supreme Court choices.  </P> <P> The tip-off to the long-term strategy came in the eagerness with which White  House officials aided reporters in learning the identities of those who they  said were highest on the list of also-rans behind Souter. They were, in the  White House's publicized order of preference, Circuit Court Judges Edith H.  Jones, a Texan and a woman; Clarence Thomas, a black; and Laurence H.  Silberman, a Jew -- all clearly in the conservative camp.  </P> <P> A Democratic political consultant who looked at the list remarked, "They've got  perfect positioning if they want to pick our coalition apart." What he meant  was that if Bush gets the opportunity to make additional court appointments  before 1992, he can force the Democrats either to acquiesce in moving the high  court much further to the right -- or to pay an exceptionally high political  price by challenging nominees from important constituencies.  </P></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why it pays to keep good company - Planning Your Pension / Debbie Harrison examines the different types of occupational schemes and their advantages BRITAIN has the most developed private sector system of pensions in the EC, covering about 50 per cent of employees. Most of these - more than 11m people - are in occupational schemes approved by the Inland Revenue, and total funds backing them are estimated at Pounds 300bn. But what advantages do they confer in return for this massive investment? Company schemes are extremely tax-efficient. Contributions are paid free of basic and higher rate tax, the pension fund builds up tax-free, and a significant chunk of pension can be taken as tax-free cash at retirement. The pension itself is taxed as income. There are two main types of occupational scheme: final salary and money purchase. Final salary schemes still dominate both the public and private sectors. Final salary schemes Under these - also known as 'defined benefit' schemes - the pension is linked to the value of the employee's final salary at retirement. Most schemes are contracted-out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) and pay a reduced rate of employee and employer National Insurance contributions. In return, they guarantee to provide a pension at least as good as the Serps benefit given up. This is known as the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP), which must increase annually in line with the retail prices index (RPI). (Contracted-in schemes simply pay a pension in addition to Serps). In a typical scheme, the pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40/60ths, or two-thirds. Where tax-free cash is taken, the value of the pension is reduced. Less-generous schemes operate on an '80ths' basis where the employee builds up 1/80th of final salary for every year of service and after 40 years has achieved a pension worth only 40/80ths, or one half, of final salary. But public sector schemes that operate in this way are treated as equivalent in value to a 60ths scheme because the tax-free cash is paid in addition to the pension. About 50 per cent of company schemes reduce the pension by integrating with the state scheme. Typically, where a scheme is integrated, the first slice of salary up to the NI lower earnings limit of Pounds 2,800 is classed as non-pensionable. A minority of schemes for senior management is very generous and builds up at the rate of 1/30th of final salary for each year of service, allowing the employee to achieve a maximum two-thirds pension after just 20 years. In the past, the pension age in most company schemes was 65 for men and 60 for women but, following a change in EC law, many are moving towards an equal pension age of 65. Where an employee takes voluntary early retirement, the pension almost always is reduced. Most final salary schemes provide other important family protection benefits in addition to the pension itself: for example, death benefits of between two and four times annual salary, or widow's and dependent children's pensions. Long-term disability pensions and private medical insurance also are common. By law, every scheme must have an additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) provision although, since 1987, employees also have been able to contribute to individual plans known as free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) and provided mainly by insurance companies. Employees can contribute up to 15 per cent of gross pay to an occupational scheme. Pay in this context is defined as basic salary plus benefits such as overtime, bonuses, and the taxable value of fringe benefits. But some schemes limit pensionable pay to basic salary. Earnings excluded from pensionable pay under the main company scheme can be used for AVCs. In practice, most employees pay about 5 per cent of salary into the scheme while employers vary their contributions according to what is needed to meet the pensions guaranteed by it. As a result, employers tend to pay more on behalf of older employees approaching retirement than for younger employees who have 30-40 years to go. Where employers do pay a fixed rate, this is usually twice that of the employees. Over the past five years, the Revenue has restricted the pensions of certain high earners. In particular, some employees are, in the present tax year, subject to a cap of Pounds 75,000 on which contributions and the final pension can be based. This cap applies to members of final salary schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and members who joined any final salary scheme after June 1, 1989. For them, the maximum contributions for this tax year are limited to Pounds 11,250 (15 per cent of Pounds 75,000), while the maximum pension is two-thirds of the cap, or Pounds 50,000. Companies can provide pensions for salaries above the cap by using 'unapproved' schemes which, although recognised by the Revenue, do not have the same tax advantages as those that are approved. If you change jobs after two years in a scheme, you cannot claim a rebate of contributions and must leave your pension where it is - known as a preserved pension - or transfer it elsewhere. By law, the value of a preserved pension must increase by the level of the RPI up to a cap of 5 per cent. This is known as limited price indexation, or LPI. The other options are to transfer your benefits to the new employer's scheme or to an insurance product - either a personal pension or a buy-out bond. But transfer options should be considered only with the help of a pensions professional. Most companies provide annual increases of 3-5 per cent on pensions in payment. Some increases are guaranteed, but others are discretionary reviews. When an outstanding requirement of the Social Security Act 1990 is introduced, all schemes must increase pensions by at least LPI although, where the scheme is not in surplus, LPI will apply only to benefits built up from the date of implementation. Public sector pensions increase automatically in line with the full RPI, as do public sector preserved pensions. Money purchase Under a money purchase scheme, contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement which is used to buy an annuity. The value of the fund - and, hence, the annuity - is not guaranteed but depends on the provider's investment performance and charges. There are two types of money purchase arrangement: contracted-out money purchase schemes (Comps) and group personal pensions (GPPs). Under a Comp, the Serps rebate must be included in the 15 per cent contribution limit. Since Comps are classed as occupational schemes by the Revenue, the annuity income must not exceed two-thirds final salary. Some Comps provide a guaranteed minimum pension but others offer only 'protected rights' where the the rules guarantee that a minimum contribution, equal to the Serps rebate, is paid into the fund. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee of what this will be worth at retirement. Most Comps also provide death in service benefits. Just to complicate matters further, there is also a Comp where the annuity purchased by the pension is paid in addition to Serps. In 1988, companies lost the right to make membership of their schemes a condition of employment. This coincided with the introduction of personal pensions which allowed employees to opt out of Serps individually for the first time. Group personal pensions are not classed as occupational schemes by the Revenue. In practice, they operate in the same way as individual plans although, sometimes, the employees benefit from the economies of scale. All GPPs used to contract-out of Serps offer protected rights. Personal pension contribution limits start at 17.5 per cent of net relevant earnings (equivalent in this context to pensionable pay) for employees up to age 35, and rising to 40 per cent for employees age 61 and over. Employer contributions must be included in these limits. Next week: Personal pensions</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A classic strategy - The publisher which revived Everyman's Library ABOVE A pornographic magazine shop in London's Soho, one of the most startling publishing stories of recent years has unfolded, to the surprise of the publishing establishment. Three men have spent little more than two years resurrecting the nearly defunct Everyman series of hardback classics. In the process they have created a substantial market in the US, introduced the newly-designed tomes into almost every good bookshop in the uk and, from scratch, sold 750,000 volumes in spite of the worst retail conditions for 20 years. In the first nine months of trading, David Campbell Publishers, new owners of the Everyman's Library with its hard back rights to 1,200 titles, racked up a turnover of Pounds 2.4m. It surprised itself by making a pre-tax profit, one of Pounds 120,000. For the current year to July, the tiny company is on course to make Pounds 500,000 pre-tax on sales of Pounds 3.9m. 'Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide' is scrolled into every one of the 60m books published in Everyman's Library since production started in 1906. The problem was that the company lost its guide some time in the 1940s. In spite of owning rights to a vast range of works from translations of Aristotle to Conrad and Dickens, the company fell into decline. During the 1980s it changed hands twice, ending up in the Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson stable and with a yearly turnover of only a few hundred thousand pounds. 'I had been tracking it for a long time,' says David Campbell, who was then a senior manager at the Hachette publishing company in France. 'I could never understand why there was no hardback series of the world's greatest books in English. There is even one in Norwegian for goodness sake] Everyman was a great brand name and brand names are very rare in publishing. It was also a good business idea.' That idea was to produce high quality hardbacks, cloth bound rather than glued and with acid free paper that would not brown. 'I thought that if we could produce such books for only a few pounds more than a paper back we'd have a market.' The target was the gift trade and readers who wanted affordable books in 'permanent' form. Campbell spent three years trying to raise the cash. In 1990, the venture capital arm of merchant bank Robert Fleming provided capital of more than Pounds 1m to cover the (much lower cost) purchase price and working capital. For this the bank obtained a quarter stake in the new company. The bulk of the shareholding is held by Campbell, Mark Bicknell, a 38-year-old former investment banker, and Alewyn Birch, a man with a long career in publishing. Campbell and Bicknell, who run the company, together put in a little over Pounds 100,000. 'That's enough to hurt but not to take the roof away,' says Bicknell. After the purchase it took a year to get the business running. Some of this time was taken signing up a printer - Bertelsmann of Germany which produces all the new Everyman books (retailing at Pounds 7 to Pounds 16 and averaging Pounds 10) - and Random House, the US publishers, which handles all marketing and distribution. 'You can be well managed, inventive and quick on your feet but no matter how clever you are you need firepower and small companies don't have firepower,' says Campbell. 'We were very fortunate that the US deal provides up front cash flow,' says Bicknell. 'That gave enormous comfort to our printers.' On each print run the little company is paid in advance about one third of what it is eventually due. David Campbell Publishers operates with small overheads, paying Pounds 18,000 a year for a three storey office in Soho and employing just four full time staff. Currency movements have made a large contribution to profits. The rise of the D-mark against the pound has not been beneficial but the strengthening of the dollar has generated a windfall. 'We bought the company when it was Dollars 1.60 to the Pounds 1,' says Bicknell. 'It then went to Dollars 1.90 and is now down to just over Dollars 1.40. If it had stayed at Dollars 1.90 making a profit would have proved very difficult. We are making a margin of 5 per cent and currency movements could wipe that out. I spend an hour a day talking to foreign exchange dealers.' The company's success nevertheless reflects its publishing nous. Of the 128 titles so far printed, 40 were not in the Everyman stable. 'Of the 1,200 titles we could plunder a good quarter we would not want to publish,' says Campbell. Not surprising perhaps when they include obscurities such as F W Robertson's Sermons on Christian Doctrine or The Channings by Mrs Henry Wood. Instead Cambell has been buying hardback reprint rights to 20th-century authors outside the Everyman stable, including Orwell and Hemingway. The company has also launched a series of children's books. 'I thought there was a market for proper reading books with nice illustrations.' Alice in Wonderland in smart, heavy duty binding sells for Pounds 7. Treasure Island comes with drawings by Mervyn Peake. The company has relaunched and repackaged a publication called Your Birthday, 80 pages of historical events and famous birthdays - now being published by W H Smith. Everyman hopes the little books, retailing at Pounds 3, will prove a cash cow. The company has also acquired the English language rights to a new travel series by a French publishing house, the books containing up to 2,000 illustrations in seven colours. One trend that has helped is a readership swing towards the classics. 'I think one reason is that there are 125,000 new titles in the English language every year and that is far too many. Booksellers are all clogged up and the man on the Clapham omnibus doesn't know what to take.' One consequence is what has been termed the classics wars. Other publishers are churning out volumes at a rapid rate of knots though all of these, from Penguin to World Classics and Oxford are in paperback. One publisher, Wordsworth, sells its paperback classics for Pounds 1. Some in the publishing industry who thought Campbell was mad to buy Everyman think Campbell could catch a cold from these new low-cost books. He dismisses the suggestion. 'We have no competition. Wordsworth will hurt Penguin. The more razzamataz in the market for classics the better.' Everyman's Library, Random Century House, 20 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 2SA. 071 - 973 - 9000</p>

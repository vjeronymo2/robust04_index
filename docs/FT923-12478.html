			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Producers suspected over zinc squeeze Producers suspected over zinc squeeze SUSPICIONS THAT Zinc producers might be mounting a concerted price support operation emerged this week as prices of the metal staged a sharp rally in defiance of the continuing rise in exchange warehouse stocks and the unpromising short-term economic outlook. As the LME stocks figure grew by another 875 tonnes to record 336,175 tonnes the cash price reversed an early decline to Dollars 1,287 a tonne to end the week Dollars 36.50 ahead at Dollars 1,338.50 a tonne. The upturn coincided with the ending on Wednesday of the LME's temporary limitation on the one-day backwardation (cash premium) - which represents the cost of carrying over short positions falling due for delivery. A descending ceiling for the one-day premium was imposed at an LME board meeting on June 25 in an effort to end an options-related technical squeeze focused on contracts becoming operable in the middle of this week. The squeeze had driven the backwardation against the three months delivery position out to Dollars 189 tonne. The backwardation was gradually eliminated and early last week the market moved into the normal situation of 'contango' - where forward prices carry a premium over cash, representing the avoidance of the costs of holding physical metal: storage, insurance, lost interest on capital employed etc. But concern has been growing recently about tightness appearing once again on forward dates, particularly October and November, and this has been linked by some observers to possible producer activity. 'Producers have become increasingly prominent in the options market, accounting at times for up to 40 per cent of turnover,' explained Mr Robin Bhar, consultant to Carr Kitcat and Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. 'Because of this activity some believe that concerted producer support operations are behind the technical squeeze and, therefore, the price rise.' The LME copper market was also stronger, recouping last week's Pounds 18 setback and moving on the an 18-month high of Pounds 1,359 a tonne for three months metal. By yesterday's close the price had been trimmed to Pounds 1,338.50 a tonne, but that was still Pounds 30.25 up on the week. In view of the widespread economic gloom some analysts questioned whether the copper market's recent strength was justified. But Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that supply and demand were finely balanced and that demand was widely expected to grow next year. By comparison the aluminium market was having a quiet week until it was boosted yesterday by talk of production cuts. The cash price moved up Dollars 12.50 on the day to Dollars 1,309.50 a tonne, Dollars 11.50 higher on the week. The talk of output reductions was highlighted by reports that a Spanish producer had been given government permission to shut down some capacity and lay off workers and news that the Italian government had put Efim, a state-owned industrial holding company, into liquidation. The poor performance of the company's Alumix aluminium unit has been largely responsible for its losses, traders said. The LME's weakest market was tin, which suffered a substantial reaction against the recent sustained rise. As dealers responded to increasingly bearish technical signals, Chinese and Brazilian selling and a rise in LME stocks the cash price declined by Dollars 244.50 to Dollars 6,817.50 a tonne. The long term uptrend was still intact, but support in the Dollars 6,700 to Dollars 6,750-a-tonne band (for three months metal) would have to hold if things were to remain that way, dealers warned. The three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 6,855 a tonne. At the London Bullion Market an uptrend in gold, which lifted the price to a 5-month high, was maintained despite yesterday's news that South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers had reached agreement with the Chamber of Mines on a framework for the settlement of 1992 talks on gold mine wages and employment conditions. The gold price closed in London yesterday at Dollars 358.25 a tonne, up Dollars 5.70 on the day on dollar weakness and Dollars 9.80 ahead on the week. The recent advance in cocoa prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange peaked on Monday when the September delivery price rose by Pounds 18 in early dealings to a 2 1/2 -month high of Pounds 632 a tonne. Speculator and investment fund selling later that day wiped out all but Pounds 2 of the rise, however, and by the end of the week September cocoa was down to Pounds 576 a tonne, showing a net loss of Pounds 38 on the week.  -------------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS      (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium   +3,950 to 1,309,125 Copper      -2,675 to   257,975 Lead           -50 to   145,325 Nickel         +78 to    25,650 Zinc        +1,000 to   336,175 Tin           +450 to    14,295  -------------------------------------</p>

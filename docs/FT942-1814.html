			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Share flood dampens Milan's enthusiasm - Mediobanca's rights withdrawal was response to strains at the bourse Mediobanca is the merchant bank at the centre of many of the industrial and financial deals which feed the Milan stock market. So it was perhaps appropriate that its L1,500bn (Dollars 948m) planned rights issue should be the first to be sacrificed to Monday's 4 per cent decline in Italian equity prices. Late on Monday night, the bank announced it was postponing the operation, after its shares fell by 5 per cent in a day, dropping to below the floor-price it had set for the issue. It was a cruel blow for a bank which prides itself on its Italian market expertise. Indeed, Mediobanca had itself provided support and advice for a number of the dozen or so share or bond issues which have been launched or are due to be launched on to the Milan market in June and July. The decision probably marks at least a temporary halt to Italian companies' unseemly rush for stockmarket funding which has characterised a buoyant Milan market since Mr Silvio Berlusconi's election victory. But the bank's withdrawal still leaves more than L10,000bn of share and convertible bond issues, from companies as diverse as Finanza &amp; Futuro, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's financial services operation, and Pirelli, the tyres and cables group, fighting for investors' attention. Taking into account forthcoming privatisations, Actinvest, a small investment firm based in London and Milan, estimates the amount required of the market over the next six months at about L25,000bn. For Mr Fabio Basagni, Actinvest's head, the follow-my-leader attitude of many Italian companies to capital-raising 'tells you a lot about the immaturity of the Italian financial institutions: they create bottlenecks any time the market performs well'. Significantly, Monday also marked the moment when the Milan equity indices slipped back below the level at which they stood before the March general election. So what now happens to the small wave of paper about to break over a weakened market, in particular the imminent privatisation of Ina, the state-owned insurer, which is to be priced this weekend and launched on Monday? Analysts caution against too much pessimism, although they admit the overhanging weight of rights and bond issues was one factor in the correction, and may affect the market for some weeks to come. However, Mr Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort Benson believes that the rally of the past two months was based on strong fundamentals, in particular the likely decline in interest rates, and that the Italian market will continue to outperform its European counterparts. Yesterday morning, as if to underline the point, equities bounced back more strongly in Milan than in other European bourses. Moreover, most of the companies seeking to raise capital are not in immediate need of funding, but are taking advantage of the opportunity offered by a rising market. Mediobanca, for example, intends to use the funds to continue its programme of investments, perhaps with a particular eye on the privatisation of Stet, the telecoms holding company. But that sell-off will not happen before the autumn, giving plenty of time for the bank to return to the market. What is more, there is clearly still a buyer, as the market cliche goes, for the right product at the right price. Only last Friday, for example, Mediobanca announced that the L990bn issue of shares in Mondadori, the publishing company belonging to Mr Berlusconi, was four times oversubscribed only a day after the offer opened. As for Ina, the mood among advisers was calm yesterday. Although the L4,500bn-L5,500bn sale is the largest of the issues planned in the next six weeks, its special characteristics should make it impervious to all but the worst type of market collapse. A priority tranche of shares intended for policyholders is already attracting strong interest, and bank branches up and down the country are fielding regular inquiries from the public. According to analysts, the most important factor is that even if Ina shares are sold at the higher end of the promised price-range, they still look like a cheap alternative to Italy's quoted insurers like Generali and Ras. But such bullishness, and yesterday's small recovery in Milan equity prices has not quite eradicated the sense of unease in the market about what really triggered for the last week's 10 per cent fall: that is, new doubts about the way in which the new right-wing government is handling the economy. The real hope of many investors lies in the fact that this is the first Italian government for many decades which cannot afford to alienate the bond and equity markets. Under the circumstances, however, Mediobanca's unprecedented decision to suspend its rights issue seems not only a logical decision by a market expert, but a strong signal to Mr Berlusconi to stop dithering.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Largest forthcoming share issues  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company       Type of issue           Offer timetable   Size (Lire bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ina           Shares (privatisation)  Opens June 17        4,500-5,500 (insurance) Cariplo       Shares (flotation)      Opens July 11        1,200-1,650 (banking) Mediobanca    Shares &amp; warrants       Postponed                 1,500* (banking) Pirelli       Convertible bonds       Closes July 18             1,000 (tyres, cables) Mondadori     Shares                  Already closed               990 (publishing) Ifil          Shares and/or           Closes July 18               802 (industrial   convertible bonds holding)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *First tranche  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

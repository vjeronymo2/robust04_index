			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Expansion costs hold back Brake THE COSTS of starting one business and expanding another held back operating margins at Brake Brothers, the supplier of frozen and chilled foods to the catering trade. As a result interim pre-tax profit was slightly ahead from Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 7.14m. 'Although the UK catering market remains dull, we expect growth in sales and are poised to take advantage of any recovery,' said Mr William Brake, chairman. The company planned to continue expansion and had 'opportunities under review'. Margins at the operating level fell from 6.1 per cent to 4.8 per cent in the six months to June 30 1993. Operating profits of Pounds 7.78m (Pounds 7.68m) had lagged a partly organic improvement in sales to Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 126.4m), because of the costs of a continuing investment in a new chilled fine foods business. The costs contributed towards a half year loss of Pounds 1.1m which had been absorbed within the operating profits of the UK Foodservice division. The French food distribution businesses, which contributed sales of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 2m) lifted by two acquisitions for Pounds 3m cash, were 'only at break even' at the operating level, as expected. Also, in an unusual move, the company had depreciated freehold properties by Pounds 250,000, the first time it had booked such a charge. Country Choice Foods, a frozen products supplier to the independent bakery market, acquired for shares in May at a price of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m depending on profitability, contributed a maiden Pounds 3.85m to turnover. Brake was 'pleased' with its progress. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditure totalled Pounds 7m, including Pounds 3m on additions and replacements to the motor fleet, Pounds 700,000 on completion of a new Aberdeen satellite depot, and Pounds 500,000 to cover premises in Birmingham for new chilled fine foods service. Interest charges rose to Pounds 644,000 (Pounds 563,000). The balance sheet 'continued to be strong'. From earnings per share of 10p (10.3p) the interim dividend is raised to 2p (1.85p).</p>

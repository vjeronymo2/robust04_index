			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / US carmakers aim for 80 miles a gallon US CAR manufacturers yesterday joined the federal government in a research programme aimed at developing cleaner cars with three times the fuel economy of today's models. The programme will pool resources from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler with those of the government's space, defence and nuclear weapons laboratories, and will redirect government research spending. 'Our long-term goal is to develop affordable, attractive cars that are up to three times more fuel-efficient than today's cars - three times - and meet strict standards for urban air pollution, safety, performance and comfort,' President Bill Clinton said at a White House ceremony yesterday to launch the initiative. Some critics complain the goal of around 80 miles per US gallon is technologically impossible. But Vice-president Al Gore said researchers needed to be imaginative. 'After all, considering that this country spends tens of billions of dollars each year to upgrade and improve bombers and fighters, it is amazing we are content to use a technology on our highways that was developed in 1876,' Mr Gore said. US carmakers are currently required to produce a fleet whose fuel consumption averages 27.5 miles per gallon. The US Environmental Protection Agency, in statistics produced this week, showed the overall average of cars sold in the US is around 28.1 mpg, twice as efficient as the cars sold in the 1970s but with little change in the last seven years. Only two car models studied by the EPA, the Geo Metro XFI and the Honda Civic HB, exceeded 50 mpg. Others worry that the programme lacks any commitment for transferring greater fuel efficiency from the laboratory to the production line. Some environmentalist groups fear that the research project might, in fact, be used by Mr Clinton to cover his retreat from a campaign pledge to increase the average fuel efficiency required by law to 40 mpg by the year 2000 and 45 mpg by 2015 - a move fiercely opposed by the car companies. An increase in fuel efficiency requirements is also opposed by many environmental economists, who argue that the problem is not the availability of fuel-efficient cars but the lack of incentive for anyone to buy them while US petrol prices remain so low. Petrol taxes are due to rise by 4.3 per cents a gallon on Friday following this year's budget, but Mr Clinton's efforts to impose a stiffer tax on all forms of energy were shot down in Congress.</p>

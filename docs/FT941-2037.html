			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commons closes Pounds 50m tax loophole MPs yesterday voted through a clause of the finance bill which will close a tax loophole that costs the Treasury Pounds 50m a year. Clause 123 changes the basis for measuring the profit to be distributed to the UK by a non-trading tax-haven subsidiary of a UK company if it wishes to avoid charges from foreign company legislation. Profits must now be calculated on a tax rather than an accounts basis. The Treasury said that the legislation would prevent companies from using mismatches between the two measures of profit to shelter income from UK tax. Clause 123 was passed in spite of objections from the accountancy profession. Accountancy bodies have complained that the change reverses the conclusions of previous consultation and that the clause operates retrospectively. The bodies have said that none of the legal safeguards that normally apply to such tax-avoidance rules were being put into place. The Accounting Standards Board yesterday called for suggestions on the revision of FRS 1, the accounting standard dealing with the cashflow statement. The standard came into force for companies with financial year ends after March 23 1992. It has been criticised by accountants and analysts for a series of ambiguities and inadequacies. Comments should be received by June 30.</p>

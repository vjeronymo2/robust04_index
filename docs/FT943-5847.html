			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats Viyella upset Sell advice from one of its joint brokers just before interim figures due next week hit the share price of Coats Viyella, the UK's leading textile group. The stock fell quite sharply in early trading as BZW recommended that clients take profits following a good run in the shares. It remained weak and closed 10 off at 229p with turnover reaching 3.5m. Ms Julia Blake, textile analyst with the UK investment bank, said the rationale was quite simply that: 'The shares were on too much of a premium to the sector and looked vulnerable. We had the stock on a trading buy at 200p, and 240p was quite a good level to take profits.' However, there was some confusion as the negative advice came the day before an expected 70-page BZW review of the sector and five days ahead of interim figures which are expected to begin a jumpy reporting period. Textile profits have been badly affected by Continental competition and the inability to raise prices of goods leaving the factory gate at a time when raw material costs are creeping up. William Baird, which reports on September 7, was flat at 234p, while Courtaulds Textiles, with figures on September 15, eased 3 to 494p.</p>

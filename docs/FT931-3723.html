			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas If there is a case for breaking up British Gas into many competing companies, Sir James McKinnon has not made it. Ofgas's submission to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was long on diagrams but short on numbers and its protestations that the proposed structure would cost only Pounds 250m a year look implausible. Equally, British Gas has failed to persuade that it deserves to be preserved as a 'national champion'. Its arguments that a break-up would be unsafe and an administrative nightmare are thin and self-serving. British Gas has a nasty history of championing the status quo in the interests of British Gas. So it sticks in the craw to go along with the company. Yet with the advantages of a break-up highly uncertain there is a case for settling nearer the company's position than Sir James's. Some of the nastier political questions - such as the obligation to supply small consumers that no-one really wants - might be avoided. A tight price cap will squeeze costs out of the business. Stronger Chinese walls within the company would make it easier to break up later if insufficient competition flows through. On one issue, however, everyone seems to be wrong. Cheap interruptible gas supplies to large industrial customers are really needed because of variations in demand from domestic users. The costs and benefits should be considered together and priced against the alternative of increased storage capacity.</p>

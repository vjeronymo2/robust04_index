			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--Rwanda's Trade, Industry, and  Crafts Minister, Justin Mugenzi, arrived in Cairo early this  morning on a visit to Egypt of several days.    The Rwandan minister said he would meet President Husni  Mubarak, in his capacity as chairman of the OAU, to discuss the  current critical situation in Rwanda following the death of  Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and the attacks carried  out by the rebel Rwandan National Front.    The Rwandan minister said he would also explain to President  Mubarak the failure to honor the Arusha Peace Agreement signed  on 4 August 1993 and the violation of international accords and  the principle of good-neighborliness by our neighboring state of  Uganda.    He noted that what matters now is for the international  public and the OAU to realize the role the Ugandan president is  playing toward Rwanda and the extent of his material and moral  influence.    The Rwandan president explained that he will brief President  Mubarak on the UN role in supervising the implementation of the  peace agreements in his country and will discuss the effects the  UN Security Council resolutions will have on the UN mission in  Rwanda.    He said he will seek President Mubarak's help to stop the  violence and massacres in his country and restore stability and  security.</p>

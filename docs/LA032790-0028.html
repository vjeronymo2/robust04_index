			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER DEFENDANT WINS LIBEL SUIT AGAINST  WRITER  </P> <P> A journalist was ordered Monday to pay a murder defendant $6,500 for an article  that concluded the man arranged his wife's slaying in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The order came despite the fact that the libel case victor is currently on  trial for allegedly trying to arrange the murder, and is serving a prison term  for plotting an earlier unsuccessful attempt to kill his wife.  </P> <P> Kazuyoshi Miura, the plaintiff in the libel suit, is on trial along with a  friend in connection with the shooting death of his wife in Los Angeles in  November, 1981.  </P> <P> Miura, 42, filed suit against magazine writer Joji Abe in October, one year  after the article appeared in the Weekly Asahi. A Tokyo court found that Abe's  conclusion that Miura ordered his wife, Kazumi, slain was not based on  sufficient evidence.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Congresswoman Intervenes on Air Force Plan: The Air Force's secret plan to move  the Ballistic Systems Division out of San Bernardino, which was disclosed in a  Times story last month, has not been well received on Capitol Hill. Rep. Pat  Schroeder (D-Colo.), chairwoman of the House subcommittee on military  installations and facilities, has sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Donald  Rice warning that the service lacks the authority to make the move. Schroeder  also termed as "irresponsible" an Air Force memorandum that laid out a legal  argument to get around a law requiring the division to stay at its current  location.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Stockholm, May 4 (AFP) -- Swedish European Affairs  Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel hailed the European Parliament's  decision Wednesday [4 May] to admit Sweden, Austria, Finland and  Norway to the European Union (EU).    "The Swedish Government welcomes, with great satisfaction,  the European Parliament's decision to accept the membership  agreement with Sweden and the three other applicant countries,"  Dinkelspiel said in a statement.    "Today's decision means that the decisive factor now lies in  the hands of the Swedish people," he added.    Sweden is expected to hold a referendum on EU membership  November 13.    "Today's decision gives a clear signal to governments and  people -- both in member countries and applicant countries -- to  move quickly in forming a united Europe," he said.    "In our opinion, Sweden has negotiated a very good agreement  on membership in the European Union. It is very gratifying that  the European Parliament today supports this agreement,"  Dinkelspiel concluded.</p>

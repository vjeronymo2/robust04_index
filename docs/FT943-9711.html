			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / EU court overturns antitrust accord with US The European Court of Justice yesterday ruled that an antitrust agreement signed between the European Commission and the US government was void. The decision raised again the sensitive issue of who has the authority to sign bilateral agreements for the European Union. The Luxembourg-based court ruled that the agreement - signed three years ago and designed to promote co-operation between the competition authorities of the EU and the US - should have been concluded by the Council of Ministers, rather than by the Commission. Lawyers in Brussels said the court ruling was a setback for the Commission, which was trying to create a framework with the US competition authorities to vet global corporate agreements. However, the Commission said the case was 'exceptional' and that the council would give its approval to the deal very soon. The Commission insisted yesterday that the court's decision would have no bearing on other bilateral accords already agreed, but would cause it to tread more carefully in fashioning agreements that might require more than administrative approval, which is the Commission's responsibility. The decision comes amid other wrangles between the Commission and EU member states over who should take responsibility for concluding international agreements, notably over who should ratify the Uruguay Round pact under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Commission has already asked the European Court for an opinion on where legal authority lies in matters covered by Gatt. In this case, the court is expected to find in favour of the Commission, a prospect causing some consternation among member states such as the UK and France, which are wary of pressure towards further integration. Confusion over Gatt ratification together with yesterday's ruling will highlight the need for member states and the Commission to settle questions of where responsibility lies within the EU. These matters are expected to be tackled at the 1996 intergovernmental conference which will review the Maastricht treaty and look at ways of streamlining decision-making in an enlarged EU. Sir Leon Brittan, who signed the deal as commissioner responsible for external economic affairs, believed the matter was administrative and did not need to go before the council. However, France, backed by Spain and the Netherlands, launched the court action, arguing that for an international agreement signed with another government it was not the Commission's place to represent the EU, but rather a matter for the member states, as represented by the council. The court largely agreed with its reasoning. The Commission stressed that in most cases, bilateral agreements went before the council but that this agreement was a special case. It added that the substance of the agreement was not in question and that it was likely to be approved without alteration by the council. 'Since the member states have in essence not questioned its substance, the Commission expects the agreement will be approved without difficulty by the council in order to maintain close co-operation and co-ordination between the competition authorities of the European Union and the US,' said a Commission spokesman.</p>

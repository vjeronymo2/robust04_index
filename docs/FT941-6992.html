			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Self-Select PEPs (3): Big companies offer shelter - A crucial development, writes Robert Miller, has been the arrival of corporate Peps promoted by big British groups, allowing savers to include other shares in their plan After years of being swamped by the marketing muscle of the more generalist unit and investment trust personal equity plans, self-select Peps are finally coming into their own. But, despite the increased popularity of the do-it-yourself approach to Peps, there is still an enormous disparity between the charges levied by different plan managers and the levels of service offered. The first step on the self-select route is to decide whether the Pep is to be a Pounds 6,000 general plan, or a Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep. The next, picking a suitable plan manager, is more difficult. By and large, self-select Pep managers offer two levels of service based on the execution-only of buy and sell orders for shares; or they give advice as well. Investors may start out with a clear idea of which shares, or in some cases unit and investment trusts, they want to hold in their self-select portfolio, but stock market and personal circumstances change, and advice might be welcomed at some future stage. Some self-select Pep plan managers simply offer the service to existing clients as an add-on to more general portfolio management, but an increasing number of stockbroking firms and financial advisers have made a point of promoting low-cost self-select plans. These include Killik &amp; Co, Pilling, Reyker Securities, Pointon &amp; York, Waters Lunniss (the stockbroking arm of Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society), John Siddell &amp; Son and Barclays Stockbrokers. On the charges front, Justin Urquhart Stewart, a director of Barclays Stockbrokers, says: 'For a single-company self-select plan, annual charges of 0.5 per cent are reasonable. For example, if the share concerned has a yield of between 4.5 and 5 per cent, there are still tangible benefits on the tax break. The annual charges for a Pounds 6,000 self-select plan should average 1 per cent. 'But there is a catch on some self-select plans. Certain managers will charge for each dividend they collect. Since most of the larger companies pay dividends twice a year and a general Pep might have three of four holdings, the costs can eat up profits pretty quickly. The more competitive plan managers make a one-off charge for all annual administration, including the collection of dividends, and that is in the 1 per cent.' By far the biggest development in favour of private investors in the self-select Pep market has been the arrival on the scene of corporate Peps promoted by big British companies. Urquhart Stewart explains: 'Companies such as British Airways, BAA, Redland and BET started out by offering low-cost entry Peps in their own shares. But they realised that private investors might begin to resent the lack of choice if that company's share price took a nosedive. So they changed the rules to make the Peps more flexible. 'British Airways, for instance, only insists that investors hold a minimum of 200 of its shares. They can then choose to shelter other shares within the BA umbrella. Some plans also allow money to be put into unit or investment trusts.' On average, the costs of a Pounds 6,000 corporate self-select personal equity plan should be 0.5 per cent a year. Commission charges for buying and selling shares within the plan are generally 1 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 10, for postal dealing and 1.5 per cent with a minimum of Pounds 20 for telephone dealing. These charges are broadly the same as non-corporate self-select plans. Investors with an existing portfolio of shares who decide to transfer them into a self-select Pep should be aware of the potential costs involved, says Matthew Orr, a partner in Killik &amp; Co. He warns: 'In order to satisfy the Inland Revenue rules on Peps, the shares will have to be sold and bought back on the open market before they are sheltered within the plan. 'For that service, we charge 1.65 per cent to sell and a Pounds 40 fixed fee for the shares in each separate company to buy back. There is also the 0.5 per cent stamp duty to pay on the purchase.' But once you have paid the initial charges, the long-term advantages of do-it-yourself Peps become more apparent, says Orr. 'More and more people are transferring Peps bought in previous years - which might have come from two or three different firms - under one umbrella. This can help keep costs down and gives better control over the portfolio. For example, a lot people sitting on reasonable past profits are switching their portfolios around to take advantage of the Pounds 1,500 rule. This allows sums up to that amount to be invested in non-Pep qualifying stock markets, such as those of the Pacific Rim or even the US.' The final pitfall to watch out for is the holding of cash within a self-select Pep. The Inland Revenue does allow cash to be sheltered and to earn interest from deposits, but only if the money is genuinely meant for putting back into the stock market. If the cash is held for too long, the Revenue could well void the plan. Single-company Peps - Page 19</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Observer: Chasing Birgit The Treuhand, the agency which has the thankless job of privatising eastern Germany's industry, may soon get a taste of its own medicine. After selling off more than 12,000 companies since it was set up in late 1990, and closing down a few thousand, many of its own staff are now looking elsewhere for new jobs. With only 1,000 companies left on the books, the Treuhand intends to close down its New York and Tokyo offices this autumn, and the agency itself will be wound up by the end of next year. The Berlin-based investment relations department, which looks after potential foreign investors, will be cut back from 15 to 10 by the end of this month. But the big question is the future of Ms Birgit Breuel, the agency's 55-year-old president. She has been been mentioned as a possible successor to Sir William Ryrie, the British civil servant who has been running the International Finance Corporation, the private-sector arm of the World Bank, for the last nine years. Ryrie has an open-ended contract but he turns 65 in November, the normal retirement age for World Bank types. It is understood that she has already been invited to join the IFC board. Others say she might end up in the Chancellery in Bonn. She might even return to politics - she was minister of finance in Lower Saxony until joining the Treuhand in October 1990. Whatever the outcome, it is highly unlikely that Ms Breuel will join Jacques Attali's EBRD.</p>

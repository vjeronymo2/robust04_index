			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Gechem in BFr1.9bn deficit GECHEM, the Belgian chemical group and foam rubber maker, yesterday announced a 1991 loss of BFr1.9bn (Dollars 55m), largely as a result of ill-fated expansion in the US, and said it would pay no dividend. This compares with a BFr1.29bn profit in 1990, writes David Buchan in Brussels. The loss was slightly greater than Gechem signalled last December when it announced it was abandoning control of Foamex LP in the US, and with it the ambition to be the world leader in polyurethane foam rubber. The news had little impact on the Brussels bourse, where Gechem ordinary shares closed 2 per cent down but its preferences shares 1 per cent up. Gechem's strategy is now to focus on Europe, where its foam-making division, Reticel, recorded a before-tax profit of BFr960m last year on turnover which increased by 3.2 per cent to BFr28.8bn. This was partly due to recent acquisitions in the UK, Austria and eastern Germany.</p>

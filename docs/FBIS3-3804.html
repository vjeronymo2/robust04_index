During the session you deputies, proceeding from the  national  interest as a whole and from the fundamental interests of the  people, earnestly performed the functions entrusted to you by  the constitution. By emancipating the mind and seeking truth  from facts, we discussed state affairs and spoke our minds  freely. Consequently, the resolutions adopted at the session  fully reflect the will and inspiration of the people of all  nationalities throughout the country. This session demonstrated  the great unity of people of all nationalities across the  country as well as their confidence in the success of reform and  development. This session is one of democracy, unity,  truth-seeking, realism, and pioneering spirit. This session  will certainly have great significance in advancing the  socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist  spiritual civilization in an all-round manner, with economic  construction as the central task.    This session examined and approved Premier Li Peng's  government work report as well as other reports, and adopted the  basic policy and fundamental tasks of the state in 1994. We  must uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, unswervingly  uphold the party's basic line, fully implement the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, and carry out the various  resolutions and decisions adopted by the current session. It is  imperative to seize current favorable international and domestic  opportunities; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure; and to achieve a sustained, rapid,  and healthy growth of China's economy. We must also maintain  political stability and promote all-round social progress. All  kinds of work in China must comply with and serve the central  task for 1994. We must correctly handle relations between  reform, development, and stability. We must strive to push  ahead with reform and development amid stability, and achieve  social stability as well as the country's long-term stability  through reform and development.    This year is an important one for China's economic  restructuring because many new reform measures will be announced  and put into practice. The task will be formidable. We must  work cautiously and conscientiously, spare no efforts, develop  careful and well-thought-out plans, and do solid work in  ensuring the smooth implementation of these reform measures. It  is necessary to further emancipate the mind; conduct everything  in line with specific conditions; dare to explore new ways; dare  to act; sum up our experience in a timely fashion; and properly  resolve contradictions and problems arising in the course of  implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform  measures. Localities and departments must have the overall  interest in mind; correctly handle relations between the central  government and localities as well as between overall and partial  interests; subject themselves to the state's overall plan of  reform and development; and be effective at implementing the  principles and policies of the central government in the light  of their specific conditions. They must do a good job in  publicizing and explaining reform so all the reform measures  will be fully understood and supported by the masses. So long  as we are united ideologically and work as one, we will be able  to achieve the hoped-for goals of reform.    It is imperative to strengthen socialist democracy and  legality in order to meet the needs of a socialist market  economic system and the modernization drive. We must work hard  to build socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics,  further perfect the system of people's congresses, and guarantee  the rights of the masses as masters of the country. It is  necessary to quicken the pace of economic legislation and use  laws to guide, promote, and ensure the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure and the progress of various  undertakings. The Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC has  adopted a five-year legislative program. We must earnestly  organize people to carry it out and attempt to complete the  general framework of laws governing the development of a  socialist market economy during its term. People's congresses  at all levels and their standing committees must increase  inspection and supervision over law enforcement; must put a stop  to the non-observance and lax implementation of laws; and must  ensure that law breakers are not allowed to go unpunished in  order to safeguard the dignity of laws, to establish the  authority of laws, and to ensure that reform, opening up, and  the modernization drive will advance along the track of  socialist legality in a sound manner.    The question utmost in the people's minds when the session  is  over is implementation. All kinds of work must proceed from the  interests of the people; they must assist in freeing and  developing productive forces, in increasing China's  comprehensive strength, and in improving the people's standard  of living. Government departments and functionaries at all  levels must change their style of work, conduct investigations,  go deeply into the realities of life, solicit people's views,  and be concerned about their well- being. They should never  treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people, and  should solve each and every one of those matters. It is  imperative to oppose bureaucracy and boasting, and to do away  with formalism. We should do away with meetings and documents  that do not solve problems; we should never be content to merely  issue general calls for action; we must not make empty talk and  platitudes; and we must not report only good news and not the  bad. More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should  perform our official duties honestly and diligently in order to  serve the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner,  immerse ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry  out our work creatively.    After this session is over, the deputies will go back to  their posts. It is hoped you will actively publicize and  implement the guidelines as well as the various resolutions and  decisions adopted by the session; will conscientiously perform  your functions as NPC deputies; will set an example in abiding  by the Constitution and the law; and will plunge yourselves into  the great practice of reform and construction.    Deputies! China is advancing along the path of socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, people of all  nationalities throughout the country must rally closely around  the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its  nucleus; must work with one heart and one mind; must display the  spirit of plain living and hard struggle; and must strive to  establish a socialist market economic system and turn China into  a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and  modern socialist country by the end of the century.    Deputies! I now declare the Second Session of the Eighth NPC  has come to a successful close.</p>

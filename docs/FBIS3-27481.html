The main task of this meeting is to sum up the main  experiences in statistical work since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made  his important talks during the inspection tour to the south and  since the 14th party congress and to deeply study reform of the  statistical system according to the requirements of establishing  a socialist market economy, thus further enhancing the level of  statistical work and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy  [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]  development of the national economy.    Statistics is an important part of the basic work of the  state in exercising scientific policy-making and management.  The party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  core attaches great importance to statistical work and cares  deeply about it. Recently, to mark the 10th anniversary of the  promulgation and enforcement of the "PRC Statistics Law,"  Premier Li Peng wrote: "Keeping accurate and timely statistics  according to the law." Practice shows that only by keeping  statistics according to the law can we ensure that statistics  are accurate and timely; and only by ensuring the accuracy and  timeliness of statistics can we guarantee the effectiveness of  the information, consulting, and supervisory functions of  statistics and guarantees the correctness of policies and their  effective implementation.    Accuracy requires us to adhere to the principle of being  realistic. That is, we must authentically record facts and must  resolutely oppose any exaggeration and concealment. If we are  not careful and rigorous in handling statistics or even practice  fraud, then it is very likely that incorrect policies will be  formulated and incalculable losses may be caused to economic  construction. There have been extremely profound negative  experiences in the past, and we should bear this in mind.    The value of information lies in its timeliness. That is,  the transmission of information must be speeded up, and the work  of monitoring, forecasting, and anticipating trends in the  operation of the national economy must be strengthened. We  should strive to provide the necessary information before  leaders make policy decisions so that problems can be solved as  soon as they appear.    Through reform and development in the past 10 or more years,  the statistical work in our country has gradually moved onto a  path specified by the legal system, and statistics organs have  gradually expanded their functions from merely providing  information to offering consulting services to the leading  organs of the party and government and exercising effective  supervision over economic operations. Under the current  situation of speeding up the process of establishing the  socialist market economic structure, our statistical work is  also facing some new and stern challenges. On the one hand, due  to changes in the economic base, changes have also occurred in  those institutions subject to statistical investigation. Not  only has the number of such institutions been increasing  continuously, but they have become more and more complicated as  a variety of economic elements, business organizational forms,  and distribution patterns now coexist side by side. This will  make it more difficult to conduct statistical investigations.  On the other hand, due to changes in the pattern of interests,  the phenomena of exaggeration, concealment, deliberately  delaying reports, and refusing to submit reports have arisen in  some localities and units, thus affecting the accuracy and  timeliness of statistics. Therefore, it is necessary to  positively advance reform of the statistical management system  and statistical investigation methods, make great efforts to  consolidate the legal system related to statistics, and ensure  that statistics are actually handled, managed, and developed  according to the law.    The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  pointed out: "The establishment and improvement of the  socialist market economic structure must have standards and  guarantees from a perfect legal system." This requirement is  also applicable to statistical work. The Statistics Law in our  country was formulated 10 years ago, and some provisions of the  law may not be suited to the requirements of the establishment  of the socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we  should make revisions without delay and improve the law as soon  as possible. Statistical legislation must give expression to  the spirit of reform. It is necessary to seriously sum up  practical domestic experience, boldly adopt successful foreign  practices, and use the law to guide, promote, and guarantee the  smooth development of reform in statistical work so that it will  play a greater role in the state's scientific policy-making and  macrocontrol.    Leading organs and leading cadres at all levels should  firmly  support the efforts of statistical organs to fulfill their task  according to the law. It is necessary to further popularize  legal knowledge related to statistics. All people related to  the statistical work should study and understand the relevant  law and should be conscious in abiding by the law and applying  the law. All localities, institutions, and individuals must not  impede statistical organs and personnel from collecting and  reporting statistics to the upper authorities according to the  law. Those who refuse to perform their statistical duty,  deliberately evade or undermine the state's statistical  supervision, practice fraud with statistics, or impede  statistical organs and personnel from independently performing  their duties specified by law must be investigated and punished  according to the law. A small number of cases which have had a  major impact should be exposed by the mass media. Thus, the  handling of one case may educate a large number of people and  may ensure the smooth conduct of statistical work.</p>

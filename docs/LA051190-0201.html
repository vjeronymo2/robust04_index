			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> K.C. JONES WON'T COACH HAWKS  </P> <P> Former Boston Celtics Coach K. C. Jones has withdrawn from consideration for  the Atlanta Hawks' coaching job, leaving New Jersey Nets Vice President Willis  Reed as the likely favorite.  </P> <P> Jones "called me late yesterday and said he wanted to withdraw his name from  consideration," Atlanta General Manager Pete Babcock said Thursday.  </P> <P> "No reason. That's all he told me. It was out of the blue."  </P> <P> Jones, now an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics, won two NBA titles  with Boston before joining the staff of Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff. He  had been scheduled to interview with the Hawks today.  </P> <P> Mike Fratello resigned last month as Atlanta coach.  </P> <P> Reed, who interviewed Wednesday, was Fratello's top assistant with the Hawks in  1985-86 and 1986-87, when they won 107 games.  </P> <P> Among the others being considered are assistants Dave Wohl of Miami, Bob Weiss  of Orlando and Paul Silas of the New York Knicks.  </P></p>

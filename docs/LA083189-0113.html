			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30 RUN FOR BOARD OF COMPTON SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> TROUBLED DISTRICT FACES GROWING DISCONTENT BY TEACHERS, PARENTS  </P> <P> Thirty people have filed to run for election to the board of a Compton Unified  School District that is facing growing teacher and parent discontent.  </P> <P> Five seats on the seven-member board will be on the November ballot. Four of  the positions carry four-year terms. The fifth seat, to fill an unexpired term,  will be for two years.  </P> <P> The district is losing about 128 of its teachers this year. Many are switching  to the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers won a three-year,  24% pay raise in the spring after a four-week strike, according to district  teachers union officials.  </P> <P> Compton parents at board meetings and other gatherings have expressed concern  over the district's low student scores on state tests. The scores average in  the first percentile on a scale of 1 to 100. School buildings are crumbling  and, according to some parents, are unsafe. And the district's swelling Latino  enrollment, which could exceed 50% this year, is resulting in more pressure  from Latino residents for better bilingual services and an equal share of the  district's jobs.  </P> <P> Four of the candidates are long-time incumbents seeking new four-year terms.  They are John Steward, a deputy probation officer for Los Angeles County;  Kelvin Filer, a Compton attorney; Sam Littleton, a medical social worker at  Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, and Manuel Correa, a retired city  police commander who is also the only elected Latino official in the city.  </P> <P> The fifth incumbent is Lynn Dymally, whose father is Rep. Mervyn Dymally  (D-Compton). She was appointed to the board only last month to replace Bernice  Woods, who was elected in June to the City Council.  </P> <P> Some district residents were angry over the appointment, which was made without  public notice. Critics also see it as an attempt by Dymally's father to grasp  more political power in the city. The residents launched a petition drive to  have the congressman's daughter removed but failed to gather the necessary  number of signatures in time to meet the deadline. Organizers of the drive were  attempting to force the school board to remove Dymally and leave the seat  vacant until the November election.  </P> <P> Dymally has already served one term on the board, but in 1987 decided not to  seek reelection. Known also by her married name of Lynn Dymally Lee, the  congressman's daughter faces three challengers vying to serve the remaining two  years of Woods' term.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tried to Win Seat Earlier  </P> <P> Among them is Acquanetta Harrison Warren, 33, who tried two years ago to win a  seat on the board. A product manager for First Interstate Bank, Warren and her  husband have two children in the Compton schools.  </P> <P> Also running is Kalem Aquil, a 41-year-old electronics technician with the  Southern California Rapid Transit District who is making his first bid for  public office. He has three children in the city schools and is a member of the  district's advisory council.  </P> <P> The fourth challenger to Dymally is Omar Bradley, 30, a high school English  teacher in the Lynwood schools, who ran unsuccessfully for the City Council  last April.  </P> <P> Bradley's sister-in-law, Paula L. Howard, is among the 26 candidates running  for four-year terms. Howard, 36, is a physical education teacher in the Lynwood  schools.  </P> <P> Also running for four-year terms are Margaret Moore, 58, a community liaison  with the school district, who almost won a spot on the board when she was a  candidate two years ago; Madelina D. Dewberry, a former teacher who is now  manager of human resources at American Express' Culver City office, and  47-year-old Earnest Spears, executive director of the Compton Chamber of  Commerce. Spears ran unsuccessfully this year for city treasurer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Run for Board  </P> <P> Gorgonio (Greg) Sanchez Jr., a quality control manager for a manufacturing  company and a member of the city government's Latino Advisory Committee, is  making his second run for the school board. He was an unsuccessful candidate in  1985 but this year, he says, the Latino community is organizing a voter  registration drive.  </P> <P> Other candidates are Sadie R. Benham, a child-care center teacher; Muhammad  Abdullah, a student at Cal State Long Beach; Verda M. Cheathen, a teacher; Gary  Leon Daniels, a minister and a teacher; Hyacinth Dandridge, an educator and  community activist; Deborah M. Gayles, library assistant; Nancy L. Johnson, a  retired teacher; Roy E. Little, a vocational rehabilitation counselor; and Saul  E. Lankster, a former school board member who listed his occupation as educator  and business administrator and operates a florist shop.  </P> <P> Also running are Chester L. Hammond Sr.; youth services counselor; Dhanifu S.  Karim, student and counselor; Malcum Mumford, a sheet-metal worker; Ken  Perkins, who is self-employed; Otha Ray Scott, an educator; Mae Thomas, a  community parent facilitator; Walter E. White Jr., a retired property manager;  and Patricia Moore, who works for the city as a business license inspector. She  is not related to the councilwoman of the same name.  </P></p>

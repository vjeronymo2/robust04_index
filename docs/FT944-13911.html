The department routinely reviews takeover and merger plans to ensure they do not create anti-competitive monopolies. However, it declined to characterise its interest in the Microsoft-Intuit transaction, saying only that it had not undertaken 'a review'.

Microsoft critics have called for the department to undertake a broad investigation of the implications of the acquisition of Intuit. 'This deal concentrates too much power in one company,' said Mr David Coursey, editor of PC Letter, an industry newsletter.

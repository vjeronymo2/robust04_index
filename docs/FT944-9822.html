			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery charities body will make right start Sir, Permit me to present a more positive picture of the National Lottery Charities Board than that in your article, 'Charities facing long delays for funds from lottery' (November 11). Contrary to the impression given in the article the NLCB is making good progress and has the full backing of many in the voluntary sector, including the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Since the board was appointed less than four months ago it has met regularly and agreed its draft guidelines. As I mentioned in my speech at the Charities Aid Foundation conference, we expect to appoint our chief executive in early December and we will begin full consultation with the voluntary sector in early January. I went on to say: 'We will be inviting applications during the course of the coming year with the aim of making grants towards the latter part of 1995 - if we can do it earlier, we will. But we shall do it properly.' With more than 700,000 voluntary groups eligible to apply to us and in excess of Pounds 100m available to distribute in the first year alone, the NLCB will be the UK's largest general grant-giving foundation. It would be irresponsible in the extreme for us to promise to rush grants out early in 1995, before we have in place the professional staff and systems necessary to ensure that we are fair, effective and transparent in all our actions. The NLCB has a unique opportunity to make a tremendous impact on the lives of the poor and disadvantaged in society, and to improve the quality of life in the community. We are determined to be successful in this and we believe that time spent in getting things right now will lay solid foundations for the future. David Sieff, chairman, The National Lottery Charities Board, 7th Floor, St Vincent House, 30 Orange Street, London EC2H 7HH</p>

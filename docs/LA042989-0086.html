			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FORGED PRESCRIPTIONS LINKED TO CARL MONROE  </P> <P> A doctor whose name was on four tranquilizer bottles found in the apartment of  former San Francisco 49er Carl Monroe, who died earlier this week at 29, said  three of the prescriptions were forged, according to Friday's San Francisco  Chronicle.  </P> <P> San Jose police found two empty bottles of Valium and two empty bottles of  diazepam, a generic form of Valium, inside Monroe's apartment on Wednesday, the  day he died, the paper reported.  </P> <P> A doctor, who asked not to be identified, had been treating Monroe for chronic  bronchitis and said that he prescribed Valium once, on April 18, to help Monroe  sleep. He denied writing the prescriptions for three other bottles found in the  apartment.  </P> <P> Police are investigating the prescriptions amid speculation that Monroe might  have died of a Valium overdose, but autopsy results won't be known for several  weeks.  </P></p>

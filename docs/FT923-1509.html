			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Letter: Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations an issue Sir, It may be that history never repeats itself, but the current sterling crisis seems uncannily like a variant of a previous one: that accompanying the end of the gold standard in 1931-32. Some quotes: '. . .the speculator who sold sterling was betting on a certainty once its stability was in question. . .(on September 21 1931) an act suspending the gold standard was rushed through parliament. The value of the pound fell by more than a quarter on the foreign exchange. Otherwise nothing happened. . .the anti-climax took everyone by surprise. Passfield spoke for all his late colleagues when he complained: 'Nobody told us we could do this'. . .This was the end of an age.' (A J P Taylor, English History 1914 -1945). 'A large number of countries. . .followed Britain off gold. By April 1932. . .the financial crisis was over. Bank rate was steadily reduced. . .The industrial depression was at its worst in the third quarter of 1932, but thenceforth all indices showed a strong upward trend, leading to the boom of 1937.' (Sidney Pollard The Development of The British Economy 1914-1980). To replace 1931 by 1992, and the gold standard by the ERM may be facile. But, so far, the parallels are striking.

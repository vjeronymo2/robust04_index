Among the problems facing the Cabinet of Ministers today  Oleg  Soskovets named "the state's participation in the country's  economic development, the improvement of tax policy, the  elimination of nonpayments, and the social thrust of reforms."  The government is particularly concerned at the situation in  the social sphere, in agriculture, and in the  military-industrial complex. According to Soskovets, a complex  situation is taking shape in the military-industrial complex  today. Economic ties between enterprises have been ruptured by  ill-considered conversion, and in some places the defense  industry's scientific and production potential has been  seriously undermined.    A further reduction in the defense budget could lead to the  total stoppage of production facilities working for the needs of  defense. Reducing expenditure on the Armed Forces means  "freezing" the further course of reforms and of structural  restructuring in the Russian Army. As Oleg Soskovets said, the  government is drawing up measures to encourage production in the  sphere of the military-industrial complex. In particular,  conditions are being created for emerging onto the foreign  market and expanding the defense industry's export potential.    As regards the state budget as a whole for 1994, in Oleg  Soskovets' opinion the revenue part has not been worked out  here. For example, the planned revenue from privatization has  been understated. But the budget will be finalized in the  government as early as this week, and the document will be  submitted to the State Duma committees. At present the budget  deficit stands at 9.9 percent.    The government is concerned at the social stratification of  society, which is unprecedented on the scale of modern civilized  countries, when approximately 30 percent of the population is  living below the poverty line, while the incomes of another  section of Russians are growing inordinately. At the same time  commercial activity is most lucrative, as distinct from activity  in the sphere of physical production.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWYER'S SINGLE IN 10TH LIFTS EXPOS OVER CUBS  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs, who never expected it to be easy, missed a chance to clinch a  tie for the National League East championship Monday night when pinch-hitter  Jim Dwyer singled with one out in the 10th inning to give the Montreal Expos a  4-3 victory over the Cubs.  </P> <P> The second-place St. Louis Cardinals lost earlier Monday night, 4-2 at  Pittsburgh, and remain four games behind the Cubs.  </P> <P> The Cubs can clinch the division title outright tonight if they beat the Expos  and the Cardinals lose to the Pirates.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson hit two home runs for the Cubs, including a controversial  inside-the-park homer in the seventh inning to give Chicago a 3-2 lead.  </P> <P> Scott Sanderson (11-9) came in to pitch the 10th inning for the Cubs.  </P> <P> Mike Aldrete led off the 10th with a single. Rex Hudler pinch-ran and stole  second, and Andres Galarraga was intentionally walked. After a sacrifice bunt  by Marquis Grissom, Mitch Williams came on to face Dwyer, who lined a 1-and-2  pitch to right field.  </P> <P> The Cubs had taken the lead in the seventh inning when Dawson hit a drive to  left field. Center fielder Dave Martinez made a diving attempt to catch the  ball at the warning track and appeared to make the play, but second base umpire  Paul Runge ruled that Martinez trapped the ball.  </P> <P> Martinez rolled on the ground, jumped to his feet and fell again in pain,  having injured his collarbone.  </P> <P> As Dawson circled the bases, Martinez still had the ball in his glove and  center fielder Tim Raines finally removed it, too late for a play on Dawson.  </P> <P> "The rule is cast in stone," Runge said. "The player must voluntarily remove  the ball from his glove after the catch.  </P> <P> "After he hit the ground and rolled around, I saw the ball roll out of his  glove and Raines picked it up."  </P></p>

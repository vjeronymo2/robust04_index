			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (3): In the thick of a battle for a Taiwan order - Interview: Raymond Sero of Westinghouse ALONG with many executives in the nuclear power plant industry, Mr Raymond Sero is feverishly putting the finishing touches to complex proposals to supply equipment for Taiwan's fourth pair of nuclear power stations. The hotly-contested Lungmen project has been shelved and revived several times in recent years, and in April suffered a further delay when Taipower changed the terms at the 11th hour. Now a new deadline for bids, December 8, is looming. Mr Sero, Westinghouse Electric's general manager for international nuclear business, explains why the Taiwan project is generating such activity at the US company and its rival nuclear plant suppliers in the US, Europe and Japan: 'It's the only big new nuclear plant project that's imminent.' However, in spite of the paucity of new nuclear plant work worldwide, and the long delays and obstacles to be surmounted in winning orders, Mr Sero says he is 'cautiously optimistic' about prospects for Westinghouse's nuclear business, the world's largest with overall annual sales of Dollars 1bn. This confidence is underpinned by Westinghouse's long history in the nuclear industry. The company pioneered the commercial nuclear power industry more than 30 years ago. It has supplied 51 of the 110 nuclear plants operating in the US, and more than 170 of the world's 410 light water reactors (LWRs, which include pressurised water reactors and boiling water reactors) have either been supplied by Westinghouse or based on its technology. Helped by having such a big installed base, Westinghouse is also the world's largest supplier of nuclear fuel and services. In fuel, it continues to make design changes to keep ahead of the competition, says Mr Sero, while in the instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) business it claims the only fully digital system for nuclear plants. Recent contracts illustrate how Westinghouse is using its strengths at a time when new nuclear plants are off the near-term political agenda in two formerly crucial markets, the US and virtually all western Europe. In the UK, Westinghouse is on schedule to complete the I&amp;C contract ready for next year's start-up of the Sizewell B plant in Suffolk - having taken over from a French supplier whose contract was cancelled in 1991. In Korea, it is supplying nuclear fuel rods after a decision to give the business to a rival supplier was reversed. In the Czech Republic, Westinghouse is hard at work on important contracts to supply the I&amp;C system and nuclear fuel for the partially-completed Temelin nuclear station. The contracts, finally clinched in May, were the largest yet awarded for safety and performance-related upgrades of Soviet-designed reactors. Mr Sero says he is confident that, with more Temelin-type contracts being awarded and new plant activity in Asia, Westinghouse will be able to announce some significant new contracts in the next two to three years. In Asia, there are potential opportunities over the next two to three years in Korea, Japan, Indonesia - and also China where Westinghouse is participating with partners from Spain and Italy on preparing proposals for new plants. And there are further opportunities in Taiwan. But Mr Sero stresses that Westinghouse has not abandoned hope of winning new plant orders in the US and Europe, even if there is no immediate business. A key development here could be Westinghouse's participation in a US-government supported project to spend Dollars 158m over the next five years on detailed design of the AP600, a standardised, simplified 600MW PWR. The involvement of the Department of Energy and of 16 leading US utilities in the project is a clear vote of confidence for nuclear power and for Westinghouse. But Mr Sero also reveals that the company has had several discussions with European utilities about the AP600 programme. In the I&amp;C business, Mr Sero sees opportunities developing from decisions such as that made recently by Ukraine, which is lifting a moratorium on its three most nearly complete nuclear plants. In services, he believes Westinghouse has to maintain its market share in existing business but look to grow its presence elsewhere. Because it is predominantly a PWR supplier, PWR stations tend to form the core of its service work. But competition is tough in this sector of the service business, so Westinghouse wants to expand in other technologies where it can. Mr Sero says opportunities include the UK, where Nuclear Electric wants to subcontract 'outage' work on its Magnox and advanced gas cooled reactors, and servicing for boiling water reactors where it has done well in the US through a subsidiary and could expand into Taiwan and Europe. Hardly surprisingly, Mr Sero is concerned by the anti-nuclear lobby. The fact that entire countries can take an anti-nuclear stance, thus influencing neighbouring countries, 'bothers us,' he says. But, along with many in the industry, he believes suppliers have to continue to educate countries and address people's fears and concerns. Two key factors stand in nuclear power's favour, he says: first, concerns over the effects on the environment of burning fossil fuels for power generation will enhance nuclear's standing because it is emission-free. Secondly, he believes that, in the US the Government is recognising the need to address the issue of nuclear waste, and how it should be stored, controlled and handled. This, he says, would give confidence to people in the US, for whom nuclear waste remains a concern even if polls suggest a majority believe nuclear power should have a role in power generation.</p>

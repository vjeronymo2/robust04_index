			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that  the Greek EU [European Union] presidency in Corfu sought the  best regarding Cyprus' accession in the EU, which was the  beginning of official negotiations to achieve Cyprus'  participation in the next EU enlargement. This goal, he said,  is considered realistically positive. Evaluating Greece's  handling of the issue during the EU summit in Corfu, Kasoulidhis  added that it became clear that the reason no date for the  beginning of accession talks was given was not due to the  developments in the Cyprus issue but to the internal structural  changes that will take place within the Union. Kasoulidhis  repeated that the decisions made in Corfu represent a  significant step in Cyprus' move for accession into the EU, and  added that the next step is the establishment of a date for  accession talks.    AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] says in a  statement that the government's triumphant statements regarding  the decisions made in Corfu are not justified because the goal  for the appointment of a date for the beginning of accession  talks for Cyprus has not been achieved. Instead, AKEL says,  there is a general position that Cyprus will be involved in the  next expansion stage, without anyone knowing under what  conditions and when the next expansion will take place. AKEL  also notes that the conclusion, that the EU has disassociated  the direction of Cyprus' accession from the Cyprus issue, is  arbitrary.    Government spokesman Kasoulidhis commented on AKEL's  statement about the decisions made in Corfu, and noted that the  government does not make triumphant statements, in comparison  with AKEL which speaks of disasters, as he put it, for every  positive step for Cyprus. Kasoulidhis added that one additional  reason that AKEL undermines the importance of the decisions made  in Corfu is that because of the policies it followed, it was the  main reason for the delay in the submission of Cyprus'  application for accession under the presidency of Yeoryios  Vasiliou.    A statement issued by socialist party EDEK [United  Democratic  Union of Cyprus] expresses satisfaction, because the decision of  the EU summit in Corfu does not associate Cyprus' move toward  accession in the EU with the move to solve the Cyprus issue, and  because the next stage of EU expansion will include Cyprus and  Malta. EDEK adds that now there is a need for a real crusade by  all forces in Cyprus and Greece in view of the EU summit next  January so that a decision for the beginning of accession talks  will be made. Finally, EDEK expresses gratitude to the Greek  Government for the fight [on behalf of Cyprus] in the Corfu  summit.    The Free Democrats Movement issued a statement regarding the  reference to Cyprus and Malta in the final communique of the EU  summit in Corfu, which it describes as a positive development.  However, it adds that it has been greatly exaggerated. In the  statement, the Free Democrats Movement stresses that there is no  final decision for Cyprus' accession during the next expansion  as Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis had said. The statement  also notes that the claim for disassociation of the Cyprus issue  from that of accession is not true. It adds that the EU  Commission's position, that Cyprus' application will be  reexamined in January 1995 in light of developments in the  Cyprus issue, is still in effect.</p>

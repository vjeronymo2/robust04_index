			<p>BFN     [Text] The proceedings of the fifth session of the Middle  East cooperation and economic development committee, which  emanated from the multilateral talks, concluded today in Rabat.    Among the most important results of this session was the  creation of a local committee at the regional level for  coordination and follow up in the sphere of economic development.    [Begin recording] [Ra'uf Sa'id, member of Egyptian  delegation] Among the most important results achieved in this  meetings was that a decision was made for the first time on  giving a principal role to the countries of the region, to the  countries of the Middle East itself, to decide among themselves  and by themselves the priorities which concern them on  cooperation in the region, the ways for coordinating between  these activities which take place in these spheres, and at the  same ensuring the complete support of the international  community.    Among the important results which have also been achieved is  that there are important projects which would come closer to the  implementation phases, i.e., transport projects in the Middle  East, be it by road, railway, sea, or air. [end recording]    The Palestinian delegation expressed its satisfaction at the  European proposal in a news conference which called for the  creation of local committee at the regional level for  coordination and cooperation in the development and economic  sphere in the region.    [Begin recording] [Samir Halili, member of Palestinian  delegation] All sides were determined to make this meeting  successful, and determination for the existence and continuation  of the international support for the Middle East peace process,  and for the regional cooperation process. Everyone had the  intention and determination to find a mechanism to support the  multilateral talks and make it a vital and practical feature as  soon as possible.    Morocco has had for a long time a principal role in the  mediation and contacting between Israel, on the one hand, and  the other Arab parties, on the other, especially Morocco's  principal role in the issue of the Jerusalem committee, and also  Morocco's principal role at the Arab Maghreb level.    In my view, the holding of the economic talks for the first  time in the Arab World here in Morocco has great significance.  According to what we have heard and according to our  assessment, there would be a greater role for Morocco in the  next phase in forming the peace process in the region, and in  forming regional cooperation in the region.

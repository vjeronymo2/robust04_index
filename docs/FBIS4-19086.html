			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] Both sides share a strong desire for the improvement  of Croatian-Turkish cooperation, Mate Granic, Croatian vice  premier and foreign minister, stated in Ankara today following  talks with his counterpart and host Hikmet Cetin. In the course  of the talks the two sides signed an agreement on air traffic  between Croatia and Turkey. Our reporter Andjelko Perincic  asked both ministers to make brief statements:    [Granic] ``Relations between our two countries are  improving.  Apart from the agreement signed today we also discussed an  agreement on friendship and cooperation which will probably be  signed during President Demirel's visit to Croatia at President  Tudjman's invitation.    ``We also discussed an agreement on economic cooperation  which will most probably be signed during my visit to Turkey in  May, when a meeting between Minister Cetin, Prime Minister  Silajdzic, and myself is to be held. We also discussed a credit  to be granted by (Ex-Bank) to Zagreb Bank to the tune of $100  million, which will be activated at the beginning of May during  a visit of a Zagreb Bank delegation to Ankara. We also talked  about cultural cooperation, about signing a cultural cooperation  treaty, and also a transport agreement, the establishment of  permanent sea lines, and about the help that Turkey can offer  Croatia for its admission to the Partnership for Peace alliance.  A Turkish ambassador is to head a NATO delegation during their  visit to Zagreb.''    [Perincic] Minister Granic announced an initiative to  establish a joint Turkish-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina bank in  Sarajevo; Turkey is also to provide help to our country for its  admission to international financial institutions and the  rebuilding of the old bridge in Mostar.    He also said that Turkey will support the joint  Croatia-Bosnia-Herzgovina policy and their participation in  meeting of Islamic countries to be held in Tunisia soon, where a  report on the Washington agreement will be delivered. Croatia  should also be a special guest at a meeting of the North  Atlantic assembly to be held in Ankara soon.    As regards NATO's role in the crisis in southeast Europe,  Turkish Minister Cetin, in the capacity of an official of a  member of the alliance, stated the following for Croatian Radio  and TV:    [Cetin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] "We will support Croatia's relation toward NATO as  a basis for its admission to NATO's Partnership for Peace [as  heard]. The Turkish ambassador to NATO headquarters in Brussels  is to head a NATO delegation which is to come to Croatia to  discuss that issue. I hope that with that support and President  Tudjman's and Minister Granic's tactfulness, Croatia will  achieve stability in the Balkans and will win a right decision  by NATO as regards cooperation with that alliance within the  Partnership for Peace project."    [Announcer] It should be added to this report from Ankara  that in the Croatian-Turkish ministerial talks the two sides  also discussed the need to stop the greater Serbian aggression  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to include the Serbs in negotiations  on the federation [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. They also supported  NATO air action.</p>

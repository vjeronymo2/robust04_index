			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Franc nears old floor The French franc moved within reach of its former European exchange rate mechanism floor yesterday, spurred on by last week's news that central bank reserves have been largely replenished and by continued strong hopes for an early cut in Germany's key lending rates, writes Emma Tucker. In the morning, the French currency rose to FFr3.4484 against the D-Mark, its highest level since August 2 when the ERM bands were loosened, and just moderately lower than its previous floor of FFr3.4305. Many analysts expect the franc to breach this level by the year-end. Not even the prospect of a cut in French interest rates - widely expected in the market - was enough to upset the currency. Analysts said this was because the market is increasingly attaching importance to the growth differentials between economies, rather than interest rate differentials between currencies. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America in London, said: 'If anything, interest rate cuts now are perceived as being beneficial.' The franc, however, eased back in late trade to close in London at FFr3.457 per D-Mark, virtually unchanged from Friday's close. Sterling was steady yesterday on the back of D-Mark weakness, but a late surge took it through DM2.54. Weekend newspaper reports that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, was planning to reduce the level of public spending next year from the previously agreed total helped to support the currency. It ended in London at DM2.5425, up a pfennig from Friday's close. Against the dollar it rose  3/4 cent to Dollars 1.4880. The UK money markets were exceptionally quiet ahead of Mr Clarke's statement today. As one dealer put it: 'The buyers have bought, the sellers have sold, and everyone has gone home early.' There was little technical trading to enliven the day, after the Bank of England announced a small shortage of Pounds 450m, revised later in the day to Pounds 750m. The Bank provided late assistance worth Pounds 135m. The three-month interbank rate ended the day at around 5 11/32 per cent. The March short sterling contract, which opened at 94.84, declined by four basis points. The Austrian National Bank announced that it was cutting its Gomex money market intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.8 per cent. A spokesman from the central bank said the move was in response to high liquidity in the Austrian money market. Austria last lowered its Gomex rate, which covers two-thirds of bank refinancing, by 20 basis points earlier this month. The discount rate stays at 5.25 per cent and the Lombard rate at 6.25 per cent. The Austrian schilling finished virtually unaltered from Friday's close at Sch7.042 per D-Mark. In Germany, tight money market conditions prompted the Bundesbank to announce it would inject liquidity via a 'schnell' or two-day repo. The repo, designed to relieve money market shortages in the short term, was set at 6.40 per cent, a relatively high rate given that, last week, banks were able to borrow money at 6.25 per cent. Dealers said conditions were made even tighter in anticipation of today's annual payment of public sector Christmas bonuses. With the abolition of Paragraph 17 funds from the beginning of next year, so-called 'schnell' tenders are likely to be used more often, although the Bundesbank will also be able to use other fine-tuning instruments such as the 'blitz tender', which injects liquidity even faster than the schnell tender. Opinion was divided over what stance the Bundesbank would take at today's regular refinancing operation. Some analysts are expecting a variable rate repo, although with the rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent, due to money market tightness. Others believe the central bank will stick to a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent as a variable tender could invite banks to probe for lower rates. Whatever happens, currency traders across Europe will keep a close eye on the repo announcement for clues on when German interest rates will next be lowered. Most analysts doubt that the Bundesbank will cut German interest rates at this week's council meeting, but are not ruling out a reduction before the end of the year. West German inflation data on Friday showed a year-on-year 3.7 per cent rise in November after October's 3.9 per cent increase and helped to keep rate cut hopes on the boil, according to analysts. The dollar weakened in late London trading after attempting to push through the DM1.7180 level. But the US currency stayed firmly above Y109, aided by a sharp decline in Tokyo stock prices, which fell 3.87 per cent to their lowest level for more than a year. The dollar is likely to trade within a fairly tight range ahead of US jobs data on Friday. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.7085 and Y109.22. Comments by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that German inflation has slowed and that the economy was stabilising had little impact on the dollar/D-Mark rate, according to dealers. The Spanish peseta remained under pressure yesterday on political worries over union threats to carry out a general strike. It closed in London at Pta82.10 against the D-Mark, compared with Friday's finish of Pta81.75.</p>

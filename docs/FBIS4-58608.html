			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All figures as published] </F>   [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs  Division.    The Majles held an open session yesterday with Mr. 'Ali  Akbar Nateq-Nuri presiding, and the deputies of the Jewish  religious minority and the cities of Kashmar, Kohnuj, Ramhormoz,  and Zarand of Kerman made preagenda speeches condemning the  recent crimes of the Zionist regime. The speaker of the Majles  also condemned the Zionist crime of killing the Palestinian  worshippers. The Majles then went into session. We call to the  attention of our honorable readers the details of the  discussions.  <H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>   In today's open session of the Majles, condemning the grave  and unprecedented crimes of the Zionist regime in killing the  Palestinian worshippers in the court of his holiness Ebrahim,  Mr. Nateq-Nuri emphasized: One should stand up and fight against  force; justice will eventually be victorious. The divine maxim  is that justice will achieve victory. We believe that one must  not retreat in the face of the oppressor. In fighting  oppression, one should not speak of discussions, negotiations,  relations, and peace. The nature of domination is to dominate.  This is also true of the United States, which is the most  criminal of all.    He then addressed the leaders of the Islamic governments and  said: Whenever there is one step in retreat in the face of  criminals, the enemy takes a step forward. If 'Arafat and his  agents had not accepted the disgraceful Gaza and Jericho Treaty,  we would not have witnessed such a crime.    The speaker of the Majles also added: Unfortunately, these  criminals did not even act and will not act in good faith on the  basis of this disgraceful agreement. Then, the trade leaders who  claim to be the leaders of Palestinians and the PLO and other  organizations sell the honor and dignity of the people of this  land, and then the treaty will not have any results but crimes  and treason. Today, while U.S. propaganda and U.S. talk of peace  is heard in the Middle East, why do you think that such horrible  crimes are committed? The Islamic countries, their leaders, and  the Muslims should not be deceived by the foolish and deceptive  explanations of the Zionists, who claim that this crime was  committed by a few extremist Jews or soldiers with psychological  problems. This is not true. For anyone to accept that a few  extremist Jews did it and the Israeli Army and the United States  had no hand in it would be extremely naive. This was certainly  preplanned.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri also added: Although usurping Israel does not  see an organized army of Arabs before its eyes, it does see  before its eyes a strong, aggressive, and brave wave of people,  which has been formed there as a result of the Islamic  revolution of Iran and our movement. We see the horizon as  bright, and in the near future they will see the fruits of their  movement. Hence, the rooted resistance of the Palestinians and  the children of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot be  endured by the United States and Israel. I believe that this  crime is the start of a new treacherous and oppressive movement  toward ethnic cleansing and destroying the resistance of the  people in occupied Palestine at the hands of the Israelis.    The speaker of the Majles considered this Zionist action in  conformity with the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia and  Herzegovina by Serbs and said: The fact that the world is silent  with regard to these crimes can be endured. What is important is  that these crimes are neither the first nor the last. But what  must be underscored is how the champions of human rights are  silent with regard to such a crime. The human rights  (organization), which sends its mercenary agent Galindo Pohl to  Iran and quotes the reports of the Hypocrites and condemns Iran  for having a prison or mistreating a Baha'i or changing the  Baha'i cemetery in Tehran into a green area, those who profess  their concern for human rights, think about this and spend so  much to say: Why did you do such-and-such? However, in regards  to such crimes, neither the United Nations nor the supporters of  human rights raise their voices. Their silence in regards to  these crimes is like their silence in regards to the Serbs. Of  course, in a sense, the more of these crimes that occur, the  more the waves in the occupied lands and in Bosnia and  Herzegovina will increase; and the waves and blood, God willing,  will dislodge usurping Israel, the United States, and their  other supporters and increase the motivation to fight in the  children of Palestine and in non-Palestinians.    It should be mentioned that after the speech of the speaker  of the Majles, the shouts of "Death to Israel" resonated in the  Majles.  <H5>  Mohammad Reza Khabbaz, Deputy From Kashmar </H5>   The first preagenda speaker was Khabbaz from Kashmar, who  offered his congratulations on the anniversary of the birthday  of Imam Hasan and, condemning the actions of criminal Israel on  the previous bloody Friday, he thanked the people, the  officials, and the deputies of the Majles for their presence at  the funeral ceremonies of Hojjat ol-Eslam Qoddusi, the  representative of the great leader in the Science and Industry  University.    Stating that our revolution is based on three foundations of  ideology, leadership, and the people, he said: Unity between  these sacred foundations has so far brought us the great  blessing of independence, freedom, and the Islamic Republic; and  the continuation of these blessings and the ability to reach the  peak of spiritual and material progress are possible under the  auspices of the unity of these three divine gifts. God forbid  that any harm should come to any of these three foundations,  which would affect the other two. He added: It is our duty to  make every effort to preserve these three virtuous elements and  not allow certain economic pressures to befall our benefactors,  that is, the people who have given martyrs.    The deputy from Kashmar then pointed out: One of the issues  that causes the people to suffer is the uncontrolled and  irrational inflation that puts pressure on the oppressed in our  Islamic society. Even though the serving government has taken  long strides toward the self-sufficiency of the country, the  speed of economic modification is very rapid, and the oppressed  in the society cannot endure these modifications.    He added: The elimination of subsidies is not in our  interests at all. I, therefore, request that the government slow  down the speed of economic modification. Otherwise, the weak  people will not reach the desired destiny. Also, measures to  prevent chaos in the market must be introduced as soon as  possible. Who is responsible for prices? Do you know of any  place in the world where there are no controls over or awareness  of the price of goods offered to the people? In less than one  week we have witnessed an increase in the price of meat of 100  tumans, and there is no one to answer for it. In a few months,  the rate of foreign currency has gone from 160 tumans to 240  tumans, and no organization takes responsibility, and the  violators are not dealt with decisively.    Khabbaz emphasized: Is the need to control prices not felt  in  the Islamic society? The greatest pressure is on that class of  people with fixed incomes, such as employees, and those with  low-level jobs. For example, until a few months ago, with the  160-toman dollar, the salary of an employee earning 15,000  tumans a month would be worth $93, but today he can only buy  about $62 worth of goods with the same salary. In other words,  not only have the salaries of employees not increased in  proportion to inflation in terms of cash or material, but they  also have decreased by about 30 percent. Instead, a small number  of people in society who neither support the revolution nor have  faith in the progress of the country, those whose God is money,  have gained astronomical wealth with this windfall money. How  long must these leeches suck the blood of the people of this  country who have offered martyrs? We, therefore, ask the  Ministry of Commerce to put the supervision and control of  prices at the top of its agenda, to provide the grounds for  nonoil exports, and to eliminate the obstacles to the export of  nonoil products in order for the economy of the country to be  cut loose from the umbilical cord of oil. Second, why do some  economic terrorists still evade taxes 16 years after the victory  of the revolution? Why, after identification, are the just taxes  on their unimaginable wealth not collected? As a result, the  weak worker and small business owner must pay for them. The  deputy from Kashmar asked the government to treat these  individuals in such a way as to make up for the past and to take  their debts of several years from them, even by force, and  render them to the Treasury.    The speaker termed the uncontrolled population increase one  of the important economic problems of the country and said: We  ask the government to confront this deadly phenomenon with  proper and serious programs and guidance. Even though since the  Islamic revolution the government has rendered a great deal of  service even to the dear villagers, and despite the economic  embargo, the imposed war, and the destroyed country inherited  from the cruel monarchical regime, the government has been able  to implement several times the number of developmental projects  of the past in the most remote areas of the country to eliminate  the problems of the country. In conclusion, he asked the  minister of roads and transport to give priority to the  strategic Borsekan-Sabzevar road and mentioned to the minister  of petroleum the implementation of the Kashmar natural gas  project next year.  <H5>  Kuros Keyvani, Deputy of the Jewish Minority </H5>   The deputy of the Jews condemned the horrible crimes of  the Zionist regime in al-Khalil.    The next speaker was Keyvani, the deputy of the Jewish  minority, who spoke briefly and said: Since several thousand  years ago, when his holiness Abraham bought a cave in the area  of al-Khalil in which to bury his wife and it later became the  tomb of his holiness Abraham as well as Isaac and Jacob, this  place has been the most sacred place of pilgrimage for Jews. The  Association of Iranian Jews strongly condemns this barbaric  crime and the massacre of the fasting, defenseless worshippers.    He continued: Especially given that all monotheists believe  that eventually the existence of a single faith and common  beliefs will result in peace and sincerity, this horrible crime  and the disrespect shown for this sacred place are intolerable,  and the perpetrators of this crime deserve curses and damnation.  Certainly, the Government of Israel, which according to  international agreements is responsible for the security and  safety of the occupied lands and for preserving respect for this  sacred place and its worshippers, has a grave responsibility in  this tragedy. Keyvani continued: The Society of Iranian Jews  demands that all the necessary investigations be carried out  thoroughly and impartially in order that the perpetrators of  this crime be punished. On behalf of the Society of Iranian  Jews, in the wake of this tragedy, I offer my condolences to the  grand leader, the families of the martyrs, the oppressed people  of Palestine, our beloved compatriots, and the whole of humanity.  <H5>  Gholamreza Mo'tamedinia, Deputy From Kohnuj </H5>   The next speaker was Mo'tamedinia from Kohnuj, who offered  his congratulations on the birthday of Imam Hasan Mojtaba and  condolences for the martyrdom of the oppressed Palestinian  worshippers. He continued: Since the victory of the Islamic  revolution, the global oppressors headed by the Great Satan have  not for a moment stopped their hostility against Islam and the  revolution and have fought the revolution and Islam openly and  secretly.    The speaker continued: By the grace of God and with the  prophet-like guidance of the late Imam and the great leader, our  regime continues rapidly on its path, and with each day the  despair and hopelessness of the oppressors increases. The enemy  accuses us of supporting terrorism. Perhaps the people of the  world know how we and our nation have suffered at the hands of  the terrorists who are protected by the oppressors. The best  children of this land were assassinated at the hands of the same  terrorists who continue their disgraceful life under the  auspices of the oppressors.    In continuation, the speaker added: The hypocrite minigroup  that is today accepted and protected in the official and  nonofficial circles of the Europeans and Americans has martyred  many Friday imams in prayer niches and placed bombs in public  places. Why do they allow them in their countries, listen to  their lies, and support them?    Stating that the false claimers of antiterrorist sentiments  are themselves terrorists and nurture terrorists, he said: The  human rights that we are accused of violating have been violated  more than everyone else and before everyone else by the  oppressors. Nowhere in the world and in no international legal  system is respect for the rights of humanity as strong as in  Islam and the sacred Islamic regime.    Mo'tamedinia continued: The Islamic legal system that is  practiced in our country today is the most perfected of all  legal systems in the world.    Then, in connection with the valuable services of the  government in the 15 years of the revolution, given the tricks  of the oppressors, the deputy of Kohnuj said: (The government)  has gained great success in the area of development and  fundamental work. To be fair, no one can accuse the government  of not having worked hard. If at times some people make  despairing statements, they are either ill-intentioned or  uninformed. We have a duty to inform the people of the work of  the government, but we must also mention the flaws.    In connection with the uncontrolled high prices that worry  the people to a degree, the speaker said: While the government  must pay special attention to the vulnerable and low-income  strata in the society, I suggest that the government fix the  prices of goods and services as soon as possible and carefully  supervise them in order to achieve trade based on proper and  just Islamic rules.  <H5>  Mohammad Reza Bahmani, Deputy From Ramhormoz </H5>   Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an  unforgivable sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it.    As another preagenda speaker, Bahmani, the deputy from  Ramhormoz, strongly condemned the barbaric crime of the Zionists  in the shrine of Abraham and said: Will the rulers of some  Islamic countries relinquish friendship and support for the  enemies of Islam? Past experience has shown, and this time will  be no different, that all the constituents of the oppressors and  the Great Satan will overlook the events.    He added: The United Nations and the Security Council, too,  will merely condemn the action and will not punish the  perpetrator or perpetrators. Based on the Geneva Convention, the  security of the residents of the occupied land is the duty of  the occupiers, and the Zionist regime must accept the  responsibility for this crime. The regime occupying Jerusalem,  by compromising with 'Arafat, has targeted all of Islam.  Disrespect for the sacred beliefs of Muslims is an unforgivable  sin, and Muslims must not simply overlook it.    He added: Muslims must by thoroughly understanding the  tragedy and display a calculated reaction, because the West has  made its choice between the Islamic world and the Zionist regime  for years, and naturally the Islamic world must also make its  serious choice.    He referred to the services of the Islamic Republic in the  area of fundamental investments and said: Despite the population  growth and the decrease in the price of oil, the country has  been able to continue its services. Nevertheless, in terms of  devising a budget and plan, it appears to have problems that  should be mentioned. The operation of the First Five-Year Plan,  in accordance with the ratification of the Majles, was supposed  to have been presented to the Majles by the government, which  unfortunately was not done. In many interviews there is constant  talk of growth above and beyond the expectations of the Plan,  sometimes up to 300 percent, yet there is no talk of the  shortcomings and backwardness.    In regards to the annual budget, he said: Note 29 of the  national budget is a note that every year deals with foreign  currency issues. The content of this note, even though it  strongly effects the economy, is rarely evaluated carefully in  order that the deputies understand how the system has been  working.    For example, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  states that the Central Bank must operate so as to ensure that  at the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], the total obligations  resulting from the operations of the current account does not  increase in proportion to the investment account of the previous  years and the foreign currency reserves at the end of 1372 are  less than the foreign currency reserves at the beginning of that  year. Hence, the foreign currency policies in 1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994] must have two characteristics from a  budgetary point of view.    A) The foreign currency obligations of the country should  not  have increased compared to those at the end of 1371 [20 March  1993].    B) The foreign currency reserves of the country at the end  of  1372 should not be less than the year's figure. [sentence as  published]    The deputy of Ramhormoz then emphasized: Why have Paragraph  A  and B, which were mentioned, not been achieved? Why has the rial  been devalued so much?    In practice, how did some amounts, which were earmarked for  accounting, actually aid the budgetary accounting? How do we  evaluate the operation of the sale of foreign currency in 1372?  How did the committee cited in Note 22, Paragraph A, Part 3,  operate? How much of the foreign currency purchases of the  country have been converted into rial purchases? Why is the rate  of foreign currency in the 1373 budget lower than the rate of  the dollar in the official markets? If the rate of the dollar in  1373 is anticipated to decrease, we must note that at the  present time, the rate of the dollar on the open market is  higher than the floating rate.    The speaker continued: The 1373 budget must reduce the  likelihood of new crises. Also, the budget cannot be  economically justified. Hence, the inflation rate projected in  this budget must be stated. To what level will it bring the cash  flow? How will it regulate the gross national product?    He then said in regards to the management of heavy  industries  and mines and metals: These days, the people are witnessing the  serious increase in the number of vehicles in the country. The  Ministry of Heavy Industries, which enjoys such significant  legal privileges as tax exemption, must saturate the consumer  market through increased production and lower prices. Not only  has it played no role in lowering prices, but it has been an  important factor in increasing prices.    Before the ratification of the law on accounting and the  collection of customs duties and commercial taxes and taxes on  various kinds of vehicles and road building equipment and the  manufacture of their parts on 02/10/1371 [23 December 1992], the  implementation of which on 27/11/1372 [16 February 1994] on all  domestically produced and imported vehicles with consideration  for the laws at the time and the legal codes of the budget of  the years prior to 1372, some amounts were collected as taxes on  imported and domestic vehicles and other taxes and deposited in  France. The difference in these amounts in 1371 [21 March  1992-20 March 1993] was about 3.7 billion rials [R] and in 1372,  R170.5 billion. For example, prior to the implementation of the  1371 tax law, the Peugeot-405 GL was R19 million on open sale,  and the tax paid was R5 million. After the implementation of the  tax policy, this figure decreased to R800,000, but the price of  the car increased to R30 million.  <H5>  'Ali Motahhari, Deputy From Zarand of Kerman </H5>   The last preagenda speaker of the open session of the Majles  yesterday was Motahhari from Zarand of Kerman, who offered his  condolences and condemned the Zionist crime of the slaughter of  the Palestinian worshippers in the city of al-Khalil, asking for  the widespread participation of the people in the march on  Jerusalem Day.    Stating that our revolution is a revolution of values, the  speaker continued: If in a regime liberal ideology has abstract  concepts such as the relationship of the people with their  deputies, the deputies with the parliament, the government with  the executive and judicial branches, and the like, these are  alienated relationships, because in such systems the  relationship of all sectors with the parliament, especially the  relationship of the people with their parliament, is limited,  noninclusive, and nondynamic. However, with the blessing of the  Islamic revolution, our Majles has found an exalted place, as  the first manifestation of the ideals of the people and the  embodiment of the virtues of the nation.    Continuing, in connection with the Majles, Motahhari said:  The great founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran presented the  Majles as the true house of the nation and the result of the  calls of "God is great" by the people. The grand leader of the  revolution also said that the Majles, in the true sense of the  word, is the manifestation of the will and rule of the people.    If we accept that the Majles truly holds such a position in  the whole regime, then how can a brother who up to a few days  ago was the governor of Kerman make such unjust remarks about  the position and status of the Majles?    In this connection, I ask for permission to inform the  deputies of a few points.    1) He says that one of the deficiencies of our Constitution  is that the government and the Majles do not have comparable  importance. While the Majles can impeach the government, the  government must also be given the right to dissolve the Majles.  Indeed, has the time not come for this dear brother, even for  one time, to carefully study the foundation of the regime and  note that our sacred regime gets its legitimacy and the  guarantee of the rule of God from the absolute rule of religious  guardianship and the guarantee of the rule of the people in  current affairs from the people. Therefore, when there are  strong reasons for the eternal power of the regime, there is no  room for the simpleminded.    2) He said that according to our Constitution we have given  the central position to the Majles, that this deficiency has  become evident and in several years may be corrected.    The question is whether he has noticed that the balance of  power, the distinguished position of the leader, and relations  between the branches are based upon the ideals of the Islamic  revolution and the approval of the nation and the people in form  of the Constitution. Contrary to his opinion, I must emphasize  that, thank God, the relationship between the three branches in  our sacred regime is based on the guarantee of achieving the  goals of the revolution and the ideals of the people, with the  thoughtful and remarkable direction of the Imam.    3) He says that our problem in the first years of the  victory  of the revolution was that we thought management meant company,  or somewhere else he says, it is an erroneous tradition for  every group that gains a majority in the Majles to put pressure  on the executive system. Of course, perhaps if the majority  existing in the Majles were that that he wished it to be,  applying pressure would be no problem, according to him. It is  perhaps for this reason that he tolerated the problem in the  past.    In continuation, he said: What has to be said here is an  expression of sorrow that he does not note that the deputies are  the voice of their constituency and are considered the eyes and  ears of the regime. Why should an executive official in our  sacred regime not appreciate ponderous words from the mouth of  the people and not pay attention to the eyes and ears? Is it not  that the continuation of support and efforts of millions of  people and the strength of this sacred regime is due to the  respect that this regime places on the votes and words of the  Muslim nation? Is it an unpleasant thing for this solidarity  between the wishes of the people and those of the executive  officials to exist? If they take a step for the people, do these  officials not want to them to participate willingly in their  destiny in the cities and villages? Is it better to choose  unacceptable governors and officials with questionable  reputations to run the affairs? If the law has given you the  authority to select the governors, do you not want to make use  of this authority to get better results, to carry out reforms,  and to satisfy the people? Has the history of certain actions  not clearly proved that it is not in the interest of our  revolution to condemn and question anyone who does not agree  with our personal and factional views and tastes, and to justify  pressures?    The deputy of Zarand of Kerman also added: I hope that his  honor, who was ultimately honored to serve alongside the  distinguished personality of the revolution, the trustworthy  captain of the executive ship of the country, the beloved  president of the Islamic nation, God willing, will be the source  of useful and effective service in the future, and such  judgments and tendencies in him will end.    Motahhari then said: Yesterday, we were informed that a  group  of directors general of the offices of the province came as a  group to Tehran. As the deputy of the people, I request of the  related ministers sincerely that they ask their directors about  the motive behind their trip in this situation and in the  blessed month of Ramazan. Was this a personal or political trip?  And, from what source were the expenditures of the trip provided?    In conclusion, he said: I request of the honorable minister  of interior and pioneering revolutionary that in order to put  the minds of the brave and patient people of Kerman at ease and  make them content, the necessary care be taken in appointing new  governors, and that it be noted that these people are the  capital of this regime and the benefactors of all of us.  <H5>  Ratifications </H5> The Majles rejected the attachment of the National Grain  Organization to the Ministry of Agriculture.  <H5>  The Proposal To Separate the Grain Organization From the </H5> Ministry of Commerce    The first item on the agenda of the open session of the  Majles was the continuation of the examination of the first  round of discussions of the Administrative and Employment  Affairs Committee concerning the rejection of the proposal to  separate the National Grain Organization from the Ministry of  Commerce and attach it to the Ministry of Agriculture, the  general points of which were not ratified and were rejected.    Among the reasons for the rejection by the above-mentioned  committee:    A) From the viewpoint of the bylaws and the goals  establishing it, considering that the goal in establishing this  organization [was]:    1) Provisions (purchasing surplus products of the producers  of domestic grain, if necessary, from abroad).    2) Storage.    3) Distribution.    4) Regulating the grain market.    5) Commercial, industrial, research activities and related  services.    The above-mentioned activities are mainly in connection with  the ratified duties of the Ministry of Commerce. Even though an  insignificant percentage may be related to the Ministry of  Agriculture, which is natural and essentially inherent in the  organization's goals and duties, a percentage is related to  other organizations.    B) In terms of governing policies:    Because grains are a strategic commodity, and in the past 60  years, due to their grave significance, attention has been paid  to them, and during the periods when they were in the  agricultural or cooperative and rural affairs branches, they did  not have a significant return, inevitably, in 1352 [21 March  1973-20 March 1974] they were attached to the Ministry of  Commerce. In the past 20 years, thank God, despite the war and  internal crises, grains have had no critical problems, and since  the revolution we have witnessed the relative increase in  production of wheat and other grains. During the times when they  were dependent on other ministries, due to incompetence, they  frequently caused the fall of governments.    C) In terms of organization:    It seems that, as it has been decided that the general  organization of the country should be reviewed, the discussion  on the separation and attachment of an organization or an  institution to some ministry would not be logical or worthy of  the Majles, because it would waste the precious time of the  honorable deputies on details. If the management of an  organization acts weakly, the organization cannot be dissolved  or moved. The operation of the organization must be examined,  and the reason for the weakness must be found. These moves not  only do not solve any problem but also add to the problems.  There are many organizations, such as the Grains Organization,  which, if we only look at the production aspect, we must move.  Production [should be] in its own place and purchasing and  distribution in their own place.    The continuation of the committee report states: Now that  the  honorable minister of commerce has recently received a vote of  confidence, it is not expedient to daily raise the issue of  separating an organization from the Ministry of Commerce. Let us  see its operation in the future and engage in such actions.  <H5>  Bill on the Establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic </H5> Coordination of the Cities of the Country    The next item on the agenda was the amendment by the  Councils  and Internal Affairs Committee regarding the bill on the  establishment of the Supreme Council of Traffic Coordination of  the cities of the country (returned from the Council of  Guardians), which was ratified by the Majles.    The text of the amendment of Article 1 by the committee:    Article 1: In order to implement comprehensive and  coordinated traffic policies and to improve the management of  all affairs related to the issue of traffic, such as the design,  planning, organization, coordination, guidance, supervision, and  control of traffic in the cities, the Supreme Council of Traffic  Coordination of the counties of the country, which will be  called from here on the Supreme Council, shall be comprised of  the following members:    1) The deputy minister of interior (president of the  council);    2) The deputy of roads and transport;    3) the deputy minister of housing;    4) the deputy minister of post, telegraph and telephone;    5) the deputy director of the Plan and Budget Organization;    6) the director of the Environmental Protection Organization  or his deputy;    7) the commander of the law enforcement forces or his  deputy.    The ratifications of this council shall be mandatory for  implementation, upon the approval of the minister of interior.  <H5>  Amendment to Article 4 </H5>   Article 4. The ratifications of the Supreme Council of  Traffic Coordination of the cities of the country, which must be  within the framework of the laws and regulations of the country,  are mandatory for implementation for all ministries,  establishments, government organizations, institutes, and public  and private establishments.  <H5>  Proposal To Amend the Registration Law </H5>   The last item on the agenda was the urgent report of the  Judicial Committee concerning the proposal to amend Articles 16  and 20 of the law of the country on documents and property  registration, of which the general points were ratified. The  examination of its details was postponed to the next session.    It is noteworthy that Article 16 specifies the procedures  for  application for registration and protests against it, and  Article 20 discusses the procedures for protest to the property  boundaries, for which an application has been registered and  submitted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baler, Aurora -- The New People's Army (NPA) in  North Quezon province claimed here yesterday that it has broken  several campaigns by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP)  to annihilate it, expanding its forces and establishing units  and mass organizations in island towns and the upper  municipalities of this province.    The rebel army however was silent on the gunslaying Sunday  of  one of its former commander, Leopoldo Mabilangan alias Comrade  Hector, formerly head of the Mt. Banahaw Command in  Quezon-Batangas area, and a government surrenderer.    In a fax statement sent to the MANILA BULLETIN, Labrador  Luminoso, spokesman of the NPA command in Northern Quezon  province, said that the NPA gains started in the early 1980's  and engaged the military in several confrontations.    They claimed that the NPA North Quezon were supported by  5,000 organized masses in the armed struggle.    Last year, he said that the NPA North Quezon was able to  "punish enemy agents, bandits, and military operatives engaged  in espionage and counter-insurgency operations."    Luminoso also said that people who are using the NPA's name  to promote their criminal activities were likewise arrested and  told to reform under pain of severe punishment.    The NPA leader attributed the people's army gains after it  launched a rectification campaign to strengthen its ties with  the masses and organize them for revolutionary work in response  to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  the Philippines.    The NPA Quezon, he said, also launched campaigns to treat  thousands of people on Pollilo island and the coastal town of  General Nakar and firmed up its relations with thousands more  scattered in remote barangays [villages] of the island town and  the nearby municipalities.    Today, Luminoso said, the group is vigorously campaigning to  stop illegal logging in its jurisdiction. Pollilo, he said, is  noted to be a shipment point for illegally cut logs bound for  Japan and Taiwan.</p>

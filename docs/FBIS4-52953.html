			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Reiterates DPRK's Stand on </F> Replacement of Fuel Rods" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK  Foreign Ministry today answered a question put by KCNA regarding  the beginning of the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt  experimental nuclear power station.    He said:    As is known, the replacement of fuel rods has begun at our 5  megawatt experimental nuclear power station according to its  operation plan.    This refueling is part of the undertakings to normalize our  peaceful nuclear activities.    As we have clarified time and again, we could not freeze the  operation of the graphite moderated reactor system for an  indefinite period, incurring economic losses, since the prospect  of implementation of the DPRK-USA agreement on converting the  graphite moderated reactor system to a light water reactor  system became dim as a result of the abortion of the third round  of talks.    Moreover, the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt  experimental nuclear power station could not be delayed any  longer in view of its technical safety.    That is why we sent a telex message to the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on April 19 informing it of our  replacement plan in advance and requesting it to observe it and  promptly take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel  rods.    Later, we sent telex messages to the agency on four  occasions, repeatedly requesting it to take relevant measures  including the removal of seals for a smooth operation of the  facilities. And we agreed to all the demands of the agency with  regard to its observation, except for the selection and  preservation of the fuel rods, a matter which is beyond our  unique status, and issued in good time entry visas to the  agency's inspectors.    Moreover, we allowed, as an exception, inspection activities  for the continuity of safeguards requested by the Secretariat of  the agency and even an "additional inspection" which it  described as an "uncompleted inspection" during its inspection  in March, taking into consideration the fact that the United  States withdrew the precondition of "exchange of special envoys  between the North and the South of Korea" which it had insisted  on.    The Secretariat of the agency, however, persistently avoided  sending a group of inspectors on unreasonable pretexts and did  not take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel rods.  Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove  seals and start taking out fuel rods for safety reasons.    In this connection, we notified the agency that the whole  course of the replacement of fuel rods would be placed under a  strict watch of the agency's cameras.    All this was motivated by our utmost sincerity to prove the  non- diversion of the replaced fuel rods to non-peaceful  purposes and demonstrate the uprightness of our nuclear  activities.    It is self-evident that such inspection activities falling  under the categories of routine and ad hoc inspections as  selection and preservation of some of the fuel rods can never be  allowed in view of our unique status following a temporary  suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from  the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).    To select and preserve some of the fuel rods at this  juncture  means to take samples. This is an inequitable attitude ignoring  our present unique status which excludes ad hoc inspection, and  a prejudiced, unreasonable demand blindly casting "suspicion" on  the DPRK.    We have already clearly notified the IAEA that we will  contain all the spent fuel under strict surveillance of the IAEA  and fully allow the IAEA to measure it when the nuclear issue is  settled between the DPRK and the USA.    It is hardly understandable for the IAEA Secretariat to  insist on selecting and preserving some of the fuel now, though  it will be able to get the most correct results if it measures  all the fuel at that time.    This makes us suspect that the IAEA Secretariat is not  interested in the measurement of the fuel rods but is seeking  the political purpose of gradually undermining our unique status  under the cloak of measurement.    In its report on the results of the inspection in March at  the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the United Nations  Security Council, the Secretariat said it was "indispensable" to  wind up the "incomplete inspection activities" at the  radiochemical laboratory. So, we allowed them and now the  Secretariat says it is "indispensable" to select and preserve  fuel rods. This proves that there is no credibility in the  attitude of the Secretariat.    This makes us conclude that the Secretariat's demand for  selecting and preserving fuel rods at this juncture is aimed at  fabricating another "inconsistency" which was one of the root  causes of our withdrawal from the NPT and justifying its  partiality toward the DPRK.    In view of our unique status, we are only obliged to provide  the continuity of safeguards through the verification of the  non- diversion of nuclear material, not the verification of the  completeness and correctness of the initial inventory.    Though we decided to strictly contain the fuel rods and put  them under the control of the agency, some quarters of the  United States are now spreading the rumor that we are changing  the fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of  four or five nuclear bombs. This is quite contradictory to the  fact and cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention  to intensify pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of refueling.    Actually, refueling is taking place under the watch of the  cameras installed by the agency. So, there is no ground to  worry about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another  purpose.    Now some quarters are contending that if we stopped and put  off refueling, the problem of observation might be solved. This  is, however, an unrealistic speculation that does not take into  account the characteristics of the technical safety of our  experimental atomic power plant.    If refueling is stopped midway, it may cause a new danger in  the view of safety.    But we think that since refueling has just begun, there  still  remain possibilities to resolve the problem.    We proposed to the agency negotiations for an agreement on  practical matters related to the presence at the replacement of  fuel rods along with complicated outstanding issues with it.    The solution to the issue depends on the attitude of the  agency.    If the agency persist in its unreasonable demand, ignoring  our unavoidable conditions regarding the replacement of the fuel  rods, the issue would become more complicated.    We will as ever make every possible effort for a fair and  fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.</p>

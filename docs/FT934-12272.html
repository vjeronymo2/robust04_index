			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens in talks to sell six units HOOGOVENS, the Dutch metals group, is negotiating the sale of six small companies representing half its industrial supply division, as part of plans to concentrate on its main steel and aluminium businesses. The six companies, with combined annual sales of Fl 250m (Dollars 138m) and a workforce of 1,000 people, are to be sold as a group to three Dutch venture capital companies - Albif, Alpinvest and Nederlandse Participatie Maatschappij. The rest of the companies in the industrial supply division are to be distributed among Hoogovens' other four divisions but they may be sold later if buyers can be found. Hoogovens, which is struggling to reduce losses and debts, announced this year that it planned to start divesting non-core businesses. The six companies are Bihca Precision, Gieterij Nunspeet, Nederlandse Draadindustrie, Achilles, Thibo Draad and El-o-Matic Holding, in which Hoogovens owns a 46.6 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "China Trains More Young Scientists"] </F>   [Text] Hefei, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is training and  promoting more young scientists for its modernization plans into  the next century.    Among them are 30-year-old Dr. Chen Yongcong, who was  promoted to professor of physics at the Chinese University of  Sciences and Technology; 34-year-old Chen Zhangliang a  department head at Beijing University; and 34-year-old Wang Wei,  professor of communications at Nanjing's Dongnan University.    Professor Hu Liming, 31, of Shanghai's Huadong (East China)  University of Science and Engineering, is known as a "rising  star" in science and tutors students for doctor's degrees.    "Training trans-century talented people is one of China's  programs aimed at helping the country catch up with the rapid  international developments in science," an official of the State  Education Commission said.    The central government will mobilize both central and local  efforts to do a good job of running 100 major universities and  colleges to approach the advanced international level in the  quality of education, scientific research and management in the  coming years, the official said.    According to him, priority will be given to the development  of Qinghua, Beijing, Shanghai Fudan, Shanghai Jiaotong and Xian  Jiaotong Universities this year.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing has called on localities to train  leaders in trans-century sciences by saying, "the Chinese  Government will offer its support in manpower, goods and  materials to create a better environment for young talented  people to display their abilities."    China has set up a special foundation to offer funds for  young people to carry out research and participate in academic  activities at home and abroad.    Guo Qipeng, a 30-year-old professor at the Chinese  University  of Sciences and Technology, has set up a high polymer laboratory  for young scientists at home and abroad to use.    "My purpose is to create opportunities and conditions for  them to bring their initiative into full play so that they can  become influential academic leaders in the field of high polymer  science," the professor said.    Professor Lu Jupu who was awarded the title of "outstanding  young scientist" by the central government, attributed his  success to the improved academic environment these days.    Professor Li Xiaoguang, 33, of the Chinese University of  Sciences and Technology has put forth new ideas for the study of  superconduction, for which he has been highly commended by  experts at both home and abroad.    Xu Xiaoming, China's youngest tutor guiding doctorate  students in automation control at Shanghai Jiaotong University,  has put forward a new theory for the forecasting and control of  industrial systems and elicitation method control for robots.    He has been invited by a U.S. mathematics society to write  articles specially for it.    Known as an expert in handling photo information, Li Chang  of  the Chinese Civil Aviation Institute has developed three  research findings in the past two years.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA INMATES BLAME UNREST ON GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> ROEMER'S STINGINESS WITH CLEMENCY HAS CREATED 'TIME BOMB,' LIFERS CLAIM  </P> <P> At Louisiana State Penitentiary, despair has a name: Gov. Buddy Roemer.  </P> <P> The maximum-security prison, once among the nation's bloodiest, is under a  state of emergency declared by U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola after a  string of murders, suicides and escapes this year. Inmates blame Roemer's  stinginess with clemency for the 4,800 men, most serving life or very nearly  life.  </P> <P> "It's the hope of release that generates faith in the system. When an inmate  loses faith, you have a ticking time bomb," said Ron Wikberg, who has served 21  years of a life sentence for murdering a grocery clerk during a robbery in  Lafayette.  </P> <P> Roemer granted clemency to four people -- only one of them from Angola -- and  approved 10 pardons from March 13, 1988, to June 23, 1989. Predecessor Edwin  Edwards approved clemency for 42 people and 22 pardons from March 13, 1984, to  June 23, 1985, the start of his last term in office.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sentence Reduction  </P> <P> Inmates accuse Roemer of going back on his word to reduce sentences fairly,  based on merit. Under Edwards, money and political connections got inmates out  of prison, they said. Howard Marsellus, Edwards' pardon board chairman, is now  serving five years in prison for his role in a pardon-for-sale scandal.  </P> <P> When model prisoners have no hope of release, they try to escape or kill  themselves, Wikberg said. "Unmodel prisoners" assault or kill others.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that's the problem. That's an excuse," Roemer said.  </P> <P> "There's two schools of thought," said state Department of Corrections chief  Bruce Lynn. "One, inside the prison, says they need more clemency. The people  on the outside say, 'No they don't.'  </P> <P> "The governor's caught between a rock and a hard place."  </P> <P> Prisoners cite the case of lifer Francis "Corky" Clifton, 52, who after 27  years in prison was made a trusty, tending bloodhounds and attack dogs. But two  months ago he ran away from the house where he lived, forfeiting the chance to  spend the rest of his sentence free of chains and cells.  </P> <P> "I realized I had a lot to lose," Clifton said after surrendering five days  later. "To think you're going to die here, it just gets to you. It gets to  working on your mind."  </P> <P> Assistant Warden Roger Thomas said: "The unwritten message from other inmates  and employees used to be, 'If you behave yourself, in 10 or 15 or 20 years  you're going to be able to go home.' What's happening is the long-termers  aren't going home."  </P> <P> Consequently, many prisoners believe they have nothing to lose, he said.  </P> <P> Inmates want only what they have earned, said Wilbert Rideau, the editor of the  award-winning prison magazine The Angolite.  </P> <P> "They're not asking for anything special. They're asking for people to treat  them fair. I can't imagine the average citizen having a problem with that,"  said Rideau, 47, who has served 28 years of a life sentence for slashing the  throat of a bank teller in Lake Charles.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is he needs to grant clemency to deserving inmates. He needs  to keep his word to prisoners," said Floyd Webb, 36, who has served nine years  of a life sentence for a shotgun slaying in St. Tammany Parish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Television Show  </P> <P> Wikberg, 46, an associate editor of The Angolite, said much of the  dissatisfaction can be traced to an April "20-20" television show on Rideau and  his inability to secure release. "Every inmate at Angola was watching that  show."  </P> <P> In the "20-20" piece, Roemer made his stand on clemency clear.  </P> <P> Clifton said that was when he decided to flee.  </P> <P> On May 1, lifer Steven Calloway Howard, 34, escaped after 10 years in prison.  He was captured nearby three days later.  </P> <P> On May 8, lifer Donald Fink, 39, tried to run off and, after warning shots, was  wounded by guards. "I'm tired and I'm going home," long-term inmate Henry  Patterson quoted Fink as saying.  </P> <P> Angola has long had a reputation as a hard place. The state's 38 Death Row  prisoners live here, close to "Gruesome Gertie," the electric chair used to  execute 18 men since 1983. Eight were executed in the summer of 1987.  </P> <P> The 18,000-acre prison, 50 miles north of Baton Rouge, is surrounded by the  Mississippi River on three sides and the impassable Tunica Hills on the other.  The location is remote, accessible only by a single, winding dirt road.  </P> <P> In 1971, the American Bar Assn. described conditions as medieval, squalid and  horrifying. Inmates told of the "Red Hat," where unruly prisoners were kept  naked in dark, damp dungeons and given only spoonfuls of food. There were  reports of 70 murders in 18 years and rampant homosexuality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State of Emergency  </P> <P> In 1975, Polozola of Baton Rouge declared the prison in a state of emergency.  Ross Maggio, called "the gangster" by inmates for his unwavering adherence to  rules, was brought in as warden to scour away the blood and filth.  </P> <P> By most accounts, he succeeded. Food was improved, wretched dining halls were  cleaned, prisoners were kept busy with work in the fields and organized  recreation. More guards were hired and given better pay.  </P> <P> The prison seemed dormant for almost a decade until four murders, four  suicides, 64 stabbings and 11 escapes in 14 months forced Polozola to declare a  new state of emergency June 21. Another suicide occurred earlier this month.  </P> <P> The fury at Angola is hidden behind the concertina wire. The grounds are trim  and neat. Guard towers rise above white fences, rows of corn and herds of  cattle. The prison camps look washed and the steel bars are painted.  </P> <P> Maggio, who retired in 1984, is coming back as Polozola's court-appointed  prison specialist, but Warden Hilton Butler remains in his job. Polozola will  not comment about the case.  </P> <P> Maggio is a nervy man. Kidnapped at knifepoint with his mother by two trusties  in 1982, he ran his truck into the main gate, grabbed a pistol from a guard and  unloaded it into the cab. One inmate was killed and another wounded. Doris  Maggio, then 64, was cut by the windshield's spraying glass.  </P> <P> Butler, chosen warden of the year in 1987 by the North American Assn. of  Wardens, said Maggio isn't needed, that there is no state of emergency. What is  needed, he said, is more guards and better pay for them.  </P> <P> For two years, Butler has run Angola with a $46-million budget and 1,200  guards. This year, budget cuts deprived guards of the $100-a-month premium for  working in a maximum-security prison. It's been years since they had a raise.  </P> <P> That doesn't help inmates either, Wikberg said. "There's a ripple effect here.  When employees are happy they treat prisoners a bit better. When they're  demoralized, it's hard on inmates."  </P> <P> "It's a situation that's ripe for anything," Webb said.  </P></p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Redwood accused of being cereal killer A parish boundary runs through a field of winter barley on Mr Roger Jones's 100-hectare farm which borders the Rhymney Valley in Gwent, south Wales. The barley on one side will earn him Pounds 191 a hectare in aid from Brussels. On the other it will be eligible for Pounds 98 a hectare at the most. 'It doesn't make sense,' he said. 'It's all the same land.' Mr Jones's problem arises from government proposals to divide Wales into two regions to determine the amount of compensation that arable farmers will be paid now Brussels has reduced its support prices. The government is under heavy pressure from Wales's 4,000 cereal growers to drop the complex two-tier system, which is based on the amount of land under cereal production in each of the country's 1,000 parishes. The farmers say it is unfair and divisive. Mr Owen Williams, a neighbour of Mr Jones, grows cereals in the Rhymney Valley. Because he is in a mainly hilly parish that produces under 50 hectares of winter cereals - the cut-off figure - he will qualify only for the lower payments. 'It's absolutely ludicrous,' he said. 'Our farm was left out of the 'less favoured area' grants because it was considered too productive.' Mr Williams produces more than 7 tonnes of cereals a hectare, much the same as Mr Jones a mile away. 'Our land is capable of growing crops equal to anything they can grow in England,' he adds. Like Mr Jones, he has appealed to the Welsh Office about the decision, which he said would cost him between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000. Mr Frank Leguen de Lacroix, a European Commission agriculture official invited to Wales by the National Farmers' Union earlier this month, is raising the matter with UK officials. He said he was puzzled by the scheme, which appeared to set one grower against another. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, proposed dividing Wales last year after Welsh arable farmers objected to being paid less compensation than those in England. The aim was to bring more Welsh growers into the higher payment category used in England. Mr Redwood said at the time that the plan was the most equitable possible. But the NFU, which represents growers in both England and Wales, wants the government to start again. It says the two countries should be treated as a single region, with the same payments for all farms. Redistributing the total aid package among English and Welsh farmers would entail a cut of only about 52p a tonne for English producers, says the union. 'The alternative, with the Gatt cuts coming, could be the end of cereal growing for those who are left so far behind,' it said. A government announcement is expected shortly. The farmers suspect Mr Redwood may abandon the plan and return to a simple division between England and Wales. They resent that just as much.</p>

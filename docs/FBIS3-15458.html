He was speaking at a  meeting in Moscow on Saturday sponsored by the former opposition  newspaper, DEN, closed by the government last October.    The meeting was also attended by other released opposition  leaders including Ilya Konstantinov and Stanislav Terekhov as  well as leaders of the Communist and Liberal-Democratic Parties  Gennadiy Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    One former Soviet deputy Mrs Saji Umalatova leading "the  standing presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies of the  USSR" claimed that "many innocent people are still behind bars"  echoed previous calls on opponents to the Yeltsin regime to  close their ranks regardless of difference in views.    For his part, chairman of the executive committee of the  National Salvation Front Ilya Konstantinov who was also involved  in last October's parliamentary revolt said that "our people are  everywhere and biding their time". In his words, the opposition  would "stand tall" again within months.</p>

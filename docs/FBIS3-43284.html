The special adviser to the Angolan Military  High Command, Mr. Kundi Paiama, said however that the army would  respond to any UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] attack against government held areas. The UNITA  movement had earlier warned the government that it would not  return to peace talks this week if the military continued large  scale attacks against its bases.</p>

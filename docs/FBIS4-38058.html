			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian Covenant is to be amended at the  first meeting of the Palestinian Council in Gaza. This was  stated this evening by Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian  negotiator, who was making a rare appearance on an Israel radio  phone-in show. This was what Sha'th had to say in answer to a  listener's question:    [Begin Sha'th recording] We have committed ourselves to the  amendments of the charter. All our existing present  organizations, Executive Committee, and so on, have approved  these amendments, and now we are moving toward holding the  Palestine National Council -- which I hope will be in Gaza -- so  that these amendments will be made. [end recording]    And on the controversial question of the division of  sovereignty and power in Jerusalem, this is how Nabil Sha'th  outlined the Palestinian position:    [Begin Sha'th recording] Well, I think if we are thinking of  long-term peace, real and stable peace, we must be thinking in  terms of equals, and equals means two neighboring states side by  side, and this means, again, sharing Palestine. But it also  means sharing Jerusalem. It's not a question of being naive or  not. I think people are not all yet decided about real peace.  Some people think they can delay the real dividends and price  of peace, and they are getting to learn gradually that this  means real rights for the Palestinians, including the right of  self-determination, which means if we choose a state then we  have a right to live side by side in two states in peace. [end  recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 27 June,  reporting on Sha'th's Israel radio phone-in appearance, adds:  "Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that Yasir 'Arafat has promised Yitzhaq  Rabin to do his best to locate the Israeli POW's and MIA's. To  the best of his knowledge they are located in Lebanon and Syria,  in areas which are not under the PLO's control. Nabil Sha'th  said he is aware of the fact that this issue is traumatic to the  families involved and to the entire Israeli people."    ["Asked why Palestinian industrialists are refusing to  cooperate with their Israeli counterparts, Sha'th said the  autonomy authorities are interested in cooperating with the  Israeli economy, but they do not want to depend on it, because  such a dependency will eventually make things harder for the  Israeli economy as well."]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;What safety methodologies do launch operators currently utilize to assure safe launch operations, and what approaches are available to evaluate these methodologies; <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How should OCST utilize the analyses of Federal ranges in its licensing review process; <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What information must launch license applicants submit to other federal agencies, including federal ranges, that must also be submitted to OCST as part of the license application review? Can OCST utilize that information to avoid duplicative document preparation and submissions by license applicants; and <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What should OCST require with respect to on orbit safety. <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the Regulations were published in 1988, OCST indicated that it would handle commercial launch site proposals on a case-by-case basis while safety studies and research were ongoing. Since 1988, the vast majority of licensing proposals submitted to OCST have been for commercial launches of launch vehicles from a Federal range. However, in light of the growing and intensified interest in operating commercial launch sites, OCST has determined that establishing certainty in the site operator licensing process through rules of general applicability is necessary to facilitate this burgeoning industry. With respect to OCST's approach to reviewing applications for a license to operate a commercial launch site, OCST seeks views concerning such matters as: (1) the scope of launch site operator licenses; (2) risk management techniques that enable license applicants to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety; (3) application information requirements; (4) reliance by license applicants on industry standards; and (5) reliance by license applicants on other Federal safety standards. With respect to site operator license applications, OCST is interested in obtaining views on at least the following: <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How should OCST assess a proposed launch site with respect to geography, meteorology, proximity to population, risk to downrange population, and other characteristics associated with the physical site; <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What process and standards should OCST utilize, including safety methodologies, to assess the capability of a launch site operator to manage safety;  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What is the relationship between a site operator license and its associated safety reviews, and a launch license authorizing a launch from a commercial launch site and its associated safety reviews; <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For launches conducted from a commercial launch site, how should responsibility for safety be allocated between the launch licensee and the site operator; and <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Given that OCST must evaluate flight safety functions, such as flight termination or tracking, to assure the safety of launch operations, how should those functions be addressed by the licensing process when the launch will be conducted from a commercial launch site.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Scope of Financial Responsibility Requirements <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In 1988, Congress amended the Act to require that licensees obtain liability insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility up to a statutory limit of $500,000,000, in order to protect launch participants from third-party claims resulting from activities carried out under a license in connection with a particular launch. Licensees must also obtain liability insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility up to $100,000,000, to compensate the U.S. Government for damage or loss to its property resulting from those activities. Reciprocal waivers of claims are also required whereby each party involved in launch services agrees to be responsible for certain losses it may sustain and losses sustained by its own employees resulting from an activity carried out under the license.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1988 Amendments further provide that, to the extent provided in advance in an appropriation law or authorized by statute, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide for the payment by the U.S. Government of successful third-party claims against a licensee, contractor, subcontractor, or customer of the licensee, or a contractor or subcontractor of a customer, resulting from an activity carried out under a license, to the extent the total amount of claims arising out of any one launch exceeds the amount of third-party liability insurance required of the licensee, up to a total of $1.5 billion above that amount. The U.S. Government bears the risk of government property losses that exceed the level of insurance coverage required of the licensee.  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> OCST prescribes financial responsibility requirements for licensees on a case-by-case basis after analyzing the maximum probable third-party and government property losses associated with proposed licensed activities. Those requirements are imposed on licensees in license orders. Currently, license orders issued by OCST reflect insurance requirements for both launches and launch site operations associated with the conduct of those launches. Concerns have arisen over the extent to which pre-launch activities are intended to be covered by the financial responsibility requirements of the Act, and the Government payment of excess third-party claims provision. Clarification is needed to provide certainty to the industry so that it may manage risks appropriately. <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides guidance on these issues. To the extent the Act provides for payment by the U.S. Government of successful third-party claims in excess of required insurance, it is only available for claims `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> resulting from an activity carried out under the license  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> issued or transferred under [chapter 701] for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> resulting from an activity carried out under the license. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' 49 U.S.C. 70113(a)(1)(emphasis added). Moreover, claims may be paid under this provision of the Act only to the extent the total amount of successful claims  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> related to one launch  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> exceeds the required amount of third-party liability insurance and does not exceed $1.5 billion above that amount. 49 U.S.C. 70113(a)(1)(emphasis added).  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> Licenses are available to authorize the conduct of a launch, as defined in the Act, or the operation of a launch site. Because the U.S. Government payment of excess third-party claims provision is only available for claims resulting from an activity carried out under the license for damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under a license, and because the Act defines launch as ``to place or try to place'' a launch vehicle and any payload in a suborbital trajectory, in Earth orbit in outer space or otherwise in outer space, 49 U.S.C. 70102(3), one interpretation of this language is that, with respect to launches, it only extends to claims resulting from ignition and flight of a launch vehicle. In other words, it may not be available for claims resulting from preparatory activities conducted at the launch site. Alternatively, some preparatory activities may reasonably be considered integral to the launch itself or part of the launch process. OCST seeks industry views on what those activities are and why they may fall within the statutory definition of a ``launch.''  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCST plans to adopt specific criteria for determining when an activity would be considered part of a launch for purposes of imposing financial responsibility requirements and to determine when U.S. Government payment of excess third-party claims may be available. OCST also seeks industry views on how the U.S. Government payment of excess third-party claims provision applies to licensed site operators, if at all. Diverse points of view exist regarding these issues, and OCST seeks information regarding the basis for each point of view as well as recommendations as to which should be adopted. <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

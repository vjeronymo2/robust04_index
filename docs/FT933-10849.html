			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Managers sceptical on training targets GOVERNMENT-BACKED tar-gets for improving workers' skills are unlikely to be achieved, a study published today by the Industrial Society shows. A survey of 620 personnel and training managers found that a large majority were sceptical of seven of the eight principal targets. The targets, launched by the Confederation of British Industry and other organisations in 1991, were intended to increase the number of staff receiving training and vocational qualifications by the end of the decade. But there was only one target - training for all employees to be the norm by 1996 - over which managers who were optimistic of success outnumbered those who were pessimistic. Ms Rhiannon Chapman, society director, said: 'There is a clear warning to ministers and others that without more support and publicity this initiative is going to fail - leaving Britain even further behind our competitors on skills.' The level of basic pay rises across the economy has continued on a downward trend, according to provisional figures published today by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research company. It said that in the three months to June, settlements fell to 2 per cent compared with 2.3 per cent in the three months to May.</p>

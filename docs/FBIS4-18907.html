			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Two planes carrying a total of near 400 refugees  from Rwanda landed at Zaventem airport near Brussels this  morning. The refugees, most of them Belgian nationals, had first  been airlifted in Army planes from Kigali to Nairobi in Kenya.  The refugees were immediately transferred to the military  hospital at Neder Over Heembeek near Zaventem.    The passengers of the first aircraft, which landed at 0230,  were welcomed by King Albert, Queen Paula, and Foreign Minister  Willy Claes.    Many refugees had tales of horror to tell and were shocked  by  what they had seen. This physician had waited in relative  security in a hotel until he was evacuated by the troops.    [Begin unidentified refugee recording] What I saw myself? At  first we heard the shooting, and the hotel itself was hit by the  bullets. And the last day when we started, I saw a van full  with bodies, dead bodies that they were going to put in a  garden, I suppose to make a hole. [end recording]    A third flight from Nairobi carrying 400 refugees is  scheduled to land at Brussels at 1445 local time. They too will  be met by the king and queen. [passage omitted]    The Belgian Red Cross has airlifted 20 tonnes of medical  equipment and medicines to Rwanda. The Boeing 707 flew to  Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, from which the goods will be  transported to Kigali in a convoy of cars and trucks. The  operation is partly funded by the Belgian Development  Cooperation Department.    A total of more than 600 Belgians have now been evacuated  from Kigali. Today the Belgian paracommandos will try to bring  the remaining few hundred Belgians to safety. [passage omitted]</p>

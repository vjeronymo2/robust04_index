			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CB: "European Parliament Is Unhappy About </F> Enlargement Negotiations"]    [Text] Strasbourg -- The European Parliament is unhappy  about the way the enlargement negotiations are being held with  Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. The Parliament feels that  little or no account is being taken of its wish for  institutional changes to allow a Union with 16 member states to  function smoothly. Various speakers warned the Council of  Ministers, which is leading the negotiations, that it was  playing with fire by neglecting Parliament's complaints. They  were referring to the Parliament's power to prevent enlargement.    Fernand Herman (PSC) [Social Christian Party] best summed up  the feelings of many MEP's [members of the European Parliament]  when he said that it was not a question of being for or against  the four countries. "On the contrary, in the entire Parliament  there is probably nobody against the membership of new member  states," he said. "The question is just whether the new members  are joining under conditions which would allow the Union to act  as effectively as it does at present."    Many MEP's are convinced that a purely mechanical  modification of the institutional rules, with every new member  state getting a commissioner, some seats in Parliament and  (weighted) voting rights in the Council, would be inadequate and  only increase the chances of deadlock. But so far the Council  has taken no account of Parliament's concerns, which have been  aired on past occasions, and yesterday that put many MEP's in a  touchy mood.    In his reaction the Greek Council President Theodoros  Pangalos pointed out that the negotiations had taken place on  the basis of the Maastricht Treaty right from the beginning. "A  treaty change does not take place during negotiations on  enlargement, but at a special conference of the governments of  the member states called together for that purpose," Pangalos  said. In reality the Parliament realizes that. But, in  exchange for its agreement to enlargement, it wants to win  guarantees on the working methods of the 1996 conference on  treaty changes, and participation in it. Following the  Maastricht Treaty, the Parliament still has no decisive voice in  treaty changes.    Not much was revealed about the progress of the enlargement  negotiations yesterday. Commissioner Hans van den Broek let it  be known that he doubted whether the negotiations with the four  countries could be completed by 1 March. The agricultural issue  was becoming hard work, van den Broek said, and at the end of  the negotiations budget contributions must be discussed. He  said he could not guarantee all four countries would make a net  contribution to the European budget, which the present member  states had originally hoped for.</p>

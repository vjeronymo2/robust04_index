			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Havana, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina reported today that the more than 150  Cubans who have occupied the German, Belgian, and Chilean  diplomatic missions over the past month have asked to travel to  the United States.    The occupants, of which only 73 remain in the Belgian  ambassador's residence and 21 in the German Embassy,  discontinued their efforts to travel to the countries whose  missions they invaded, the Cuban foreign minister asserted.    Robaina told almost 200 U.S. citizens, who came to Cuba as  part of a campaign to challenge the Washington government's  prohibition against U.S. citizens' travel to the island, about  the occupation of diplomatic missions. He said the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana has denied 40,000 visas to Cubans  who had their documents in order and wanted to visit the United  States this year.    "We could add the almost 150 Cubans in the embassies to  those  40,000 because they would not have acted by force if they knew  they would achieve their objective through regular mechanisms,"  Robaina said.    Cuba and the United States have a valid immigration  agreement, which was signed in 1987. The agreement stipulates  that Washington will grant up to 20,000 entry visas to Cuban  citizens every year. In reality, however, it only grants  approximately 1,500 every year.    Robaina confirmed the Cuban Government's position that it  will not authorize the people who occupied foreign missions by  force to leave the country. [passage omitted]</p>

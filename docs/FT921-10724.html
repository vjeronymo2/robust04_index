			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Japanese premier apologises over disparaging remark MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday apologised for the 'misunderstanding' he caused by a disparaging reference to the 'work ethic' of Americans. Mr Miyazawa's apology was intended to undo the damage done by remarks he made before the Japanese Diet on Tuesday which were later condemned by the White House in Washington as 'not helpful'. The verbal exchanges between Tokyo and Washington highlight the increase in bilateral tensions since US President George Bush visited Japan last month. Mr Miyazawa said on Monday he had felt for a long time Americans 'may have lacked the work ethic'. So many university graduates had gone into Wall Street that the number of engineers had declined. He added: 'I think a similar case was found in Japan's bubble (economy). It is important to have the sweat on one's brow to produce added value.' Yesterday the prime minister said he had intended to criticise an over-emphasis on speculative financial activities in Japan as well as the US, and not to criticise Americans. The ministry of foreign affairs added that the phrase 'work ethic' meant 'philosophy of work'. The elaborate explanations indicate how sensitive Japanese officials are about antagonising the US. They are concerned that, with a presidential election campaign about to start in the US, Japan could come under severe political attacks. Japanese politicians have periodically criticised the US, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes not. Most recently Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the speaker of the lower house of the Japanese Diet, said US workers could not understand written instructions because 30 per cent were illiterate. Mr Sohei Miyashita, defence minister, said yesterday his ministry would cut Y100bn (Pounds 450m) from its current five-year budget to help compensate for Gulf war contributions, Reuter adds. Japan gave Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) to US-led coalition forces fighting the Gulf war last year. Opposition parties had demanded a cut in the defence budget as part of a parliamentary deal on the Gulf war funds. The Defence Ministry has earmarked Y22,750bn for defence in the current five year programme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] The State Duma will resume its sittings  on Thursday 13 January. Today, the pickets at the building of  the State Duma expressed their liking for the deputies.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Aleksandr Lutskoy] About  100  supporters of the idea of communism and the restoration of the  Soviet Union, under red banners and singing revolutionary songs  to the accompaniment of accordions, gathered this morning near  the building of the State Duma. The pickets chanted  antigovernment and antipresidential slogans and expressed  fervent approval of the communist deputies.    The latter, in turn, expressed gratitude for the support.    [Lutskoy, addressing Communist Deputy R. Gostev] You  represent the Communists.    [Gostev] Yes.    [Lutskoy] What is your attitude toward the government? The  present one?    [Gostev] It is a critical one.    [Lutskoy] Do you think we need a consolidation of all powers  at present, both of the executive and the legislative powers?    [Gostev] Yes, certainly.    [Lutskoy] But if your attitude is a critical one what do you  think should be done in respect of the present government?    [Gostev] We have a lot of questions for the government, and  it is possible that finally a question on the resignation of the  government will be raised.    [Lutskoy] Your attitude toward the LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia]?    [Gostev] I think that one should regard the LDPR as a party  that exists. But I think that to say that this is a party of  fascists, etc, I believe that is wrong. LDPR reflects..., with  the stand that Zhirinovskiy has put forward he has managed to  strike a chord with people.    [Lutskoy] The communist deputies, having talked to the  gathering, went off to work in the Duma, while the pickets  continued rallying.

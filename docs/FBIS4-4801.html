			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Perfidy Condemned Abroad"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Public organizations of  different countries expressed support to the March 21 statement  of a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman which denounced the  perfidious act of the United States in totally reversing the  agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of  the DPRK said in a statement March 24 that the United States  will be unable to evade the blame for the aborted third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks.    The statement said:    The United States announced to the world a suspension of the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and the date of the third  round of DPRK-U.S. talks, but has taken no step to put them into  practice. On the contrary, it has committed a brigandish and  brazen act of urging Korea unilaterally to implement the  agreement.    The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  must know clearly that hostility against Korea is an act of  provocation against mankind.    If the United States dare provoke Korea, it will suffer a  more ignominious defeat than in the 1950s.    The Rwandan Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea and  the Rwandan Committee for Support to Korea's Reunification, in a  joint statement March 22, charged that the United States  invented the "nuclear issue" and has premeditatedly raised it in  the international arena in an attempt to isolate and stifle  socialist Korea.    The statement demanded an immediate halt to its acts of  mocking at the sovereignty of Korea.    The Society for the Study of the Chuche Idea of the  University of Madagascar, the Madagascan National Committee for  the study of the Chuche Idea, the Madagascan Institute for the  Study of Chuche-based Idea on Literature and Art and the Society  for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Journalists of Madagascar in  a joint statement March 22 expressed full support and solidarity  for the Korean people's just struggle to defend the dignity of  the nation and security of the country.    The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement March  23 strongly demanded that the United States think matters over  and solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a  peaceful way through dialogue in accordance with the spirit of  the February 25 DPRK-USA New York agreement.</p>

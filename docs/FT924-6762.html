			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool This week at last brought a definite firming in Australian wool values. The AWC market indicator rose 12 cents to 514c/kg on November 17, and a further 6 cents on November 18. Clearances were very good, around 95pc of the offering. Buying interest is led by Japan and China, and although the rise only covers part of the ground lost this season, it does represent a clearer upturn than anything experienced for many weeks. At this stage of the season some recovery is not unprecedented. This raises cautious hopes that the decline may have been halted.</p>

Pyongyang did not give the IAEA a green light to resume  inspection of its declared nuclear sites, agency spokesman Hans  Meyer said.    In the three-hour contact at IAEA headquarters, the North  Koreans conveyed their position and opinions in detail on IAEA  inspection while IAEA officials explained details of the demands  for inspection, he said, but did not make any further comment.    The IAEA team was led by operations director Demetrius  Pericos and three diplomats from the North Korean Embassy in  Vienna were headed by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor.    "I made the proposal enough to secure the continuity of  nuclear safeguards," Yun said after the contact. "Next time,  it's the IAEA's turn to answer, and the consultations will  continue."    He declined, however, to comment on whether Pyongyang will  allow inspection of its radiochemical laboratory and a  5-megawatt reactor.    "You will get the information little by little," he said.    The North Koreans rejected the IAEA's demand for extraction  of samples from the radiochemical laboratory and reactor while  the IAEA people demanded that Pyongyang allow full-fledged  inspection according to nuclear safeguards regulations, an IAEA  source said. North Korea answered the requirements set by the  IAEA at the second contact, Dec. 10, and the discussion focused  on narrowing differences.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: Export trade is life's blood of pig co-op - How Gatt has affected Danish Crown, the country's largest pork company Danish Crown, Denmark's largest pork company, has already started to feel the effects of the latest General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. This year, the company has exported significant quantities of meat to Korea for the first time in its history. 'It surprised us - we didn't expect it to happen so quickly,' says Mr Kjeld Johannesen, company president. 'Korea was a closed market for us.' European exports of pork - mainly frozen belly and collar - reached around 6,000 tonnes in the first quarter - with Denmark providing the lion's share. Mr Johannesen believes sales to Korea could increase to as much as 20,000 tonnes by the end of the year. The opening up of new markets overseas is of vital interest to this huge pig co-operative since the export trade is its life's blood. In the 1992-1993 financial year to the end of October, 85 per cent of Danish Crown's DKr9.2bn turnover came from its export business and a third of sales were made outside the European Union. Its overseas sales make up 12 per cent of all Denmark's agricultural exports. 'In general, the export market is a question of survival for Denmark because we produce many times our own needs,' says Mr Johannesen. One of the strength's of Danish Crown's marketing efforts overseas is its strong focus on quality products. 'The consumer's focus on food safety is very important and that's why we like to control production from breeding to the end-user,' he stresses. Danish Crown is able to exert an influence on pig production through its co-operative set-up. The company has 15,000 farmers as members, all of whom receive a share in profits at the end of the year. Farmers also shape company policy by electing representatives to an advisory committee which comprises 225 producers and 22 staff. That committee elects 12 members to the Danish Crown board of directors. The co-operative set-up commands considerable loyalty from farmers who see it carving a market for their produce in a way that would be impossible for individual producers. While some farmers are tempted to sell to private operators as these often offer a higher price, they must leave the co-operative to do so. 'If someone is selling privately while still in the co-operative, he is spoiling the company for a quick profit and I will make him stop or he must leave,' says Mr Niels Rovsing, a pig farmer who is a representative on the Danish Crown board. Farmers are currently feeling the pinch from low pig prices in Denmark, where as in the UK, pork profits are depressed by overcapacity. Pig prices fell from DKr13.40 per kg two years ago to DKr8.60 per kg in January to March this year, pushing some producers out of business. 'It has been very tough,' said Mr Rovsing, who estimates that about one pig farmer in 20 went out of business. Prices are creeping back again now with the onset of the barbecue season and the market has reached DKr9.80 a kg. But Mr Rovsing stresses that, even though prices are low, at least farmers have a steady outlet for their pigs which the co-operative must always take even if it sees little demand. The decline in pig prices across Europe, which produces around 5 per cent more animals than it consumes, highlights the importance of Danish Crown's export sales outside the EU. The company delivers 11 per cent of its export sales to the Japanese market, but the high value of those sales means Japan represents 21 per cent of the value of its exports. Those lucrative markets could be threatened by expansion of the US pig herd, however, and increasing competition resulting from the Gatt deal. 'It is very important that we are aware of very tight competition from the US,' says Mr Johannesen. Danish Crown's biggest markets still remain within the EU with Germany overtaking the UK for the first time last year as the most important destination. Germany took 16 per cent of the company's exports last year with 13 per cent going to Britain. Denmark's efforts to market its agricultural products overseas have been very successful, aided by the homogenous domestic set-up which sees large co-operatives controlling most of the output. Danish Crown is part of a larger pork co-operative which sets prices to farmers and produces a joint marketing campaign. The Dansk Slagterie, to which Danish Crown belongs, is made up of five smaller co-operatives which between them slaughter 96 per cent of the nation's pigs. Danish Crown uses its high standards of production and the quality of its meat to differentiate itself from run-of-mill producers in other countries. This gives it a particularly important edge in the Japanese and Asian market. The company has over 100 veterinary inspectors who regularly check on farmers' pig herds. It insists that regular disease checks are made on pigs and that all feed is tested for salmonella before the animals eat it. 'The co-operative makes it easy to influence in a short time what is being produced by the farmer,' says Mr Johannesen. Along with the demand from consumers for 'clean' products and calls for free-range pigs, particularly from the UK market, Mr Johannesen sees a move towards more old-fashioned products with a traditional taste. Danish Crown has worked with some supermarkets to produce the Mester Porker range of pigs which have slightly more fat than today's lean animals; they are larger and are hung for longer to give them more flavour. At the opposite end of the scale, Danish Crown has introduced its Green Butcher range of meats and salad products which contain less than 3 per cent fat. This range currently represents 2 per cent of sales in Denmark and is sold overseas on a franchise basis. The company has recently run a large advertising campaign for the products in the hope that it will capture 5 per cent of the market. It is now working on a fat-reduced salami, since salami products are widely eaten in Denmark. Formed four years ago when three co-operatives banded together, Danish Crown has managed to cut its costs by 10 to 15 per cent in the past two years. The company sees a tough period ahead with increasing competition in markets outside Europe from the US. 'It is important for us to stay in front on standards and keep in touch with our customers' demands,' says Mr Johannesen. 'That's how we will compete.'  --------------------------------------------------------                  DANISH MERCHANDISE EXPORTS                   1992 figures in DKr bn  -------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture*                                      40.9    of which to non-EU countries                   16.7 Meat                                              23.3    of which, pigmeat                              16.7 Dairy products                                     7.4    of which, cheese                                4.5 CAP restitution payments                           5.4 Total                                            246.0  -------------------------------------------------------- *Excluding CAP restitution payments  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: Agricultural Council, Copenhagen  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

Gavrilov; Kazan Chemical Engineering Institute, 420015;  UDC 579.26:579.6.663]    [Text] The operation of existing and  the construction of new equipment for producing microbial  synthesis products is currently giving rise to sharp social  protest in connection with environmental contamination by  microorganism cells in the gas emissions of these industries  that cause acute respiratory diseases in humans.    The specifics of producing the majority of microbial  synthesis products, including the production of feed proteins,  involve the fact that during their growth process,  microorganisms utilize oxygen, the source of which is, as a  rule, air, which is released to the atmosphere after it has  passed through the reactor.    The traditional scheme for producing microbial synthesis  products includes a bioreactor (fermenter), air processing  equipment, and equipment for purifiying the gas exiting the  reactor.    Air processing equipment is intended for purifying gas of  solid and harmful gaseous contaminants, compressing and  condensing air, separating condensed moisture, and sterilization.    Equipment for purifying gas exiting the reactor is intended  for trapping aerosols. As a rule, wet or dry filters are used  for this. However, wet filters have a low purification  effectiveness, and dry fabric filters, while they are relatively  highly effective, have a high hydraulic resistance and require  frequent regeneration or filter element changes, which makes it  impossible to maintain sterility in the production space.    Due to the large volume of air that passes through the  reactor per unit time (5000 - 3 m[.sup]3[/]/hr), which  results in a low level of oxygen removal from the air (no  greater than 15%), and the need to mix the liquid medium,  equipment for processing and purifying air is significantly  large.    In such a manner, the creation of ecologically pure  technology allows one to overcome problems that have arisen and  to give new momentum to the development of microbial synthesis.    The basic principle of creating ecological pure technologies  lies in organizing a closed cycle, which is accomplished by  capturing the carbon dioxide evolved in the reactor by means of  sorption methods and returning the purfied gas to the reactor  after adding the required amount of oxygen to it.    In this case, total oxygen utilization is achieved, whereas  in a traditional apparatus, losses of oxygenated air are  unavoidable, which leads to high air and energy consumption. The  absorption of carbon dioxide from spent gas can be accomplished  by chemical or physical sorption. In this case, the need for  equipment to process air and biologically purify it after exit  from the reactor drops.    A diagram of the equipment that carry out an ecologically  pure method for producing microbial synthesis products with the  application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gas  after its use in the reactor is presented in fig. 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-95A>           Fig. 1. Diagram of equipment with the application of chemical sorption of carbon dioxide. </FIG>       Such a method for organizing the purification of spent gas  leads to additional costs associated with chemisorbent  consumption and the need to reprocess or neutralize reaction  products.    Organization of the closed cycle with the application of  physical sorption of carbon dioxide assumes regeneration of the  absorber (monoethanolamine) and generation of carbon dioxide,  which is widely used in various industrial sectors. A diagram of  equipment intended for producing microbial synthesis products  with physical sorption of carbon dioxide from the gaseous  mixture is presented in fig. 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-95B>           Fig. 2. Diagram of equipment with application of physical absorption of carbon dioxide by </FIG>          Regardless of the apparent prospects of technology for  producing microbial synthesis products by organizing a closed  gas cycle based on chemical or physical sorption of carbon  dioxide, additional expenditures will be required with its  implementation that are associated with creating equipment for  producing pure oxygen and with the need to regenerate the  sorbent or to utilize products formed as a result of chemical  sorption of carbon dioxide.    Therefore, there is definite interest in a combined method  where microorganisms that utilize oxygen and give off carbon  dioxide in their life processes are cultured with microorganisms  that utilize carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. For example,  combined culturing of Candida scottii yeast and  chlorella, whose biomass may be used as a feed additive, has  been conducted. A diagram of equipment for combined production  of C. scotii yeast and chlorella is presented in fig.  3.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-96A>           Fig. 3. Diagram of equipment for combined production of microbial synthesis and chlorella </FIG>          Such a method allows one to organize ecologically pure and  absolutely waste-free production of microbial synthesis products  with a significant reduction in the equipment required for this  task, as well as in capital and operational expenditures.    The achievement of ecologically pure methods of conducting  microbial synthesis assumes the use of high-efficiency reactors  capable of processing highly concentrated nutrient media with  low air (gas) and energy consumption.

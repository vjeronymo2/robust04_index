			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SHOT DOWN OWN JET IN 1960 U-2 INCIDENT  </P> <P> The Soviet army newspaper Red Star disclosed for the first time Sunday that  when the Soviets downed Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane 30 years ago, they  also destroyed one of their own fighters that was pursuing the American plane.  </P> <P> The U-2 was downed on May 1, 1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in  Paris between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S.  Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned for later  that year.  </P> <P> Red Star also disclosed for the first time that the Soviets had sent up a new  fighter plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 on a suicide mission. The  new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but failed to find it.  </P> <P> Soviets hurrying to the May Day parade in the Ural Mountain city of Sverdlovsk  saw what appeared to be fireworks high in the air, said the article, signed by  a Col. A. Dokuchayev.  </P> <P> The fiery debris was not fireworks but a Soviet MIG-19 that was hit by the same  type of missile that exploded behind Power's U-2 and damaged it, Red Star said  in the most detailed version of the Soviet military action.  </P> <P> Powers' mission began in Pakistan and was to have carried him over Sverdlovsk  for a landing in Norway.  </P> <P> He used neither the automatic destruction device nor a poison pin he had been  given in case the mission failed, and he was captured at a collective farm near  Sverdlovsk. He was held for three years, then exchanged for the Soviet spy  Rudolf Abel.  </P> <P> The Soviet article disclosed for the first time that the Soviets ordered a new  Sukhoi 9 fighter, which was unarmed, to pursue the U-2, which operated at about  70,000 feet, in an attempt to ram it.  </P> <P> The Soviets also scrambled two MIG-19s, which were not capable of flying that  high. The pilot of one MIG-19, Boris Ivazyan, reported to ground control that  the debris from the U-2 was actually that from a missile that had missed the  U-2, prompting the ground battery to fire another.  </P> <P> The next Soviet missile struck the MIG-19 flown by Sergei Safronov, 30, who was  killed.  </P> <P> Ivazyan survived and later married Safronov's widow.  </P> <P> Powers died in August, 1977, when his Los Angeles traffic helicopter --  apparently out of fuel -- crashed in Encino.  </P></p>

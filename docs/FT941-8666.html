			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank Once again, the Bundesbank has shown a capacity to surprise. Having failed to cut the discount rate at its meeting two weeks ago, it duly lopped half a point off the rate yesterday although not much, at least domestically, has changed in between. The trend in consumer prices and the weakness of the economy certainly justify lower rates, but January money supply growth will again be well outside the target range and the outcome of the metal workers' pay negotiations remains uncertain. The big difference is that the US tightening, which the Bundesbank must have expected two weeks ago, has been and gone without any serious disruption to the exchange markets. Indeed, at just below DM1.73, the dollar is a pfennig weaker than it was two weeks ago. The Bundesbank's move could thus be taken as confirmation that tighter US money need not impede European rate cuts. But in cutting its discount rate, the Bundesbank has simply created room to edge down its securities repurchase rate which actually sets the tone for the money markets. The repurchase rate was left unchanged at 6 per cent, indicating that the Bundesbank intends to use its newly-created headroom cautiously. Perhaps more important, the excitement in bond markets around Europe was short-lived. They fell back after the New York market had second thoughts about the latest US inflation figures. The exchange market may have regained its composure, but even the prospect of lower short-term rates is not enough, it seems, to allow European bond markets to decouple from the transatlantic trend. Unless that happens, the Bundesbank may become still more cautious about the speed with which it allows money market rates to fall.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WRONG BOLTS CITED IN AIR MISHAP  </P> <P> The use of improper bolts probably caused a cockpit windshield to blow out of a  British Airways plane at 23,000 feet during the weekend, almost sucking the  pilot out of the aircraft, officials said today.  </P> <P> "Investigators have determined that of the 90 bolts used to retain the  windscreen, 84 were of an incorrect size for the captive nuts into which they  were installed," a Civil Aviation Authority official said.  </P> <P> "This explains the windscreen's blowing out when exposed to the cabin pressure  during the climb."  </P> <P> Officials reported the incorrect bolts were 1.5 inches in diameter, 1/32 of an  inch smaller than they should have been.  </P> <P> British Airways said it has suspended the engineer responsible for fitting the  bolts, pending completion of the inquiry by government investigators.  </P></p>

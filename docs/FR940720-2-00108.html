			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased nor decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these changes do not contribute to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment malfunction. Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its operation, and thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect plant equipment or operation. Safety limits and limiting safety system settings are not affected by these proposed changes. Extending the time the Spray Additive System may be out of service from 48 hours to 72 hours and removing the requirement to have a spray pump suction flow path from the additive tank for a spray train to be operable is consistent with STS. The STS only require that the spray system be capable of taking suction from the refueling water storage tank and the containment sump.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Containment Spray System would still be available and would remove some iodine from the containment atmosphere in the event of a Design Basis Accident. The 72 hour completion time takes into account the Containment Spray System redundant flow path capabilities and the low probability of the worst case Design Basis Accident occurring during this period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> University of Wisconsin Library Learning Center, 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bradley D.

Box 1497, Madison, Wisconsin 53701&hyph;1497.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> John N.

The basis for Section 15.3.2 and applicable surveillances in Table 15.4.1&hyph;2 would also be revised to support the above changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, political editor, PA News] </F>   [Text] Ex-shadow cabinet minister Bryan Gould today warned  Labour that it might rue the day if it continued with a "safety  first" policy and allowed the Tories to get their act together  before the general election.    Mr. Gould, who last night resigned as an MP, told the party  that if people started to think more kindly of the Tories again  then Labour's huge opinion poll lead would "fade away pretty  quickly."    He was unsure if any of the likely contenders for the Labour  leadership would try to put the party on the more radical and  positive course that he would have wanted.    Mr Gould did not think it was a foregone conclusion that  shadow home secretary Tony Blair would emerge the winner.    "He is the front runner, justifiably. He is seen as the most  voter-friendly of all the candidates.    "But it is inevitable that as the contest is joined he will  come more in the spotlight and that some of the doubts which  inevitably must exist with all the candidates in different ways  will arise in his case.    "He is young and inexperienced. My view is that he has the  qualities to overcome these problems, if problems they are,  pretty rapidly once he comes into office," Mr Gould told the BBC  Radio 4's Today programme.    Mr Gould believed Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry  secretary, was the most able of all the contenders.    "In the end, I fear that Robin might not quite make it  because of a rather unfair perception that he is not  `voter-friendly,'" Mr Gould added.    Meanwhile, Labour has accused the Liberal Democrats of  breaking the campaigning truce which it was hoped the three main  parties would observe until after John Smith's funeral on Friday.    The Liberal Democrats were holding a news conference today  to  launch their campaign for the Eastleigh by-election, to be held  on June 9 -- the same date as the Euro-elections.    A spokesman for Labour said: "We are dismayed by this  decision." But a spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats said she  did not think this breached any arrangement. Matthew Taylor,  the party's election campaign coordinator, was speaking at the  news conference in support of their candidate, David Chidgey.</p>

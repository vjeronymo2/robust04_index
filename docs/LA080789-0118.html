			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BRONCOS' CASTILLE ENDS HOLDOUT  </P> <P> Former Denver Bronco starting cornerback Jeremiah Castille signed a series of  one-year contracts, ending a three-month holdout during which he refused to  speak to Coach Dan Reeves.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not released, but it was reported that Castille will  get the same pay as last year, $275,000.  </P> <P> Castille's holdout began when the Broncos left him unprotected under terms of  the NFL's Plan B free-agency system. He demanded to be traded, boycotted an  off-season mini-camp and refused to report to camp two weeks ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / South Africa moves to improve black education South Africa's main industries and political, community and education organisations launched a multi-million dollar drive yesterday to improve the quality of the country's crisis-ridden black education, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Signatories of the R500m (Pounds 106m) trust fund said it was founded following concern among certain industries about the education crisis and the widening gap between schooling and requirements of the workplace. The state is estimated to spend five times more on each white child than on each black. Trustees will meet at the end of February to develop criteria for allocating funds to community organisations. Signatories include Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party, various banks, Barlow Rand Ltd, Anglo American, Caltex and Allied Electronics Corp Ltd.</p>

He said Natal was a "difficult  province" but "in the weeks to come we will deal with the  volatile and explosive situation".    "We will definitely talk about making wider use of the  SADF,"  Mr de Klerk said.    Mr de Klerk said he on Thursday morning received morning  updated intelligence reports and contingency plans for Natal,  and would be given a full run-down on Thursday afternoon. "The  government is willing and able to ensure that law and order is  effectively maintained." He said the solution lay in continued  successful negotiations.    On the controversy surrounding his laying of the foundation  stone at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Phoenix earlier in  the day, Mr de Klerk reiterated he had acted as the head of  state. He chastised the Democratic Party Natal Chairman Mike  Ellis for suggesting his visit was an electioneering strategy.    He said he was performing a "pleasant" duty as the leader of  the government. "I don't need them to teach me good manners,"  said Mr de Klerk.    He also criticised the Transitional Executive Council for  "poking their nose" into his public duties. He said they should  rather concentrate their efforts on stopping intimidation. "This  is beyond my understanding," Mr de Klerk commented.</p>

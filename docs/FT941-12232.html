			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Norway's bank chief faces new inquiry An official investigation was launched yesterday into two companies linked to Mr Torstein Moland, Norway's newly-installed central bank governor, who has come under pressure to resign over allegations of tax irregularities linmked to a share deal. Mr Moland, who took office at the beginning of January, said he welcomed the inquiry by Okokrim, a body which deals with economic and environmental crime, which he said was necessary to 'get the truth on the table'. He denies any wrongdoing. The country's three leading newspapers and the small Socialist Left party have called for Mr Moland to resign. They argue that his authority at the Bank of Norway was undermined by allegations of tax regulation violations in the sale of his share in Airbus A320, a limited partnership used to finance aircraft purchases, to Ostlandske Stenexport, a subsidiary of Christiania Bank, where Mr Moland was a member of the board.</p>

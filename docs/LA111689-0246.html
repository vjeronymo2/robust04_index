			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HERZOG PITCHES TO GET TUDOR BACK TO ST. LOUIS  </P> <P> Free agent left-hander John Tudor may become a member of the St. Louis  Cardinals pitching staff again, if Manager Whitey Herzog gets his wish.  </P> <P> "I'd take him right away," Herzog said of Tudor, who pitched in just six games  for the Dodgers last season after having off-season surgery on his left  shoulder, elbow and knee.  </P> <P> "You look at our situation, and we've got a lot of question marks. Not that  John wouldn't be a question mark, but if he says he can pitch, he can pitch."  </P> <P> Tudor, 36, was a mainstay on the Cardinals' National League championship teams  in 1985 and 1987 and compiled a 50-22 record in three-plus seasons before being  traded to the Dodgers for first baseman Pedro Guerrero in August, 1988. He is  said to be considering the Red Sox, because he lives in Boston, and the  Cardinals.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel Books: Tall tales from the yurts of subterfuge - Why travel writers are economical with the truth TRAVELLERS tell such lies. Out on the grasslands, at the border between inner and outer Mongolia, I was introduced to my first nomad yurt. Under its cosy felt roof I enjoyed an unbelievably disgusting and drunken lunch of mao tai, millet seed, mare's milk, ewe's butter, camel curd and boiled dissected sheep. I thought I was in paradise. But did I confess that I had shared my meal with a party of Hong Kong Chinese tourists, that my host the herdsman was a trusty of the local Communist Party, and that the yurt had been erected just for the day? I did not. Years before, visiting Tashkent, I took photographs of smiling Uzbeks in lambswool caps selling their colourful wares in the peasant market. That night I watched a cabaret in which pale Slav girls in fishnet tights and toppers danced under strobe lights. Did I keep quiet about it? I did. Travellers omit any fact that interferes with their prestige or tarnishes the fantasy that binds the narrator to his audience. The humblest tourist is economical with the truth. He writes fibs on his postcards home. His snapshots dutifully reflect the brilliant scenes - beaches, mountains, castles, ruins - of the holiday brochure that sent him abroad in the first place. He is forced into elaborate subterfuges like the great Kurosawa, the Japanese epic film-maker whose lens could not stray above roof height for fear of catching the telephone lines strung across his mediaeval battleground. In some quarters, even Marco Polo is still accused of inventing his 17-year sojourn at the court of Kublai Khan in Peking. His revelation that the Chinese kept themselves warm by burning black stones was, however, vindicated when coal made its appearance in Italy. Why do travellers lie? Because they pine for an exotic primitive world which, in all but the remotest regions, has passed away and survives only in the minds of freeloading travel-writers, coffee-table cameramen and television scriptwriters. This is the fantasy the tour operator sells: you won't find photographs of the Everest climbers' garbage dump in his Himalayan travel pack, nor of Nepalese mountain tracks decorated with scraps of lavatory paper left by previous trekkers. We all have our travel fantasies, of course. Mine, like I do not know how many thousand of others', began at the age of eight while reading Heinrich Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet. Later, John Buchan's Greenmantle took me, along with the impossibly daring Sandy Arbuthnot, behind the mysterious shutters of the Turkish bazaar. But it was China and Central Asia that took the greatest hold. A beautiful godmother who lived in the Peking embassy and dined with Chairman Mao sent me a set of green china horses and figures of sages and peasant fishermen. Sir Fitzroy Maclean pushed the window further open by travelling the Turkish railway and writing about it in Eastern Approaches. I learned Buddhist prostration techniques from Henning Haslund's Men and Gods in Mongolia and followed the extraordinary missionary ladies Mildred Cable and Francesca and Eva French on their wagon train through the Gobi. But it was Peter Fleming, crossing the Taklamakan desert with Ella Maillart in One's Company, who finally did for me. For nearly 20 years I nursed my complaint before the opportunity arose to scratch my Central Asian itch. Disillusionment followed hard on the heels of wonder. Yet there were rewards: among them, encounters with the Living Buddha of Huhehot and the sole surviving imam of Ashkhabad, a solitary view of the devastated Tangut necropolis in the desert of Ningxia, a scramble over the mound that was the Parthian capital of Nissa, and a day (secured only after a week's badgering of a forked-tongue Soviet commissar) in the withered mudbrick remains of Merv, razed by the Mongols in the early 13th century. The only travel writers for me are the ones who are not afraid to paint the whole picture - telephone wires and all. Peter Fleming, inventor of the witty anti-travel book with Brazilian Adventure, ranks among the very best. He has his heirs. One, although of a more cynical turn, is Paul Theroux. Another (with whom I have travelled myself) is Andro Linklater: his Wild People of the Sarawak longhouse were religious animists who wore 'I love New York' T-shirts. I would trust almost any title from the house of John Murray, publishers of Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle and of Patrick Leigh Fermor and the late Freya Stark. Their latest comes with the reliable name of Hopkirk on the cover. It is A Traveller's Companion to Central Asia by Kathleen Hopkirk, wife of Peter whose Foreign Devils on the Silk Road and The Great Game are compulsory. Hopkirk (to whom I owe the reminder of Marco Polo's impugned veracity) acknowledges a debt to Sir Fitzroy Maclean and has raided her husband's library to produce a short alphabetical history of the best bits of the old Silk Road. She covers Ashkhabad, Bokhara, Geok-Tepe (where the Tekke Turcomans were slaughtered by the Tsar's army), Gilgit and Hunza, Kashgar (including a delightful portrait of the first British residency), Khiva, Merv, Samarkand, Tashkent, Tunhuang, Turfan and Urumchi. Her book is undoubtedly as reliable as anything extant on Central Asia. For the addict, of course, it is one more dangerous dose, a tickle for itchy feet, an invitation to seek fresh surprises in central Asia following the collapse of the Pax Sovietica. A Traveller's Companion to Central Asia, by Kathleen Hopkirk; John Murray, Pounds 16.99. 290 pages.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / British Coal proposes measures to save 13 pits BRITISH COAL urged the government yesterday to adopt plans aimed at saving 13 threatened pits and 8,000 jobs and to change the law to enable it to adapt working patterns and significantly increase pit efficiency. The proposals were attacked by unions, which said saving fewer than half of the 31 pits earmarked for closure was not enough, especially as British Coal envisages that seven of the 'saved' pits and 6,000 of the saved jobs would go within five years anyway. The National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods pit deputies union also oppose law changes by which British Coal could introduce 24-hour working, seven days a week. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, said in Sheffield yesterday: 'This latest statement by British Coal displays further incompetence and a refusal to accept the overwhelming evidence in support of keeping all 51 pits open.' Separately, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said it was unlikely that contracts with electricity generators would be signed before the government published its energy review scheduled for the end of next month. He called for longer contracts with the power generators than the five years at present envisaged. In its evidence to the Department of Trade and Industry's energy review, British Coal proposed a series of measures that would, it said, enable it to sell an extra 15m tonnes of coal a year over the next five years to the England and Wales electricity generators and another 5m to industrial and domestic customers, taking the total to 64m tonnes in 1997-98. Mr Clarke said if British Coal were to be profitable, extra sales to generators would have to be at the same price as agreed for lower volumes in existing tentative deals. British Coal's proposals include: Deferring the commissioning of Sizewell B nuclear power station for a number of years, saving 3m tonnes of coal by 1997-98, and phasing out most Magnox nuclear stations over the next five years, saving 5m tonnes. Reducing gas burning at committed combined-cycle gas turbine plants and refusing permission for others to be constructed, saving 6m tonnes. Extending the UK tax on electricity - the fossil fuel levy - to electricity imported from France and eliminating the present net inflow into Britain, saving 6m tonnes. British Coal wants a slower reduction in coal stocks than is now envisaged and limits on the burning of bitumen-based orimulsion. It also backs the deferral of plans for the proposed liberalisation of the electricity market due for implementation in 1994 and 1998. British Coal warned that without policy changes there would be only 11,000 deep-pit miners and 15 pits by 1997. Even with the changes there would be 25 pits compared with the present 50 and 17,000 miners. None of those calculations incorporates the effects of the the proposed law changes on alterations to working practices. British Coal says the changes may cut average deep-mine operating costs of Pounds 1.27 a gigajoule by a further 15p. British Coal wants the government to repeal the 1908 Coal Mines Regulation Act, which limits underground shifts to 7 1/2 hours. Because of travelling time, many miners work only five hours at the coal face. British Coal wants to increase that to eight hours, and for some miners that would mean 10-hour shifts. The corporation also wants the government to repeal of Section 46 of the 1946 Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, which establishes machinery for consultation and conciliation and the modernisation of mines and quarries legislation to allow more efficient management and supervision. It wants to be able to make compulsory redundancies. The Trades Union Congress has called on the European Commission to take legal action to halt the pit closure programme.</p>

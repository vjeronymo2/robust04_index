Simko entered politics as a member of the KDH, which now  again becomes a government party, and which he co-founded in  early 1990. His post-November political activity was preceded by  numerous activities under the communist regime (toppled in  November 1989). During his studies in Bratislava, Simko, along  with local Catholic circles, helped establish Christian-oriented  communities of young people.    Ivan Simko, doctor of law, was born on January 1, 1955 in  Bratislava. In the late 1970s he graduated from Bratislava's  School of Economics. He was shortly employed in economic  research, later worked in the Department of Bratislava's Chief  Architect. In the mid-1980s he studied, without leaving his  job, at the Law School of Bratislava Comenius University, from  which he graduated in 1987.    In January 1990, he was invited by Jan Carnogursky, then  deputy prime minister of the new Czechoslovak Government, to  work in his secretariat, where he stayed until the first free  elections in June 1990. He was elected a deputy to the House of  the People of the then Federal Assembly. He headed the  Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, and was a member  of the Assembly's Presidium. He held the deputy's post until the  next elections in June 1992. In 1991 he was elected as  Czechoslovakia's representative to the European Parliament.    A few months before the June 1992 elections, the KDH  proposed  Simko to the vacant post of Slovak justice minister. Between  March and July 1993, he was deputy chairman of the Legislative  Council of the Slovak parliament.    Since late 1992, when the Federal Assembly terminated its  operation (in connection with the split of Czechoslovakia into  two independent republics), Simko, a member of the KDH  leadership, has been working for the KDH. At the 5th KDH  congress in September 1992, he was elected a party's deputy  chairman.</p>

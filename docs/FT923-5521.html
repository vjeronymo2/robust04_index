			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Gerald Ratner's total pay listed as Pounds 574,452 MR GERALD RATNER, who earlier this year was forced to step down as chairman of Ratners jewellery chain after the company ran into financial difficulties, received total emoluments of Pounds 574,452 in the year to March 1. Although this represented a 7 per cent pay cut from the previous year, the payment came in a year when Ratners reported a loss before tax of Pounds 122m compared with a profit of Pounds 112m, when ordinary shareholders received no final dividend and when preference shareholders saw their dividends deferred. Mr Ratner is also, apparently, receiving the same salary in his remaining role of chief executive as he received in his previous position as chairman and managing director. This is in spite of turning over his responsibilities as executive chairman to Mr James McAdam who took up the post on January 10. According to Ratner's annual report, which is due to arrive on shareholders' desks in coming days, Mr Ratner received Pounds 541,401 in the 11 months before he gave up the chairmanship, equivalent to Pounds 1,573.86 a day. In the 21 days left before the accounts were drawn up, Mr Ratner received Pounds 33,051, equivalent to Pounds 1,573.86 a day. Meanwhile, Mr McAdam was paid Pounds 15,377 for the period, equivalent to a more modest Pounds 732.24 a day. Mr McAdam was not returning telephone calls yesterday to comment on whether he and Mr Ratner will continue on the same remuneration terms this year. See Lex</p>

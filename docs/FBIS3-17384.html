According to the document, the two sides will look into the  possibilities for cooperation in space research, physics of  circumterrestrial space, the mutual impact between the sun and  the earth, space-based scanning of the earth, space biology and  aeronautics. In part, the declaration proposed using the  Ukrainian scientific vessels Yuriy Gagarin and Academician  Korolev.    According to NSAU Director General Vladimir Gorbulin, the  vessels were used to maintain space communications in times when  the former Soviet Union still existed. "Nowadays they are out  of service and are a heavy burden for the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry," he pointed out.    Gorbulin said the talks failed to touch on the possibility  of  bilateral cooperation in producing spacecraft and using space  transportation systems which is of great importance for Ukraine.  In his opinion, that was caused by Ukraine's failure in 1992 to  back the U.S. proposal to expose its missile technologies to  international control. At the moment, as many as 26 countries  have signed the agreement.</p>

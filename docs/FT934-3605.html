			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Need to rationalise ITV's fragmented advertising regime Sir, Michael Grade's letter ('Advertisers threatened by ITV changes', November 27), urges the ITC to preserve its present 25 per cent limit on the share of ITV revenue that can be sold by any single ITV sales house. This is both self-seeking and unduly alarmist. The ITC has said it will review the sales house rules early next year: one of the factors it will take into account is the way the TV air-time market is changing. Channel Four takes nearly 18 per cent of the market at the moment and is by far the largest single commercial broadcaster in the UK. (It will still be number two even if the Central and Carlton air-time is sold together.) If the ITC revised the rules to permit an lTV sales company to take up to 25 per cent of the market, this would make life less comfortable for Channel Four but would scarcely imperil its existence. Advertisers already have real choice in the TV market, and this choice will grow as satellite and cable companies increase their audience share. It is in everyone's interest (including the advertisers) that ITV remains a strong channel, commissioning and producing original British programmes on a scale exceeded only by the BBC. Rationalising its present fragmentary structure, in both the ownership rules and the sales rules, is a necessary prerequisite for this.

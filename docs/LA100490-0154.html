			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> HOUSING REHABILITATION PLAN  </P> <P> After a two-year absence, the city's Housing Rehabilitation Program is on its  way back to help low- and moderate-income families improve their homes with a  number of loans and grants.  </P> <P> The City Council unanimously voted Monday to take the first steps toward  re-establishing the program, which was discontinued because of lack of funds.  </P> <P> The program, expected to be in operation by January, would provide assistance  with repairs including painting, yard cleanup, plumbing and electrical work,  roofing, and room additions.  </P> <P> Robb Steel, Azusa's redevelopment director, said 50% of the city's housing  units require minor or major repairs.  </P> <P> The city is hoping to fund the program with $50,000 from its own budget,  $223,307 from a county grant and $250,000 from a state loan program.  </P></p>

The Middle East, a magnet damaged by the Gulf War, is  especially promising, said Chen Yongcai, director general of the  international co-operation department at the Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Co-operation.    "We're well prepared to enter the Iraqi market once the  United Nations' sanctions are called off," he said.    There is a strong likelihood the UN will lift economic  sanctions against Iraq within the year, analysts say.    China has had a number of projects in Iraq, some have had to  be postponed because of the sanctions.    And in certain cases, Iraq still owes China money.    "We're closely following what is happening with Iraq," Chen  said, but he declined to give details.    China has already regained its presence in Kuwait, which is  emerging from the scars of the Gulf War.    Chen said China's labour and engineering contracts where  were  back at pre-Gulf War levels.    "We've won bids from Kuwait to build larger petrochemical  projects," he said.    Other big potential markets include South Korea, Japan,  Sudan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Chen believed China would get $7.5 billion worth of overseas  labour and engineering contracts this year, 25 percent more than  1993.    Business turnover would grow 12.5 percent to $4.5 billion.    And altogether 190,000 workers would be overseas by the end  of the year, 30,000 more than 1993.    Chen said China would also seek higher-level labour and  engineering contracts this year, including aircraft maintenance  and project consultancy and design.    In the past, Chinese workers have been engaged mostly in  infrastructure on construction projects.    Chen said China was also considering accepting payment in  the  form of oil or oil products from Middle East countries.    China had rejected such payment in the past, causing the  loss  of many contracts, Chen added.    He estimated the value of 1993's overseas labour and  engineering contracts at $6 billion, 10 percent lower than 1992.    But he said actual business turnover would hit $4 billion,  up  31 percent.    Chen attributed the slide in contract value partly to Sino-  British disputes over Hong Kong.</p>

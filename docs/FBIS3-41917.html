As Siemens spokesman Rainer Jend said in Hanau  upon inquiry, a first shipment of uranium material to the Tomsk  nuclear complex in Siberia had already taken place without this  so far being made public knowledge.    A total of 140 tonnes of ``slightly impure residue''  obtained  in the production of nuclear power station fuel elements at  Hanau are to be reprocessed in Tomsk by the end of next year.  This is stipulated by a ``service contract'' concluded with the  Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. In return, Siemens imports  two shipments of about 70 tonnes of so-called enriched  uranium-hexafluoride from Tomsk in order to manufacture new fuel  elements in Hanau. The nuclear waste produced during processing  in Tomsk is disposed of in Russia. According to Siemens, only  small quantities are involved.    The Siemens spokesman pointed out that the deal with the  ``Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises Tomsk,'' a branch of  the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, has been approved and  supported by the responsible German and Russian bodies.  According to him, the Federal Radiation Protection Office, the  Federal Export Office, and the European nuclear authority  EURATOM were involved. As Cay Friemuth, spokesman of the Bonn  Environment Ministry, said, the permits were granted as early as  in July 1993 with the participation of his Ministry and of the  Economics Ministry. The first shipment to Tomsk was sent on its  way via the land and sea route on 21 October. According to the  regulations of the nuclear law, the permit must be renewed for  1994; this will probably be done, Friemuth said.    Upon inquiry by FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, Siemens spokesman  Jend  said that it is still open whether the 140-tonne project will  turn into lasting cooperation with the nuclear complex in  Siberia. However, he pointed to the ``cooperation agreement for  the field of nuclear fuel circulation,'' which was concluded by  Siemens and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov in  September. This agreement involved joint projects in, for  instance, the construction and storage of fuel elements and the  processing of plutonium from the Russian nuclear weapons.    The 140 tonnes of impure uranium material, which have  accumulated in Hanau, cannot be purified and enriched on site,  according to Jend, because the part of the fuel element factory,  which would be suitable for this work, has been closed down  since a hydrogen explosion on 12 December 1990. Processing in  Hanau would be possible only in the new Siemens factory, about  the approval of which Siemens and the Hesse land government have  been engaged in a legal quarrel for some time. Jend said:  ``You must ask Minister (Joschka) Fischer, when we can do that  in Hanau.''    Asked about the safety of Russian nuclear factories, Jend  said that Siemens experts convinced themselves in Tomsk that the  processing would be conducted in line with the internationally  usual Purex process and that ``high quality standards'' are  achieved in the process. Jend did not accept the reference to  the nuclear accident in Tomsk, during which an explosion  released plutonium last spring and 200 square kilometers were  radioactively contaminated. This ``was in a completely  different corner'' of the large nuclear complex, where several  thousand people work.    In its assessment of the safety in Tomsk, the Environment  Ministry relies on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  in Vienna, which has access to Tomsk. Spokesman Friemuth said  that his Ministry has to accept the safety standards if the IAEA  does not have any indications of irregularities.</p>

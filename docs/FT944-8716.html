			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Budge searches for light at the end of the tunnel: RJB Mining's bid and projections for British Coal So now we know why RJB Mining was able to offer what seemed so much for the English mining regions of British Coal. If the company's projections are correct and it can make Pounds 220m in pre-tax profits in 1999, as it says it can in papers being shown to institutions, then its proposed Pounds 914m acquisition may end up looking rather cheap. But it is a large if. According to coal and electricity industry executives and analysts, serious questions also hang over other assumptions which the company is using to gather support for one of the most audacious bids seen for some years. Much is riding on the outcome of the Pounds 1.1bn fund-raising exercise which RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd have embarked upon. If it fails, ministers will be forced to look for another buyer among the bidders it passed over for RJB. The government's already flagging privatisation programme would also suffer a blow, and the credibility of both BZW and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised the government on the bids and their feasibility, would be damaged. RJB, founded by chief executive Mr Richard Budge, floated on the stock exchange last year in preparation for the bid. It appears to be confident of raising the Pounds 425m in equity and Pounds 628m in debt needed to finance the bid and provide working capital. BZW is said to have conducted more 'due diligence' on the bid than any other in recent years. There are still many institutional investors interested in providing funds. 'People want to invest in coal,' said Mr Charles Kernot, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing. Nonetheless few institutions, if any, have made commitments. 'I am impressed by the company's management but the complexity of the bid means I need more guidance on the numbers,' said one potential investor. There will be no shortage of that in the next few weeks. At least some of the advice on offer is likely to be either non-committal or even negative. 'He may be able to make Pounds 220m in 1998 but it looks tight,' says Mr Kernot. One of RJB's rival bidders said that if the company was able to make as much as it projects then it will be the most profitable coal company in the world, 'certainly more profitable than Hanson's Peabody or RTZ'. This, he says, is highly optimistic. From the point of view of potential lenders for the Pounds 628m of debt RJB wants to raise, the crucial period will be the years before 1998. RJB predicts that by that time it will have paid off all the bank debt which amounts to Pounds 528m (the other Pounds 100m will be financed through a longer term corporate bond). This provokes differing opinions among rival bidders and analysts. One says debts will still be high in 1998; another believes borrowings can be cleared, saying 'key assumptions' in the RJB presentations on both price and volumes prior to 1998 seem 'eminently feasible' and that sale of stocks, valued at Pounds 314m, can clear some of the debt. The key assumptions are, after all, largely predictable. RJB will inherit contracts to sell 29m tonnes of year to 1998 to the electricity generators at prices already agreed. It assumes that it can sell around 35m a year tonnes of coal in the next three years but that includes the domestic and industrial markets and so seems plausible. Most coal executives believe that the debt will be successfully raised in the next few weeks (although there is less of a consensus about whether it can be paid off by 1998). Placing the shares to raise Pounds 425m may prove a more critical test as potential investors will focus on the less predictable years after 1998. In presentations to potential equity investors, RJB is saying that the initial dividend yield is expected to be about 4.5 per cent but that there will be a 'policy of rapid dividend growth with substantial increases expected after the reduction of debt'. RJB assumes demand for the coal produced and sold from the regions it is buying will remain constant at about 34-35m a year for the rest of the decade. However the post-1998 difficulties were highlighted yesterday when Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the UK coal industry's biggest buyer, said his company would like to buy UK coal but expected that after 1998 volumes would fall and prices become more competitive. According to most forecasts outside the RJB camp, markets will decline markedly after 1998. Some executives think RJB will struggle to sell 25m tonnes a year from the coal regions after 1998. Intense competition with other producers seems inevitable. That makes the Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule (at today's prices) assumed for 1998 and 1999 look optimistic. A more appropriate figure would be Pounds 1.15 or less, say some forecasts. Tables, Page 21</p>

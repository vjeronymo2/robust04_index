			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission traditionally has concluded that a broker-dealer routing customer orders for automated execution could satisfy its best execution obligations so long as the broker-dealer assesses periodically the quality of competing markets to ensure that its order flow is directed to markets providing the most advantageous terms for its customers' orders. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  Nevertheless, the Commission's staff recently has warned against presuming that guaranteed executions at the best bid or offer always will satisfy the broker-dealer's best execution duties for small orders in listed securities. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  For example, as a general matter, trades in listed securities routed to an exchange will be exposed to other public orders or interest in the trading crowd, with the possibility that the order may receive a price that is better than the existing quotations (so-called ``price improvement''). Most regional exchanges, for example, have incorporated order exposure features into their small order routing and execution systems with a view toward offering price improvement. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Status Report,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 26.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also Market 2000, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, Study V at 1 n.8; Multiple Trading of Standardized Options Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 27, 54 FR at 23973 n. 127; and Securities Exchange Release Act Nos. 17583 (Feb. 27, 1981), 46 FR 15713, 15715 n. 16 (Mar. 9, 1981); and 15926 (June 15, 1979), 44 FR 36912, 36923 n.118 (June 6, 1979). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, Study V at 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  This feature by itself, however, rarely provides an execution between the spread. Most regional exchanges program their automatic execution systems to ensure that customer orders receive a price at the NBBO or better, and the specialist is provided an opportunity to improve the price. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'') does not have such a feature in its automatic execution system, although the Commission has recommended for years that it be included.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Market 2000, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, Study V at 4 n.19; Proposing Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1, 58 FR at 52938  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> n.28; Market 2000 Concept Release,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, 57 FR at 32595 n.53; Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27013 (July 7, 1989) 54 FR 30298 n.2 (July 19, 1989); 22750 (Dec. 31, 1985), 51 FR 799, 801 (Jan. 6, 1986); 20350 (Nov. 4, 1983), 48 FR 51722, 71723 n.10 (Nov. 10, 1983); 19858 (June 9, 1983), 48 FR 27872, 27873 (June 17, 1983); and 19372 (Dec. 23, 1982), 47 FR 58287, Technical Appendix, n.12 (Dec. 30, 1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the possibility for price improvement, while not the exclusive factor, bears on the question of whether a broker-dealer is fulfilling its duty to seek best execution, especially when payment is received by the broker-dealer in return for guaranteeing order flow. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  Although it may be impractical for a broker or dealer that handles a heavy volume of orders to make an individual determination regarding where to route each order it receives, the broker or dealer must use due diligence to seek the best execution possible given all facts and circumstances. The Commission believes a broker or dealer must assess whether the order flow in the aggregate, is receiving best execution and that a broker-dealer must not allow a payment or an inducement for order flow to interfere with its efforts to obtain best execution. Accordingly, in light of a broker-dealer's obligation to assess periodically the quality of the markets to which it routes packaged order flow absent specific instructions from customers, the Commission does not believe such a broker-dealer violates its best execution obligation merely because it receives payment for order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Because executions of market orders for listed stocks in an exchange market include the possibility for a price between the quotes, the staff has concluded that the existence of this possibility, even if the price is not actually improved, can be a factor in determining whether best execution has been sought.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, Study V. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this connection, the Commission has taken several steps recently to expand the opportunity for customer market orders to be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time of receipt, including proposal of a Rule to require limit order price protection in Nasdaq National Market securities. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  Nevertheless, considerable differences among market centers exist today. Accordingly, consistent with these steps to help customers understand payment for order flow practices, and to facilitate fair competition among exchange and non-exchange market centers, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to require broker-dealers to disclose to customers their policies regarding where they route unspecified orders that are subject to payment for order flow. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  This provision requires a description of the extent to which orders so routed can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO at the time the order is received. Dealers should explain, in simple terms, whether the market center to which they route unspecified orders executes orders to purchase or sell at the NBBO and whether it provides an opportunity for execution at prices superior to the NBBO. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34753 (Sept. 29, 1994), 59 FR 50866 (Oct. 6, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As revised, paragraph (a)(2) of the Rule would require broker-dealers to provide information concerning the broker-dealer's policies for determining where to route customer orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By the terms of the Rule, this disclosure would be limited to orders that are subject to payment for order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Annual Disclosure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters opposed annual disclosure because it would duplicate the account opening disclosure and suggested that the Commission require additional disclosure only upon a material change in the firm's policies. The Commission is retaining the annual disclosure requirement because it believes this will serve to remind customers that evaluation of a dealer's services involves more than a comparison of commission rates and to encourage broker-dealers to continue to evaluate the quality of service they receive from market centers from which they receive payment for order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "`Russia's Choice' Not Losing </F> Optimism"]    [Text] How will the resignation of key figures (Gaydar,  Pamfilova, Fedorov) affect the activity of the "Russia's Choice"  deputies' faction? What do the leaders of this movement intend  to do in the long term? These and many other questions were put  by journalists yesterday to Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Mityukov,  Boris Saltykov, and Grigoriy Tomchenko. It had been intended  that Ella Pamfilova would attend the news conference. But she  had fallen ill and was not present.    Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that the parliamentary faction  supports the departure of Gaydar, Pamfilova, and Fedorov.    In his opinion, a real process is now being observed,  whereby  the center of power is shifting from the presidential structures  toward the head of government. The government has firmly  embarked on the path of curtailing the reforms which had been  begun.    At the same time "Russia's Choice" is not losing optimism.  Again, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the deputies' faction has  sufficient means and opportunities "to prevent the matter from  being completely spoiled." "Russia's Choice" holds sufficiently  strong positions on key parliamentary committees and, in  addition, relies on the support and solidarity of other factions  (including Communists and farmers) in the struggle against any  extreme views and positions.    "Russia's Choice" also does not rule out raising the  question  of no confidence in the government. This is possible in the  very near future, when the new budget, for example, is discussed.    The Duma faction's spokesmen also pin considerable hopes on  the president of Russia. Sergey Yushenkov emphasized that  Yeltsin will, in the final analysis, realize the perniciousness  of curtailing the reforms and will find the strength to make the  necessary decision.</p>

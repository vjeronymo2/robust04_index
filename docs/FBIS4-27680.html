			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The May 17 TONG-A ILBO editorial on  page 3 expressed concern over the new prime minister's lack of  authority. On 4 May, Yi Yong-tok, in office for only five days,  issued a memorandum revising regulations on official vehicle  usage for government-funded businesses and institutes. The  memo, which had a 14 May suspense date, requested all concerned  to prepare an action plan and return it to his office.    Although there are 340 such businesses and institutes, not  even one has carried out his order. Were the plan to be  implemented, the government could save over 100 billion won  annually. It appears the Prime Minister's office is trying not  to make this non-compliance a major issue. The office made the  excuse that 10 days was not enough for the offices to make their  reports. The editorial pointed out that saving 100 billion won  isn't a minor issue, but the real problem is a powerless prime  minister. Without authority, he cannot have an effective  working relationship with his cabinet or with the National  Assembly. Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang left office because  he couldn't establish his authority.    The editorial urged President Kim to grant the prime  minister  sufficient authority so he can act to reform the government. It  also reminded the president that the real victims--should Yi  fail to carry out his job--are the people; not the government,  not the National Assembly, nor Yi Yong-tok and his office.</p>

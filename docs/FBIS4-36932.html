			<p>CSO     [Text] Tehran, 24 Ordibehesht [14 May] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News  Service -- White House officials are continuing their policy of  frightening the region's leaders and talking to the region's  oil-rich nations about the threat from Iran, for the purpose of  selling them more American weapons.    In this same connection, Robert Pelletreau, the American  assistant Secretary of State, said while visiting the southern  Persian Gulf nations: "We believe Iran intends to arm itself  with modern weapons in the shortest time possible." Speaking  with reporters before departing from Bahrain for Kuwait, he  added: "We have consulted and exchanged views with our friends  in the region concerning the threat from Iran to the Arab  emirates."    Pelletreau spoke of the threat from Iran and this country's  becoming equipped with advanced weaponry at a time when the  Islamic Republic of Iran's military budget is insignificant  compared to the budgets of many of the countries in the region,  including the emirates in the south Persian Gulf.    It is worth mentioning that one of the ways Western  companies, including American companies, sell chemical weapons  to the Arab nations, is to claim that Iran is a threat to the  security of the aforementioned countries, and that if the Arab  nations of the Persian Gulf do not become equipped with advanced  weaponry, they might be attacked by the Islamic Republic of Iran.    In his press conference he claimed that Iran continues to  threaten the oil-rich Arab nations of the Persian Gulf. America  is now holding talks and negotiations with the Arabs to increase  their defense and deterrent capability.    It is to be noted that Iran has repeatedly opposed American  opportunism in the region and the White House goal of  strengthening its domination of the Persian Gulf. Iranian  officials have emphasized that establishing security depends on  cooperation among the Persian Gulf nations and removing  foreigners from this region.</p>

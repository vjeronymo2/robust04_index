			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Honeywell drops to Dollars 102.6m in last quarter HONEYWELL, the US controls group, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 102.6m, compared with Dollars 109.2m a year earlier, in spite of the impact of the US and international economic recession. The profits, which worked through at Dollars 1.46 a share, compared with Dollars 1.49, were struck on sales which rose 2.3 per cent to Dollars 1.71bn, with each of the company's three main businesses showing revenue gains. The group's operating profit was Dollars 199.4m, down from Dollars 203.9m. Honeywell said operating profits had improved in the home and building control and industrial businesses, and remained steady in space and aviation. For the full year, Honeywell reported net income of Dollars 331.1m, or Dollars 4.70 a share, compared with Dollars 382m, or Dollars 5.03 a share, in 1990. However, the 1990 figures benefited from a lower tax rate - 28 per cent against 35 per cent - as well as a gain of Dollars 14.3m from asset sales and Dollars 10m of income from discontinued operations. Mr James Renier, the chairman, said the 'stable, solid results' were a dramatic improvement over past recessions and reflected the success of its strategy in concentrating on the core control business. The home control division earned fourth-quarter operating profits of Dollars 88.5m, up 3.5 per cent, while orders showed a double-digit increase. The industrial business made Dollars 66.2m, up from Dollars 65.6m.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Observer: Chinese take-away The Chinese answer to George Soros has just been made a university professor in the hope that some of his Midas touch will rub off on the country's eagre youth. 'Million Yang', probably China's best-known securities trader, recently waxed lyrical on the art of stock dealing before an audience at one of the world's hitherto more obscure seats of learning, Shenyang Finance College. He is now a 'full-time' professor at the institution. But it remains to be seen just how much time the smart Shanghainese will spend up north. Lacking any form of financial training, Yang skipped a university education and toiled long as a humble worker in Shanghai before essaying the delights of stocks and shares. But since the Shanghai bourse opened for business in 1988, Yang has devoted himself night and day to its every gyration, accumul-ating an enviable pile in the process. He is even taking small steps to emulate Soros the benefactor; Yang's meagre monthly professorial emoluments will go to a good cause, namely a Shenyang charity called Project Hope.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Why Finland's PM should be smiling but isn't: Lionel Barber detects an ambivalence about membership of the EU Mr Esko Aho, Finland's youthful prime minister, ought to be smiling. The polls show solid support for membership of the European Union, and his country is looking at a once-in-a-century chance to slip out of Russia's orbit and join the west. Yet here is Mr Aho sitting in his spartan office offering mild apologies about his country's (and his own) lack of Euro-phoria. His coalition government has yet to decide when to hold a referendum on EU membership. He is worried about a backlash from Finnish farmers who stand to lose heavily under lower EU farm prices. And no one quite knows how to handle the referendum. Mr Aho's nightmare is a repeat of the Maastricht treaty referendums in 1992 when the French and Danes turned their back on their political elites. He worries that a hard-sell Euro-campaign could turn off voters renowned for their stubborn streak: 'It's a very complicated process,' he sighs. The timing of the referendum reveals much about the Finnish psyche. Finns fret about the possibility that Sweden might vote No, prompting a Norwegian No, undermining Nordic co-operation and leaving Finland stranded. EU supporters such as the recently elected President Martti Ahtisaari want to hold the referendum before the Swedish poll. They hope a Yes vote will create a bandwagon behind membership in sceptical Scandinavia. But Mr Heikki Haavisto, foreign minister, and Mr Pertti Salolainen, deputy prime minister and foreign trade minister, want to wait until after the Swedish poll - ostensibly on the grounds that Sweden applied first for membership. Mr Aho prefers the 'neutral' option of holding it on the same day. The poll date will be resolved next week, but in an interview Mr Aho suggested that some (unnamed) EU member states might be tempted to block ratification of all four enlargement treaties if rich, populous Sweden rejects membership. According to the chief executive of one of Finland's largest manufacturing companies, Mr Aho is haunted by divisions over Europe within his own centre party and has one eye on next year's general election. 'Industry is giving him a beating (for not speaking up on membership),' he says. For Finnish industry, EU membership is vital. Mr Georg Ehrnrooth head of the Metra conglomerate who chairs the Finnish employers federation, says the European Economic Area is not a satisfactory substitute for full membership: 'It is just a stepping stone.' Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive of Nokia, the mobile phones manufacturer, agrees. EU membership offers the chance for Finnish business to shape new European industrial standards and norms now under discussion in Brussels. Without membership, Finland risks being marginalised, weakening its role as a magnet for international investment. Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen, governor of the Bank of Finland, welcomes the external economic discipline offered by EU membership and the project of European monetary union as a means of weaning industry and unions off currency devaluations - a useful tool to pull a commodity-driven economy out of recession. Yet Mr Aho's caution may turn out to be smarter than it looks now. Much depends on the 'national package' settling the cost of compensating Finnish farmers for reducing producer prices overnight to EU levels - an average 40 per cent cut which will force the Finnish government to raise an extra FM4.3bn (Pounds 531m) next year with, it is hoped, the sums reducing gradually over the next five years. These sums trigger the best of Finnish black humour. One member of parliament joked that the government was certain to lose the referendum either way: the package was too generous and Finns would object to the cost; or it was too mean, in which case the public would vote No in sympathy with the farmers. In the past, EU policy allowed new EU members such as Spain and Portugal generous periods of transition. Now, virtually the whole of Finland will be eligible for special EU regional aid. And however much Brussels and Helsinki offers in compensation, more than 30 per cent of Finnish farmers are likely to be wiped out by the end of the decade. President Ahtisaari likens the challenge to the resettlement of 423,000 Karelians (representing 11 per cent of the population) who were driven off their land by the Russian forces during the second world war. The war reference is telling because it offers the biggest single clue as to why Finns are likely to plump for membership later this year. Finns deny they are searching for extra security. Ministers bristle when asked whether Finland would like to join the West European Union or the Nato alliance as an insurance policy against a resurgent, nationalist Russia; and they play down the importance of the common European foreign and security policy set out in the Maastricht treaty. But they reject the idea that EU membership and its future foreign and security policy obligations risk provoking Russia, or that it could impose obligations down the road which are too high a price to pay. The message is that Finland's traditional neutrality is no longer relevant. In the end, the best indication of Finnish interest in the EU is the fact that the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the foreign trade minister all intend to be at the European summit in Corfu next month. And that is not purely to do with the weather.</p>

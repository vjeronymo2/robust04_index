			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HE'S GOT A TICKET TO RIDE;  </P> <P> AND HE DEFINITELY CARES; SANDY ALOMAR JR. WANTS HIS FUTURE DECIDED SOON  </P> <P> Not that all of this is turning his brain to stew. But the other day, Padre  catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. was standing in the shower when he heard his name and  a trade mentioned on the television set. He threw back the curtain, splashed  into the living room and dripped through nearly a minute of a sportscast that,  alas, was only talking about more rumors.  </P> <P> The question, of course, is not whether he was still getting the shampoo out of  his ears 4 hours later. The question is, how did he ever hear a television set  from inside the shower in the first place?  </P> <P> "You no understand," he said. "I am so wondering about my future, every night I  keep the sports turned up. Turned way up."  </P> <P> Not that all of this is turning his brain to stew. But when the news came  Tuesday that the Seattle Mariners would probably be dealing with the New York  Mets instead of the Padres, one of Sandy Alomar Jr.'s close friends predicted  danger.  </P> <P> "Oh no, oh no," Padre infielder Joey Cora said. "Sandy always think he is going  to Seattle. Hearing this will hurt him bad. Oh man. It's only going to get  worse."  </P> <P> Some of his teammates worry about him. Others wonder about him. Mostly, though,  they just try not to look too closely.  </P> <P> Sandy Alomar Jr., 22, last year's Topps minor league player of the year and one  of baseball's top prospects, is this spring's Nowhere Man. He has no future  here. He has no present here. He has only a uniform that doesn't look or feel  right and a hotel room where he escapes nightly by playing Nintendo video  games.  </P> <P> His problem is simple -- he is not good enough to play ahead of All-Star  catcher Benito Santiago but too good to sit the bench behind him, and certainly  too good to return to the minor leagues, where last year for triple-A Las Vegas  he hit .297 with 16 homers and 71 RBIs in 93 games.  </P> <P> He and the Padres thought the solution would be simple -- trade him this winter  for a top player, giving Alomar a deserved chance and the Padres the pennant.  </P> <P> But nothing has happened as it should have. Even though Alomar, 6-feet-5, 200  pounds, is considered the top catching prospect in baseball since Santiago, and  catcher is baseball's hardest position to fill, McKeon has been unable to put  him in a deal for top talent.  </P> <P> Kansas City wouldn't give up outfielder Danny Tartabull. Cleveland wouldn't  give up third baseman Brook Jacoby or outfielder Joe Carter. Texas wouldn't  give up third baseman Steve Buechele.  </P> <P> Seattle wouldn't give up pitcher Mark Langston. Montreal wouldn't give up third  baseman Tim Wallach or outfielder Hubie Brooks. The New York Yankees, as of  yet, won't give up third baseman Mike Pagliarulo. And now it appears the  Atlanta Braves might not give up outfielder Dale Murphy.  </P> <P> Some say it is because McKeon has overvalued someone who is, after all, still a  minor leaguer. Others say it is because scouts are worried about the  arthroscopic knee surgery Alomar underwent last August, even though it is  obvious that he has completely recovered.  </P> <P> "How much is one player worth, I don't know," McKeon said. "But you just don't  give somebody away."  </P> <P> Said Alomar: "I don't know why they can't trade me. But it is not my job to  know why. I've got enough things to worry me right now."  </P> <P> He has been taught well about how to accept this, by brother Roberto (Padre  second baseman) and father Sandy (Padre coach). He has been taught to act tough  and look uncaring.  </P> <P> But contrary to most expectations, he is not like his brother or his father. As  anyone who saw the boys grow in their seaside Puerto Rican village will tell  you, Sandy is his mother's son. He is the family's sensitive, boyish one. He is  the only one who ever quit baseball because he wanted to ride dirt bikes. He  cannot act what he does not feel or appear as anything but himself.  </P> <P> "You know what he feels like?" Cora asked. "He feels like a leftover. He feels  like, there is the Padres, and then there is him. He feels like nobody is  counting on him for nothing. It is so hard. And it gets harder."  </P> <P> Brother Roberto, ever the fighter, grabs at a light: "He could always hit .360  like I did last spring and win a job here, right?"  </P> <P> Sandy Jr. shakes his head. Wrong.  </P> <P> "I understand, Benito is a great catcher, he is the Padres' catcher, it is the  way it should be," he said. "And I know that while I am young, I cannot back  up, Mark Parent is the best backup. There is no place for me here."  </P> <P> Such is the truth of this statement that even the tough Santiago feels sorry  for him.  </P> <P> "That guy, I do all I can to help him," Santiago said. "He's in a tough spot,  and I know about that tough spot. We talk, I help him."  </P> <P> Said Alomar: "There is no bad feelings with Benito, because I know I have to  go. But where? I wish they would tell me. I wish I'm gone."  </P> <P> True to his character, part of the reason Alomar wants to be traded soon is for  reasons other than baseball, human reasons.  </P> <P> "How can I get to a city at the start of the season and make friends?" he  asked. "The later it gets, the harder it is to be part of a club. I don't want  to be an outsider somewhere all year."  </P> <P> Alomar finds it funny that so many people ask him for his preference of cities  -- "They don't know . . . I would go to Japan."  </P> <P> He does, however, know where he doesn't want to go: back to triple-A Las Vegas.  But if McKeon can't work something out, that is precisely where he is headed.  </P> <P> "Hey, you gotta go, you gotta go," McKeon said. "I remember back in the days of  the great Baltimore Orioles, a lot of guys went back to the minors after great  years because you don't replace a Brooks Robinson or Jim Palmer. I saw Scott  McGregor, Mike Flanagan, Doug DeCinces, Don Baylor all go back to the minors."  </P> <P> "What can I do there?" Alomar asked. "I haven't thought about it yet, and I  don't want to think about it. I love the people and the town, but why stay in  the same place?  </P> <P> "None of this is the Padres' fault, but all the time, I'm the one getting  penalized. That's what's hard."  </P> <P> Other things are also hard. Like Tuesday morning, when Alomar couldn't find his  baseball shoes. Turns out an equipment man accidently gave them to Benito  Santiago.  </P> <P> "Funny, huh?" asked Alomar, without one drop or splash of a smile.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Four of the eight remaining no-shows reported to camp Tuesday, one day before  the requested date. Outfielder Marvell Wynne, shortstop and captain Garry  Templeton, first baseman Rob Nelson and utility man Bip Roberts all worked out.  The only position players who did not report early, and will make their first  on-field appearance in today's first full workout, are first baseman Jack  Clark, infielders Randy Ready and Gary Green and outfielder Shane Mack. Pitcher  Eric Show, who has been home with the flu, is also expected to make his first  appearance today. three days late. . . . Negotiations have begun for the Padres  final three unsigned players, Benito Santiago, Roberto Alomar, and Sandy Alomar  Jr., all represented by agent Scott Boras. Although Santiago actually walked  out of camp for a morning last season during sometimes heated contract talks,  he said this year will be different: "I'm not saying the stuff I said last  year, I'm not saying anything," Santiago said. "There is too much good that can  happen on the field for me to worry about the contract. I'm sure I will be  happy." He will be particularly happy if his $177,000 deal of last year is  increased to around $300,000. Said Boras: "I want Benito focused on the goal of  having a fine year, focused on the game rather than the contract. It's a  situation where I will keep as low key as possible." Santiago just recently  signed with Boras after dropping Davimos Sports Inc. following last year's  unpleasantness. Roberto Alomar, meanwhile, will try to push his major-league  minimum of $62,500 into the $150,000 range, while brother Sandy Jr., with just  one big league at-bat, will sign for considerably less.  </P></p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Signet trims losses to Pounds 25.8m but warns on weaker sales trend Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as Ratners, cut its interim losses slightly but warned yesterday of a weaker sales trend continuing in the US and softer September sales in the UK. City analysts cut their forecasts for full-year profits from Pounds 20m to Pounds 10m, and the shares closed 3 1/4 p down at 28 1/4 p. The pre-tax loss for the six months to the end of July eased from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 25.8m. Included in the latest figures are trading losses of Pounds 4.65m at the Salisburys luggage and handbag chain, which was sold last month, and a related provision of Pounds 1.5m. The group expects no further costs to arise from the disposal. The operating loss on continuing activities fell from Pounds 7.32m to Pounds 3.06m. Sales were flat at Pounds 375.6m, compared with Pounds 375.9m previously. Interest payments rose from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 16.6m. Mr James McAdam, chairman, said it was too early to say whether the softening US sales trend would make it more difficult for the group to trade its way out of debt as the Christmas trading season would determine the final result. The group's attitude to a possible financial reconstruction remained the same as at the annual general meeting in July. 'All our effort has been directed at trading,' Mr Mc-Adam said. 'If you do not have a cake in the first place there is no point in splitting it up.' However, Mr Julian Treger, an adviser to the UK Active Value Fund - a large holder of US dollar convertible preference shares - said yesterday that the capital structure was arguably holding the company back. He added that the issue needed to be addressed in the interests of all shareholders. 'The risk is, if they wait long enough there will not be a cake,' he said. Preference dividends have not been paid since early 1992, and arrears now stand at Pounds 78m. Net debt eased from Pounds 401.6m to Pounds 394.5m, although the group attributed most of the improvement to exchange rate movements. The group now operates 616 stores in the UK, mainly trading as H Samuel and Ernest Jones, and 909 in the US, where jewellery sales rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 240.8m. The closure of Ratners cut 102 stores from the UK total, the main reason behind UK jewellery sales falling 7 per cent to Pounds 134.8m. UK like-for-like sales were 3 per cent higher. Mr McAdam said the group's reorganisation of the UK side of the business was virtually complete. Signet is now completing the refurbishment of nine H Samuel and five Ernest Jones branches, and plans to refurbish up to 150 stores next year. The basic loss per share was 10.5p (10.9p).</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Graduates 'lack Euro job skills' THE number of UK university graduates finding work in continental Europe remains minimal, the Institute of Manpower Studies, said yesterday. Its report damps speculation that a continental European labour market may be developing. Only 1.4 per cent of graduates with higher degrees find work on the continent, while the figure for students with a first degree is 1.7 per cent. But half the first-degree graduates went into teaching posts, rather than business positions. The increase in recruitment is minimal - 1,266 UK graduates worked in continental Europe in 1991 compared with 1,200 the previous year. Poor language skills were identified as one of the main barriers to finding jobs abroad. They also found that UK graduates lacked the relevant qualifications to satisfy European employers. Students also suffered from relative youth and inexperience compared with European counterparts, and had great difficulty finding out about employment opportunities. France was the most popular destination - possibly because French is the most widely taught language in British schools - and accounted for 39 per cent of all graduates. It was followed by Germany (20 per cent), Belgium (15 per cent), the Netherlands (12 per cent) and Spain (8 per cent). For higher-degree graduates, Germany was the most popular destination. Continental European companies appeared to be highly selective - most of the 105 employers identified as being interested in UK graduates seemed to be targeting individual institutions, and in some cases specific departments. Their links with 'new' universities - the former polytechnics - and with higher education colleges are weaker than those with the old universities. The flow of UK graduates is expected to increase steadily, but not dramatically. The Recruitment of UK Graduates to Work in Continental Europe, IMS Report 248.

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Woolwich more than doubled at Pounds 88m WOOLWICH Building Society, the third biggest society by asset size, yesterday disclosed that it had more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first half of the year helped by a 35 per cent increase in mortgage lending. The society, which will be displaced as the third largest if Leeds Permanent and National &amp; Provincial merge as planned next year, raised pre-tax profit to Pounds 88m (Pounds 36m) despite a 9.8 per cent rise in bad debt provisions to Pounds 72.7m (Pounds 66.2m). Operating profit rose 51 per cent to Pounds 160.6m (Pounds 106.7m). It also disclosed that Woolwich Property Services, the estate agency subsidiary which is one of the largest in the south-east with 257 offices, was trading profitably. Woolwich Property Services incurred a trading loss of Pounds 11m last year, halving the previous loss. Estate agencies are heavily dependent on transaction volumes for profit, and Woolwich said contracted sales were up 20 per cent. Assets increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 24.4bn (Pounds 22.9bn), and gross mortgage lending rose 35 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The increase in lending was partly financed by a 50 per cent rise in net retail receipts to Pounds 390m (Pounds 260m). Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive, said the boost in operating profit partly reflected the depressed state of the housing market last year. But the society was also 'seeing encouraging signs of improvement'. The increase in income, combined with management expenses holding steady at Pounds 155.8m (Pounds 155.4m), lowered the society's comparatively high ratio of cost to income by 10 percentage points to 49.2 per cent (59.3 per cent). The society raised its proportion of funding from wholesale markets to 22.7 per cent (21.7 per cent) as non-retail funds in creased to Pounds 4.9bn (Pounds 4.47bn). Retail funds from savers grew to Pounds 17.9bn (Pounds 17bn).</p>

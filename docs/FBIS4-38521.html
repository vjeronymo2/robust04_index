			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- Keeping the situation calm on  the surface, the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Soviets started  "tempered bickering," believes Crimean president's advisor for  military issues Pyotr Chernyatevich.    Speaking on the phone with a RIA correspondent he claimed  that the Ukrainian parliament traces every move taken by their  Crimean counterparts. Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet has put  today's plenary session on Constitution off from 9 A.M. to 2  P.M., the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet fired back and postponed its  session with a similar agenda from Tuesday to Wednesday.    Despite this wait-and-see policy adopted by Ukraine, says  the  presidential advisor, there are good reasons to hope that the  working group of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will arrive in the  Crimea at long last next Thursday. Only then will it be  possible to bring a definite solution to the long-running  dispute.    In his words, the people in the Crimea keep a watchful eye  on  the developments in anticipation of new moves by Kiev.    The fact that deputy heads of Ukrainian power ministries are  still based in the Crimea only increases psychological tension  on the local population, insists Mr. Chernyatevich.</p>

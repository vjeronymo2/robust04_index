			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report by special NA correspondent] </F>   [Text] Boston, 25 Jun (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo,  Argentine ambassador to the United States, announced today that  "the pharmaceutical patents issue will be resolved before the  end of the month in Washington," probably after a number of  meetings between high-ranking U.S. and Argentine trade officials.    Granillo Ocampo made this remark during an exclusive  interview with the NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency a few minutes  after the conclusion of a World Cup soccer game between the  Argentine and Nigerian teams.    The ambassador went to the stadium, representing President  Carlos Menem. The diplomat said that the president "followed  the game on television" at a hotel in the southern city of New  Orleans.    The ambassador emphasized that "there will be good news" on  the pharmaceutical patents issue, which worries the U.S.  Government because the U.S. laboratories are asking the  Argentine laboratories to pay for intellectual property rights.    Moving on, the diplomat emphasized the significance of a  meeting held yesterday in the White House between Presidents  Menem and Clinton.    The diplomat said: "I would say it was a really superb  meeting due to the issues discussed, the quality of the meeting,  the agreement that existed, and the good news that they gave us  but asked us to keep secret for the time being. [no closing  quotation marks as received]    The ambassador refused to provide any details on the matter,  but admitted that "there is good news on the pharmaceutical  patents issue."    The diplomat announced that a U.S. Government envoy would  travel to Buenos Aires to confirm "that Argentina has awakened  interest here."    The ambassador said: "The person is like a foreign trade  minister, who will go to approve certain trade agreements that  the two countries are in the process of concluding."    Granillo Ocampo believes that the second meeting between  Presidents Bill Clinton and Carlos Menem this year "represents a  recognition of our country, as it was arranged in 10 days and  because top-level U.S. Government officials were present, which  demonstrates that Argentina is being described a country worth  talking to."    Granillo Ocampo stressed: "This also demonstrates that  President Menem is being described as a valid person to talk to,  and that when he is in the United States high-level talks are  held, taking advantage of his presence."</p>

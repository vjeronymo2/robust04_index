			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY URGES DISCLOSURE POLICY  </P> <P> Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig has recommended that secret reports and memos  from his office to the City Council be released to the public only with the  approval of four of the five council members.  </P> <P> The proposal, which was made in a report to the council, will be considered by  the council during its regular meeting on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gillig's recommendation was prompted by criticism from Councilwoman Ann Johs,  who said earlier this month that the city attorney's office generates too many  secret memos.  </P> <P> The city has never had a formal disclosure policy, but Gillig said the  unofficial policy has been to require that four members approve the release of  such documents.  </P> <P> However, in a previous interview, Johs said she believes the policy is too  restrictive. "I think it stinks," she said.  </P> <P> In his report, Gillig said his office submitted 148 confidential reports to the  council, of which 134 related directly to claims against the city, court cases,  potential litigation and personnel issues.  </P> <P> The remaining 14 reports and memos concerned "items of interest to the City  Council and contained legal opinions of the city attorney with  recommendations," the report said.  </P> <P> In his 8 1/2-page report, Gillig discussed at length the question of whether he  represents the entire council, a majority of the council or each individual  council member.  </P> <P> Although he concluded that the council as a collective body is his client, he  decided against requiring a unanimous vote of the council to release secret  documents.  </P> <P> In summary, he said, there is no legal precedent to help him draft a disclosure  policy.  </P> <P> "A compromise between the above proposals would be for City Council to adopt a  policy which requires four votes for disclosure, but there is nothing magical  about that number either," he said in the report.

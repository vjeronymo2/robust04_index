			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR NINE TO OPEN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Harbor will meet San Jose City College today at 1 p.m. in the first round of  the state baseball playoffs at Sacramento City College.  </P> <P> The Seahawks (32-14) earned the spot in the four-team tournament by defeating  Cypress, 2-1, in the Southern Regional final.  </P> <P> If Harbor defeats San Jose (38-13), the North's No. 2 team, it will play the  winner of today's Cerritos-Sacramento game at 3 p.m. Saturday. If the Seahawks,  No. 1 in the South, lose they'll play the loser of that game at 11 a.m.  </P> <P> Either team will be difficult to beat. Sacramento (37-12) is the defending  state champion and Cerritos (39-9), the 1987 state champ, is making its third  straight appearance in the tournament.  </P> <P> Harbor's pitching is a strong point. Pat Ahearne, Chris Garrett and Leonard  Fletcher are the starters and the bullpen is solid with freshmen Tom Fulkerson  and Robert Parga and sophomore John Ingram.  </P> <P> "I feel real good about this team," said Coach Jim O'Brien, who led Harbor to  the state title in 1978 and 1984. "It took us a little while to get going this  season, but now I think we have a great chance of winning this." IRENE GARCIA  </P></p>

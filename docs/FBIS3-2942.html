			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said Russia and the United States should  enter into relations of partnership but both sides should have  their independence.    The minister told the press before his meeting with visiting  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Russian Far  East city of Vladivostok that both Russia and the United States  have no other choice but to enter into relations of partnership.  However, such a relationship does not mean that one party  should restrain its actions while the other enjoys much freedom.    He also rejected the idea that the U.S. is the senior  partner  while Russia is junior.    Russia-U.S. relations fell back in the past two months due  to  their different positions on the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict and  the espionage issue.    The meeting between the two ministers is expected to focus  on  "mending bilateral relations" and on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Middle East issue.    Kozyrev said this meeting will provide a change for the two  countries to establish their relations of strategic partnership  on a mature basis.    He suggested that in establishing relations of partnership,  Russia should not follow every step of the West and Russians  should not have the idea that partnership means no conflict or  problem between the two countries.    He noted that every pragmatic politician must understand two  basic facts. Firstly, Russian is a big nation. Therefore, it  should not be treated as a small brother but as an equal  partner. Secondly, relations of partnership should not sacrifice  Russia's policies of national interest.    The Russian foreign minister criticized the "wild fantasy"  by  some people of regarding the United States as "the sole leader  of the present world."    He said in the present world the U.S is not able to solve  every problem by its own. Russia, though is facing many  difficulties, is still a big power in that it has nuclear  weapons as well as a strong military force, he added.</p>

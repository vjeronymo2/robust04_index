			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Prescott will argue case for BR leasing MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, will argue in a speech tomorrow that freeing British Rail to enter unhindered into lease agreements with private companies would cut the real cost of buying new rolling stock. Mr Prescott, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, will refine his calls for the rules governing BR's access to private finance to be made less restrictive and condemn the government's 'ideologically prejudiced' attitude to the funding of public bodies. Speaking in Llandudno, north Wales, within weeks of BR's expected announcement of an annual loss of Pounds 150m, he will urge the government to accept that the organisation is in financial crisis. Focusing on the planned Pounds 860m upgrading of the west coast main line from Euston to Glasgow, Mr Prescott will explain that a leasing deal would cut costs if the lender could be persuaded to pass on a portion of the tax benefits accruing from the transaction. He will advocate that the estimated Pounds 530m cost of new trains for the line and a new West Midlands maintenance depot be financed by leasing. The Pounds 330m cost of infrastructure improvements should be generated by permitting BR to raise an index-linked bond. Present accounting conventions remove the advantages of such techniques as leasing for public bodies such as BR.</p>

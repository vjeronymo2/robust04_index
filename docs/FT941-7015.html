			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets end on nervous note after week of heavy selling European bonds and stocks ended a hectic week sharply lower yesterday, although the heavy selling of previous days eased. European bonds tumbled again in early trading yesterday after an overnight drop in US Treasuries. But the markets stayed calm, and ended above their lows. 'It wasn't the same panic that gripped the markets Thursday,' said a London bond trader. Stock markets in Europe steadied but remained nervous as they kept a close watch on bond prices. The best performance was in London, where the FT-SE 100 Index closed 13.7 higher at 3,281.2 on the firmness in UK government securities. The UK government bond market posted the biggest gains among European markets yesterday, having lost the most ground the day before. The Liffe March long gilt futures contract ended at 112 13/16 , up of a point. Gilts bounced back from Thursday's lows as investors switched from other European markets, which continued to fall amid bearish sentiment. German 10-year bonds ended nearly a  1/2 point lower while their French counterparts dropped by more than  3/4 of a point. Both markets are expecting fresh long-dated paper to be issued next week which subdued sentiment. According to Salomon Brothers, world government bonds lost 0.95 per cent in local currency terms in the week to Thursday. Although US Treasuries sparked the European sell-off, they ended down 0.88 per cent, outperforming the non-dollar sector which dropped 0.99 per cent. Gilts posted the largest losses on the week to Thursday, falling 3.05 per cent. In London, share prices made uneven progress and investors remained cautious on expectations that the US may again raise interest rates. Trading volumes were moderate. The UK stock market fell by about 3 per cent during the week. 'It's a psychological market that's not driven by any fundamental factors, so it's very hard to predict,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with market analysts IDEA. The recovery in confidence in UK equities was helped by comments from leading analysts that domestic interest rates were unlikely to rise in the near term.

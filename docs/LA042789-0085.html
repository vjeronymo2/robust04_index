			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERAZA KEEPS THE FAITH AT OXNARD  </P> <P> Jerry White did not hesitate to go to bat for George Peraza, his prized  shortstop at Hueneme High, when a counselor expressed concern that Peraza could  not make it in college.  </P> <P> "Here I was trying to encourage him to go to college and this counselor was  telling me I was wasting my time because they did not think he could do college  work," White said.  </P> <P> Peraza not only made it in college -- he graduated from Ventura College and  Nevada Las Vegas -- but he earned master's degrees in both Spanish and physical  education. No one was less surprised by Peraza's achievements than White, who  coached the All-Southern Section shortstop at Hueneme from 1963-65.  </P> <P> "I think he has proven a lot of people wrong over the years because his work  ethic is so tremendous," White said. "I don't think anyone can measure the  amount of heart and the work ethic that George has. I just wish I worked as  hard as George does."  </P> <P> Peraza and White's association did not end after Peraza graduated from Hueneme.  In fact, it was just beginning.  </P> <P> After playing baseball at Ventura College and UNLV, Peraza became White's  assistant coach -- a position he held for 12 years at both Moorpark and Oxnard  colleges.  </P> <P> So, when White -- who compiled a 235-100 record at Oxnard and Moorpark --  resigned last summer as baseball coach at Oxnard, who better to replace him  than Peraza?  </P> <P> "I think he deserved the position," White said.  </P> <P> Oxnard officials eventually agreed with White, but it took them a few months to  reach that decision. Peraza was not hired until September -- after fall  baseball practice and the 1988 school year had begun.  </P> <P> White and Peraza agree that the delay in selecting a head coach hurt Oxnard's  recruiting efforts. Still, Peraza scrambled after being named coach and, as of  Tuesday, had guided Oxnard to fifth place in the 11-team Western State  Conference with a record of 15-13, 10-8 in conference play. The Condors are in  contention for a berth in the WSC's five-team Shaughnessy playoff tournament  that begins Tuesday.  </P> <P> "There are some players who want to know who the head coach is and you are  going to lose people like that, there is no doubt about it," White said of the  recruiting snags. "They have been competitive all year, but throw in two more  pitchers and a postion player here and there and they would have been right up  there."  </P> <P> Peraza, 41, agreed that the delay in naming a successor to White probably cost  Oxnard several key players.  </P> <P> "They could have gone out right away and found a coach, but that's just the way  they do things," Peraza said. "We were lacking two or three key defensive  players and not having a head coach probably cost us about five players who  were necessary to win this thing."  </P> <P> Oxnard Athletic Director Don Brockett said last summer that the delay was  necessary in order to comply with the Ventura County Community College  District's affirmative action policy.  </P> <P> However, the Condors showed no ill effects at the outset of this season. The  team got off to a fast start in conference play but has slipped in the  standings the past two weeks.  </P> <P> A lot was expected of Peraza when he took over for White, who had coached at  Oxnard since 1978, excluding 1986 when he took a sabbatical leave. Oxnard won  five WSC division titles and made eight appearances in the conference playoffs  under White, who had a reputation as a great motivator.  </P> <P> "Jerry has a kind of an aura around him," Peraza said. "He makes you feel like  you want to go out and play every practice and game as hard as you can. He  inspired me in high school and he's still inspiring me."  </P> <P> Peraza, a teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said he is not the same caliber of  motivator that White was, but added that he has developed a good rapport with  his players.  </P> <P> "I am more of a self-motivated type of individual," Peraza said. "I expect my  players to also be self-motivated, but that is not always the case. As coach,  you have to be able to find the right buttons to push."  </P> <P> For the most part, Peraza has been successful in firing up his players.  </P> <P> "He is a real spunky guy, very enthusiastic," said Gil Valencia, a freshman  left fielder from Camarillo High. "No matter who the opponent is, you will  always see that competitive look in his eye."  </P> <P> Vince Ebarb, a freshman catcher from Chaparral High in Las Vegas, said that he  considers Peraza a friend.  </P> <P> "He would do anything for his players and go out on a limb for us any way he  could," Ebarb said. "If I ever got thrown into jail, he is the one I would  call. That's how comfortable I feel with him."  </P> <P> Yet not all the players give high marks to the first-year coach. John Stuart, a  freshman right-handed pitcher, calls Peraza a "tireless guy" but says that he  has made mistakes this season.  </P> <P> "He's not a Jerry White, who I heard was a winner here," Stuart said. "He has  made a lot of mistakes this season, like leaving in a pitcher too long or not  making a decision at the right time. But it's his first year, he will improve."  </P> <P> Peraza said that he is pleased with the Condors' performance this season and he  is confident he can make Oxnard a winner, just like his predecessor.  </P> <P> "I am very confident that I can do the coaching at this level," he said. "I  feel like I've learned enough throughout the years while working with Jerry."  </P> <P> Said White: "I think George has done a good job of getting the fundamentals  across to his team. I have watched him at practice this season and I think he  does a better job with them during practice than we did last year."  </P></p>

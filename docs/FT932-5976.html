			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading football club WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION has won a Pounds 5m design and build contract to redevelop the south stand at West Ham United Football Club in east London. With the football season drawn to a close and West Ham promoted to the Premier League, Wimpey has started work at Upton Park to upgrade the ground. Rebuilding the south stand will nearly double the seating capacity of the stadium creating an additional 7,650 seats. The steel-framed, two-tier stand will be topped with a 36 metre wide roof which will be supported by a 73 metre goal post lattice beam running the length of the stand. As the roof is only propped by columns at each end of the stand, spectators will have an unobstructed view of the pitch. The profile of the lower tier follows a parabolic shape which also maximises the crowd's view of a match. Situated between the two levels, Wimpey is building 19 executive boxes with full catering facilities for up to 200 people. Facilities include club offices and a lounge for the use of supporters. Wimpey's design team is AD Consultants as architect and Jan Bobrowski as structural engineer.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH DOCUMENTARY TO SCREEN AT USC  </P> <P> There will be a free public screening today at 4 p.m. of the Czech  feature-length documentary, "Pictures of the Old World," by Dusan Hanak, at  USC's Norris Auditorium. Acclaimed at its recent AFI Fest screening, this  portrait of indomitable, elderly villagers, living in virtually medieval  conditions yet somehow preserving their humor, energy and optimism, was made in  1973 but not released until 1989.  </P></p>

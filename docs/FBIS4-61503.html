			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Lev </F> Rumyantsev]    [Text] St. Petersburg May 5 TASS -- "The head of the  Swedish Government agreed with me on the need to establish a  post of a commissioner for human rights and national minorities  in the states of the Baltic Sea," Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev told a news conference devoted to the results of  his meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt today.    When discussing the condition of the Russian speaking  population in the Baltic countries, the Russian foreign minister  noted, both sides came to the conclusion that this is an  all-European problem and it must be settled in strict accordance  with the norms of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE) and the generally recognized human standards.    In reply to a question why Estonia does not wish to follow  the Latvian way in the talks with Russia, Carl Bildt said that  the situation in Estonia was more complex. However, he noted,  with a goodwill [as received] from both sides it is possible to  reach a compromise. At least, the conclusion of a package of  agreements between Russia and Latvia may serve an example for  other states.    The Russian foreign minister and the Swedish premier drew  attention to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina which sharpened  again. According to them, the world community should take  urgent constructive measures so that the situation around the  town of Brcko did not get out of control. Otherwise, it will be  practically impossible to return to the peaceful development of  the events there.    Andrey Kozyrev and Carl Bildt believe that their working  meeting in St. Petersburg was a success. They stated that  similar dialogues should be continued.</p>

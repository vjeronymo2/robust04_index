			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Argentine trade gap wider than predicted MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, has admitted that this year's trade deficit is likely to be far larger than he estimated less than three weeks ago. In a speech to businessmen on Monday, he also warned that economic integration with Brazil was at risk. Mr Cavallo said that he now expected a deficit of Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.4bn in 1992, after forecasting last month a deficit of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m). Argentina has not seen a trade deficit since 1981 and in 1991 ran a Dollars 3.87bn surplus. Mr Cavallo had said a deficit was no cause for concern, as it would be covered by capital inflows or would force an adjustment in the domestic economy. However, last month he increased industry's protection from foreign competition by trebling to 10 per cent a tax on nearly all imports, to try to slow shipments from Brazil, Argentina's partner in the Mercosur trade pact. Mr Cavallo warned in his speech that economic instability in Brazil was making integration impossible.</p>

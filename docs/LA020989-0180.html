			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SOME ADVERTISERS SHYING AWAY FROM TRASH TV PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Although a Geraldo Rivera special on Satanism or a "reality" program that  re-enacts a brutal murder may be OK for Raid bug spray, the people behind  Campbell's Soup, Apple Computers and Kellogg's Frosted Flakes don't hold the  same opinion.  </P> <P> Those family items are among a long list of products that advertisers don't  want associated with so-called "trash TV" or "tabloid TV" -- the new breed of  sensationalistic programs that include "America's Most Wanted," "A Current  Affair," some installments of "Oprah" or "Donahue," and just about anything  with the name "Geraldo" in the credits. Some advertisers with a wholesome image  to maintain are studiously avoiding this newest TV plague.  </P> <P> But even though these advertisers are trashing trash TV, local TV stations say  advertiser backlash will not kill off tabloid TV.  </P> <P> Some station managers charge that advertisers who just say no to trash TV -- a  hot topic at last week's National Assn. of Television Producers and Executives  convention in Houston -- are blatantly self-serving.  </P> <P> "I believe what we hear and see (about advertisers rejecting tabloid TV) is  indicative of a completely ulterior motive," asserted Steven Gigliotti,  director of sales for KCBS-TV, which airs "Inside Edition" and "Geraldo." "It's  a negotiating ploy to help enhance their position in the market."  </P> <P> Gigliotti believes that, although "about 3%" of advertisers will not buy time  on trash TV, most who adopt a holier-than-tabloid attitude are merely jockeying  for a better price.  </P> <P> "There's an (advertising) agency in town . . . that has indicated that it  doesn't want to put its clients on 'Geraldo,' " Gigliotti said. "The fact is,  'Geraldo' is the show that we charge the most for. They're hoping that our  account executive will deal a very desirable rate to get them to buy the show.  </P> <P> "I'm sure when I leave, and the ABC (marketing executive) walks in, they say  the same thing about Oprah Winfrey's show. It's just a ploy to take away our  trump card."  </P> <P> Greg Nathanson and Bill McGowan, station manager and general manager,  respectively, of Fox-owned station KTTV, home of "America's Most Wanted," "A  Current Affair" and "The Reporters," agreed. "They (advertisers) will try any  trick they can," said McGowan. Nathanson added that networks that don't feature  one of the highly rated tabloid shows have a vested interest in tarnishing the  image of their competitors.  </P> <P> The issue of advertiser rejection surfaced at the programmers' convention, the  annual site where television syndicators market their wares. The reason: This  year's new shows for syndication include 'Crime Diaries," "Crimestoppers 800,"  "The Investigators" and "Crimewatch" (which will appear on KCOP-Channel 13 if  sold to enough other stations nationwide to get clearance) and the aptly titled  "Tabloid" from Paramount Television.  </P> <P> Companies refusing to buy time on most such programs include General Foods USA,  McDonald's and Campbell's Soup Co., a client of BBDO/New York, which rejects  tabloid TV for all of its clients. Others, including Kellogg's, are unlikely to  advertise on shows dealing with the titillating topics currently in vogue on  "Geraldo."  </P> <P> At the convention, some syndicators reportedly expressed fears that there won't  be enough advertiser support to get the new tabloid shows on the air.  </P> <P> "It's really going to be a problem," said Larry Blasius, vice president and  associate director of network programming for BBDO/New York. "I would think you  couldn't put 13 of those shows on and expect them all to be gobbled up by  advertising."  </P> <P> But plenty of advertisers are still gobbling, said Michael Eigner, vice  president and station manager of KTLA-TV Channel 5, which telecasts Rivera's  occasional specials. "If anything, there's a premium on those shows," Eigner  said. "There are certain clients that are prone to stay away, but there are  others that will jump to them, because they don't mind the controversy and like  the high ratings."  </P> <P> The Wisconsin-based S. C. Johnson Co., for example, has no problem with tabloid  TV, believing stations, not advertisers, should decide what is in good taste.  Gus Priemer, an advertising consultant for the company, said S. C. Johnson  purchased time on the recent NBC Rivera special on Satanism.  </P> <P> Among Johnson's heavily advertised products are Glade air freshener and Raid  and Off insect sprays -- and Priemer said killing bugs doesn't require the  company to maintain a family image.  </P> <P> Channel 5's Eigner acknowledges that certain tabloid shows present a public  relations problem. "I think you have to get the advertisers to view a show, "  he said. "Sometimes it's good to get the hosts of the shows in contact with the  advertisers and see if their views change."  </P> <P> KCOP president and general manager Bill Frank said that the station did not  worry about purchasing the new "Crimewatch," because he expects advertisers  will judge the show on its own merits. "It is more of a news show than a pure  tabloid show," he said. While he acknowledged that some advertisers have shied  away from "A Current Affair" and "Inside Edition," he believes they will give  the new shows a chance. "I don't think they (advertisers) judge a show ahead of  time unless the title is so outrageous that they might be scared," Frank said.  </P> <P> The station managers pointed out that advertisers boycotting tabloid television  are the same group that avoid any controversial show. "Kellogg's is advertising  primarily to kids," said KTTV's Nathanson. "They would have a list (of shows to  avoid) that would contain half the shows on television."  </P> <P> Advertisers such as Kellogg's that steer clear of sex, violence and Geraldo  also may avoid non-exploitative programs dealing with sensitive topics such as  politics and religion. Paul Mulcahy, Campbell's Soup Co. vice president of  advertising, said that the biggest negative viewer reaction the company ever  got was when the company advertised during a CBS documentary on Central  America.  </P> <P> Mulcahy noted that popular taste determines what advertisers consider  controversial. Daytime soaps, once considered too steamy for some advertisers,  are now routinely accepted; with the advent of Geraldo and Morton Downey Jr.,  many consider Winfrey and Donahue tame offerings.  </P> <P> Station managers concede that if the new tabloid shows become even more  sensational, it could blight the reputation of existing shows -- such as it is.  And KCBS' Gigliotti noted that advertisers could also begin to reject these  programs because despite their high rating, tabloid shows tend to draw a  downscale audience. Gigliotti said the ideal advertiser's show is still a  program like "60 Minutes," which gets both high ratings and upscale viewers.  </P> <P> In the meantime, said KTTV's Nathanson, "I wish all of our inventory was as  easy to sell as 'A Current Affair' and 'The Reporters.' And if they gave me  'Oprah Winfrey,' I'd be very happy to have it too."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR PARENTS: SITTER SEARCH;  </P> <P> DESPITE DAY CARE, BABY-SITTERS STILL A NECESSITY OF CHILD RAISING  </P> <P> Should the word "baby-sitter" slither into conversation, my four children can  dazzle an audience with embellished tales, complete with sound effects, of the  individuals who have graciously augmented my role as caretaker over the past 18  years.  </P> <P> "Remember the one with red-hair who whistled nonstop the theme from 'High Noon'  and let us have dessert first?"  </P> <P> "How about Jennifer and Katie who had the pet gila monster?"  </P> <P> While society has made strides in providing care for children while their  parents work, the difficulty of finding competent baby-sitters to assist on  evenings, weekends and while out of town persists.  </P> <P> Trading services is the obvious and most reasonable method of arranging  baby-sitting. When our first child arrived, we were living in a married student  housing unit with a sophisticated, and well-managed baby-sitting cooperative.  We watched other children and their parents, in return, watched our daughter.  </P> <P> Over the years, in less-formal arrangements, our home, at times, has been a  drop-in center, and I have had the services returned.  </P> <P> We have had children sometimes stay with us while their parents were out of  town. I have especially found this arrangement helpful with teen-agers, who I  don't believe should be left unsupervised during those times.  </P> <P> For caring for small children for short periods, students are a blessing.  </P> <P> Junior high students (an age group I came to know well as a teacher) can be  ideal sitters for youngsters past the age of six months. I feel that these  sitters are optimal for three reasons: 1) they operate with a certain degree of  anxiety and, therefore, they are cautious; 2) they tend to play with the child  rather than allow the television to supervise and 3) they are frequently more  available to help out since their social life is rather restricted.  </P> <P> If you don't know any sitters in this age group, you might try calling the  counseling office at a nearby junior high for the names of interested students.  </P> <P> I am hesitant, however, to engage teen-agers during the week. Perhaps, it is  the teacher in me, but I feel guilty asking a young person to supervise my  children, prepare dinner, and read bedtime stories on nights when their  schoolwork requires attention.  </P> <P> When I have needed a sitter during the week, I've turned to baby-sitting  agencies with success. I preface my remarks about these agencies by noting that  while a student myself, I worked for one. This month we will attend the wedding  of a young man I once baby-sat. I well remember his mother's remark when I  asked how she came to use an agency. Her experience had been that the agencies  sent people who were well-interviewed, bonded and reliable.  </P> <P> Rates for agency sitters in North County vary, depending on number of children  and where you live. For one to two children, expect to pay $20 to $28 for a  three-hour minimum and $4 for each additional hour. For a 24-hour period,  expect to pay $70 or more. There is often an additional charge for sick-child  care. The agencies, which are listed under baby sitters in the yellow pages,  can give you specifics. Information on sitter services for developmentally  disabled children is available at 574-6481.  </P> <P> I have always required that the agencies send a nonsmoker to our home and asked  that the television not be turned on during the day or until the children were  sleeping at night. Over the years, we have had wonderful women spend time with  our children, reading books and sharing tales about growing up in Arkansas or  their family ranch in Montana.  </P> <P> On other occasions, I have used baby-sitting agencies in other cities when  staying in hotels. The concierge at most major hotels can be most helpful in  arranging for sitters.  </P> <P> One summer, I advertised for a sitter a month prior to our vacation in a  Michigan newspaper, stating the hours, pay, and children's ages. I received a  dozen replies to my ad and had a charming college student from a farming  community spend time with the children. Having employed her two young sisters  in the past five years as well, we have been enriched by the added enjoyment of  involving this family in our summer.  </P> <P> I have often used colleges, churches and temples as resources for baby-sitters.  One can call the college student employment office, which frequently has a list  of sitters or will place a note on a bulletin board for you. Expect to pay $5  an hour for college sitters. At UCSD, call 534-4500; at USIU, call 693-4700; at  Cal State San Marcos, call 471-4145.  </P> <P> Young student couples, sometimes with one child or two, can be ideal candidates  for baby-sitting. We still list our favorite family as the young law student,  his wife and baby who have stayed at our home while we have been out of town.  They came to us with a referral from a friend who knew them from church. In  addition to playing with our little ones, the couple is young enough to still  be wise to teen-agers and are firm with house rules.  </P> <P> My kitchen cupboards are shrouded in instructions noting the day's schedule for  each child, suggested meals, house rules, telephone numbers and a medical  release form when we leave town. I keep meals extremely simple, suggest the use  of paper products to cut down on dishes, try to make carpool arrangements and  make it clear to our children that I expect perfect cooperation.  </P> <P> When you have found good sitters, treat them well, and you'll find they'll be  there when you need them. Use good judgment when asking for the name of someone  else's sitter: that person went to the trouble of finding them and you need to  respect that. Don't take a friend's sitter on as your own without first  checking back with your friend.  </P> <P> Lastly, there is an unwritten rule regarding baby-sitting, which a friend  refers to as "my universal open-ended pay-back program." This is the type of  baby-sitting one does with no regard to direct reciprocation.  </P> <P> One simply helps a friend who needs respite from children or finds themselves  in a "jam." Our family has been rewarded on several occasions when these  children have spent time in our home.  </P></p>

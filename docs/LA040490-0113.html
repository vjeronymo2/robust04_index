			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SIKH GROUP BOMBS HINDU PARADE; 32 DIE  </P> <P> Sikh extremists set off a bomb near a Hindu religious procession in Punjab on  Tuesday, killing at least 32 people and triggering clashes between the two  communities, police said.  </P> <P> A police officer died and five were injured as they tried to quell the unrest,  and 15 more people were killed in violence elsewhere in Punjab.  </P> <P> Witnesses said a procession of 14,000 Hindus, celebrating the birthday of their  deity Rama, had reached a crowded vegetable market in Batala when the bomb went  off on a bicycle or scooter.  </P> <P> S. S. Channi, deputy commissioner of Gurdaspur district, imposed an indefinite  curfew on Batala, an industrial town of 100,000 people in the north of the  state.  </P> <P> Police said the blast was almost certainly the work of the Khalistan Commando  Force, Babbar Khalsa and the Khalistan Liberation Force -- a powerful new  coalition of extremist groups fighting for an independent homeland in Punjab.  </P> <P> They said shrapnel from the bomb killed 10 people in the procession including a  5-year-old girl watching it with her parents. At least 50 others were taken to  the hospital with serious injuries.  </P> <P> The girl's mother was among 15 others who died at a Batala hospital shortly  afterward. Seven more of the injured were sent for care 21 miles to the Sikh  holy city of Amritsar, where they died.  </P> <P> After the blast, Hindus rampaged through the market trying to set fire to  vehicles and shops owned by Sikhs.  </P> <P> Police fired in the air to enforce the curfew and to control fighting that had  broken out between the two groups, senior police Supt. S. K. Goyal said.  </P> <P> Goyal said one police officer was killed and five were injured in the clashes.  </P> <P> Hindus are targets of the extremist campaign in Punjab, in which some 670  people have died this year alone as Sikhs battle for a homeland they call  Khalistan -- Land of the Pure.  </P> <P> Sikhs are in a majority in Punjab but make up only 16 million of India's total  population of 829 million, of which most are Hindus.  </P></p>

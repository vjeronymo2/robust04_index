			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trelleborg tumbles 78% TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, yesterday reported a 78 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr512m (Dollars 84m) for 1991, but decided to maintain an unchanged dividend of SKr6.50 a share, writes John Burton in Stockholm. The board proposes a one-for-five rights issue to raise SKr913m. The funds would be used for investments in foreign mining operations as well as to finance possible acquisitions. Sales for the group fell by 15 per cent to SKr21.5bn, reflecting the slowdown in the construction industry and weaker metal prices. Mining units Boliden Mineral and Boliden International suffered losses of SKr62m and SKr23m respectively.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Car sales show slight recovery West European new car sales rose by 6.3 per cent to 1.029m in January compared with the same month in 1993, according to provisional figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, writes Kevin Done. The increase ends 12 successive monthly declines, but the scale of recovery remains modest, as sales in January 1993 were very depressed, having fallen 23 per cent from the previous year. New car sales fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent in the whole of 1993 to 11.45m, the steepest annual decline in the post-war period. Most industry forecasts suggest a marginal 1-2 per cent recovery this year. The increase in January was led by a significant rise in the UK, where new car registrations jumped by 20 per cent year-on-year, and by rises of 15 per cent in France and an estimated 28 per cent in Spain. By contrast, sales declined further by 10 per cent in Italy and were estimated to have risen by only 2 per cent in Germany, the single largest market in Europe.</p>

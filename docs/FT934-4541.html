			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Businesses face tax shake-up Thousands of new businesses will be affected by the Inland Revenue's new system of self-assessment for taxes as soon as next year, officials said yesterday. Under proposals unveiled in the Budget any business started after next April 5 will be assessed for tax on the profits earned in its first year, rather than on the prior-year basis which is used now. Existing businesses will continue to pay tax on a prior-year basis in 1994-95, but will then start to be affected by transitional arrangements under which tax will be based on average profits from the current and preceding years. Up to 9m taxpayers, about half self-employed, will start to receive new tax returns under the self-assessment plan from April 1997. Surveys by the Revenue suggest that up to two-thirds of the self-employed and a smaller proportion of other taxpayers will take full advantage of the new system. They will be expected to return payments and tax forms by January 31 in the year after their tax year. Final settlement will be expected by the following July 31. The remainder of taxpayers will be free to continue asking the Revenue to assess their liability but must return their tax forms earlier, by September 30 after the end of their tax year. Revenue officials said yesterday they intended to launch consultation with professional bodies on a system to obtain rulings in disputed cases.</p>

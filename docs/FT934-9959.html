			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italy's 30-year domestic bond move well received ITALY'S first 30-year domestic government bond has been warmly greeted by investors, in spite of political tensions which have depressed the lira and bond prices. The new bond, due later this month, takes Italy into the select group of western industrialised states which have issued such long maturities. Until the 1990s, most domestic bonds issued by the Rome government were either short-term fixed-income treasury bills lasting up to a year or longer-term floating-rate paper. Although bankers had speculated last week that the Treasury was about to break new ground, the 30-year bond was by no means certain in view of the sudden upsurge in political tension over the future of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the government of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Treasury officials suggested the decision to issue remained finely poised until virtually the last minute. But the treasury was encouraged to take the plunge by investors' appetite for relatively high coupon debt. Interest rates on bonds have fallen sharply in the past 12 months, with that on 10-year fixed rate government securities, hitherto the longest, falling by virtually half to about 7 per cent. The new bond remains something of an experiment. The initial issue size is a relatively cautious L2,000bn, with a gross coupon of 9 per cent. If successful, it is likely to be followed by further tranches to create the sort of liquidity essential to international investors. Italy has already dabbled with 30-year maturities. In September, it launched a Dollars 5.5bn global dollar bond, the world's biggest, which had a 30-year component. The global bond was the most conspicuous example of the treasury's much more ambitious borrowing policy and reflects recent successes in tackling the chronic budget deficit and inflation.</p>

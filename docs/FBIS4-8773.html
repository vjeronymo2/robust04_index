			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In the organization of the Ministry for  Information, a Sarajevo-Gorazde radio bridge was established  today for domestic and foreign reporters. Mediha Colo has  compiled a report based on the information collected this way.    [Colo] The reporters were acquainted with the situation in  Gorazde this afternoon by Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the  Gorazde assembly:    [Ohranovic] Gorazde is going through the worst day since the  offensive started. The town is disappearing from the face of  the earth. I have no words to describe what is happening here  today. It is impossible to reach the killed and the wounded, so  we are unable to give the exact number. The Gorazde citizens  that are still alive are wondering whether they have been  condemned to death by the international community. One of the  facts that speak to that effect is that General Rose's monitors  have fled Gorazde without our knowledge. I believe that this  fact confirms the full ruthlessness of the international  community.    [Colo] The foreign reporters insisted on speaking with one  of the representatives of the international institutions that  have remained in Gorazde, but Esad Ohranovic said:    [Ohranovic] They do not want to speak to reporters or the  international community. They told us that they were forbidden  to do so.    [Colo] One of the reporters' questions referred to today's  situation in the Gorazde war hospital.    [Ohranovic] The hospital is being shelled at the moment from  three directions, so one cannot really count the number of  shells landing on the hospital. All the surrounding buildings,  residential areas are on fire. This must be the worst day from  the beginning of the offensive. One can no longer count the  number of shells landing.    [Colo] The tanks are in the town, Mr. Ohranovic said. Asked  how many there were, he said:    [Ohranovic] It is hard to say, but there are somewhere  between 20 to 40 tanks, it depends on the shelling of the town.    [Colo] How far away are they from the center?    [Ohranovic] Depends, from 500 to 600 meters.    [Colo] We know you have been unable to tell us so far, but  can you say now where the front line is?    [Ohranovic] It is in the town itself. From the direction of  Ustipraca, that is some 100 meters from the petrol station, and  [words indistinct] from the hospital, and on the right side --  you probably know Gorazde -- in the direction of Cajnice, that  is around the bus station.

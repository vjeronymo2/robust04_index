			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Efficiency league table of water and sewage companies ANGLIAN Anglian is in a solid position on waste-water efficiency, according to Ofwat figures. Forecast range for K of between 1.5 and 2, which could still be a tough target given capital expenditure requirements. NORTHUMBRIAN Heavy spending requirements leave this company in a combative mood, particularly when it comes to Ian Byatt's assumptions on asset values. Forecasts on K range from 2.5 to 2.9. NORTH WEST Does well out of Ofwat's methodology. Has the added perk of an agreed 7 per cent rate of return on Pounds 360m of its Pounds 2.75bn in cap ex, from 1995 to 2000. The forecast range of K is from 2 to 2.6. SEVERN TRENT Severn has escaped the cost burden of coastal regulation but argues strongly it must spend to maintain standards of discharging into inland waterways. Cap expenditure estimated at Pounds 2.25bn to the year 2000, with estimates for K ranging from a negative 2 to positive 0.3. SOUTHERN Southern's bias towards waste-water and its coastal exposure will encourage a more generous K. Capital spending targets are estimated to have fallen from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.1bn. K forecasts range from 2.5 to 4.55. SOUTH WEST Worth watching for capital spending reductions in this peninsular Tory heartland. K forecasts range from 3.4 to 6.6. THAMES Unimpressive performance on efficiency could result in tougher targets. Thames's capital spending is not estimated to rise significantly. The most pessimistic are looking for a K of minus 1, while the optimists are going for a positive 1.45. WELSH Most expect Welsh's strong balance sheet will give Ofwat more room to put pressure on financial ratios such as debt to equity and interest cover. Forecasts for K range from 0 to a negative 4. WESSEX Does well in the water-supply efficiency test. The group is making significant strides in sludge disposal reducing its need to dump off-shore. But there is still a substantial coastline to deal with. Forecasts for K range from 1 to 1.6. YORKSHIRE The company's respectable performance on efficiency is expected to leave it with an average target. The capital spending burden estimated at Pounds 1.75bn to the year 2000 is forecast to leave it with a K of 1.2 to 2.85. Information based on report by NatWest Securities</p>

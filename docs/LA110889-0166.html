			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GUN STUNS BETTORS AT BRITISH TRACKS;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: OFFICIALS ON LOOKOUT FOR SCI-FI WEAPON THAT MAY HAVE BEEN USED TO  DISABLE A HORSE IN MIDSTRIDE.  </P> <P> A cartoon in the Times of London showed a woman walking up to a betting window  and telling the ticket seller: "Ten pounds to win on any horse that's deaf."  </P> <P> The Jockey Club doesn't think it's funny, and that's why Britain's race tracks  are on the lookout for the ultrasonic stunner, a sci-fi contraption that may be  capable of affecting horse races from the stands.  </P> <P> The Jockey Club, which oversees horse racing in the United Kingdom, told the  Racecourse Assn. today to come up with ways of stopping the stun gun, detailed  in a London drug conspiracy trial.  </P> <P> "It is recognized that there is the possibility it could upset horses during a  race," a club statement said. Anyone found with such a device at a track will  be prosecuted, the club said.  </P> <P> The statement represented a turnaround for the club and the latest development  in a week of bizarre events touching both the soul and the wallets of a nation  dedicated to fair play and deeply in love with horse racing and betting on the  races. Almost 10,000 Britons attend horse racing each day, and about 5,200  races are run each year, according to Jockey Club figures.  </P> <P> The gun, which looks like a pair of binoculars but hides a high-powered  ultrasonic transmitter, allegedly was used to stun Ile de Chypre as the horse  was racing toward victory in last year's King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot.  </P> <P> Ile de Chypre finished ninth in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park last  Saturday.  </P> <P> Greville Starkey, the jockey who last year was thrown from Ile de Chypre, says  tests show the gun works. The Jockey Club, which initially expressed its  doubts, said Starkey's remarks made it think again.  </P> <P> "It seemed prudent to ask race courses to look at the ramifications of this  device, despite there being no independent evidence available," David Pipe, the  club's spokesman, said.  </P> <P> The club, in a statement to the nation's 59 flat and steeplechase courses, said  it still wanted to conduct its own tests to see how the gun worked.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it said, security should be stepped up and plans drawn to combat the  high-pitched intrusion, which witnesses have said cannot be heard by humans but  sounds like a firecracker going off in a horse's ear.  </P> <P> "Consequently, the stewards have asked the Racecourse Assn. to consider the  security implications and to recommend any necessary additions to the Jockey  Club general instructions," the club said. "In the meantime, security  arrangements remain the responsibility of racecourses after consultation with  the local police."  </P> <P> All of this concern stems from a drug trial involving three London area men  that drew scant attention until a week ago.  </P> <P> James Laming, one of the defendants, testified that he developed the gun to fix  races or, as it is known here, to "nobble horses."  </P> <P> Describing himself as not a genius but an ingenious man, Laming testified that  he invented the gun with some basic knowledge in electronics and help from the  Encyclopaedia Britannica. Containing a 22-watt amplifier and miniature  loudspeakers, the ultrasonic gun, which looks like the front of a jet engine,  can direct a high-pitched blast directly into a horse's ear, the court was  told.  </P> <P> Prosecutors charge that the gun was financed by $16,000 from a cocaine  distribution racket. Laming and his co-defendants admit developing the gun with  the intention of fixing races but deny the drug charge.  </P> <P> The defendants also say they only used the gun once, on Ile de Chypre, and did  not bet on that race. Laming said he was caught before he had a chance to use  the gun again.  </P></p>

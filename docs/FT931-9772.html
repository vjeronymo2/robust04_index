			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kone earnings lifted by elevator operations KONE saw profits after financial items rise 7 per cent to FM478.9m (Dollars 89m) in 1992, thanks to a recession-resistant performance from its core elevator activities. Sales expanded 12 per cent to FM11.3bn, reflecting acquisitions and the weakening of the Finnish markka. Dividends are unchanged at FM9 per A share and FM10 per B share. Earnings per share rose to FM51.45 from FM43.88. The group said demand for elevators and cranes continued to decline in Europe, its main market, and North America's share of overall business was down. But maintenance business grew worldwide and new equipment sales benefited from strong growth in Asia Pacific. Kone's elevators business lifted sales to FM8.3bn from FM7.1bn, with maintenance business, which is more recession proof than new business, accounting for as much as 60 per cent of the total. Kone said it had decided to de-list its shares from the Stockholm stock exchange because of low volume.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Amsterdam The stock exchange will shrug off nearly 400 years of tradition when it opens for business on Friday with a Fl 8m (Dollars 4.3m) computerised equity trading system designed to increase Amsterdam's share of the market in Dutch stocks, writes Martin Brice. Currently, between 40 and 60 per cent of trades in Dutch stocks are made in London. Central to the development of the new system is a decision to change the role of Amsterdam's time-honoured system of jobbers or hoekmen. In future, they will concentrate on retail trades, and new electronic screens will handle wholesale dealing. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

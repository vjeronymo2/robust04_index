			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellery Minister Bernd  Schmidbauer has confirmed that the German Government has known  "for some time" about the construction of a weapons arsenal in  Tahunah, Libya, near the capital, Tripoli. It passed on its  information to the "competent body of the German Bundestag,"  the minister said in Bonn on Thursday [3 March]. Investigations  are being conducted into whether German companies have  "contributed" to the construction of the project, "in awareness  of the use to be made of it."    In close coordination with foreign partners, the German  Government has pursued "all available information" about the  construction of the project and "taken all necessary measures."  According to Schmidbauer, this has "caused considerable  difficulties for building the structure." [passage omitted]</p>

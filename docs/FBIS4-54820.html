			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of </F> deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by an  unidentified correspondent; date and place not given -- from the  "U Potrazi" program]    [Text] [Correspondent] Our guest tonight is Ivan Bender,  chairman of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna's parliament.    Why was the parliament of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina not in session last week, between 28 and 30  April as announced ?    [Bender] We had several discussions with the Muslim side and  we agreed that the constituent assembly should take place at the  end of April. However, the Muslim side did not respect the  agreement and the assembly did not take place because there was  nothing to discuss. We should begin implementing the agreement  in principle -- the selection of cadres and demarcation on the  ground -- and we should adopt the constitution.    [Correspondent] There are two problems regarding the  selection of cadres: Things seem to be stuck in connection with  the posts of the president of the federation and the prime  minister.    [Bender] This is a problem because the Muslim side wants to  keep both the post of the president of the federation and the  post of the premier. This is not logical and we have made our  standpoints clear through the presidency of the Croatian  Democratic Union [HDZ] and the presidential council of  Herceg-Bosna. We cannot change this and there is no reason why  we should. One of the top posts must be given to the Croats.  In this case it is a priority, having in mind that Alija  Izetbegovic has been the president of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina for four years now. If we want to have some  kind of continuity as we have said earlier then it is logical  that the Croats should have 50 percent of the posts in the  Federation in the forthcoming period.    [Correspondent] What do you have to say about Alija  Izetbegovic's appeal to President Tudjman, urging the  implementation of the Washington agreement, if you think that  the Muslim side does not want to implement the initial steps as  far as the constitution is concerned.    [Bender] I believe that it is an attempt to relegate  responsibility from the Muslim side to us Croats. I believe  that the world will find it easy to see through this attempt.  At our last meeting in Sarajevo, which was attended by Mr.  Silajdzic with his team and by us from Herceg-Bosna it was  obvious... [pauses] The U.S. envoy was present there as well as  the Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They attended  the meeting and they could see for themselves. We gave our  proposals and an alternative while the Muslims did not.    [Bender] Consequently, one can see -- I can state in clear  terms -- that the Muslims are not interested in implementing the  agreement. If they were interested they would take steps, as it  is their turn now. We agreed that they should convene the next  meeting of our working groups so we can embark on the next round  of talks.    [Correspondent] Why should they do it?    [Bender] Because it was we who requested and organized both  meetings. It is Silajdzic's turn, that is, his team and Alija  Izetbegovic. We expect, we are willing, to continue talks  wherever and whenever. But these talks should be within the  framework of the constitution and the agreement. By no means  can we go beyond this.    [Correspondent] Mr. Bender, both you and President Zubak as  well as the chairman of the executive board of the Croatian  Democratic Community, Markovic, frequently stress that you are  not going to tolerate a situation in which Croat cadres in the  federation are appointed by someone else. What are you referring  to, precisely?    [Bender] I believe that everyone is aware that the HDZ is  the  only legal and legitimate representative of the Croats in the  area of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna. It is logical then that all the rights to elect  and appoint cadres to any position and represent the Croats are  vested in the HDZ.    [Correspondent] Who does want to manage cadres instead of  the  HDZ? Tell us explicitly.    [Bender] There are attempts by those people in the so-called  HNV [Croat National Council], headed by Ivo Komsic, to  appropriate some kind of right at their talks with Sarajevo's  HDZ city branch. We have been present there on three occasions.  One should listen to these people and understand what they  think about that tiny bunch who gather there and call themselves  representatives of the HNV. The leadership of the HDZ Sarajevo  city branch are firmly in line with the policy of the HDZ and  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    [Correspondent] Who supports the HNV and its policy of  appointing cadres, as you say?    [Bender] In our area, I believe, no one supports them. I  also firmly believe that the HNV's policy and that tiny bunch  who call themselves HNV are behind everything that is going on  in the area of our state of Croatia.    [Presenter] And lastly, what next?    [Bender] I believe that it is in the interest of both the  Muslims and the Croats to try and implement this skeletal  agreement, the Washington agreements and our constitution. Over  the next few days we are going to wait and see what the other  side does. We must make use of this period of cease-fire and  consolidate our ranks. We must primarily improve some things in  our army, in our police and in political life and the economy.  Wherever it is possible, production should be revived. I  believe that our visits, ranging from president Zubak to  Markovic and everyone else among us who is touring the area, we  must implement some things on the ground. [sentence as heard] We  must return to the creation of living conditions.</p>

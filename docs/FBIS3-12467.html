			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Samir </F> Ghawshah, by Sa'id Mu'addi, place and date not given; from the  "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO  Executive Committee: The PLO leadership is continuing its  consultations with all parties. Does this mean this decision  will be crucial and decisive for the peace process?    [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership is continuing its contacts on  all levels and in more than one area, whether on the Arab or  international levels. In the meantime, the PLO leadership is  pursuing political activity on all levels. We would like to say  that the support extended to us and the denunciation and  condemnation of the massacre perpetrated against our people in  Hebron are indications that the world understands and  sympathizes with the just Palestinian demands. Moreover, we  believe that much of the future of the political process hinges  upon the positions to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government  and on the measures and positions that will be taken toward the  Palestinian demands for the sake of advancing the peace process  and extricating it from the vicious circle. I think the  experience of the past months clearly showed that it was the  Palestinian side which was serious in its quest for peace,  termination of all acts of violence, withdrawal, and coexistence  for all peoples in the region.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the peace cosponsors--Russia and the  United States--are mediating an end to the causes which stopped  the peace talks. Yesterday, a Russian envoy met with Yasir  'Arafat and will meet today with the decisionmakers in Israel.  What conditions has the PLO conveyed to the Russian envoy?    [Ghawshah] During yesterday's meeting, the Russian envoy and  brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] discussed in detail the peace  process and the obstacles facing it, especially the recent  developments. The most important point of discussion was the  need to provide protection and security for our people,  especially after it has been proven that the Israeli Army did  not and will not carry out its duty in preventing attacks on our  people. The two sides discussed the obstacles facing the peace  process and Israel's failure to carry out its commitments as  stated in the Declaration of Principles. These included its  delay of withdrawal from the Jericho and Gaza areas, earlier  scheduled for 13 December. The entire peace process was  discussed. A basic Palestinian demand was submitted; namely,  the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian  people and international observers to guarantee this security.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, when do you expect the  Israeli-Palestinian talks to resume and what about the  Palestinian delegation which will leave for Washington?    [Ghawshah] The matter depends primarily on the measures and  policies to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government. This is  the issue. The first fact which should be considered is the  degree of seriousness in taking measures and responding to the  Palestinian people's just demands. This is the first basic  factor. The second is the extent to which the cosponsors of the  political process will play their role and give a new push to  the peace process.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO Executive  Committee. Thank you very much.    [Ghawshah] Thank you.</p>

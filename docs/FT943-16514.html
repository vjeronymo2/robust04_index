			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming chiefs paid more than Pounds 1.5m Two executives of Robert Fleming Holdings, the investment bank, were paid more than Pounds 1.5m in the year to March 31 1994, while a third senior executive earned a little more than Pounds 1m, according to the company's annual report. A further five senior executives received total remuneration of between Pounds 525,000 and Pounds 795,000. In addition loans to directors nearly doubled in the year, with Pounds 4.1m to 22 directors outstanding at year-end, up from Pounds 2.5m in April 1993. Fleming saw pre-tax profits rise by 97 per cent to Pounds 209.9m in that period. In 1992-93 the highest paid executive was paid a total remuneration of Pounds 955,000, with the next highest receiving Pounds 815,000. Overall, the total remuneration paid to Fleming's 26 executive directors in 1993-94 rose by 50 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, against Pounds 7.8m in the comparable period. Of that, Pounds 8.2m represented performance related pay. In the previous year, senior executives received a far more modest Pounds 4.1m in preformance related pay. The annual report only details performance related bonuses to executive directors, although other Fleming officials also apparently received significant performance-related packages. Mr John Manser, group chief executive, said last week that almost all of the increase of about Pounds 60m in administrative costs represents profit-related pay. The annual report also shows that Mr Manser exercised 30,000 of his stock options during the year, while being granted an additional 10,000. Mr William Harrison, chief executive of the investment banking division was granted the most stock options during the year, a total of 50,000.</p>

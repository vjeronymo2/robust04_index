			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Khartoum presses its offensive against the south: Prospects for peace talks diminish, writes Julian Ozanne, while civil-war havoc and suffering go on FUELLED by support from Libya and Iran, the Sudanese army is waging its biggest and most successful offensive in the nine-year war against southern rebels, forcing hundreds of thousands of starving women and children to flee their homes. Experts say that the offensive is bent on destroying rebel forces at any cost and could provoke southern Sudan's worse humanitarian crisis. Aid officials working around the clock in Nairobi to ferry food into southern Sudan said yesterday that soldiers of the fundamentalist Islamic government of General Omar Hassan al Bashir were continuing their fierce battle against the remaining strongholds of the mainly Christian Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Further emboldened by a damaging internal split in the rebel movement, the Sudanese army has made unprecedented territorial gains in its lightning six-week offensive. Moving by road, and by barge along the Nile, supported with bombing raids by Libyan-supplied MiG jet fighters, Sudanese soldiers advancing in four columns have captured the key towns of Bor, Pochala, Kongor and Yirol. And now, allegedly with Iranian military advisers, they are pushing east towards Akobo on the border with Ethiopia and south to relieve Juba, the besieged southern capital which has long been encircled by rebel forces. The success of the campaign, described by one analyst yesterday as 'nothing short of a jihad (holy war) to crush the south,' has been helped not only by the Libyan and Iranian training but by Chinese-made heavy weapons and road-building equipment. The government has also attempted to starve out the civilian population supporting the rebels by imposing a six-week ban on critical United Nations relief flights (the ban was lifted on Sunday after intense international pressure). It is not possible to know how many people have died from starvation because most of southern Sudan is cut off, but aid workers say at least several hundred people have died during the past six weeks in the few areas with which they are in contact, and that hundreds of thousands of women and children are malnourished and in severe need of food, oral rehydration therapies and medicines in the sun-baked wilds of one of Africa's most inhospitable regions. Moreover, after the years of rugged bush warfare between the Arab north and black African south, which has reduced southern Sudan to a primitive wasteland, there appears less chance than ever of a resolution to the conflict. Peace talks, which are apparently being brokered by President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of the Lonrho trading conglomerate, appear unlikely to make any progress. Southern fears of Arab-Moslem domination have intensified to the point where many Christians in the south believe that the intention of the north is genocide. The government of Gen Bashir, which seized power in 1989, has continued to build an oppressive Islamic state, and Amnesty International, the international human rights group, said last week that the government's denials of grossly violating human rights had no credibility. Torture, brutal beatings and short-term detention, the organisation said, were the government's standard reaction to dissent: 'Prisoners have been shackled and suspended from their cell walls, sometimes upside down, others have had their testicles crushed with pliers.' The US has expressed fear that Iran is establishing a 'beach-head' to export Islamic revolution across Africa and provide a base from which terrorist groups can operate. Last Thursday, Sudan's military-appointed assembly declared its support for Col Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, and denounced UN sanctions against Libya as an 'international crime'. The rebels, for their part, are divided into two factions, one based at Nasir, the other at Kapoeta and Torit, after a split emerged last August in the high command over allegations of gross human rights violations against Dr John Garang, the SPLA leader. Both factions, partly based on tribal lines, have spent much of the past four months attacking each other's forces and trading insults through press releases and propaganda sheets printed in Nairobi.</p>

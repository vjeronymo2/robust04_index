As usual,  he claimed that Syria has not clarified the nature of the peace  it seeks to establish in the region and adds that Israel will  not agree to a complete withdrawal from the Golan and to the  evacuation of the settlements but to a withdrawal on the Golan  in exchange for a complete peace.    The truth is that, since the launching of the U.S.  initiative, Syria has explained that it aspires to a just and  comprehensive peace in the region and to the settlement of all  the aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Syria has submitted  practical, objective, and balanced proposals since the sixth  round to translate the UN Security Council resolutions and the  peace for land principle into tangible reality. Syria, also  announced through its foreign minister that it is ready for a  full peace in exchange for a full withdrawal. However, the  Israeli officials who have done their best since the Madrid  conference to undermine the Washington talks and raise obstacles  and obstructions have so far rejected the formula of a just and  comprehensive peace. They did not abide by the UN Security  Council resolutions and insist on partial settlements and peace  in installments. When Rabin speaks about withdrawal on the  Golan, he refers to a partial and limited withdrawal and wants a  full peace in return.    This is so in spite of the fact that Syria had informed all  the parties concerned that the Golan is nonnegotiable and that  peace depends on Israel's full withdrawal. Rabin wants to share  the Golan with Syria. The Golan has been Syrian land since time  immemorial and cannot be divided. The UN Security Council  resolutions are clear. They demand a full Israeli withdrawal, do  not permit the forcible seizure of the land of others, reject  the settlement operations and the transformation of the  landmarks of the occupied territories.    Syria is fully committed to the implementation of  Resolutions  242 and 338, which are the basis of the peace process. Has  Israel done the same? Rabin speaks on every occasion about a  withdrawal on the Golan and not from the Golan. Thus, he places  an insurmountable obstacle before the attainment of any progress  on the Syrian track. Syria has announced on every occasion that  it rejects partial deals and aspires for a comprehensive peace.  Why then does Rabin insist on phased partial settlements and  peace in installments? Rabin, actually plans to swallow up part  of the Golan. It goes without saying that Syria will not be  dragged into such deformed and mutilated settlements and will  not give up any inch of its territory. Rabin's statements seek  to raise doubts about the feasibility of the Syrian-U.S. summit  scheduled to be held in Geneva in the middle of this month.  Everyone knows that the United States seeks a comprehensive  peace and is in accord with Syria on this. Comprehensive peace  cannot be established without Israel's full withdrawal, the  removal of the occupation, and the elimination of the  settlements in accordance with the international legitimacy  resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace.  But, Israel refuses to withdraw, insists on occupation, and  resorts, as usual, to the pretext of security. Security and  expansion go together with respect to the Israeli rulers. They  have launched many wars of expansion under the pretext of  security. They reject peace now under the pretext of security.  What peace are they talking about if it will not lead to the  elimination of the occupation, the return of the land, and the  entrenchment of the right of the dispersed and the refugees to  return to their land and properties?    Perhaps, we can see the type of peace Israel wants through  the negotiations resulting from the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel  has not conceded a single essential thing to the Palestinians.  It insists on entrenching its occupation and hegemony and its  control over the crossings, routes, areas, and the Palestinian  people's resources.    Everyone agrees that occupation is the opposite of peace.  Although the Palestinian side became involved in Israel's  schemes, it soon reaped the bitter fruits. It found itself face  to face with an endless series of operations of deception and  misleading actions.    Syria will certainly not be dragged into such agreements and  insists on the meticulous implementation of the UN Security  Council resolutions. It will pay no heed to any Israeli  proposals that do not contain a full and comprehensive  withdrawal from the Golan.</p>

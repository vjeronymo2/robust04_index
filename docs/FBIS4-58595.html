			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 4 May (MENA) -- Fighting broke out tonight in  the city of Dhamar, 100 km south of Sanaa, between the  Republican Guard forces (northern) and the garrison of the  Basahib camp (southern).    An official source at the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] in  Dhamar said that, at about 1930, the Republican Guard Forces  attacked the Basahib camp with missiles, artillery, and tanks.  Clashes are still taking place in front of the camp with all  types of weapons. An electricity station was shelled and the  camp's munitions and fuel depots were burned, according to the  source.    Meanwhile, a responsible source at the General People's  Congress in Sanaa said that the YSP forces in Dhamar fired at  Republican Guard camps and that no information is yet available.    Power cuts have taken place in most parts of Sanaa since  2030  tonight.</p>

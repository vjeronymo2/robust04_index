			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 5 Jun (AFP) -- Kibassa Maliba, president  of the Zairian Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, USOR,  today severely criticized France's position in Zaire. He  accused France of "supporting the dictatorship" of President  Mobutu. Mr. Maliba, accompanied by Etienne Tshisekedi, the main  Zairian opposition leader, was taking part in a mammoth rally  organized by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, UDPS,  the first radical opposition party, to which both belong.    Mr. Tshisekedi "warned" Marshal Mobutu to sign the decree  appointing him the new prime minister of Zaire, otherwise  threatening to call on diamond producers to embark on an  indefinite strike.    Mr. Tshisekedi is a native of the Kasai-oriental region (in  central Zaire), the main diamond producing region of the  country, whose production currently represents the main source  of revenue for the country.</p>

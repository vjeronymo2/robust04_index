			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Bullishness on sterling STERLING futures were slightly higher yesterday amid fledgling expectations of another cut in UK interest rates at some point later this year, writes James Blitz. In the last few weeks, nobody in the sterling market has been betting too strongly one way or the other on UK base rate moves. However, there was some newspaper speculation at the weekend that the next figures for UK unemployment might show a net rise, in contrast to the drops seen in the last two months, forcing the UK auth-orities to look for new ways to stimulate the economy. Several other factors have also made dealers wonder whether the UK authorities might lower rates again. First, sterling has been testing the DM2.50 level against the D-Mark in recent days. The UK authorities might take the view that too strong a pound would damage UK export prospects in what are already difficult markets. Secondly, the Bundesbank indicated last week that it may be set for more aggressive easing of German interest rates than has been seen thus far, enhancing the possibility of another UK rate reduction. Yesterday, the Bundesbank announced that it would hold a two-tranche tender for securities repurchase funds this week. Few dealers expect the repo rate to come far below last week's level of 7.75 per cent this week and, with call money yesterday trading higher than this, at 7.82 per cent, there is even speculation that the repo rate may rise. However, as one dealer suggested yesterday, the dollar is performing so weakly against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges that the Bundesbank may take the opportunity to cut rates now, knowing that this will have no consequences for imported inflation. The bears' case on UK rates is still relatively strong, of course. In particular, there are worries that another rate cut would push Britain's inflation rate outside the limits set by the UK government. The June short sterling contract was up 4 basis points at one stage yesterday, at 93.94, before finishing at 93.93. The September contract ended 4 basis points higher at 93.98. In the cash market, three-month money closed at 6 1/16 per cent, down 1/16 percentage point. A small shortage of Pounds 450m helped to ease short-dated rates.</p>

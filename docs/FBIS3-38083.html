The fulfillment by the Serbs of their  commitments to withdraw heavy weapons from the vicinity of  Sarajevo is, to a great extent, an act of trust in Russian  policy in the region. According to our correspondent Marina  Chernyukha, this was stated at a news conference in Moscow today  by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian  Armed Forces. He emphasized that compared with the Muslims'  infantry the Serbian infantry now finds itself in a  disadvantageous position. If the former want to seek revenge,  it might have grave consequences.    The prevention of provocations by either side is the main  task of the Russian blue helmets. It was noted at the briefing  that the additional contingent of 300 servicemen will be  arriving in Bosnia in March.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finance mandate awarded for Qatar Gas A group of six international banks has been awarded the mandate to arrange up to Dollars 680m to finance the upstream elements of Qatar's first liquefied natural gas project. The total cost of Qatar Gas, the first of two proposed LNG projects in the country, will be about Dollars 4bn by the time the first shipment of LNG is made to Chubu Electric Power company in Japan in 1997. Japanese banks and government agencies are responsible for financing the more than Dollars 3bn 'downstream' part of the project, including the liquefaction plant and the LNG carriers. The total amount of limited recourse financing for the upstream section  - which includes the offshore production platforms and pipelines to the land facilities - will depend on the extent of export credit in equipment contracts now being let. The upstream partners in Qatar Gas are the Qatar General Petroleum Corporation, Total of France and Mobil Oil of the US. The financing is expected to be in place this year. The group of banks includes Barclays, Credit Lyonnais, Gulf International Bank and Societe Generale. JP Morgan is advising the Qatar Gas partners and Citibank is an adviser to QGPC.</p>

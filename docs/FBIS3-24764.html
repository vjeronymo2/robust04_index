An  AFP correspondent saw the bodies of two women and one man on the  road leading to the airport. One of the dead had his arm blown  off. There was no immediate confirmation of the clash from  either U.S. military or UN sources.    "He was sitting by the road. He wasn't doing anything," said  a relative of another victim, who was shot in the head. A  child, less than 10 years old, was hit in the throat while a man  had his wrist blown up by a high-caliber bullet. Panic spread  in the crowded streets shortly after the firing erupted, with  passers-by screaming: "It's the Americans, It's the Americans."</p>

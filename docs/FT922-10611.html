			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: BASF tumbles 25% to DM473m BASF profits slumped in the first three months of this year and the German chemical concern said it saw no real signs of improvement in the world economy, despite some positive indications from the US. BASF's pre-tax figure of DM473m (Dollars 286.6m) was 25 per cent lower than that of the first quarter of 1991, putting it roughly in line with the poor performance of Hoechst which reported a 26 per cent fall. Bayer's first-quarter decline was a much gentler 8 per cent. In common with its rivals, BASF managed a slight rise in turnover, which was 4 per cent higher at DM11.9bn. However, it said that this was mainly due to higher oil taxes in Germany - BASF has a large energy operation - as well as the inclusion of new activities. The company said stiffer competition had led to large profit declines in some sectors; these could not be offset by cost-cutting measures and restructuring. BASF said business was weak in plastics and fibres, with profits held back by low prices and the starting up of new plant, although volumes were higher.</p>

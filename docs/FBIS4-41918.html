			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UNIAN correspondent Anatoliy Drobyazko: "The </F> Dollar Comes and Goes, Whereas the Karbovanets Is Always in  Demand"]    [Text]  <H5>  Your Money or Your Life? </H5>   Ukraine's National Bank on 18 June set an official exchange  rate for the U.S. dollar -- 17,500 karbovantsi [K] for $1, which  is K1,000 higher than the preceding rate (of 8 June). In this  way, the exchange rate of the karbovanets continues to be  smoothly regulated and brought closer (although not really fast  enough) to the true rate of exchange prevailing on the market.  At the same time, last week revealed a quite interesting trend:  When the exchange rate of the karbovanets was carefully set at  an unreasonably low level, its exchange rate with regard to the  dollar fell increasingly deeper, but, as soon as the National  Bank started lowering the rate, a different phenomenon began to  be observed on the market.    On the currency cash market, for example, the position of  the  karbovanets became somewhat more steady from 10-17 June -- both  with regard to hard currencies and the Russian ruble. By way of  example, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar ranged at purchase  between K45,500 and K46,500 for $1 and at sale between K46,400  and K48,000 for $1. This is on average 2 percent lower than  what the dollar cost last week. The rate of the Russian ruble  ranged between K21,000 and K22,600 (at purchase) and between  K22,500 and K25,000 (at sale) and decreased by comparison with  the last week's rate by between 2.8 and 4.7 percent. The German  mark cost at purchase between K26,900 and K27,800 and at sale  between K27,600 and K29,000 -- in other words, it showed over a  week trends characteristic of the U.S. dollar.    The Ukrainian karbovanets also gained strength at the  exchanges of the CIS countries. For example, at the Minsk  currency exchange, the rate of the karbovanets grew from 0.58  Belarusian rubles for K1 on 8 June to 0.68 Belarusian rubles for  K1 on 16 June. Thus, the cross rate of the cashless Ukrainian  karbovanets with regard to the U.S. dollar constitutes in Minsk  K39,411.8 for $1. At the Moscow Interbank currency exchange,  the rate of the karbovanets grew from 4.30 Russian rubles [R]  for K100 on 8 June to R4.55 for K100 on 17 June. The cross rate  of the cashless Ukrainian karbovanets at the Moscow Interbank  currency exchange with regard to the U.S. dollar constituted in  the final analysis K43,142.9 for $1.    What factors affected the currency market?    The currency dealers continued their speculation toward  lowering the exchange rate of hard currencies. The fact that  the rate is in the zone of resistance is indicated by the low  activity of market entrepreneurs, but the quite steady fall in  the rate of the U.S. dollar is a matter of concern for owners of  small amounts of cash. This may be accounted for by the  continued situation associated with the destabilization of the  currency market at the end of May. Expectations of inflation  also continue to intensify as a result of introducing into  circulation of the K200,000 banknote. In addition to that, as  is known, a decision was adopted on the procedure for issuing  credits for agricultural work and on the size of credits, and  this may lead to a 10-percent rise in the rate of the U.S.  dollar as soon as at the beginning of July.    A certain counterbalance to these negative factors is, to  some extent, an improvement in the liquidity indexes of  commercial banks, which is associated with the present reserved  policy pursued by Ukraine's National Bank, the introduction of  the system of electronic settlements, and, as a consequence, a  sharp rise in the circulation of capital, the appearance of a  surplus of free credit resources, and a decrease in bank  interest rates. Besides, with the beginning of the vacation  season, the turnover on the currency market has increased due to  the natural migration of people. However, if the exchange rate  of the dollar continues to be low, then, everything considered,  it will be more profitable to sell dollars for rubles directly  in Russia.</p>

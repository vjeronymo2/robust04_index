			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Drazen Budisa, president of the Croatian </F> Social Liberal Party, by Vlado Vurusic; place and date not  given: "We Should Not Have Signed the Agreement With the  Serbians Before Serbia Has Recognized Croatia!"]    [Text] [Vurusic] What is your comment on the Geneva  agreement that establishes relations between Croatia and the FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]?    [Budisa] From the comments of those who prepared the Geneva  declaration it is obvious that much work had been done on the  Croat-Serb agreement. We were not surprised by the agreement;  it is a consequence of the continuity of Croatian policies  toward Belgrade and Milosevic. We have always pointed out that  Croatia must pull out of Milosevic's embrace because it brings  us nothing good, while it is gradually getting Serbia out of  international isolation. We believe that technical rather than  political negotiations should be held with Serbia, until the  time they recognize Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina within their  integral borders. Until that happens, agreements such as the  Geneva one will be harmful for Croatia, and beneficial for  Milosevic's regime. The worst thing is that these agreements  always come about when Milosevic's regime is under intensified  international isolation. This agreement was reached at the  moment of most serious talk about air strikes on Serb military  targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There was even talk of more  drastic sanctions.    [Vurusic] How would you account for President Tudjman's  actions?    [Budisa] The question is if the Croatian president can still  manage to pull out of the embrace he was caught in during the  famous negotiations in Karadjordjevo. If Dr. Tudjman were to  try to do so, who knows what would emerge concerning the talks  he and Milosevic held before, especially concerning  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, this agreement has been reached  at a time the West is facing a redefinition of its positions  concerning the events in the former Yugoslavia, which was  prompted by the changes in Russia. I think that the new western  plan for Bosnia, which even the French are inclined toward, will  reduce the possibility of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I  do not see what the new plan could contain apart from  recognition of integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and giving up on  ethnic states in Bosnia. Croatia must adjust to the concept  supported by the international community, rather than stubbornly  insisting on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and finding  common grounds with Milosevic.    [Vurusic] Do you think that Milosevic is in a way  blackmailing Dr. Tudjman?    [Budisa] I do not know about that, but if we were to turn  our back on Milosevic completely, the contents of all the former  talks between Tudjman and Milosevic would probably be revealed.    [Vurusic] Radovan Karadzic has recently said that Serbia  profits more from the agreement, while opening the Office in  Serbia makes Croatia equal with the so-called Krajina and the  Serb Republic.    [Budisa] Croatia's mistake is consenting to open the Office  before the FRY has recognized us within our borders. When there  is such an agreement, the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party]  will do its best to mend and regulate the Croat-Serb relations.  Until then, we believe that Serbia must be left under all the  sanctions and have the status of aggressor. We in the HSLS do  not want to give interviews even to the democratic --  provisionally described as independent -- Serb papers.    [Vurusic] The Geneva agreement will reflect on Croat-Muslim  relations.    [Budisa] Although those involved deny it, the declaration  certainly makes our relations with the Muslims difficult. If it  were an agreement on recognition of the borders, there could be  talk of a significant step toward the Serb recognition of  Bosnia- Herzegovina within its borders, but since this has been  avoided in the declaration, I am afraid this is another mistake  Croatian diplomacy has made.    [Vurusic] What do you consider positive in the Geneva  declaration?    [Budisa] Perhaps just this -- even the HSLS was attacked  about the recent meeting of the Croatian and Serbian  intellectuals in the Mimara [art gallery in Zagreb], although we  had nothing to do with it. It is interesting to see the critics  of the meeting silent now. The declaration could cause some  sobering. It is evident that the agreement does not refer to  the Security Council Resolution 871, but the UN Charter and the  documents of the CSCE, the organization that the FRY is not a  member of!? What does it mean for such country to sign such an  agreement?    [Vurusic] It seems that the reactions of the West are mostly  constrained, even negative.    [Budisa] The West, faced with the breakthrough of Greater  Russian nationalism, which has become spokesman of the Russian  parliament, and bearing in mind the danger of a new eastern  block being founded on the nationalist-Orthodox basis, is in a  position to support the principle on the borders being  unchangeable more firmly than before. I think that the West is  giving up on Bosnia- Herzegovina being a union of three states,  and that Croatia must adjust to that and base its foreign policy  on that principle. I think that the West has sobered after the  changes in Russia, and that it realizes that the precedent of  allowing the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a  recognized member of the international community, could bring  about events of unprecedented scope in the countries of the  former Soviet Union.    [Vurusic] Yesterday Croatia officially expressed the wish to  be included in the Partnership for Peace, some kind of a  antechamber to membership in NATO.    [Budisa] We welcome that intention. It has been done in a  rather hesitant way, late, and probably due to the impression  that, with the Croat-Serb agreement, we have gotten into the  area of Russian politics. The fact that Churkin was preparing  the Geneva agreement is no accident. With the application for  the Partnership for Peace Croatia is expressing the wish to pull  out of the Balkan embrace. President Tudjman himself realizes  that he has gotten too deeply involved in the relations with the  countries that separate us from the West. I think that this  initiative is late. The HSLS proposed a long time ago, and  included the proposal in the program, that Croatia apply for  membership in NATO.    [Vurusic] Is there a possibility of Croatia becoming a  subject of ridicule because of this agreement, as it has granted  amnesty to its aggressor?    [Budisa] Indeed, it seems to me that Croatian politics is  losing credibility, and that with such an agreement we are  losing the reputation and national dignity, while in return we  gain nothing. I would therefore agree with your statement.  Croatian politics got entangled the moment it started making  arrangements with the aggressor. Such moves truly insult the  Croat national dignity and endanger the international  community's main positive achievement -- the political and  economic isolation of Serbia, which is now being questioned.  Moreover, the Muslim doubts concerning the benevolence of this  agreement are provoked. The former animosity between the Serbs  and Croats has been brought to the boil, and now that it has  fulfilled its purpose, by questioning the survival of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, this projected hatred should be brought down  to a normal level. I am afraid of the agreement being presented  as an act of the Croat-Serb solidarity in the face of the  alleged danger of Islamic fundamentalism. I still believe that  the Muslims are our allies -- not "natural" ones, but that they  have become our allies through a combination of historical  circumstances and the fact that Serbia is the aggressor -- both  against Croatia and Bosnia.    [Vurusic] Why does Dr. Tudjman keep negotiating with  Milosevic, despite the fact that Milosevic has several times  proved that he does not abide by what he signs?    [Budisa] Because President Tudjman is captured by the  concept of rearranging the former old Yugoslavia in completely  different historical circumstances. He has pointed out several  times that there is no solution to the Croat issue without an  arrangement with Belgrade, and that our interest is the  encompassing of the Croat ethnic territories. This is in itself  neither correct nor wrong outside the historical context. Macek  [Croatian signatory of the 1939 agreement founding the Bannat of  Croatia] also acted upon these bases, and this is how he partly  succeeded. However, in these historical circumstances of  Yugoslavia disintegrating and parts of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina being occupied this approach has lead to  cooperation with the aggressor and the war with the Muslims.    [Vurusic] Do you think that Tudjman is trying to find his  Dragisa Cvetkovic [prime minister of Yugoslavia, co-signatory of  the 1939 agreement mentioned above] in Milosevic?    [Budisa] Today, unlike in 1939, there is no prince Pavle in  Serbia. Why Dr. Tudjman persists in acting this way despite the  fact that Milosevic has evidently cheated him several times is a  question you will have to ask him. I no longer understand it.    [Vurusic] The key question raised by the Croat-Serb  agreement is whether Milosevic has given up on the concept of  Greater Serbia.    [Budisa] I am certain he has not. I think that the key to  integrating our occupied areas is in the resolution of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If Croatian politics were to  concentrate on that as one of its main tasks, then there would  be fewer negative consequences of this agreement, and in the  future they would completely disappear. If the Croatian  politics continues to aspire toward Herzeg-Bosna being annexed  to Croatia, then the question arises how we will retrieve our  occupied areas. There is constant talk that the two thirds of  the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina who will be left outside the  Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna will be equal in all respects.  If this is really true, why should a separate republic be  created for only one third of the Croats in Bosnia, when it is  precisely the founding of such republic that questions the  equality of the Croats who are left outside its borders in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Vurusic] What organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina do you  propose?    [Budisa] The Croats, as the least populous in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, should have parity authority, while the territorial  division should also be based on the observance of the ethnic  principles, but not on creating separate states. Why would  Bosnia- Herzegovina not be decentralized, divided into a certain  number of counties? The advice of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  bishops and the messages from the Pope should be accepted.    [Vurusic] Western commentators mostly think that the Geneva  agreement has definitely divided Bosnia.    [Budisa] Yes, many have interpreted it that way. However,  since the West, under the pressure of the political changes in  Russia, is changing its attitude on Bosnia, I am more optimistic  about the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina than I was several  months ago. The tragedy is that Tudjman does not see what is  going on and that he is letting Milosevic have his way. Croatia  is still not so badly off; it has the international credibility  that is still incomparable with Milosevic's. Valentic's  [Croatian prime minister] measures have yielded positive  effects. Serbia has nothing to lose, and now it is dragging us  into games in which we have a great deal to lose.    [Vurusic] The Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna and the Serb  Republic have recently signed an agreement. In your opinion,  does that make the situation in Bosnia easier or more difficult?    [Budisa] This is just one of the many papers. I think  that Sarajevo has given up on the initial idea according to  which the Serbs could separate from the Union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina after two years. Bosnia-Herzegovina can be  preserved if three of the four factors support it: the Muslims,  the Croats, and the international community. I think that a  great number of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are in favor of  preserving it, even those in Herzegovina. Croatia, on the other  hand, is behaving as if the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina depends  on Karadzic.    [Vurusic] There have been some significant personnel changes  in Herceg-Bosna lately: after General Ante Roso, Vice Vukojevic  also arrived in Herzegovina. What is your comment on that?    [Budisa] I see the arrival of Ante Roso differently from  that of Vice Vukojevic. When he arrived in Herzeg-Bosna, Ante  Roso was no longer a general of the Croatian Army, while Vice  Vukojevic put on the uniform of the brigadier of the Croat  Defense Council while still a Parliament representative and  president of the Committee for Selection and Nomination. It  seems as if some of our politicians are competing in who is  going to make more political mistakes.    [Vurusic] Does the HSLS intend to start a discussion of the  Geneva declaration in parliament?    [Budisa] We can not remain silent, though I do not know what  will be on the agenda of the next parliament session. The HSLS  can start many actions and initiatives, but there is less chance  of the Croatian authorities changing some elements of its  policies if it is suggested by the liberal party. We are forced  to place our ideas through the members of the party in power who  are close to us. On the other hand, the representatives of the  Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] are, due to party  discipline, often simply forced to vote against the HSLS  proposals.    [Vurusic] Will you ask President Tudjman to make additional  explanations, will you perhaps demand someone's resignation,  since you have stated that the declaration was "an attack on the  vital national interests and the national dignity"?    [Budisa] I am not sure we will not raise such questions,  too. A strong reaction at the HDZ moves is demanded of us, but  people forget the balance of power in parliament. We are aware  of the fact that major political decisions and changes may  result from the conflict within the HDZ, and not only from the  Parliament discussion between the opposition and the party in  power.    [Vurusic] Do you think that the Croats support the Geneva  declaration?    [Budisa] I think that it is difficult to find a Croat who  would privately support an agreement that offends our national  dignity. The HSLS has not issued any slander against any  people; there are no chauvinists and primitive people in the  party, and we are not saying that there should be no  negotiations with the Serbs and with Serbia, but the basis for  that is well known -- the recognition of the borders and the  reintegration of the occupied areas in the constitutional and  legal system of Croatia. However, I am appalled at the HDZ  masochism, at the consent to forget Vukovar, Petrinja, Okucani,  Drnis, Baranja, all the destruction and all the atrocities done  to us. I am afraid that we are slowly sliding into the position  that was imposed on the Croats in the former Yugoslavia. I am  afraid that the Croat national feeling will again be limited to  what the Serbs mind about the manifestations of Croatianness. I  am afraid that it will be our realist-politicians who will  adjust to the Serb "oversensitivity" to Croatianness, that we  will again have to be careful about not "offending" the Serbs  with our Croatianness. After all they have done to us, from  Vukovar to Dubrovnik, I am afraid that the present Croatian  policies will lead to the situation in which we will no longer  be allowed to talk about these crimes so that the Serbs do not  get angry with us, or proclaim us nationalists. We can  therefore again find ourselves in the position in which we will  be as Croat as the Serbs will bear or allow. I am afraid that  there will be some people in Croatia who will become accustomed  to it, and who will adjust their speech and behavior to what I  call national defeat. I fear that such people could again  become representatives of professed Croat political interests,  in the name of the so-called realist politics. I am prepared to  go to Knin and make peace with the Serbs, but only after they  recognize Croatia within its borders. What do Pejnovic's  [deputy president of the Serb National Party] statements about  the resolution of the Serb issue in Croatia depending on the  observance of all the Serb options mean? Does that include the  Chetnik ones? The Serb issue can not be resolved from the  Ustasha positions, and Croatia must not respect the Chetnik  positions. I hope that this is clear. We are not in such an  unfavorable political and economic situation as Serbia and the  so-called Krajina are. We should not be in a hurry and we  should not have to curry favor with them. We have no reason to  enter rash and insufficiently defined arrangements.    [Vurusic] What is the HSLS comment on the continuation of  the conflict within the HDZ, from the Second HDZ Congress until  the present, which culminated in the open argument between  Manolic [president of the Chamber of Counties] and Susak  [defense minister], and the announcement of [parliament  chairman] Stipe Mesic's resignation?    [Budisa] As a rule, we do not comment on what goes on in  other parties. The HDZ has recently accused the opposition of  destabilizing Croatia, and we are witnessing the opposing  positions within the very top of the HDZ. Their internal  polemics are more irreconcilable than those between the  opposition and the authorities, which is truly destabilizing the  Croatian state. At his recent meeting with heads of counties,  President Tudjman appealed for a united stand on the Croatian  state politics, and we in fact do not know what it is. The  defense minister has completely different opinions and positions  on many key state and national issues from those of the  president of the Chamber of Counties and Representatives. I  therefore must ask what the Croatian state politics is and what  concept it is that we should all unite about.    [Vurusic] Lately there has been talk of factions within the  HSLS, and even of your having submitted your resignation as  party president. Is that correct?    [Budisa] I have not submitted my resignation. At the Lower  Council session we discussed personnel issues, which involved  many people from the party leadership. The opinion prevailed  that the continuity of the party should be preserved in the  personnel issues as well, which means that I will run for  president of the party at the next HSLS congress. I do not know  who my opposing candidates will be. For the time being, there  are seven candidates for deputy party president. There will be  many candidates for certain positions, but, unlike in the HDZ,  it can not happen in the HSLS that I dispute and change anyone's  candidacy at the congress.    [Vurusic] The popularity of your party is decreasing; there  have been reproaches that you often did not react the way the  strongest opposition party in Croatia should have done.    [Budisa] I am certain that the HSLS would currently win more  votes than at the last elections. However, our popularity has  dropped in relation to the period after the elections.  According to the surveys published in the press, however,  almost half of the people do not want to declare their opinion.  You see, there is a fierce media campaign against us, mainly on  Croatian Television, the theme of which is that if we attack the  authorities, we also attack Croatia.    We are also fighting against the HDZ because we believe that  we would conduct the Croatian politics and the Croatian state  better, more efficiently, and more successfully than the HDZ.    [Vurusic] Will you demand early elections?    [Budisa] Not for the time being. Our insistence on  elections would certainly postpone them.</p>

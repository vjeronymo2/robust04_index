			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK property The latest uptick in the gilts market, some bullish forecasts for commercial property values, and the purchase of a big City office block by a German investment fund have breathed some life into property shares. Leading property companies yesterday outstripped the FT-SE 100 index with British Land climbing 5 per cent. After a sluggish performance all year, it would be tempting to assume that property shares may run some more - especially now that most companies have returned to discounts to net asset values. This year, rising bond yields have diminished property's appeal by narrowing the comparative yield. Higher long-term interest rates have also deterred investors from buying bricks and mortar direct. But at some point, such arguments will lose their force. If rising gilts yields really do presage the return of inflation then rents should rise more quickly. That in turn promises income growth for property companies, which is the ultimate reason for buying property shares. The theory is fine; the practice may be somewhat different. Many property companies own buildings where tenants pay more than open-market rents. Such portfolios may still not produce income growth for several years.</p>

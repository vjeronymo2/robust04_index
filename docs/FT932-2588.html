			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Ceasefire in Pacific air war A LOOMING air services war between Australia and the US was averted yesterday when both sides agreed to lift sanctions against each other's airlines - Northwest Airlines and Qantas. The ceasefire will hold while the two governments renegotiate the terms governing the airlines' services, particularly Northwest's lucrative Japan-Australia-US flights. The Australian government has banned one of Northwest's three weekly flights from New York to Sydney via Osaka. It claimed the American airline had contravened an agreement that it would not offload or take in half of its passengers in Sydney. Northwest has claimed that the so-called 50 per cent rule was an 'informal' agreement. In retaliation, the US ordered cancellation of Qantas's three non-stop Sydney-Los Angeles flights. Senator Bob Collins, Australia's transport minister, said the agreement allowed Northwest to resume its Sydney services as long as it observed the 50 per cent rule. He said the US government had also agreed to withdraw its banning order on Qantas.</p>

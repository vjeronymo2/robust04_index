			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / TGWU confirms merger plan LEADERS of the TGWU general workers union yesterday officially confirmed plans for a merger with the GMB general workers. The formal announcement follows months of speculation about a courtship between the two unions, which have a combined membership of 2m across British industry. The move will be welcomed by employers who see union amalgamations as a means of simplifying collective bargaining agreements. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said: 'There is a clear industrial logic for the T&amp;G and the GMB to work towards a merger.' Mr Morris said he hoped the merger would take place far sooner than Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, has suggested. Mr Edmonds said he did not expect to see the two unions still separate at the end of the century. The announcement is a response to the financial difficulties all unions face. The TGWU last year spent Pounds 11m more than its income. The move has also been prompted by a rash of mergers between other unions, some of which threaten the 1.1m-strong TGWU's 60-year reign as Britain's largest union. The AEU and the EETPU recently merged to form the AEEU electrical and engineering union with 980,000 members. Next year Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse, the public-sector unions, will merge to form Unison with 1.5m. TGWU leaders also announced they would no longer take part in beauty contests, in which companies rather than workers decide which unions should have representation rights. This follows the GMB saying that it would also shun such competitions. Unions in the rail, coal and electricity industries are considering a joint campaign to protest against what they see as threats to jobs - from privatisation, pit closures and generating electricity from gas. The main unions understood to be involved are the TGWU and GMB general unions, the NUM and Nacods miners' unions and the RMT, TSSA and Aslef rail unions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 15 Mar (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH and AL-QADISIYAH  write that President Saddam Husayn's speech to the Cabinet on 13  March has ended a period of wily procrastination and  prevarication and put the onus on the UN Security Council to  discharge its clear and pressing obligations.    AL-THAWRAH says: Iraqis have endured American arrogance and  tyranny and they have watched while the Americans tried to  destroy every symbol of civilization in their country, and yet  they held their ground.    Over the past four years, Iraq has handled the unfair UN  Security Council resolutions with a sense of responsibility and  commitment, while the UN Special Commission has been shuttling  back and forth between New York and Baghdad. In the meantime,  Iraq has had its weapons and factories destroyed, met its  obligations, and opened its facilities for future inspection, as  well as acceding to demands that it is certain are unfair.  Having gone through this bitter, long, and arduous experience,  the Iraqi people and Government are convinced that the page of  procrastination and prevarication of the sly fox must be closed.  Having seen the results of an unprecedented military aggression  and realized that the Iraqi people are not easy prey, the fox  has tried prevarication to sap the strength of the Iraqis to  make it easier to break their will and destroy their sovereignty.    The paper adds: Iraq is taking on a conspiracy whose weapons  are sanctions and no-fly zones imposed under the cover of UN  resolutions. But thanks to the genius and wisdom of its  historic leader, Iraq has taken a well-considered stand that  robs its enemies of all pretexts, especially since Iraq has  carried out its obligations and shown every cooperation.  Regional and world developments have exposed America's double  standard toward Bosnia and the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. In the  latter case, the United States has been blocking the UN Security  Council from passing a resolution condemning the massacre.    The paper stresses that all peoples and governments,  including [word indistinct] states, are now facing their basic  responsibility to address the faults that have been observed in  the UN Security Council's view and stands since the outburst of  U.S. tyranny and its adoption of the evils of the new world  (?order).    The paper notes that the use of the UN Security Council and  the UN flag by the U.S. pirates, who inherited all the evils of  the old colonialism, not only threatens Iraq's bread and  sovereignty, but also the sovereignty and dignity of all states  in the world and all peoples aspiring to achieve sovereignty,  progress, stability, and the supremacy of justice and fairness  in international relations.    AL-THAWRAH said that what is at stake now is the integrity  and reputation of the Security Council. The paper stressed that  the council should uphold justice and fairness and fulfill its  obligations by ending injustice and lifting the sanctions, or  else Iraq and its leadership will legitimately choose a new  road, a road different from the one it has followed for the past  four years, in terms of its approach to resolutions and  committees.    Iraq has a legitimate and crystal clear demand: An end to  the sanctions and the no-fly zones by the permanent Security  Council members, which are required by the council's resolutions  to ensure Iraq's sovereignty.    The paper adds: If the evildoers think that Iraq has no  other  options or that it is incapable of rejecting the injustice that  is concealed under the guise of UN resolutions with colonialist  interpretations, then they are mistaken. Iraq, with its free  will, is living in the age of its historic leader, the  victorious knight Saddam Husayn. The years of al-Qadisiyah and  the Mother of Battles, as well as the years of the unjust  blockade, is sufficient evidence that Iraq is capable of  surviving and that it has never lost its choice of options to  reach its legitimate, noble goals -- sovereignty, dignity, and  full rights.    AL-QADISIYAH writes: His Excellency President Saddam  Husayn's speech was open and echoed the soul and conscience of  the people. It is the last chance for the Security Council to  lift the sanctions without delay or conditions.    The people of Iraq and Saddam Husayn speak with one voice  and  endure the same tribulations. Under his mujahid leadership,  Iraqis vie among themselves to see who will sacrifice the most.  We have come safely through difficulties and taken off, and  with the benefit of our leader Saddam Husayn's resolve and the  brilliance of his strategic intellect, we will stay the course.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Gid'on Zelinger; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Zelinger] My first question must refer to what we  all saw at yesterday's signing ceremony in Cairo. What did you  feel on the stage when 'Arafat pulled his stunt?    [Peres] I felt embarrassment and regret, which is only  natural. As you know, however, when something like that  happens, you do not have time to get wrapped up in how you feel;  all that concerns you is how to get out of it.    [Zelinger] You also looked angry.    [Peres] Justifiably so. Look, after working very hard, our  negotiations reached a positive conclusion, we met him halfway,  and suddenly the prime minister finds out that he did not sign  the maps. That was contrary to everything agreed upon.    [Zelinger] Did you, at any stage, feel that his refusal to  sign could make everything go up in smoke?    [Peres] No, I was certain things would work out, and that is  why it angered me even more. I knew that nobody, including  'Arafat, had any alternative. It was -- to use an  understatement -- a very unaesthetic act before the entire world.    [Zelinger] Did you also consider what effect that act would  have on support for the agreement in Israel?    [Peres] No, we cannot gauge the mood each and every day. In  general, I believe that the Israeli public and others will judge  the overall picture. I really thought that what we witnessed on  television was the birth process: the labor pangs, the blood,  and the baby.    [Zelinger] But as Yo'el Marcus asks in today's HA'ARETZ: If  that is the birth, what sort of baby will it be? It may have  been born with a defect.    [Peres] You have to look not only at the parents but also at  the baby. The parents cannot be changed. Still, a new baby was  born, a new situation was created, and what I think constantly  is: Good God, why did we remain there for 27 years? For what?  Why did we have to call up all those reservists, some of whom  were wounded and some who even paid with their lives. A nation  has to ask itself questions. The question is not how 'Arafat  looks, but how we look.    [Zelinger] But beyond the issue of manners and conduct --  and I assume that all those on the stage and all those who were  watching shared your sense of deep embarrassment -- the question  is: What other stunts does the man who signed the agreement  with us have up his sleeve? Tomorrow he might renege on some  other agreement.    [Peres] There is also the other side of the picture. I  think that what upset 'Arafat was that nobody from the  territories came to the ceremony. We must look at the other  side of the picture. He made the decision practically on his  own, without any support. He is worried about his condition and  his status. I believe, however, that the third and most  important partner -- reality -- will now enter the negotiations.  There are hundreds of thousands of people on the West Bank and  in the Gaza Strip, including young, talented, and ambitious  people, who did not participate in the negotiations. In fact,  the negotiations were conducted by the Palestinian diaspora and  not the Palestinian reality in the field. I have no doubt that  they will make a decisive contribution which will completely  change the character of the agreement.    [Zelinger] Since we are discussing reality, the ink has not  yet dried, and the PLO is already asking for a delay in the  implementation. Does that not indicate something about the  capability of the organization?    [Peres] Yes. They are not yet a government; they are a  movement in the diaspora. Do not forget that they do not have  institutions like we do. On their side, everything is fragile  and tenuous. They cannot operate in an organized way like us.  It will take them a very long time before they become  realistic and adapt themselves to the demands.    [Zelinger] That, without doubt, will be the test period  for the implementation of the agreement....    [Peres, interrupting] There is no test period. The dice  have been tossed and the outcome is known. There is no turning  back. We will not return to Gaza; Gaza will not return to us,  thank God. In the name of thousands of citizens, who now feel a  sense of relief, I say to you: Goodbye to Gaza. Anyway, why  would we want to run their lives? Let us assume that their  lives are not run as we would prefer. It is their lives and not  ours; it is their way of running things, not ours.    [Zelinger] Their failure to run their lives will not affect  us?    [Peres] They will not fail. Why should they? They will run  things as they see fit. Do you think I am impressed by the way  all the Arab states are run? Is that a reason for us to get  involved? Anyway, the entire world is under tremendous pressure  exerted by a political instrument we did not have to take into  account before: television and radio. Developments occur as a  result of the information flow. A communist brought down  communism; an apartheid supporter brought down apartheid; a  Peronist brought down Peronism. Who pressured South Africa? The  media, the pictures, the information. I think this will also  have an impact on the reality in the Middle East. The current  political scene in the Middle East is a fog which hides the  sunlight, and it will be replaced by completely new relations  and rules.    [Zelinger] What would you consider a failure in the  implementation of the agreement? What could happen that would  indicate to you the failure of the implementation of the accord?    [Peres] I am not built that way. I believe in it, and I  believe it will work out. What would pain me most is if there  are additional casualties. There is no consolation for us or  for them if that occurs.    [Zelinger] Are there any circumstances under which Israel  would consider intervening if terrorism continues?    [Peres] Israel intervenes all the time. It is not that  Israel did not try to eradicate terrorism. There is no dispute  over that, and it will continue to do so in the future. The  question is: Can terrorism be uprooted only through  countermeasures -- clubs, orders, deportations -- or by also  enlisting the other side to take positive steps that would put  an end to people's motivation to commit suicide or attack and  murder.    [Zelinger] I asked whether circumstances could crop up -- in  the Gaza Strip, for example -- under which the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] would have to intervene with massive power.    [Peres] I refuse to answer that question, because if I  answer it, I cast doubt on the trustworthiness of our measures.    [Zelinger] What is the next stage? Should we now deal with  the permanent settlement with the Palestinians or negotiations  with Syria?    [Peres] There are some things we have to do now with the  Palestinians. We promised that in the wake of the present  agreement, there would be deliberations on what is called early  empowerment [last two words in English] for the Palestinian  authority in the areas in Judaea and Samaria. We are referring  to five fields, such as health, education, commerce, taxes, but  that is still not autonomy. We promised to do that immediately,  and we will do what we undertook.    Of course, I would very much like to start with Syria or  Jordan. For the time being, Syria's moves -- if they can be  termed moves at all -- are very measured. At the same time, we  will continue to examine any crack or opening in order to  continue the peace process. I would also very much like to find  out what the situation is in Jordan, because there has also been  an incomprehensible halt or retreat there. We are not doing  anybody any favor and are not serving anybody else. Peace  serves us no less than we serve it.    [Zelinger] The prime minister said that Syria holds the  key to information about the fate of our POW's and MIA's. Will  that be an inviolable condition for signing any agreement?    [Peres] Prior to an agreement, we exert tremendous pressure.  If you recall, a U.S. congressional delegation went to Damascus.  I know that Clinton and Christopher also spoke about it with  al-Asad. We will not give an inch with regard to the fate of the  POW's, which is at the top of our agenda when we negotiate peace.    [Zelinger] In the end, there are some Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad detainees among the  Palestinian prisoners who were and are being released. Did  Israel, therefore, yield on that?    [Peres] Two things are at issue: First, we did not release  people whose hands are stained with Jewish blood. Second, the  others have to pledge to abandon war and terrorism and to commit  themselves to supporting the peace process.    [Zelinger] There are still some unresolved issues, such as  the size of Jericho, the Palestinian policeman on the Allenby  bridge, etc. The question is whether will Israel give in later  in the negotiations with the Palestinians on the size of Jericho.    [Peres] Let us be precise. A map of Jericho was agreed  upon. The prime minister added about 6 km, which is about 10  percent of what we agreed to previously. What they asked for is  to discuss it further. That is fine, but there is no commitment  to give more. That is also the case with the policeman on the  bridge. We responded negatively. They asked for permission to  hold further talks. We cannot prevent that.    [Zelinger] The question is: Will Israel give in on those  points?    [Peres] It does not have to.    [Zelinger] What is your opinion?    [Peres] In my opinion, what we signed is it, and we now have  to move on to negotiate the early empowerment.    [Zelinger] To conclude, can you tell us anything concrete  about the issue of the Jericho synagogue, which has become a  focus of confrontation between demonstrators and the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces]?    [Peres] Yes, definitely. We said that al-Nabi Musa, a holy  site for Muslims, will be under Muslim religious auspices. The  synagogue will be under Jewish religious auspices. I think that  in the final analysis, both sides will respect sites that are  holy to the believers of both religions.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSURE OF TRAUMA CENTER IN WHITTIER EXPECTED TO HURT QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> The closure of the trauma unit at Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital in  Whittier probably will cause further deterioration in the quality of health  care in the San Gabriel Valley, hospital and county health officials said last  week.  </P> <P> But they said the impact will be softened by being spread among facilities  throughout the San Gabriel Valley, southeastern Los Angeles County and northern  Orange County.  </P> <P> "There will be a little fallout on all the hospitals in the area," said  Virginia Price-Hastings, who oversees the county's trauma network. She said  community hospitals will have to begin treating more patients, many of whom  have no insurance.  </P> <P> In a press conference Wednesday, Presbyterian Intercommunity officials  confirmed that they will end the 358-bed hospital's participation in the trauma  center network.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Will Have to Cope  </P> <P> Price-Hastings said the closure will mean that hospitals such as Queen of the  Valley in West Covina and Greater El Monte Community in South El Monte will  have to cope with severely injured patients who would normally have been taken  to the trauma center at Presbyterian Intercommunity.  </P> <P> These patients will be taken to the closest emergency room, she said. But  unlike trauma centers, emergency rooms are not required to have a surgeon and  anesthesiologist on duty at all times.  </P> <P> Among the most affected by the closure, Price-Hastings said, will be hospitals  that serve residents of El Monte, South El Monte, West Covina, Hacienda  Heights, La Puente, La Mirada, Norwalk, Artesia, Bell, Bell Gardens and Downey.  </P> <P> But Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, the only remaining trauma center  in the San Gabriel Valley, will probably not receive more trauma patients, she  said. Huntington officials say the 606-bed hospital loses about $1.8 million a  year on its trauma center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responsibility Unchanged  </P> <P> Price-Hastings said she has assured Huntington officials that their  responsibility will remain the same: caring for the critically injured within a  20-minute ambulance ride.  </P> <P> Yet an overriding problem remains: In the last three years, the trauma center  network has dwindled from 23 hospitals to 13. "Our goal is to retain what's  left of the trauma system and stop the domino effect of closures," she said.  </P> <P> To do so, Price-Hastings said, will require additional money from the state.  </P> <P> "We remain optimistic that by July or August there will be more money in the  state budget to help pay for health care of the uninsured," Price-Hastings  said. Otherwise, she said, the system will soon collapse.  </P> <P> The system was created in 1986 to provide a network of hospitals throughout the  county so that people who suffer traumatic injury could get speedy, quality  treatment at a facility nearby. Trauma centers provide round-the-clock staff to  handle gunshot wounds, traffic accidents and extreme multiple injuries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Finance  </P> <P> The system is costly. And, from a business standpoint, it is difficult to  finance, partly because of the nature of the injuries and the type of people  who are injured. Trauma patients tend to be young men who frequently have no  medical insurance to pay for the expensive and extensive care that they  require.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's press conference, Presbyterian Intercommunity President  Lowell W. Smith said in a prepared statement: "We have all witnessed the steady  deterioration of the trauma system that has made the network in the San Gabriel  Valley almost non-existent and woefully ineffective."  </P> <P> The Whittier hospital's trauma center will close Aug. 7. Previously, officials  at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank announced that their hospital's  trauma center will close June 19. Last year, the two institutions handled more  than 1,000 traumatic injuries.  </P> <P> Presbyterian Intercommunity officials said the closure is necessary because of  the high cost of subsidizing the care of uninsured patients whose hospital  bills are not being adequately reimbursed from other sources.  </P> <P> In a statement, Dr. John S. Marsh, chairman of the hospital's trauma committee,  cited two reasons why the hospital has lost $2.7 million on its trauma center  this fiscal year.  </P> <P> One problem, he said, has been County-USC Medical Center's "frequent inability  to accept the transfer of stabilized indigent patients." Another is that trauma  patients have been brought to the hospital from outside its geographic area, as  defined by the county's trauma network.  </P> <P> Price-Hastings said: "Whittier Presbyterian has eased its financial problem,  but in the process has spread it out among other hospitals." In 1988, the  hospital treated 433 trauma patients.  </P> <P> At Huntington Memorial, public affairs manager Peg Kean said: "The main  question that we're going to continue to ask ourselves is: If the trauma system  virtually no longer exists, what does that mean to us? As each hospital closes  its trauma center, it becomes a more pertinent question."  </P> <P> Still, Kean said, Pasadena hospital considers its trauma center "an important  community service."  </P> <P> At one time, Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia, Pomona  Valley Community Hospital in Pomona and Queen of the Valley in West Covina  operated trauma centers. But all these hospitals dropped out because of the  cost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Have Effect  </P> <P> An official at Greater El Monte Community Hospital said the closure of the  Whittier trauma center would almost certainly have an effect on the 115-bed El  Monte facility.  </P></p>

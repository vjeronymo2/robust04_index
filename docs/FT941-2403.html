			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance to float Four months after Independent Insurance became the first general insurance company to gain a stock market listing for more than 30 years, another insurer is set to float. Lombard Insurance, a Tonbridge-based company bought out by its managers last year, expects to raise Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m from the flotation, planned to take place in the next few months. Overall, Lombard is expected to be valued at Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m. After the fund-raising, net assets would be roughly Pounds 50m. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m for the seven months of 1993 that followed the management buy-out. Annual underwriting profits of Pounds 3.1m compared with losses of Pounds 2.8m in 1992 and Pounds 5.9m in 1991. Mr Andrew Laing, managing director, said the extra capital would 'raise awareness of Lombard', especially in the broker markets where it competes with companies such as Independent, Norwich Union, Commercial Union and Zurich Insurance and help sustain rapid recent growth. Premium income increased by 25 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 87.7m, following a 33 per cent rise in 1992. Some 60 per cent of Lombard's income comes from personal lines such as household and private car, where the company specialises in insuring 'mature drivers' with good safety records. In commercial lines the company specialises in insuring small and medium-sized companies, focusing on property and business interruption risks. Mr Laing stressed the importance of an agreement negotiated with the company's previous owners last year, indemnifying Lombard for losses occuring prior to the buy-out. A trust fund of Pounds 38.9m is designed to cover all liabilities on claims occuring before June 1 1993. The group's management, which owns about 10 more per cent of the company's equity, expects to retain its shareholding, although the venture capitalists who backed the management buy-out last year could sell some of their shares. A placing and intermediaries offer will be handled by Charterhouse Bank and Charterhouse Tilney Securities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 4 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is ready  to expand the free market sphere eastwards, Premier Vaclav Klaus  stressed during his meeting with students and teachers of the  Moscow Financial Academy today.    "After the experience with Comecon and communist regime one  cannot expect the Czech Republic to organise some east European  economic or political system. On the other hand, I am for the  creation of the free market sphere. I will always support this  sort of cooperation," said Klaus in fluent Russian.    "First, operation is necessary, then follows the fitness  centre and only afterwards one can attend the Olympic Games. We  are in the fitness centre, while Russia remains on the surgery  desk," said Klaus who arrived for a two-day visit to Russia  today.    Asked about the prospects of the Czech-Russian economic  cooperation, Klaus replied "the word cooperation belongs to the  past, I care for business."    "We were experiencing cooperation for 40 years, and it was  not useful for either country," he noted.    When asked by a student to comment on the economic situation  in Russia, Klaus answered that as a premier of the foreign state  he could not afford it. "After some lost elections I will gladly  deliver a lecture on the issue," he said.    Academy leadership proposed today to Klaus to become  honorary  professor.</p>

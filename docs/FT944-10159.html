			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (6): Welfare cuts needed - 'Resources must be released for growth' Economists believe Hungary faces a stark choice: the country must cut public expenditure, lower taxes and restructure its bloated welfare system, which last year cost the equivalent of 29 per cent of gross domestic product, or sacrifice strong economic growth and the chance to compete in the single European market, writes Virginia Marsh. Mr Andrew Rogerson, resident representative of the World Bank in Budapest, says: 'Radical changes in spending are needed if Hungary is to close the gap with western Europe. To catch up will require faster growth than is now on the table. The government has to find a way to provide both a social safety net and the basis for sustainable growth. It must release more resources for growth and investment.' However, it will not be easy for a Socialist-led government, elected in part to soften the pain of transition, to overhaul the extensive welfare system which most Hungarians have come to expect from the state and which provides cash benefits to most households. Mr Peter Akos Bod, the central bank governor, says that unlike the productive sectors of the economy, the social sector has undergone little restructuring in the past four years. 'Large areas - welfare, health, culture, education, social services - function as they did 10 years ago . . . The previous government was unwilling to tackle these problems because the economy was contracting and society was in trauma due to the changes after 1990. Now, we should correct this,' he says. Within the government there appears to be a broad consensus on the need to restructure the system which Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, describes as 'premature' for a country with Hungary's resources. However, he admits implementation of tough measures will be difficult for many ministries. This view is shared by western advisers who say there are already sharp divisions within the government as to how deep cuts in welfare should be. Mr Bekesi says social sector reform will form a large part of the government's three-year modernisation plan due to be presented in the spring. In the meantime, the cabinet has accepted a draft 1995 budget which raises social expenditure by just 10 per cent in nominal terms. Given expected annual inflation of more than 18 per cent, this will lead to significant cuts in real terms, if implemented. The draft budget also begins the first of several expected tax reforms in the sector. From 1995, contributions to the social security and unemployment funds will be only 25 per cent deductible for personal income tax purposes, down from the present 100 per cent. Welfare ministry officials say the efficiency of the system also needs to be improved. A key problem is that too many benefits are paid to too many people while an increasing number of Hungarians slip below the poverty line. 'Support should be better targeted at those who need it than at present,' says Mr Mihaly Kokeny, secretary of state. For example, from 1996, the state plans to combine child and child care benefit and pay families a flat rate. Under the present scheme the benefit varies according to a family's income, paying a higher amount to higher earners. 'This way we will create savings for the system and redirect resources to lower income groups.' He says welfare providers can also be made more efficient by increasing competition among them and by allowing local authorities to contract out some services to the private sector. Competitive tendering has already been introduced in some World Bank-funded projects. Other medium-term plans include pension reform. One way to reduce the burden on the state would be to encourage private schemes and later retirement in line with European norms. The present official retirement age is just 55 for women and 60 for men. Mr Kokeny says: 'We would like to restructure pensions so that people would be able to retire early but there would be incentives to stay at work longer.' He says an element of choice is essential if the population is to accept cuts and changes in welfare: 'We cannot be rigid. We have to discuss our plans openly and warn people of them well in advance. If we take a top-down approach, we could easily fail.' Western advisers point to the considerable political risks involved for the Socialist government. One says: 'In making the cuts, the government is in danger of losing the support of a large part of the middle class - those who are not poor but not rich, either. The problem is many people are happy with the status quo. The changes will benefit just a few.'</p>

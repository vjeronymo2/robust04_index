The exchange would be based on Australian Stock Exchange rules and its formation would be subject to a minimum level of interest from brokers and dealers. However, 'Once a minimum of five members have agreed to participate the exchange will open for business,' Sir Julius Chan, PNG's finance and planning minister, said yesterday. The proposal emerged in the course the finance minister's budget speech, and Sir Julius added that taxation reforms were being introduced which would facilitate transactions on a PNG stock exchange.

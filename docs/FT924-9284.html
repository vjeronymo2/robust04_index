			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Thatcher's union regime lives on MAKERS OF artificial flowers will soon find, after more than 80 years of statutory wage protection, that their wages are set according to the harsh dictates of the international market place. The government's decision to abolish the 26 remaining wages councils, announced yesterday, in effect ends Britain's system of statutory industry minimum wages. The councils set wages floors for 2.5m low-paid private-sector workers, about 10 per cent of the workforce, and covered industries as diverse as catering, hairdressing, laundries, and ostrich-feather workers. The decision is intended to be a significant political signal from the government that it is continuing the deregulatory agenda of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher when she was prime minister. Yet whether abolition will increase efficiency and employment in the labour market is highly contentious. A number of recent studies have suggested that these minimum wages may even increase employment. The government has consistently argued that wages councils, by distorting the labour market, have reduced industrial efficiency and cut jobs. It repeatedly made clear that it saw no medium term role for the councils and their influence has declined significantly in recent decades. The average hourly minimum set by the councils has declined steadily since 1979 as a percentage of the economy-wide average wage. More importantly, the degree of wage variation within industries covered by councils has also risen, suggesting that an increasing number of companies are paying wages above the minimum. British business has, not surprisingly, been calling for the councils to be abolished for years in the face of union opposition. The Institute of Directors argues that the councils constitute a bureaucratic and arbitrary intervention in the labour market, which is especially onerous on businesses employing less than 50 people. A recent report from Income Data Services, the employment research body, lists complaints from catering and retail companies such as Grand Metropolitan and from the National Federation of Meat Traders. The system, they say, is inflexible and arbitrary. The fixed national minimums make it difficult to introduce pay structures which regard performance or reflect regional variations in living costs or labour supply. However, many smaller companies support the retention of wages councils, according to the IDS survey, because they provide an uncomplicated guide for wage-setting while preventing larger companies from competing by wage cutting. The government acknowledges businesses' complaints, but stresses two other reasons for abolition: that they reduce employment by keeping wages artificially high, and that they do so while playing a neg-ligible role in preventing poverty. The government claims that 80 per cent of those affected, primarily part-time women workers, live in households with at least one other income. So a fall in low wages would not increase poverty significantly. Although no detailed study exists on the income characteristics of workers in wage council industries, a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the income effects of the Labour party's plan to introduce a statutory minimum wage appears to support the government's conclusions. The IFS report found that wage floors were a surprisingly blunt way to attack poverty because most low-wage workers come from high-income households. The gains from Labour's minimum wage would be concentrated among middle-income households with the richest 30 per cent having a larger net gain than the poorest 30 per cent. Yet minimum wages may still be well targeted on low-income working families, according to Mr Paul Gregg of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. He finds that a national minimum wage would raise the incomes of more than half of the poorest 10 per cent of families in which one person works. Most poor people do not work. But abolishing existing minimum wages may well increase poverty among the working poor. Nor is the government's case on the employment effects of abolishing wage councils very sound. In some highly competitive manufacturing sectors the evidence suggests that raising wages reduces employment. That was a conclusion of a Department of Employment study of the UK textile industry in 1985. In the service sector the evidence - both in the US and the UK - is less clear cut. A recent study of the employment effects of UK wages councils, conducted by Mr Stephen Machin and Mr Alan Manning at the London School of Economics, finds no evidence that the decline in the effectiveness of wages councils in the 1980s has increased employment. In the catering industry the results seem to suggest the opposite. Employers, they argue, have found it profitable to reduce the wages they pay. But this makes it harder to recruit people and thus reduces employment, a pattern that can also be seen in the US hamburger industry - not at all the effect that the government intends.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Faults in an Irish model Sir, Having farmed and run a small data-processing business in the Irish Republic, and more recently attempted to sell abroad the services of an indigenous manufacturing operation which was a model of efficiency, I have to take issue with Anthony Harris's comments about the country ('An Irish model for Britain', March 23). The balance of trade does look good, but about 80 per cent of the non-food exports come from international companies employing transfer pricing in the European Community's most favoured tax haven. Of the food exports the largest item is cola concentrate produced by another international company and employing a few hundred people. The remaining luckless indigenous Irish industry has to be super-efficient to overcome the currency hurdle imposed by the European Monetary System. This improbable task is not encouraged by the highest personnel tax regime in Europe which in turn is compounded by the cost of the highest national debt per capita in the world. Little wonder that unemployment is at 20 per cent, and this after a continuous stream of some 20,000-30,000 young educated people leave the country each year. If this is 'a model of how ERM disciplines are supposed to work', then God help us. Charles Hazell, 16 Bemish Road, Putney, London</p>

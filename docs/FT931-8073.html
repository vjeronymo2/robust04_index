			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Poetry in motion ONCE WE have become accustomed to the sanitised perfection that the CD offers, we often long for something a little more human. Poets who record their own work on cassette often give us just that kind of experience: something raw, rough-edged, and all too painfully human. This often tells us more about them and the impulses that have driven them to shape their poems than any number of purer renderings by a professional actor. One thing that such a reading immediately tells us is where a poet has come from geographically, and how the way he hears and speaks his own variety of native English has shaped his attitudes towards poetry as an art. Simon Armitage, one of the most lively young poets writing now, was born near Huddersfield and the sound of his language when spoken - a certain brutish dourness, a raw honesty in the almost aggressive lack of musicality in the voice - match perfectly his often chilling narratives. In Zoom and new poems, he takes a knowing sideways glance at the Northern drugs scene; in 'Snow Job', a punchily idiomatic and amoral tale, some drinkers argue in a pub over who should take the most credit for having recognised the car stuck in the snow, its dead driver slumped against the steering wheel, the word 'Volvo' printed backwards in his frozen brow. The language of Armitage's poems is as far removed as it is possible to be from 'poetic diction'. Idiomatic, breezily colloquial, they sound like anecdotes overheard in the pub. There are no classical references strewn about; the heroes belong to our own times: Johnny Weissmuller, for example, who, Tarzan apart, once held the world record for holding his breath under water. Sujata Bhatt was born in India, though she now lives in the West, and the creative tensions that surface in her reading of Selected Poems testify to an inner conflict between the claims her childhood language, Gujerati, and the learned language of her adulthood, English. Bhatt reads her poems slowly; and the poems themselves are often intense meditations upon the loss of one's tongue. Such a loss, which she likens in 'Search for my tongue' to a lizard slipping away, has incalculable consequences: the need to think a different reality. Bhatt reads with a measured desolation, inching her way forward, as if her own tongue might trip her up at any moment. The University of Keele has recently embarked upon a mammoth project to make available all the extant recordings of the great American modernist poet, William Carlos Williams. The complete set of 15 cassettes costs Pounds 100, but those with a more modest interest in the project could start with a sampler of a single cassette entitled The People and the Stones. Carlos Williams, one of the great pioneers of modernism, a contemporary of Eliot and Pound, reads 20 of his best-known poems from all the major phases of his career in the hectoring populist tone of the barnstorming preacher. Between the poems we get snatches of interviews, warts and all (car horns honk; a dog barks) in which Williams proselytizes to the enthusiastic chuckles of his audiences. The poet resembles that inconspicuous flower, the saxifrage, he tells us. It may look frail - but, my God, it can break a rock in half] Another excellent cassette in the Keele series is a sampler from the complete recordings of the Scots poet Hugh Macdiarmid, the centenary of whose birth was celebrated last year. Macdiarmid's greatest poems - the short lyrics of the 1920s and the much longer meditation upon the destiny of Scotland and her language, A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle - are often maddeningly difficult to get to grips with because of the sheer number of obscure and, to the English, seemingly unpronounceable words. Macdiarmid helpfully complements this reading of his own Scots originals with glosses in English. The verbal music alone is quite extraordinary. Zoom and new poems by Simon Armitage and Selected Poems by Sujata Bhatt: Pounds 5.95 each, available from The Poetry Business, 51 Byam Arcade, Westgate, Huddersfield HD1 1ND; The People and the Stones (Pounds 6.50) by William Carlos Williams and The Scotland of Hugh Macdiarmid (Pounds 5) are available from Dr Richard Swigg, Department of English, Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, England.</p>

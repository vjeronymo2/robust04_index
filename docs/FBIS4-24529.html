			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] A march to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre ended with minor scuffles yesterday  after police blocked access to the Xinhua (New China News  Agency) headquarters.    The confrontation came after a three-hour march in which  protesters demanded redress for the suffering of the 1989  pro-democracy movement, labelled a "counter-revolutionary riot"  by mainland authorities.    More than 3,000 people -- about half last year's number --  gathered outside Chater Garden and walked along Queensway and  Hennessy Road to Causeway Bay, then to the Xinhua offices in  Happy Valley.    A core member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the  Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Cheung Man-kwong, said  he believed people still had a strong passion for the movement.    Accompanied by alliance leader Szeto Wah and other key  members including Mak Hoi-wah and Yeung Sum, Mr Cheung led the  group in calling for the release of political dissidents in  China and singing patriotic songs.    When the group reached the Queen Elizabeth Stadium opposite  the Xinhua office, the police allowed 20 representatives to  cross Queen's Road East to hand in a petition.    Barricades kept people back about 1.5 metres from the main  entrance.    Alliance representatives were allowed to send only one  person  beyond the barricades to place the petition at the main gate.    They were not allowed to place a wreath and black banner on  the doorstep.    Alliance leaders decided to stage a sit-in until the police  yielded.    However, scuffles broke out when another demonstrator, Wong  Kin, rushed the police line in the middle of Queen's Road East,  attempting to join the alliance members.    He and a second protester were restrained and some  photographers were pulled away by policemen.    The incident sparked allegations that human rights had been  violated and that the Government might be bowing to Chinese  pressure to suppress the demonstration.    Mr Cheung, also a legislator, said it was ridiculous for the  police to insist that only the articles specified in the  petition licence could be placed at the Xinhua entrance.    He questioned the legal basis on which the police had barred  them from placing the flowers and banner on the footpath.    But Wan Chai District Commander Harold Bludd said the police  were right in imposing the restriction.    "They do not have a permit to do it. That's why. They have  a permit to hand in a petition. That's all," he said.    "It was not agreed that they would bring a flower cart, it  was not agreed that they would bring their banners. There was  no agreement that they would put them in front of the NCNA (New  China News Agency) main entrance," Mr Bludd said.</p>

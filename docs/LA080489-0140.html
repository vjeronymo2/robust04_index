			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME-BREW: A CRIME NO LONGER;  </P> <P> POPULARITY OF HOUSEHOLD BEER-MAKING IS NOW BUBBLING OVER  </P> <P> They can admit them now, these crimes of heart and palate:  </P> <P> One purveyor of beer-making supplies tried importing malt extract from England,  but was foiled when customs officials confiscated the contraband. Another  gladly sold hops and yeast, but couldn't tell customers what to do with them.  </P> <P> They were fermentation fugitives at a time when home-brewing was a crime. But a  decade ago, President Jimmy Carter gave these suppliers a sort of presidential  pardon by signing the bill that changed their lives and increased their sales  all at once.  </P> <P> "If you walked up to the counter and asked how to make beer, we couldn't tell  you," said Don Siechert, owner of Fun Fermentations in Orange. "We could sell  some of the products, but that was all."  </P> <P> In the 10 years that have passed since home-brewing of beer was legalized in  February, 1979, the number of stores selling brewing supplies has doubled from  about 1,000 to 2,000, with California in the forefront of many of these  bubbling businesses.  </P> <P> The biggest jump in home-brewing's popularity came right after legislation was  enacted that allowed adults to ferment up to 200 gallons of beer annually per  household. But the recent growth of microbreweries and brew pubs has given the  home-brewing industry yet another push.  </P> <P> In fact, Siechert says, his shop is doing so well this year that "it's  frightening," thanks to a solid core of 800 local customers and an additional  3,200 mail-order clients.  </P> <P> For what was a shadowy group of illegal practitioners 10 years ago has grown  into a population of 1.7 million brewers legally making beer at home -- and  spending a stout $400 million each year in the process, according to the  Boulder-based American Homebrewers Assn.  </P> <P> Daniel Bradford, association spokesman, said the number of home-brewers doubled  annually from 1979 until 1985 before cooling off. It took the rush of boutique  breweries and brew pubs that began to dot the nation in the mid-1980s to  rekindle public interest in home-brewing. The brewing ranks began to rise again  in 1987, with a 25% increase; 1988 showed similar growth.  </P> <P> With more than 200,000 active fermenters, California is home to more brewers  and home-brew clubs than any other state and boasts 45 of the 90 brew pubs in  the nation.  </P> <P> But that wasn't always the case. Modern home-brewing had its start during  Prohibition -- those dark, dry days from 1920 to 1933. It was a time when  commercial breweries either shut their doors or manufactured root beer and near  beer -- products that provided profits but no punch.  </P> <P> Some, say home-brew experts, circumvented the law by selling five-gallon cans  of beer wort, the liquid that ferments into beer, with labels that warned: "Do  not take the lid off. Do not add yeast. If you do, this will produce beer. This  is illegal."  </P> <P> When Prohibition was repealed by the 21st Amendment, commercial brewing of  beer, wine and spirits was again legal. Homemade wine was legalized too,  according to Charlie Papazian, author of "The Complete Joy of Home Brewing"  (1984).  </P> <P> But a sloppy stenographer omitted three key words from the proposed amendment  as it appeared in the Federal Register, according to Papazian's tome. In the  line that legalized home-brewing of wine, the typist left out the word: "and/or  beer." With that, a nation of home-brewers was doomed to decades of stealth.  </P> <P> Stealth, because home-brewers and their suppliers weren't about to give up  their labors just because you could buy a six-pack of Bud at the corner grocery  store without fear of arrest. For, as Fred Eckhardt, considered the father of  home-brewing, says: "Beer-making has been legal in the minds of home-brewers  for years."  </P> <P> The 1970s saw the beginnings of a strong home-brew movement, fostered in part  by a rebellion against the major American breweries.  </P> <P> "What really started happening in the 1970s was a qualitative rebellion against  the major brewers," said Byron Burch, author of "Brewing Quality Beers" (1986)  and owner of Great Fermentations in Santa Rosa. "When it's not 110 degrees, you  want something different than a pitcher of Coors or Budweiser. . . . We're  after beer that has a little more flavor and body."  </P> <P> The problem, though, was that supplies were hard to come by.  </P> <P> Boiling kettles and kitchen thermometers could be picked up at any housewares  store. But fermenters, bottle cappers, barley, hops, yeast and malt extract  were much harder to come by.  </P> <P> The slender selection of supplies that existed had to be imported, for no  American companies would sell to small retailers of brew supplies, said Burch.  </P> <P> At the time, Burch said, only two varieties of hops were available. Now there  are 15. Brewers could find only three kinds of grain; now there are more than a  dozen available.  </P> <P> Larry Carlson opened Wine Inc. in Akron, Ohio, in 1969 and spent the next 10  years selling mostly wine-making supplies.  </P> <P> "There was virtually no beer brewing at all," said Carlson, who operates one of  the largest brew-supply distributorships in the nation. "It was illegal, though  we did attempt to promote (it). We would bring in selected malt extracts from  England. But we had a very difficult time with U.S. Customs, which would  destroy shipments because they were brought in for something illegal. Those  were not easy years."  </P> <P> They're easier now, for the nation's home-brewers annually spend $250 each  supporting their hobby. These brewers tend to make five gallons of home-brew  each month and buy an additional 1 1/2 gallons of commercial beer in that time.  </P> <P> They're usually in their mid-30s, married, own homes and have more than a  college education. What they don't have in common is occupation. As one  beer-watcher said, home-brewers "are your next-door neighbor."  </P> <P> But they were a bit slow coming into the fold, even after home-brewing was  legalized. Fun Fermentations, for one, found that it took a while for  home-brewing to catch on and its customer list to grow.  </P> <P> "People like us were a little bit afraid," Siechert said. "We continued as  though the law had never been signed. We were afraid to get rambunctious. . . .  And we had no good supplies."  </P> <P> Fun Fermentations started out as a mail-order wine-supply business in the early  1970s, operated by Brant and Kathi Horton out of an extra bedroom. By late  1972, the business had outgrown the Horton's home, so the couple opened the  store in Orange, which they sold to Siechert in January. Before buying Fun  Fermentations, Siechert repaired computers, brewed beer and worked on and off  at the store.  </P> <P> As recently as 1985, Fun Fermentations' business was nearly all in wine-making  supplies. But in the mid-1980s, brew pubs -- those small saloons that sell beer  made on the premises -- began to crop up in Southern California. Such  operations were legalized in 1982.  </P> <P> Brew pubs, like City of Angels in Santa Monica, piqued Californians' interest  in home-brewing, industry watchers said, and the brew supply industry took off  for the second time since 1979. In fact, brew-pub owners and master brewers  often got their start at home.  </P> <P> "Four years ago, 90% of the business was wine," Siechert said. "Now it's easily  half and half. . . . We've never been busier than this year, and up until now,  it's all been beer. Wine season doesn't start until September."  </P></p>

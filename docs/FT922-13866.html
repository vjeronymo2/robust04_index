			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Moscow plays down rift with Ukraine LEADING Russian politicians in Moscow yesterday played down the danger of conflict with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea fleet, but action at the fleet headquarters of Sevastopol underlined the tension between the two sides. President Boris Yeltsin sent Admiral Vladimir Chernavin, commander of the Commonwealth of Independent States naval forces, to Sevastopol to oversee transfer of the fleet to Russian control. This followed Mr Yeltsin's decree on Tuesday taking the fleet under Russian jurisdiction - a direct counter to a similar decree issued by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine president, on Monday. The Ukraine parliament met in emergency session yesterday to discuss the crisis and Mr Ivan Pliushch, the parliamentary chairman, reported that Admiral Chernavin had told Ukrainian representatives they could have a fleet but would have to find new headquarters for it. According to Ukrainian TV, the talks between the Ukrainian and Russian representatives came to a stalemate. 'Your approach is not acceptable to us,' Mr Vasyl Durdynets, head of the Ukrainian delegation, told the Russians. Meanwhile, thousands of pro-Russian demonstrators were reported to have surrounded the fleet headquarters, brandishing banners saying 'We won't give up the Black Sea fleet' and 'Sevastopol is a city of Russian glory'. A Black Sea fleet spokesman said demonstrators had come to the defence of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the pro-Russian commander of the fleet. 'The whole town has risen up in support of the admiral,' a spokesman said. General Dmitri Volkogonov, military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, said: 'It is inconceivable that there would be war between the two great Slav states on this issue. 'We must now set up a commission between the two states to discuss these questions and we must find a compromise between us. A compromise is certainly possible.'</p>

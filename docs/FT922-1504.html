			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Economics: Focus on German money supply and cost of living ATTENTION will be focused on Germany this week where May money supply data and the cost of living index for June will be relased. German M3 money supply growth is unlikely to have slowed significantly last month. In April the year-on-year rate of growth dropped to 8.8 per cent from 9.4 per cent in March. This was still significantly above the 1992 target growth rate of between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Economists are forecasting an annual rate of inflation of 4.3 per cent in May, from a revised 4.6 per cent in April. However, they are not yet convinced that the inflationary pressures in the German economy have been successfully squeezed. Service sector prices have been particularly stubborn. In the first four months of the year they accelerated to an annual rate of 5.7 per cent following rent increases. The following are some of the other economic highlights of the week, with the figures in brackets the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International: Today: UK, May visible trade balance (Pounds 1.1bn deficit), May current account (Pounds 0.9bn deficit); Japan, May money supply (up 1.4 per cent on year), April personal consumption expenditure, April personal income; Canada, first quarter real gdp (up 0.4 per cent on previous quarter).

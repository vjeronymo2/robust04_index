			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Clinton to boost defence budget US President Bill Clinton yesterday announced a boost in defence spending intended to maintain the readiness of the US armed forces. Countering criticism from the Republicans who will take control of Congress next month, Mr Clinton promised an additional Dollars 25bn (Pounds 15.2bn) in defence spending over the next six years for US forces to ensure they 'remain the best trained, the best equipped, the best prepared fighting force on earth'. The Defence Department budget will still dip from Dollars 252bn in the current financial year, which started in October, to Dollars 246bn next year and Dollars 243bn in fiscal 1997, but it will then climb to Dollars 277bn in fiscal 2001, compared with an earlier target of Dollars 268bn. US defence spending has fallen in real terms in every year since 1986, but Mr Clinton promised that it would increase faster than inflation in 2000-2001. In addition, Mr Clinton promised not to try to cut the pay increases Congress has called for the armed forces over the next four years, and to 'spend what is required' on programmes such as housing and childcare to improve the quality of life of the military and their dependants. 'Our number one commitment is to the readiness and welfare of our armed forces,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Clinton's appearance in the Rose Garden of the White House yesterday to announce the plan represented a pre-emptive strike against Republicans who criticised the administration for creating a 'hollow force' through excessive defence cuts. A Dollars 40bn gap had emerged between the money allocated to defence by the administration's five-year budget plan and the Pentagon's own assessment of what it needed to meet the US's overall strategic aim of being able to fight two nearly simultaneous big regional wars. This was largely because of the knock-on effects of a military pay increase Congress ordered last year, when the administration had expected to include the armed forces in a pay freeze for all government employees. Mr Clinton will also ask Congress to approve around Dollars 2bn as emergency funding to pay for military missions in Haiti, the Adriatic and Kuwait. When Congress delayed approval of a similar request to fund the US troops who returned ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti this autumn, the Pentagon had to cut training in other areas to meet the unexpected cost. As a result, readiness at three army divisions dropped to a point where they could not be considered immediately available for action. This drew howls from Republicans, but some senior members of Congress have also complained that by spending whatever extra money it has on readiness and by scrimping on the development of new weapons, the Clinton administration is creating problems for the future. Even with the additional money Mr Clinton said yesterday he would allocate to defence, the Pentagon will still have to cancel or delay some new equipment programmes. But the list of cancellations may not be as long as originally expected when Mr John Deutch, deputy defence secretary, ordered the services in August to prepare plans to cut or stretch out procurement of a long list of their most cherished weapons systems, including the F-22 fighter, the Comanche helicopter and the Aegis destroyer.</p>

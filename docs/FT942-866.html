			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / FT Guide to the Week HK airport progress review The Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which deals with the details of the colony's 1997 transfer to China, reconvenes. Commentators will also be looking for signals of progress on the Hong Kong airport, which has been held up as a result of China's concerns about its financing. US and Canadian trade and agriculture ministers meet in Chicago in an attempt to resolve their farm-trade dispute. Washington has threatened to impose a quota at the end of July if the Canadians fail to agree to curbs on fast-rising exports of durum wheat, used for pasta. Ottawa has threatened to retaliate against a range of US products. US commerce secretary Ron Brown, on a trip to Latin America accompanied by 22 business leaders, inaugurates a US commercial centre in Sao Paulo. He meets Argentine President Menem on Thursday in Buenos Aires and President Frei of Chile on Friday. Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, leaves for a three-day visit to Indonesia, where he will have talks with President Suharto. Australia has been eager to promote trade ties with its south-east Asian neighbour. However, the visit has been overshadowed by protests over the Indonesian government's decision to revoke licences for three local news magazines. Nigerian military leaders meet: The Nigerian four-month National Constitutional Conference opens in Abuja. The military regime says this will help to restore civilian rule, but opponents say the government is stalling and should make way for Moshood Abiola (above), the winner of last year's annulled presidential poll, who was arrested last week. Vat in harmony: The European Commission opens a conference on European enterprises and VAT. Business leaders and Brussels officials will address the problem of how to harmonise value added tax regimes in the Union by 1997. Chess: Gary Kasparov faces his younger challengers in the second leg of the Dollars 750,000 Intel Grand Prix in New York (to June 30). India's Vishy Anand won the first leg at the Kremlin. FT Survey: Russia Holidays: Venezuela. TUESDAY Korean nuclear crisis Deputy prime ministers from North and South meet to discuss arrangements for a summit between the leaders of the two countries in an attempt to resolve the crisis precipitated by the North's nuclear programme. The Japanese government, against a background of fresh political turbulence, may announce a package of deregulation and tax reform measures in an attempt to curb the high trade surplus. Events will be closely observed by Washington and foreign exchanges, and may affect the value of the yen, the week after it attained a new high against the dollar. China's eight-year-old bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade enters a crucial stage with negotiations in Geneva today. Following Washington's decision in May to renew China's most-favoured-nation trading status and to dissolve the link between this issue and that of China's human rights record, the Gatt negotiations are bound for the home straight. Beijing hopes to become a member by the year-end, so that China can become a founder member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation. Chile's president Eduardo Frei meets US President Bill Clinton in Washington. Mr Clinton has already assured Chile that it will be next in line for a free-trade agreement, but the necessary 'fast-track' negotiating authority to enable that has run into difficulties in Congress. Haiti's exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, will speak on efforts to restore democracy in his country at the National Press Club in Washington. He is likely to repeat his demand for US military action to allow his return to Haiti. Impressionists hammered: Manet's first version of one of the most famous of all Impressionist paintings 'Un bar aux Folies-Bergere' is on offer at Sotheby's in London tonight. It is sketchy by comparison with the finished product, but a price of about Pounds 3m is anticipated. In the same auction is one of the 10 paintings of poplars completed by Monet in 1891 (above). It might also fetch Pounds 3m. FT Survey: Computer Networking. WEDNESDAY 29 Hong Kong awaits vote Chris Patten puts his democracy proposals for Hong Kong to the vote at today's meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo). The governor first mooted his proposals to broaden democracy in the colony in October 1992, immediately incurring China's wrath. China accused Mr Patten of violating the Basic Law, which lays out the constitution for Hong Kong after transition, and said that it would dismantle representative bodies upon assuming sovereignty in 1997. Some 17 rounds of talks between Britain and China failed to resolve differences. Bulgarian debt: Bulgaria and Deutsche Bank are due to sign a debt-rescheduling deal which will reduce the country's USDollars 9.27bn foreign commercial debt by USDollars 3.8bn. Last November Bulgaria and some 300 London Club commercial banks, chaired by Deutsche Bank, agreed to reduce principal on the debt, which was racked up by the former Communist regime, by about 50 per cent, and they set a mid-1994 deadline for agreeing final terms. Bulgaria plans to make an advance payment of more than USDollars 700m. The country hopes that settlement of the debt will attract foreign support in its transition to a market economy. India's prime minister PV Narasimha Rao begins a three-day visit to Russia. De Beers of South Africa, which controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds via its London-based Central Selling Organisation, reports first-half sales today. These are expected to at least match, and perhaps to exceed, the record USDollars 2.54bn reported for the first six months of 1993. Safety in numbers: 1,321 quoted companies, about 95 per cent of those in the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange, hold annual shareholders' meetings today. The companies deliberately meet on the same day in order to frustrate the efforts of sokaiya, extortionist gangs who blackmail companies not to disrupt AGMs. Rowing: Henley Royal Regatta, premier aquatic event of the English summer, opens (to July 3). Cricket: Oxford University play Cambridge University at Lord's (to July 1). FT Survey: Business Books. Holidays: Chile, Costa Rica, Malta. Thursday 30 Day gains a leap second Today's final minute will have 61 seconds, so as to bring atomic clocks in step with solar time, which is defined by the Earth's relatively erratic rotation. Atomic clocks are accurate to one second in a million years, but the Earth is gradually slowing down. Bill Birch, New Zealand's finance minister, is due to deliver the country's annual budget. It is expected to show the first fiscal surplus since the late-1970s. Mr Birch has cautioned forecasters against being too optimistic, but many economists are predicting a surplus between NZDollars 200m (USDollars 340m) and NZDollars 500m. An important question is how NZ uses this 'reward' from a decade of hard economic reform - and to what extent it chooses to meet social goals, such as a reduction in unemployment, at the expense of faster reduction in public debt. Abkhazia talks: United Nations-sponsored talks resume in Geneva between the Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists on a permanent political settlement for the embattled province. Under the terms of a ceasefire accord signed in Moscow in May, some 3,000 Russian troops are being deployed to police the Abkhaz border with the rest of Georgia. Over 200,000 non-Abkhazis fled the region during brief but bloody fighting last September. UK by-election: Labour, the main opposition party, defends the Monklands East parliamentary seat near Glasgow against a strong Scottish Nationalist party challenge. Labour has a big majority in the constituency, which was held by John Smith, the party leader who died in May. But the party is under pressure over allegations of corruption on the local council. Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani's term expires. Prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has warned his battle to topple the president could intensify if Rabbani does not step down on time. Fundamentalists in Bangladesh have called a general strike to support their demand for the death of feminist writer Taslima Nasreen on charges that she insulted Islam. Cricket: Third test between England and New Zealand begins at Old Trafford, Manchester (to July 3). FT Surveys: Executive Cars and Chemicals and the Environment. Holidays: Ecuador (Bank Holiday), Sri Lanka, Zaire. Friday 1 Russia's sell-off continues The largest sell-off of state property in the world formally enters its second phase. Foreign investors are being encouraged to join in. Germany takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. It is keen to promote opening up to eastern Europe, and to demonstrate that the Maastricht framework of closer co-operation on foreign policy and internal policing, together with enhanced powers for the European Parliament, will succeed. Roman Herzog, Germany's new president and former chief justice of the constitutional court, assumes his largely ceremonial post. EU insurance: Today is the deadline for member states to implement directives completing a single market in insurance. New currencies are due to be introduced by Uzbekistan, the Som, and Brazil, the Real - the country's fifth currency since 1986. Holidays: Bangladesh (Bank Holiday), Canada, Ghana, Pakistan (Bank Holiday), Taiwan, Thailand. Weekend 2-3 Historic Tour de France Europe's premier cycling event begins on Saturday in the northern French city of Lille (to July 24). The sweep into England, which this year comprises a symbolic stretch through the Channel tunnel as well as stages through Brighton and Portsmouth, will mark the tour's first trip across the Channel since 1974, when a circuit race was held around the Plymouth by-pass. The British stages will take place near the beginning of the 22-day endurance test which ends in Paris. Paraguayan president Juan Carlos Wasmosy on Saturday starts a working visit to Britain. It will be the first recorded visit to the country by a serving Paraguayan head of state. Guinea-Bissau polls: Sunday sees presidential and parliamentary elections in this west African state.

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> WITH SADDLEBACK AWAY, SAN CLEMENTE WINS  </P> <P> The question was inevitable.  </P> <P> Would Bill Hartman's San Clemente High School boys' cross-country team still  have been able to win the Orange County Cross-Country Championships Saturday if  Saddleback, the county's top-ranked team, had participated?  </P> <P> Few, including Coach Hartman, wanted to venture a guess. "I'm just glad we were  able to prove ourselves today," he said.  </P> <P> Most of the county's top teams competed in the county championships at Irvine  Park in Orange, but Saddleback chose to compete in the Mt. SAC Invitational in  Walnut. There, the Roadrunners placed fifth in the team sweepstakes division.  </P> <P> But as it turned out, neither Saddleback's absence nor the light morning  drizzle could dampen the spirit of county competition in the boys' and girls'  seeded varsity races.  </P> <P> In the boys' division, San Clemente, the county's second-ranked team, placed  five runners in the top 40 to win, with 101 points. El Toro, ranked ninth, was  second with 123, followed by Huntington Beach (134), Santa Ana (138) and Corona  del Mar (139).  </P> <P> The race started in a fury, with Jeff Matsumoto and Tom McCauley of Mater Dei  leading a tight pack through the first half-mile in a near sprint. Once the  runners hit the first steep, dirt hill, though, San Clemente's Mike Farrell  surged to the front.  </P> <P> Sweeping down the hill, past hundreds of fans roaring their approval, the  runners nearly tumbled on the soft, steep turf as they headed back toward the  flats. At 1 1/2 miles, Farrell ran with Matsumoto and Dana Hills' Daniel  Niednagel at his side and five other runners a half-step behind.  </P> <P> Finally, at the two-mile mark, Farrell made his move, quickly leaving  Niednagel, his South Coast League rival, and the others 10 yards behind. Over  the final mile, the 6-foot-2, 145-pound Farrell let his lanky stride do the  rest as he cruised in to win in 15:20, the fastest time of the day and six  seconds ahead of Niednagel.  </P> <P> "I knew it was gonna be me and Dan, me and Dan," said Farrell, who two weeks  ago was outkicked by Niednagel in a South Coast League dual meet. The two will  meet again Friday in the league finals, also at Irvine Park.  </P> <P> "I got him by five seconds last time, he got me by six today," Niednagel said.  "The only way to beat him is to stick with him and outkick him. I couldn't do  it today."  </P> <P> Those running against Katella's Martha Pinto know the feeling.  </P> <P> Pinto, a junior, won the girls' varsity race four, one that highlighted teams  with particularly talented individuals, in the fastest time of the day for  girls, 17:35.  </P> <P> Pinto now has run the fastest girls' time at the past three county  championships.  </P> <P> "This is her race every year," said Huntington Beach's Natalie Adam, who  finished fourth in 18:23. "Martha's incredible."  </P> <P> Pinto went out very fast -- as usual -- and didn't let up until she passed the  first mile in 5:41 with a comfortable lead. Villa Park's Susannah Thrasher,  second in 18:06, and Ocean View's Christie Engesser, third in 18:15, ran the  second- and fourth-fastest times of the day.  </P> <P> "When we were first starting, we were sprinting," Pinto said. "My coach said,  'OK, slow it down,' but I was afraid to. I didn't want them to get ahead. After  I got ahead, it was hard to keep up the pace because I was all alone."  </P> <P> In the girls' seeded team race, No.1-ranked Woodbridge placed five runners in  the top 25 to win, with 69 points. Fourth-ranked Irvine was second with 108,  followed by Los Alamitos (153), Newport Harbor (159) and Capistrano Valley  (168).  </P> <P> Newport Harbor's Kim Robinson had little trouble winning the race in 18:10, as  runner-up Tracy Fatone, a Los Alamitos sophomore, could attest.  </P> <P> "That was the hardest race of my life," Fatone said. Then, pointing to  Robinson, Fatone added: "She was always in front. Makes me sick! Do you realize  how good you are?"  </P> <P> Robinson, who won the same race last year in 18:22, said: "Coming down the last  hill, I was afraid because they're all sprinters. I thought they were gonna get  me. Especially Terri Smythers (third in 18:28) because she's really fast."  </P> <P> The seeded girls' race featured 13 runners who finished in less than 19 minutes  (five more than last year), and 40 girls under 20 minutes (eight more than last  year). Kaci Keffer (sixth) and Cathi Peck (seventh) both ran 18:52 to lead  Woodbridge to its first county title.  </P> <P> "I had one wish today: that every team would do their best, because I wanted us  to win it with everyone strong," Woodbridge Coach George Varvas said. "Today  was kind of scary for me, but for my girls it was just another day in the park;  you know, business as usual."  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPSAt Irvine Park, Orange  </P> <P> Boys  </P> <P> SEEDED RACE  </P> <P> Team  </P> <P> 1.

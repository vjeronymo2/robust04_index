			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Arts: The drama of intimidation - Three excellent fringe productions There is an electric new production at the Tricycle. Michael Henry Brown's The Day the Bronx Died starts with gunfire: a child being shot apparently without motive on a New York subway. Violence, physical and verbal, continues throughout, yet the piece passes a supreme test: never does it become violence for its own sake. This is a play about intimidation. It is not a documentary, but cannot be far from fact. Here is the Bronx breaking up in gang warfare. There are two terrifying aspects. One is that the members of the gang are so young; it seems a matter of course to be sent a gun by your elder brother, who may be already in prison, on your 15th birthday and if you have it, you have to start using it sometime. The other is that intimidation works - even of the great and the good. Even in gangland, however, there are redeeming features. Officer Bream goes about the business of maintaining law and order with apparent self-confidence, though then he is shot. People try to bring up families and educate them - in Mozart and piano competitions as well as baseball. Blacks and Jews rub along together. As Big Mickey explains, this is - or was - the melting pot. Big Mickey (Ewen Cummins) is a black who has made it to a smart apartment and is now being wooed to join the Republican Party. On stage beside him is the young Mickey he was in the Bronx (Thomas Goodridge). Clearly the upward mobility was touch and go, literally a matter of life and death. A great virtue of The Day the Bronx Died is that all this is presented without sentimentality, almost without comment. When the violence in the Bronx becomes too much, those who can simply move on. The gang in the play looks like an offshoot of the tontons macoutes, led by a boy called The Prince (Freddie Anobil-Dodoo). The most dramatic moment comes when Officer Bream (Alan Cooke) breaks the Prince's cane, but then of course, after slight hesitation, the boy feels obliged to shoot. No-one will give evidence against him. Physical fighting comes about as close as you can get to the real stuff on stage and the piece is magnificently directed - and paced - by Gordon Edelstein. It deserves a wider outing. Bronx seems topical, yet political trends can be cruel to the theatre. If My Goat - a play about hostages in Lebanon - had been first performed just a few years ago, it might have looked like a sparkling political satire. As it is, it comes out as a mixture of the macabre and the sentimental, but is still a fascinating piece, wonderfully acted at the Cockpit. Michele Celeste, the Italian who wrote it, says that he took his original source not from the Middle East, but from Naples 1943, when Neapolitan women would pick up fleeing Germans as compensation for the loss of husbands and sons who had been transported by the Nazis. There developed a kind of transfer market in hostages, though there were also some emotional attachments. Much the same happened in West Beirut in 1982/83, where the action takes place. There are only two characters. A pregnant Arab woman, whose husband has been kidnapped by one of the warring factions, is in charge of a European archaeologist, innocently caught up in the process of tit-for-tat hostaging. The goat remains in the background: a substitute child competing for food and being fattened up to be ready for selling. If there is no symbolism in the names, it is a remarkable coincidence. The woman's missing husband is called Yasser (after Arafat?). The man's German wife is called Ulrike (after Meinhof?). And the German-Spanish archaeologist is called Carlos, a name to conjure with in the world of terrorism. Moreover, Carlos is played (superbly) by Jonathan Arun in an unmistakable Irish accent. The Irish dimension adds to the strange mixture of the primitive and the sophisticated which seems to dominate Lebanon. When the woman thinks she has traded her hostage, she finds she is gazumped because the market for Frenchmen is higher. The macabre comes in with the exchange of ears and little fingers as proofs of identity; the sentimental with a man and a woman locked up together. It is not very profound, but at times it is certainly haunting. Anna Savva as the woman has a memorable husky voice and is full of intensity. This is a fine performance. Burt Caesar directs and Tom Piper's set catches that sense of parts of the Middle East being permanently rebuilt and destroyed. The Royal Court has grown fond of cooking. A few months ago it stripped the stalls in the main theatre to revive Arnold Wesker's The Kitchen, though no food was actually served. In Joe Penhall's new play, Some Voices in the Theatre Upstairs, food is lovingly prepared and sometimes appreciatively eaten. The suggestion seems to be, as in Wesker, that cooking provides a kind of therapy. Therapy matters, for Some Voices is a study in schizophrenia. The voices are heard inside the head of a young unemployed man called Ray. At times they drive him close to suicide or murder, and in one memorable scene to dousing the kitchen and himself with paraffin. Yet the voices can stop just as mysteriously as they start. Ray is saved, at least for the time being, by his elder brother Pete, the chef. The piece is a remarkable mixture of violence and tenderness. I would guess that the references to schizophrenia have been carefully researched. Equally authentic are the scenes of drifting homelessness, of people who move in and out of mental institutions and those who survive on a mixture of crime and social benefits. Despite the violence, it is the humanity that stands out. Movingly played by Lee Ross, Ray has a brief period of happiness with Laura (Anna Livia Ryan), a girl in tow to the flashy thug, Dave. Yet even Dave (Lloyd Hutchinson), who comes to a sticky end, has had his moments of feeling. None of the characters, including Ives (Tom Watson), the old man who says he has come to like his mental home, is flat. Ives indeed has a scene of his own describing how the madness came upon him in an explosion at the gasometer where he worked: we never know whether this is true and nor does it matter. Best of the lot is Ray Winstone's Pete in his soothing care of his brother. At first I thought this would be a dull part. It is a measure of the strength of Penhall's writing, however, that it grows to become dominant. Penhall is a young playwright to watch. Ian Rickson directs and the production is sponsored by The Jerwood Foundation which specialises in the welfare of the young.</p>

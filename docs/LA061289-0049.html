			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRICES ARE GOING UP FOR THIS GOING-OUT-OF-BUSINESS SALE  </P> <P> It hasn't taken Gene Klein any time at all to start improving the value of the  horses he is going to offer in a dispersal sale in Kentucky in November.  </P> <P> Klein, the most successful owner in racing since he started paying big prices  for horses in 1982, announced on Friday that he will leave the game because of  a desire to do some extensive traveling with his wife, Joyce, who introduced  him to the sport.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Klein's Is It True won the $117,000 Riva Ridge Stakes at Belmont  Park. Then, on Sunday at Belmont, Open Mind, Klein's superb 3-year-old filly,  beat Gorgeous by a head in the $227,200 Mother Goose.  </P> <P> Open Mind has also won the Acorn here, and if she can win the Coaching Club  American Oaks on July 3, she will become the seventh horse to sweep Belmont's  three-race series for 3-year-old fillies.  </P> <P> Under Angel Cordero in the Mother Goose, Open Mind ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 2/5,  setting a stakes record.  </P> <P> Open Mind, winning her eighth straight stake, earned $136,000 and paid $2.60 to  win. Gorgeous, a shipper from Hollywood Park, was ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye  and they finished 18 lengths ahead of Mite of Fun.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Worry over Crest plans While professional investors await eagerly the arrival of Crest, a settlements system that does away with paper for securities trading, its advent early in 1996 is worrying many retail investors. The Bank of England, which is controlling Crest while it is being assembled, released a progress report this week outlining some of the changes individual investors can expect. Under Crest, the existing 14-day settlement gap will be condensed into a five-day rolling period. This will change the way private investors handle their dealings and alter their relationships with their stockbrokers, the report suggests. It acknowledges that private clients may well have to use nominee companies if they cannot hold paper share certificates and if they are to settle all transactions so much more quickly. But moves are being made to smooth the transition. The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body which covers private client stockbrokers, is seeking new laws to bring so-called nominee companies under the Financial Services Act. Such laws would require all companies to seek authorisation from a regulatory body. Should a company become insolvent, and if assets of clients disappeared, they could claim under the Investors Compensation Scheme - a crucial point. The Bank also is searching for ways to ease the anxiety for private investors. Those who do not wish to keep their shares in a nominee company may be cheered by a proposal to introduce 'sponsored membership.' This would allow individuals to become members of Crest - and have their trades settled through it - without having to buy such infrastructure as computer systems or place their shares in a nominee company. A sponsored member would have to arrange credit facilities to cover stock purchases and sign a contract with Crest, as well as authorising another member to give instructions to the system on his behalf. Private clients could designate their broker as their intermediary, although the Bank warns that investors would 'be exposed to risk if their agent should act in error or improperly.' Meanwhile, another initiative is on the way. This comes from ProShare, a group which promotes individual share ownership, and is aimed particularly at investors who enjoy their direct relationship with the companies in which they invest. ProShare is urging a voluntary agreement under which the listed company could extend the rights of company ownership to the customers of nominees. This would need to be matched by nominees passing - with their clients' consent - relevant details about customers to the registrars. ProShare hopes to settle all details by May. Whatever happens, both the Bank and the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers say it is inevitable there will be changes in the way private investors deal. The move to five-day rolling settlement means that unless clients shift their shares to the account of a nominee, there will be practical difficulties in delivering either cash or shares to their broker in time. Geoffrey Turner, chief executive of APCIMS, Turner says it is likely brokers will have to re-write completely the letters of agreement they have on file for each client. The Bank says private clients appear already to have difficulty making payments within five days of buying stock. In a recent survey, the Stock Exchange found that 30 per cent of all deals made six days before the settlement deadline were not paid on time, and that the majority of these were those of small private investors. Turner believes that intra-account trading almost certainly is a thing of the past. While some clients manage to buy and sell a stock within the present 14-day settlement period, this will become almost impossible under the five-day system. 'No one has said intra-account trading is banned but, as a practical matter, it will be very difficult,' he says. All told, the advent of Crest undoubtedly will change the way private clients invest their assets. How smoothly the transition to the new arrangements is made would seem to depend as much on the diligence of the client as on the efficacy of the broker.</p>

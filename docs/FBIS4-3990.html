			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Jianqing (2621 1696 7230)] </F>   [Text] Macao, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, said yesterday that  while China would like to explore and study [tan tao he yan jiu  2232 6062 0735 4282 4496] the human rights issue with other  countries, it opposes the linkage of this issue with the trade  issue.    Wu Yi made this statement at a news conference last evening  while answering a question concerning Sino-U.S. trade relations.    She said: The most-favored-nation [MFN] issue is one key  provision of the trade accord China and the United States signed  when the two countries established diplomatic relations. It is  also the foundation of the development of the two countries'  trade. She stressed: The MFN issue is strictly a trade issue.  China will never accept any attempt to link trade with  irrelevant issues, especially the human rights issue.    Wu Yi said: China is not afraid even if confrontation ever  occurs on the MFN issue [ru guo shuo zai zui hui guo dai yu wen  ti shang fa sheng dui kang, zhong guo ye bu hai pa 1172 2654  6141 0961 2584 1920 0948 1765 0795 7344 0006 4099 3932 1417 2123  0022 0948 0048 0008 1364 1830]. It has now established trade  relations with more than 200 countries and regions. It has many  trade partners.    She added: We hope the United States can properly resolve  the MFN issue and will not do anything that may give rise to  confrontation on this issue because that will not be in the  interest of both countries.    Wu Yi arrived in Macao from Hong Kong the other day to  attend  the seventh board of directors meeting of the Nanguang Holdings  Company Ltd. after concluding her visit in the United States.</p>

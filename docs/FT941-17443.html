			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The new year has brought a rude reminder that the US Treasury market's tolerance to bad news is not inexhaustible. Dealers had grown accustomed to report after report showing the economy expanding at a stronger- than-expected rate in the fourth quarter. Yields on longer-dated bonds remained fairly stable through most of December. However, as the first quarter begins, the market seems to have lost some of its composure. Last Thursday, news of a surge in new-home sales rekindled fears of inflation and sent the yield on the 30-year issue up 10 basis points to 6.34 per cent. The jump was somewhat exaggerated by the low volume of trading. Yesterday, the market was hit with a further blow. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its December composite index, an important leading indicator, rose to 57.9 per cent, from November's reading of 55.7 per cent. It was the third straight increase and the index's highest level in a year. In reaction, the benchmark 30-year issue dropped a point to 97 13/16 , and the yield jumped to 6.41 per cent in late trading. On the short end, the two-year note was off  1/8 to 99 7/8 , to yield 4.299 per cent.</p>

He accused the  Americns of doing nothing to stop the war there. He added, in an  interview with AL-HAYAH conducted in Paris yesterday, that the  United States had not behaved reasonably towards an important  partner such as Pakistan, and that the sanctions it imposed have  hurt his country.    The Pakistani foreign minister touched on the Afghan  question  in his interview, saying that the reason for the failure of the  peace accords there was the disqualification of the military  sides from the solution and opining that there had to be a broad  solution including all sides. Regarding the Egyptian "Afghans"  who say that Pakistan expelled them from its territory, he said,  "It was hard for us to distinguish between Egyptians and  Sudanese, because they all carried Sudanese passports."    Asif Ali further confirmed that his country had made a  decision to remain in Somalia for as long as its people required  the presence of Pakistani forces. He also reaffirmed his demand  that a referendum be held in Kashmir to grant its population the  freedom of self-determination, and denied that his country had  any intention to annex this region. The text of the interview  follows.  <H5>  Kashmir </H5>   Regarding the bases upon which, in Pakistan's view, a  Kashmir  settlement should rest, he said, "Our view is simple in this  regard; there must be coexistence between the civilized entities  of the world, and in accordance with Islamic principles, and  with what United Nations law stipulates. There are the Security  Council resolutions on Kashmir that must be implemented, chiefly  the holding of a referendum by which the residents of Kashmir  may decide whether they want to join the Indians, or Pakistan."    Addressing the likelihood of a Turkish-Pakistani solution in  Bosnia after the visit of the two countries' prime ministers to  Sarajevo, he said, "Our position on this crisis is one with that  of the 52 countries of the Islamic Conference Organization. It  stipulates the sovereignty of nations and respect for human  rights. If the sovereignty of one country is destroyed, and that  is accepted in principle, then the sovereignty of the other  nations comes into question."    He believes that it is essential not to legitimize  aggression  through hasty solutions, saying that "a veiled peace will never  lead to lasting peace; the two world wars are the best proof of  that. Therefore we do not understand Europe's position. We do  not understand how Europe made this costly mistake. The results  of this mistake will be serious and dangerous for the future of  Europe, the Atlantic alliance, and the UN. My view is that  depriving a country of the right of self-defense is immoral, and  we condemn it vigorously. Nor do we understand the reason why  Europe does not take responsibility for the war going on in the  middle of the continent. It holds to the principle of  coexistence among religions and peoples, so why does Europe not  do so in this matter?"    He discussed his belief that the United States has not taken  a well-defined position on the war in Bosnia; he said that the  Americans "are not doing a thing."  <H5>  Relations With Washington </H5>   On another front, the foreign minister commented on the U.S.  decision to freeze its aid to Pakistan because of doubts about  its development of a nuclear bomb. "Traditionally we have had  excellent relations with the United States, and we hope that  they will return and resume in order to remove the  misunderstanding arising primarily from the nuclear issue. The  American law, known as the Pressler Amendment, forbids us from  getting weapons systems for which we have paid more than $1  billion in cash. This harms us and has made us feel that there  is an anti-Pakistan bias." He added that Islamabad considers  that the United States "has not behaved reasonably, especially  towards one of its important partners." As to his nuclear  policy, he said that he had explained to the three senators who  visited his country recently that Pakistan had maintained to the  international community that it will not develop an atomic bomb.  He confirmed that Islamabad refused to sign the nuclear  non-proliferation treaty because India had not signed it and  thus the problem was a regional one. He pointed out that his  country had submitted very significant proposals in this regard.  "We are ready to sign the treaty as soon as India signs it."  <H5>  Neighboring Countries </H5>   Speaking of Pakistan's efforts, with Saudi Arabia, to  mediate  between the two warring sides in Afghanistan, he said, "I  believe that the major groups have not taken part. This is my  personal view, not as a foreign minister but as a political  analyst. Now, our inclination is to reach an accord between all  the neighboring countries of Afghanistan. We all agree on the  solution, and we say that it must be a broad one embracing all  sides, from the military men to the jihad factions and others.  Only then will we be able to achieve a lasting solution, because  historically, and over two and a half centuries, Afghanistan has  been a country whose unity was based on a wide-ranging  alliance." AL-HAYAH asked him whether Pakistan's rapprochement  with Turkey, was aimed against Iran, and whether it was linked  to his country's excellent relations with the Gulf states. He  said, "Our relations with Turkey are not aimed at Iran. Iran is  a friendly country and very close to us; it is a neighbor, bound  to us by great understanding, just as with Afghanistan. Our  relations are aimed at strengthening these ties. Regarding the  Gulf, unfortunately Iran does not have excellent relations with  the Gulf states, and some Gulf states are uneasy to some extent,  especially after Iran seized some islands."    Addressing Egypt's request to have the Arab Afghans handed  over, he said, "There are a number of Egyptian fighters who came  to Afghanistan and had headquarters in Peshawar; they were  fighting in Afghanistan and used Peshawar as a base. Some of  them are charged with acts of terrorism in Egypt. We were  recently asked to turn them over. It is very hard for us to  distinguish between who is Egyptian and who is Sudanese, because  the routes by which they came all passed through Khartoum, and  their passports with visas from our embassy were Sudanese. The  Egyptian interior minister and chief of intelligence visited us,  and our chief of intelligence visited Egypt; I think that they  can distinguish between an Egyptian for themselves, and a number  of those were prevented from entering Pakistan." He explained  that he thought these numbered between 20 and 30, "but we cannot  hand over citizens with Sudanese passports to Egypt."    In response to a question on whether the withdrawal of the  Europeans and the United States from Somalia would affect the  mission of the Pakistani forces there, he said, "We do not make  our decisions based on what the United States and Europe decide.  We have decided to remain in Somalia for as long as the Somali  people need us."</p>

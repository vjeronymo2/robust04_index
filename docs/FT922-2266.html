			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / NEC to boost US chip output NEC, the Japanese electronics company, plans to triple production of semiconductors at its plant in Roseville, California, by the end of next year, through investment of Dollars 200m. The expansion will lift capacity from 10,000 6-inch wafers a month for 4-megabit dynamic random access memory chips (DRAM) to 30,000 wafers a month. The decision is a sign of NEC's renewed confidence in the market for memory chips, which is currently deeply depressed. The company believes the recent increase in demand coming from US buyers will continue strongly into next year. The expansion of production will also help NEC to increase sales into the US market without exacerbating the tense trade relations with the US. The US has applied pressure on Japan to increase purchases of foreign-made chips. NEC may introduce to the Roseville plant production of 16M DRAM chips, the most advanced memory devices.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Best practice for survival - The EU's first environmental audit for farms Farmers pride themselves on being the guardians of the countryside. So it is perhaps surprising that many of them have given little thought to measuring production methods according to their impact on the environment. This week, however, the European Union's first environmental audit for farms was launched in London. The brainchild of Leaf (Linking Environment and Farming), a British organisation promoting profitable but environmentally-friendly farming, the audit has won support from government, conservationists, supermarkets, banks and even agrochemical manufacturers. Farmers' very survival could depend on adopting practices such as careful pesticide use, crop rotation and energy conservation which the audit is designed to monitor, according to some of the speakers at the launch. 'Care and concern for the environment does not necessarily add cost, but lack of quality certainly does,' says Don Phillips, sales marketing director of Dalgety Agriculture, the UK grain trader, which helped sponsor the audit. 'We need to associate ourselves with farmers who clearly understand the need for best farming practices. They will be the survivors.' Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, glimpsed the potential for countering Britain's Pounds 6bn trade deficit in food and drink. 'I hope that carrying out this exercise will help farmers get and maintain markets for their produce by building a better image for their products,' she says. Leaf is part of a pan-European project to promote 'integrated crop management'. This involves using crop rotations and natural predators to reduce reliance on pesticides and fertilisers, along with positive management of the landscape and wildlife habitats. For the agrochemical companies, environmentally-sensitive farming is preferable to a public backlash against all chemical inputs if intensive production methods continue. Initially the audit is being targeted at larger farmers. Those with 100 hectares or more will be invited to buy the questionnaire, which costs Pounds 20 and takes about two hours to fill in, according to Leaf. It is divided into eight sections covering the landscape, wildlife habitats, soil management, crop protection, energy conservation, pollution control, animal welfare, and farm planning and organisation. Caroline Drummond, co-ordinator of Leaf, hopes the audit will be used by about 3,000 British farmers in the first year and eventually be taken up as an annual exercise 'by the industry as a whole'. Self-assessment by farmers is the first step, but Leaf is considering a three-yearly external audit to monitor the scheme if there is demand for it. Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, backed the 'integrated' farming approach in a speech in Brussels last month. Surpluses could not be reduced just by price cuts, compensatory payments and laying fallow arable land, he said. 'Farms must optimise their production costs, adapt to market forces and compete by producing goods with a high level of defined quality, for which they can command attractive prices without the need for agricultural subsidies.' Some farmers at the launch remained unconvinced. Hugh Oliver-Bellasis, a member of the council of the National Farmers' Union, said he feared that maintaining high production standards would put UK farmers at a disadvantage to producers using cheaper methods elsewhere. 'In vegetable production, there are some very nasty, very cheap insecticides on the market, and there are some very good, very safe products which are considerably more expensive,' he said. But Geoff Spriegel of J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain, insisted the same standards applied to all the group's suppliers.</p>

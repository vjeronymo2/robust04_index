			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Spanish office complex BOVIS INTERNACIONAL de ESPANA SA, a P&amp;O company, has won a Pounds 167m project management contract to build a retail and office development project for Centros Comerciales Continente, Glorias Diagonal, SA and Centre Corts, SA in Barcelona, Spain. To be known as 'Barcelona Glories', the 1.09m sq ft development will provide 750,000 sq ft of retail space, including a new hypermarket for Centros Comerciales Continente, 340,000 sq ft of lettable office space and 1.4m sq ft of underground parking. This new development will occupy four city blocks on the site of the former Olivetti plant on the Plaza de Las Glorias Catalanas - a focal point of the main thoroughfares of Barcelona. Designed by architects Jos Galan, Cristian Cirici and Joaquin Sainz de Vicuna, the development will incorporate a number of unusual building techniques. Special diaphragm slurry walls will be used to construct the four-story underground car park with three of the floors being situated below the Barcelona water table. These walls will be installed to create the perimeter of the underground car park. Subsoil conditions make the installation of this watertight environment a highly complex exercise. The exact location and size of the sand and clay areas will be determined by extracting samples of the soil and performing water pumping tests. The permeability of the subsoil must be known before the type of slab on grade is determined. The uncertain subsoil conditions make accurate planning one of the biggest challenges of the project. The 1940s style factory building will be transformed into a commercial and office building complex. A section of the rear of this building has already been demolished. The remaining front part of the building will be carefully retained as the adjacent four-storey underground car park is excavated. The old factory will be refurbished to create high quality office and retail space, featuring 12 ft high ceilings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- France condemned Monday  [25 April] the recent bomb attacks in South Africa saying that  it hopes the incidents will not set back the democratic process  in that country.    "We condemn these irresponsible incidents and their authors  who are trying to scuttle the South African political process to  which nearly all the parties have lent their support," Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said.    Duque was reacting to a bombing campaign in recent days by  suspected white extremists opposed to the country's first  all-race elections this week. [passage omitted]</p>

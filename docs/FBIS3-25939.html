The briefing was attended by the Kunming-based National  People's Congress deputies, Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee members,  persons in charge of the provincial branches of various  democratic parties and people's organizations, well-known public  figures without party affiliation, as well as prominent ethnic  minority and religious personages.    Lang Dazhong said in his report: Since the Second Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee concluded  last August, the provincial party committee and government have  attached great importance to the deep anticorruption struggle,  conscientiously carried out mobilization work and made  arrangements in this regard, and employed practical and feasible  measures. The discipline inspection, supervision,  procuratorial, judicial, and other functional departments across  the province have also done a lot of work to this end. The  broad masses of the people have reported and provided clues on a  large number of corruption cases with the result that a batch of  major and serious corruption cases have been cracked and  handled, a batch of corrupt elements penalized, a batch of  malpractices resented by the masses wiped out, and a batch of  unreasonable charges abolished. The malpractice of going on  domestic and overseas sightseeing tours at public expense in  disguised form has been put to an end. With a serious and  conscientious attitude, leading cadres at and above city level  across the province have also held internal democratic meetings;  placed themselves under the supervision of the masses; and  conducted self-examination and self-rectification in accordance  with the five central regulations on building a clean government  and maintaining self-discipline among cadres with the result  that a batch of problems have been resolved. These activities  have dealt a telling blow at all types of negative and corrupt  phenomena. At the moment, the provincewide anticorruption  struggle is still going on in an in-depth manner in accordance  with the central arrangements.    Lang Dazhong stated: The whole province should make  continued efforts to fulfill three major tasks during the next  stage of the anticorruption struggle and heighten understanding  of the anticorruption struggle; consciously adhere to the  principle of firmly and simultaneously grasping two key work  aspects; concentrate on attaining three goals; see to it that  leading cadres remain honest and maintain self-discipline; and  waste no time in investigating and handling corruption cases and  rectifying malpractices. At the moment, we should also make  every possible endeavor to prevent such malpractices as holding  banquets and giving gifts at public expense, engaging in  extravagance and waste, and so on, from recurring during the  Lunar New Year Festival.    The meeting was also attended by Ling Huan, provincial party  committee deputy secretary; Yang Ming and Mai Xiqiu, provincial  people's congress standing committee vice chairmen; Dao Shixun,  Xiang Chaozong, and Liu Bangrui, provincial CPPCC committee vice  chairmen; as well as persons in charge of the relevant  departments.</p>

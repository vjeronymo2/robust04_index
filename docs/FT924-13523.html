			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Television cookery programmes have improved out of all recognition. True, you do still come across the occasional man with a camp hairdo and a silly accent standing behind a studio gas stove telling you that this is one he made earlier, but increasingly rarely. Setting the standard today are series such as Keith Floyd's on Spain where the sharing of recipes is just one among a number of ambitions. A Cook's Tour Of France with its location camerawork and interest in local traditions and personalities has much more in common with Floyd than with the old studio gas stove routine. Here the hostess is Mireille Johnston who today visits Brittany (8.00 BBC2). Given the current scarcity of good British comedies it seems odd of BBC1 to screen Waiting For God and the repeats of One Foot In The Grave on the same night (8.30 &amp; 10.20), especially since both are concerned with the modern tribulations of old age. BBC2's series about life in Britain today, Present Imperfect (9.30) looks tonight at Steve and Dennis, travelling evangelists who use video and pop music to appeal to their target audience: children.</p>

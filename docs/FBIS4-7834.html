			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 6 (AFP) -- Around 15,000 people who  fled fighting in Mostar, south Bosnia, are to return home from  refugee camps in Croatia, according to a Croatian Refugee Office  statement issued Wednesday [6 April].    Croat authorities decided on Tuesday to withdraw refugee  status from those concerned, who were forced to flee fighting  between Moslems and Croats in the Mostar region in spring 1993.    The authorities said hostilities in the region between the  two sides had ceased some time ago.    The statement said the repatriation followed "a growing  number of requests from people from Mostar" and did not involve  sending back "invalids, sick people and all those whose houses  or apartments have been destroyed."    According to the statement, the refugees will return home  gradually and with the full collaboration of the local  authorities in Mostar.</p>

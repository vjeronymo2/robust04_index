			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Italy seeks political consensus to avoid poll THE two day-old Ciampi government was last night desperately trying to patch together a new consensus among Italy's political parties to avoid the damaging consequences of elections before electoral reform has been enacted. This followed a dramatic blow to the new government from the withdrawal late on Thursday night of three ministers of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the one Green cabinet member. They withdrew in protest after parliament voted to preserve the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, from facing serious charges of corruption. Uncertainties about the duration of the much-weakened government yesterday affected the lira, which was trading at L941 against the D-Mark. This compared with L928 when Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, was chosen on Monday to head Italy's 52nd post-war government. Efforts to head off the storm of protest provoked by the Craxi vote centred on proposals to end parliamentary immunity in cases of corruption. However, a simpler proposal, which would not involve a change of the constitution, was for secrecy to be removed in voting. Such secrecy is regarded as the reason behind the majority vote in favour of Mr Craxi. Some members of opposition parties, such as the populist Lombard League, the neo-fascist MSI and the hardline communist Reconstructed Communism, are understood to have voted with Mr Craxi's allies in order to discredit the government and force early elections. Italy's press yesterday emphasised the gravity of the situation, saying the stability of the country was at serious risk. Newspapers doubted whether Mr Ciampi would be able to survive long enough to introduce new electoral laws. Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement, warned that 'without electoral reform, the chamber of deputies could return up to 20 parties in a new election'. Demonstrations were staged in many large cities denouncing parliament and attacking Mr Craxi for hiding behind its immunity. Last night, the PDS was firm in its decision to withdraw its three ministers who had spent less than 10 hours with the science, finance and parliamentary affairs portfolios. The same applied to the Greens who pulled out of the environment ministry. Magistrates vow to fight, Page 2 World stocks, Page 21</p>

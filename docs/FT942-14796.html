			<p>940419 FT  19 APR 94 / Directors' training priorities revealed Equal opportunities, foreign languages and international competitiveness are the three topics on which newly appointed senior managers and directors are the least likely to receive training, says the Industrial Society, Lisa Wood writes. Business planning and people management are the two top training topics in the society's latest training trends survey of 458 managers. Some 44 per cent of senior managers, for example, said that management of people was their current priority for the training of senior staff. By comparison, international competitiveness came at the bottom of the list. Board level directors expressed slightly more interest in international competitiveness, although it still came at the bottom end of their list.</p>

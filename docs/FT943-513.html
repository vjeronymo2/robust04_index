			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / US durable goods orders rise sharply US durable goods orders rose sharply in August, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, signalling that the US economy is continuing to expand steadily. The Commerce Department announced that new orders for manufactured durable goods rose by 6 per cent last month to Dollars 154bn, a slightly steeper increase than had generally been expected. The increase provoked short-lived fears in the financial markets that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates further to bring the pace of economic growth back to a steadier and less inflation-prone level. But the jump was not much larger than had been anticipated and was set against a 4 per cent decline in July. After an initial flurry markets settled back to watch other indicators. The Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets the Fed's interest rate policy, made no announcement of any change in interest rates after its meeting on Tuesday. Financial markets have interpreted this absence of any clear signal as meaning that the FOMC gave Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, considerable leeway to raise interest rates if economic data before its next meeting in November show the economy still growing faster than can be sustained without an upsurge in inflation. But the Fed chairman was not expected to respond so soon after the FOMC meeting to one apparently strong economic statistic, particularly one as volatile as durable goods orders, which can bounce wildly because of a handful of new aircraft orders. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the durable goods data indicated investment was still an important factor behind economic expansion. He called this 'a positive sign for productivity growth prospects and for sustained moderation in inflation'. The commerce department said motor vehicles and parts contributed to over half both of the rise in orders in August and of the fall in July because some car makers had retooled for the new model year a month earlier than usual. Transportation equipment, including aircraft, rose 19.1 per cent in August after dropping 14.8 per cent in July.</p>

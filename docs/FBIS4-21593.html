			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [AP, YONHAP report from Vienna] </F>   [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Spokesman  David Kyd disclosed on 23 March that it seems that North Korea  will complete the construction of its second nuclear reactor  within this year. Spokesman Kyd said that North Korea is  building its second nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The 50  megawatt nuclear reactor is scheduled for completion by the end  of this year.    He said that North Korea is currently building a third  nuclear reactor in Taechon, which is even more secluded than  Yongbyon, and that the 200 megawatt reactor will begin  operations early in 1996.    He pointed out, however, that the practical issue regarding  North Korea's plan for nuclear development is how North Korea  dealt with the nuclear fuel it extracted from the small five  megawatt nuclear reactor which has been in operation since 1987.</p>

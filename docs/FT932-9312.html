			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Richmond Park sees the return of shire horses Shire horses are returning to Richmond Park, west London, after an absence of more than 30 years. Mr Mike Fitt, park superintendent, said two horses (above) have begun work in a pilot scheme to reduce the costs of using tractors and other vehicles. The park's management is seeking sponsorship 'in the region of Pounds 500,000' to fund the scheme, which will include fitting out farm buildings to use as a nature study centre for school parties and disabled people. The horses are being used for haymaking, harrowing and as an environmentally friendly method of transportation in woodland conservation areas. If the scheme is successful the management of the royal parks hopes to extend the use of working horses to other London parks.</p>

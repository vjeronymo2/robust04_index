			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAPTIVE AUDIENCES;  </P> <P> VIEWERS FIND THEY ARE AT MERCY OF THEIR COMMUNITY CABLE COMPANIES FOR PRICE,  SERVICES, CHANNELS  </P> <P> You can choose your friends, your supermarket and the right to remain silent if  you are arrested. But once you settle into a place to live, you cannot choose  your cable television company.  </P> <P> Like electricity and gas providers, cable companies are monopolies in the areas  they serve, but with an important difference. Power companies provide a uniform  product -- there is no discernible difference between the electricity provided  by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and, say, Southern California  Edison. But cable TV services and the prices you pay for them can vary widely.  </P> <P> About 20 cable companies operate on the Westside and in the San Fernando,  Conejo, Simi and Antelope valleys, each with a different fee schedule, channel  lineup and installation charge. Among those systems surveyed for this article,  the fees for basic service range from $10 to $19.90 a month, the installation  charges run the gamut from $15 to $52, the number of channels available for a  basic fee range from 10 to 48, and the charge for the most popular of the  premium services, Home Box Office, ranges from $9.95 to $14.65 a month (see  chart).  </P> <P> The reasons for all this diversity are historical, political and financial.  Some of these systems, especially in areas where television reception was  extremely poor or non-existent before the advent of cable, are well over 20  years old. They were built long before technology expanded the number of  available channels and enhanced the quality of reception.  </P> <P> Others came on line during the cable boom years of the late 1970s and early  1980s, when the competition to wire urban areas was intense. In bidding wars,  cable companies promised municipalities large numbers of basic and pay  services, plus other goodies such as public access and local government  channels, pay-per-view capability and stereo sound.  </P> <P> Until Dec. 29, 1986, municipalities could regulate the fees that cable  companies charged customers, but that considerable bargaining chip was taken  away by a federal cable deregulation law that bars state and local governments  from setting rates. Fees have, not surprisingly, gone up since then. According  to Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who introduced legislation in May to bring  back some regulation to the industry, basic cable service prices have risen 32%  nationally since deregulation. Cable operators have spoken out against the  proposed legislation, which is still in committee, saying that fees were kept  artificially low when they were regulated and that they needed to bring in more  income to update and maintain their systems.  </P> <P> The following is a capsule look at cable operators serving the Westside and the  valleys:  </P> <P> ATC-American Cable Vision: Serving 18,800 customers, out of a potential  subscriber base of almost 21,500 in Canyon Country, this system is owned by one  of the industry giants -- American Television Communications, which itself is  82% owned by Time Warner, which also owns HBO and Cinemax.  </P> <P> Cablevision: With 77,000 subscribers out of a possible 180,000 households, West  Valley Cablevision is the largest cable operator in the San Fernando Valley. It  serves an area west of the San Diego Freeway plus the city of San Fernando.  </P> <P> CalaVision: This relatively small system, built in 1969 in Calabasas, has 1,200  customers out of a possible 1,500. Cable professionals call this a captive  system because over-the-air television reception in the area is poor.  </P> <P> Capp's Electronics: Only 203 households (out of 253) subscribe to this system  in Lake Hughes, about 20 miles northeast of Castaic Lake. Owned by electronics  dealer Capp Loughboro of Ventura, it is, by far, the smallest system in the  area.  </P> <P> Century Cable: The lucrative Westside market has been a headache for this huge  system, which has the largest number of subscribers of the 17 companies  surveyed (143,900 in Los Angeles County). Begun by Howard Hughes in the early  1950s, the system has gone through several owners, most recently Century, which  purchased it in 1987. The system includes the communities of Beverly Hills,  Santa Monica and West Hollywood, all of which have taken an active role in  overseeing their cable service. Indeed, last year, because of numerous  complaints about customer service, the Beverly Hills City Council collected  fines from Century, accusing the company of violating service provisions in its  contract. At the time William Rosendahl, vice president of Century, complained  that the area probably had the toughest standards in the country for cable  operators.  </P> <P> In addition, West Hollywood threatened to break its contract with Century over  the service issue last year, and Santa Monica has been negotiating over the  franchise renewal for years.  </P> <P> This year the controversies have cooled in Beverly Hills and West Hollywood,  and Rosendahl said the company is finalizing its negotiations with Santa  Monica. He also said Century is partway through a massive rebuilding program to  make it state-of-the-art.  </P> <P> But controversy is likely to stir again when Century increases its rates for  basic service Sept. 1 to $19 in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills and to $18.25  in all its other areas.  </P> <P> Continental Cablevision: This system, one of the largest in the Los Angeles  area, includes Venice, Mar Vista, Culver City, Palms and parts of Marina del  Ray, West Los Angeles and Hollywood. (There are 86,000 subscribers in Los  Angeles County.)  </P> <P> Until the system was bought by American Cablesystems in 1986, large portions of  </P> <P> its franchise area in Hollywood remained unwired for cable, much to the  consternation of its residents. American began an expansion that wired about  25,000 additional households per year and that expansion has been continued by  Continental Cablevision, which took over in February, 1988.  </P> <P> According to Continental's director of marketing, Ed Gorman, all but about  50,000 homes in its service area are wired for cable and the expansion  continues.  </P> <P> Comcast Cablevision: Covering portions of Simi Valley, the system is undergoing  a rebuilding and expansion of services. This month four channels, including  VH-1 and C-Span, were added to its basic service lineup.  </P> <P> Comcast has 23,400 subscribers out of a possible 32,000.  </P> <P> Crescenta Valley Cable: This small system in the La Crescenta area has about  1,500 subscribers, out of a possible 3,000, getting its 31 basic channels.  </P> <P> Falcon Cable TV: Covering unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County in the  vicinity of Calabasas, Topanga Canyon and Woodland Hills, plus parts of Malibu  and Thousand Oaks, Falcon has largely a captive audience that cannot receive  much television without cable. Parts of its system are more than 20 years old,  which has led to reception problems.  </P> <P> Last year, Thousand Oaks took the serious step of commissioning an $18,000  study of the situation. At the time, city officials said the study was  undertaken in case the city decided to change cable operators when the system  came up for refranchising in 1991 (under federal law, a city must provide  evidence as to why it wants to switch companies).  </P> <P> Recently, Thousand Oaks employee Carol Williams said that although the study is  an "ongoing process," in the last year Falcon has shown a willingness to work  with city officials to formulate a plan to rebuild and improve the system.  Falcon has 13,500 subscribers out of a possible 17,000.  </P> <P> Jones Intercable: In a rapidly growing area of the Antelope Valley, this system  covering Palmdale, Lancaster and California City has 43,000 subscribers out of  a possible 65,000.  </P> <P> King VideoCable: Now undergoing a two-year, $7-million rebuilding project to  replace equipment throughout the system, King covers a large area that includes  Sunland, Tujunga, Sylmar, Pacoima, Newhall Saugus and Valencia.  </P> <P> In the Sunland-Tujunga area, it is known for a particularly active, locally  oriented public access channel, which includes a local newscast several nights  a week. (The newscast, which has been off for the past several months during  the rebuilding, is due to be revived soon.) Subscribers in the area pay 50  cents a month extra to support the channel. King has 26,000 subscribers out of  a possible 39,000.  </P> <P> Littlerock Cable TV: This system has a two-tier basic price system that offers  10 channels for a monthly charge of $10. For an additional $5.50, customers get  an additional 14 channels.  </P> <P> It has 2,000 subscribers out of a possible 3,000. The company is working on an  expansion that will double its level of potential subscribers.  </P> <P> Lost Hills Communications: This new system near the Hidden Hills area serves a  small group of new homes. It has 922 subscribers our of a possible 1,142.  </P> <P> Mountain Meadows Cable: This small system in Moorpark has a perfect record:  Every one of the 1,500 households in its area subscribes to the system. It only  serves the Mountain Meadows tract of homes, which were all pre-wired for cable.  </P> <P> Sammons Communications: The system in Glendale and Burbank, which was  originally built in 1962, underwent a major rebuilding in 1979. It is expanding  into a previously unwired, 1,000-home area of La Canada Flintridge.  </P> <P> The latest improvement to service, which reaches 60,000 subscribers out of a  potential 116,000, is the addition of stereo sound to the pay channels that  Sammons offers.  </P> <P> United Cable TV: Of all the cable systems in the survey, United certainly had  the most trouble getting off the ground. The company won the franchise to wire  the San Fernando Valley area east of the San Diego Freeway, including Van Nuys  and North Hollywood, in 1983 with a promise that the system would be completed  by Dec. 7, 1985. After several extentions and paying the city of Los Angeles  fines of more than $450,000 because of delays, the system was finally declared  complete on May 11, 1989. United still isn't out of the woods on the fines  front -- a decision is pending in the City Council over whether to levy an  additional $300,000 in fines, also because of the delays. United has 53,000  subscribers out of a possible 147,000.  </P> <P> Ventura County Cablevision: Ventura covers all of Camarillo, Fillmore, Santa  Paula and Ojai, and parts of Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. It also extends into  Agoura Hills and parts of Calabasas and Las Virgenes. It has 77,500 subscribers  out of a possible 95,000.  </P> <P> CABLE TV SYSTEMS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:3.76IN:2.66IN:1.89IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

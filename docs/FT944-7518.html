			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Plan offers no renaissance for Florence Sir, We read your article, 'David and the car Goliath' (October 31) on the new urban plan for Florence, with great interest. However, we take a different view on a number of points. First, the Franchini-Vittorini urban plan is not based on 'mixed development' principles. For instance, the 1.86m sq m Fondiaria area - very large by our standards and currently empty - will become an extended dormitory containing 2.2m cu m of new buildings. Originally, a large park was planned here, in a town in which open and green spaces are as precious as historical monuments. Second, the so-called Fiat-Novoli plan has been made possible by the demolition of the Fiat factory - again, this is at odds with the mixed development concept. Further, the Fiat-Novoli project offers no solution to the traffic and mobility problem, while it adds thousands of inhabitants - plus cars - to a heavily polluted area. A total of 6m cubic metres of new buildings, mostly apartments/houses, are planned in a town where the population is falling and where there are 18,000 empty flats. Florence is strangled by traffic, but the new plan offers no solution in terms of streets, public transportation, even underground car parking. And there is bad news for tourists - the Michelucci-designed railway station is to be demolished and replaced by the badly served Campo di Marte station on the periphery. Nobody coming into Florence by train will again have the cupola by Brunelleschi as their first view of the city. The plan will cause disruption for 10 to 15 years. Why? Because the Florence administration accepted in the plan the Italian Railways high-speed project. This will cost some Pounds 600m, merely to allow 10 per cent of train passengers to save 20 minutes on the Florence to Rome journey and 40 minutes between Milan and Florence. It is hard to believe that Florence will achieve a second renaissance as a result of Dr Franchini's project. Many intellectuals, environmentalists, political groups in the town council, and many citizens, oppose it. Eva Buiatti, 'Lavori in Corso' town council group, Florence, Italy</p>

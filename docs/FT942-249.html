			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / France raises minimum pay The French government yesterday announced that the SMIC minimum wage would be increased by 2.1 per cent, from FFr34.83 (Pounds 4.13) an hour to FFr35.56 (Pounds 4.19) from the beginning of July. The increase, in line with the legal formula for calculating the minimum wage, prompted an angry reaction from trade unions, which had been demanding an additional increase. The SMIC is at the centre of the debate about French labour market reform. An attempt by the government to change the system so that young apprentices could be paid less than the SMIC prompted nationwide protests in March and forced a humiliating climbdown by the government. The big CFDT union federation, which had demanded an increase of 2.7 per cent in the SMIC, said yesterday that 'once again, the lowest paid would not benefit from the same increase in purchasing power as the rest of French employees'. Under the new rate, the 1.48m employees who receive the SMIC will be paid FFr6,010 a month for 169 hours of work.</p>

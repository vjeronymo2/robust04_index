			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The road to fame - Clive Fewins meets two would-be British film makers IN A Cotswold village another revival of the British film industry is ready to take shape. Early next year, producer Genevieve Jolliffe and director Chris Jones, both less than four years out of film school, launch their first full-length feature film. White Angel, a psychological thriller, will be one of a handful of all-British features on general release in the past 12 months. Classed as low budget, it cost less than Pounds 1m to produce. The pair had to raise all the capital themselves, and they have had to wait four years before seeing any return. 'All the money has come through our own contacts - friends, friends of friends, and simply people who have faith in us and our ability to produce a good film that will make a lot of money,' said Jolliffe. 'Several hundred people have lent us sums ranging from Pounds 100 to Pounds 30,000. None if it came from a bank.' Although only 23, Jolliffe had 'lived films' since being captivated by Star Wars at the age of seven. Two years ago she gained an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for being the youngest British film producer, and the world's youngest female producer. After film school in Bournemouth she and partner Chris Jones made another psychological thriller, The Runner, with a group of friends. It was backed by a large film distribution company and made a lot of money. Jolliffe and Jones made nothing, but they had an excellent product to show the backers of White Angel. Nevertheless, it has been a hand-to-mouth existence for the past three years since forming Living Spirit Pictures and making White Angel. They have existed on grants from the government Enterprise Allowance Scheme and a gift of Pounds 5,000, plus much material support from The Prince's Youth Business Trust. In addition they have made a number of small but profitable promotional videos. In the last six months, however, the pair's day-to-day income has all but dried up. White Angel will not hit British screens until November 15, when it will get two screenings at the West End Odeon as part of the London Film festival. By then, hopefully, the couple's fortunes will have improved. By the end of this month the first payments from pre-sales of the film, arising from August's Montreal film festival, will arrive in the Living Spirit bank account. 'We know that by the end of the year we will have taken at least half a million pounds,' Jones said. 'We shall immediately pay out about half of that to our creditors but we shall still be poor for another 12 to 18 months because most of the remaining money will go straight in to our next project. 'This is under wraps at present but it is much bigger than White Angel. We have had serious offers of pre-sales valued at more than Pounds 2m from some very large distributors who are prepared to buy the rights before the film is made.' Jolliffe said: 'We told our investors they would get their money back and double it, and we are well on course. The plan is that they will get an additional one per cent of the total profits for each Pounds 10,000 they have invested. 'What we said all along is proving true. White Angel got rave reviews at the Montreal Film Festival at the end of August. It is so low budget it cannot fail to make money. 'But our movies are our existence. It is a long cycle to financial success in this business. It will be a long time before we are millionaires.' In the meantime the couple lives with difficulty. 'Our biggest outgoing has been the rent of the cottage - Pounds 450 a month,' said Jones, an ebullient 25-year-old. 'It is quite easy to drive to west London, to dubbing theatres, sound transfer bays, equipment hire companies, publicists, and all the other specialist services we need,' he added. 'Also, we have all the editing equipment we need here in the cottage. It cames as part of an Pounds 8,000 seedcorn grant from Cheshire County Council. 'Besides, more than half of White Angel was shot here, so we are very attached to the building, although we shall probably move and buy something for ourselves with some of the proceeds of the film.' The film is set entirely in suburban London, Jolliffe and Jones having deliberately written the screenplay to suit a location in the outer suburbs. They started shooting some of the scenes in a rented Ruislip house before their move to the Cotswolds. However, after they moved out, they were unable to return to shoot other scenes in the same interior. So they had to recreate that in the garage at their current cottage. 'When we filmed The Runner in and around the cottage we occupied near Nantwich we hired Terence Ford, the brother of Harrison Ford, to play the all-American action-man hero,' said Jones. 'When he arrived, direct from Hollywood, he found, to his enormous surprise, that all the crew as well as the actors, were staying in the same house. It was quite a shock as he was used to having an enormous camper van to himself. However, he stayed the course. 'It was much the same here.' White Angel will get a limited theatrical release in the new year, but in the meantime, through their agents, the couple have already made sales totalling Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 in the US alone. Rights have been sold in Korea and Venezuela and negotiations are going on with distributors in the UK, Germany and Spain. Jolliffe and Jones believe that, in spite of a mass of talent, the British film industry will not return to anything like the health of the 1950s and 1960s. 'The problem seems to be that the British see film-making as an art, not an industry. So in this country the professionals don't make great movies any more - they make terribly important films. We represent a new generation of film makers. Our aim is to revive the British film industry. No less.' White Angel, starring Peter Firth, Harriet Robinson and Don Henderson, producer Genevieve Jolliffe, director Chris Jones. Living Spirit Pictures is based at The Old Picture House, Througham, Bisley, Stroud, Glos GL6 7HG. Tel: 0285-821543.</p>

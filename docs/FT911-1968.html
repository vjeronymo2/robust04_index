			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (12): Flight plan of national carrier under review - Profile: Lot WARSAW'S new international airport, due for completion next year, could become the regional hub for one of the world's most dynamic markets in the 21st century. The new runway and expanded terminal facilities being built by Hochtief of Germany alongside the present crowded baggage and customs hall, should relieve the growing congestion of western European airports and provide a vital freight and passenger interchange in the geographical heart of Europe. This vision of the future is central to the privatisation plans of Lot, the Polish state-owned national carrier. Mr Bronislaw Klimaszewski, who returned to the company last year as general director after being sacked as commercial director following the imposition of martial law in 1981, has already begun preliminary talks with airlines such as Air France, Lufthansa and El Al. But before Lot has any realistic chance of becoming an attractive partner it has to dispose of its fleet of uneconomic Soviet-built aircraft, cut back on a payroll stuffed with retired military and security personnel and create a new ethos for what used to be, in effect, a semi-military organisation. There are only two potential buyers for Lot's seven long-range Ilyushin-62, 14 medium-range Tupolev 154 and seven Tu-134's - the Soviet Union itself and China. Negotiations are under way with both. But a sale to China requires agreement from Moscow, which would have to guarantee spare parts and other services to the new owner. Moscow, desperate to keep its aircraft factories busy, would preferto sell new aircraft directly to China. On the other hand Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, is itself in the throes of a major re-organisation. This should lead to the establishment of many smaller, regional and republic-based airlines which could be potential buyers of Lot's redundant fleet. Meanwhile, Lot, which has already leased three Boeing 767's from the US manufacturer, plans to lease two similar aircraft to replace its long-range Ilyushin-62s and is negotiating with Boeing, McDonnell and Airbus for eight medium-range aircraft to replace its 14 Tu-154s. A further eight Franco-Italian ATR-72 turboprop aircraft are on order to replace obsolete Antonov-24 aircraft and the ageing Tu 134s. In the face of union protests, 1,500 of Lot's 8,000 employees are being dismissed. Staffing should be further trimmed to around 5,000 once the fuel-thirsty and expensive-to-maintain Soviet jets are replaced by efficient western aircraft. But getting to the point where Lot will be an attractive proposition for foreign investors and potential partners will be hard and expensive. 'I think that the combination of Lot and the new Warsaw airport will be an attractive and interesting proposition within the next three to four years. But we'll need government finance and subsidies until then,' says Mr Klimaszewski who has called in the French bank, Credit Commerciale, to carry out an audit and evaluation. Until now, he adds, 'nobody had any idea of how to run the airline's finances. Everything was distorted by artificial exchange rates, arbitrary pricing and providing sheltered employment for retired submarine commanders and the like.' The first steps to privatisation are now under way as Lot is 'commercialised' by conversion from an amorphous state-owned company into a joint stock company with all shares held by the Polish treasury. This is the classic first stage in Polish-style privatisation of big companies. The rest depends on the speed with which Poland and its neighbours create the potential traffic which would make the revamped airline an attractive investment.</p>

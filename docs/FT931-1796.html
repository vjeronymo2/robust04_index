			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Parker Pen deal threatened THE US Department of Justice announced yesterday it would file an anti-trust suit to prevent Boston-based Gillette from purchasing Parker Pen on the grounds that such a sale would have an anti-competitive effect on the market for premium fountain pens, writes Lisa Bransten in Washington. The suit could block Gillette's attempt to become the world's largest seller of all types of pens. Gillette holds approximately 7 per cent of the world pen market, while its leading competitor, Societe BIC, holds about 8 per cent. With Parker, Gillette would control 15 per cent of the world market. The Justice Department contends that Gillette and Parker, together with one other company, control 80 per cent of the premium fountain pen market.</p>

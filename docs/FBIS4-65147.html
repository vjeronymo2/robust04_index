			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] London, 11 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  stated that he and British Prime Minister John Major discussed a  number of issues of common concern, notably the Middle East  issue, the situation in Yemen, peace in the Middle East, and  developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a statement to reporters  after his meeting with Major, he said he will be discussing  these issues in detail during his meeting with Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd tomorrow. At the beginning of the meeting, Musa  conveyed a verbal message from President Mubarak on developments  in the Middle East and the peace process and received Major's  reply.    Musa said that he and Major also discussed ways of  strengthening cooperation between Egypt and Britain in various  fields. He said he conveyed to Major Egypt's views on the  situation in Bosnia and expressed his hope that the liaison  committee on Bosnia will begin its work to end the Serb  aggression.

With regard to Yemen, he said Egypt has maintained  contacts with both parties there, and noted that President  Mubarak's envoy has visited Yemen several times and will return  to complete President Mubarak's endeavors to end the crisis. He  pointed out that Egypt will spare no efforts to resolve the  current crisis in Yemen, noting that no party wanted things to  reach this state of affairs. He emphasized that the events in  Yemen are not in the interest of either party and that things  should not have reached this point.    Discussing the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement, Musa said that  the implementation is the responsibility of both parties, adding  that Egypt is always ready to help. He noted that there are  still obstacles and voiced his hope that things between the  Palestinians and Israelis will go well.

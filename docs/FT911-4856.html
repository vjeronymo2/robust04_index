			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour tries to blunt points of Tory attack - Philip Stephens considers the strategy behind the opposition's latest policy document THERE are three battlegrounds on which the Conservatives hope to fight the next general election. They have not changed since 1983 and 1987. In spite of Mr Neil Kinnock's undoubted success in dragging Labour into the centre ground of British politics, Conservative research shows he is still vulnerable on three issues: the economy, defence and the trade unions. Labour's Opportunity Britain, the draft programme for government which will form the basis of its election manifesto, suggests that Labour privately shares the same judgment. The document, from a party which has sustained its recent momentum by being 'never knowingly underlaunched', builds on rather than displaces its two predecessors - Meet the Challenge and Looking to the Future. Mr Kinnock summed up the general theme in his opening remarks at yesterday's typically slick launch with the comment: 'The old ideologies - command economy at one extreme, crude free market economics at the other - do not work'. Put another way, Labour's alternative to Thatcherism is no longer socialism, but the centrist social democracy which - and the document reminds us of this repeatedly - works well in France or Italy, even Germany. For the thesis to be credible, Mr Kinnock has to show that Labour can turn the Tories' chosen battlegrounds into neutral territory. His hopes rest upon what it does not promise as much as on what it does. Beyond a general commitment to defend the realm, the document restricts comment on nuclear disarmament to a reference to the party's previous statements. However, Mr Kinnock and Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, have added an important gloss to reassure the electorate. The pledge to negotiate away Britain's independent deterrent did not, they stressed, mean a Labour government would give up nuclear weapons in exchange for a Soviet move to scale them down. Instead it would keep the option of retaining some nuclear capability as long as the Soviet Union and any other country held a nuclear arsenal. The lengthy section on the economy is similarly full of reassuring noises. There are two firm public spending pledges: to restore the real value of child benefit and to increase state pensions. Other commitments will have to wait their turn in the queue. 'There will be no irresponsible dash for growth under Labour'. The Conservatives undoubtedly will produce their own costings for plans to increase capital allowances for industrial investment, for a training 'revolution', for the commitment to transform educational opportunities, for new Technology Trusts and for a more responsive health service. Mr Kinnock's response is already there. Labour has learnt to balance its ambitions with prudence. 'We will not spend, nor will we promise to spend, more than Britain can afford'. Nationalisation is not a word in the new Labour vocabularly. Instead the party plans to take 'control' of the national electricity grid. The other privatised industries, including perhaps British Telecom, look safe in terms of ownership but would be subject to a tighter regulatory framework. The basic strategy is underpinned by a commitment to preserve sterling's place in the European exchange rate mechanism and an apparently casual acceptance of the inevitability of European economic and monetary union. London, the document says, is the natural home for a European central bank. There is no change in the proposals of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, to raise the top rate of tax to 50 per cent and to abolish the ceiling on national insurance payments. The calculation is that only a little over 10 per cent of those in work would suffer. There is a warning for wage bargainers. Labour's plan to integrate in the Budget its public spending and tax decisions following a national economic assessment is designed to deliver a simple message to trade unions - what they take in excessive pay rises cannot be paid out in higher spending on the health service or in help for the low paid. The language on industrial relations still bears the imprint of Labour's intractable ties with the unions. 'We fully support and advocate 100 per cent trade union membership at the workplace', it says. In contrast, the closed shop does not merit a mention and, as elsewhere, the emphasis is on 'best European prac-tice'. The Tories are convinced there is still plenty in the document to shoot at, but Mr Kinnock has further narrowed the angle of fire.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Arts: Pinnock's tidy Mozart - Prom THIS Prom season has played its cards cleverly: the popularity of period performances has come as a godsend to hard-pressed promoters. The fewer musicians there are on stage, the more it seems there will be in the audience. At the all-Mozart Prom on Wednesday a capacity audience greeted Trevor Pinnock and his modestly-sized English Concert. This orchestra is larger than the chamber-sized group that Ton Koopman has brought to London for Mozart, but Pinnock might still have considered more. First, because the hungry Royal Albert Hall acoustic devours small bands; and secondly because we know Mozart performed the 'Paris' Symphony with an orchestral complement of 56. Pinnock had 10 less, the shortfall being in the strings. The wind instruments had to struggle to make themselves heard but brass and timpani rang out proudly whenever they had a chance. Pinnock's recordings of the early symphonies had not suggested that he would make such a flamboyant job of No 31, the 'Paris'. In the increasingly crowded world of period-instrument conductors Pinnock is known particularly for light, airy textures, grace, neatness. The English Concert's opening to the 'Prague' Symphony was scrupulously tidy, but not much more. Then the main Allegro began, at such a speed that the adrenalin level could only rise; the finale rocketed along. Pinnock included all the repeats and finished sooner than conductors in my youth used to without them. In between came choral Mozart with the Choir of the English Concert, which offered neatly clipped diction in the best Pinnock style. Barbara Bonney was the shining soprano soloist and Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Jamie MacDougall and Stephen Gadd completed the quartet in the 'Coronation' Mass, a performance which had spirit but fell short of the joyous punch that this music can pack. By chance I caught the encore (the Overture to Figaro) on the car radio, where the orchestral playing sounded more dramatic by far. As so often happens in early music Proms, the Radio 3 audience had the best of it.</p>

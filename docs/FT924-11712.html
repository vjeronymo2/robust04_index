			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Down-to-earth Tory voices: Backbenchers in the news - 1922 Committee If an extra-terrestrial were to land on your lawn this weekend and say, as ETs always do, 'Take me to your leader,' you would not, I am sure, make the mistake of directing it to Number 10 Downing Street. FT readers are too astute for that. Any one of them would point the way to Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers. This would pay off. A visitor from another world would feel instantly at home in the '22, especially one accustomed to time-travel. Is Dame Jill Knight of this decade? Is the bewhiskered Sir Rhodes Boyson of this century? The committee's origins, too, are disputed. The conventional account is that disgruntled Tory aliens met at the Carlton Club 70 years ago, to hear Stanley Baldwin rally them in opposition to the coalition led by Lloyd George. The latter was quickly disposed of. Another view, rehearsed in a letter to the Daily Telegraph yesterday, is that the 111 new Tory MPs elected in November 1922 came together in April 1923 to overcome their handicap of parliamentary inexperience. What is clear today is that the committee now exercises more power over the government than the prime minister can have bargained for when he won the election with what at the time seemed like a good working majority of 21. It was Sir Marcus who, with a word, intimated that Mr David Mellor had to go; Sir Marcus who, with a phrase, intimated that after Black Wednesday the government had better pull its socks up; and Sir Marcus who pronounced (backed up by his some of his fellow committee-members) that the original plan to close 31 coal-mines was 'unacceptable'. Only 11 backbenchers need to vote against a government motion to defeat it. When the Tories are in opposition every one of their MPs belongs to the committee. When, as is usually the case, the Tories form the administration, the 1922 is made up of the party's backbenchers. They elect an executive of 18. In May cunning manoeuvres by the Conservative right placed many of their own on this executive. These range from Sir George Gardiner, the veteran Thatcherite and leader of the 92 group of right-wing MPs, and Sir Peter Hordern, a long-standing monetarist, to the more populist Sir Rhodes and Dame Jill. Many of the 61 first-time Tory MPs among the Conservatives are natural Thatcherites; they regard the '22 as one weapon in their war of attrition against ministers who, as they see it, are betraying the former prime minister. The over-representation of the right on the executive derives in part from its feeling of being under-represented in the cabinet. In the current febrile atmosphere of Conservative politics this can be taken to great lengths. Backbenchers opposed to the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty turned up in force at Thursday night's meeting, outnumbering middle-of-the-roaders who rarely attend. The result was reports yesterday suggesting that Sir Marcus and his troops wanted to postpone further consideration of the bill. Talk of delay suggests no real wish to unseat the party leader. Loyalty is still a powerful element in Tory thinking. What has also changed is the way in which the 1922 executive reflects opinion. Sir Marcus was elected in May on the platform of raising the committee's profile and speaking out on behalf of ordinary MPs. Sir Cranley Onslow, the chairman since 1984, found that his taciturnity and loyalty to the leadership were not popular enough. The chairman traditionally has direct access to both the prime minister and the chief whip, to whom he regularly reports on the mood of the troops. Sir Marcus's open and televisual approach has created tensions within the executive. The arrival of sound-bite politics in the traditionally discreet area of internal party management has not gone down well in all quarters. Some of the 1922's more traditional members complain their chairman has taken to leading backbench opinion instead of reflecting it. One said that it was not necessarily only the government which got out of touch during the long summer recess. The average age of the executive is just over 60, higher than that of the government. Twelve are knights, and one is a dame. None of the 18 has been in the cabinet, though half of them have formerly been ministers, and four have been whips. Others have worked their way up through the Byzantine structure of parliamentary committees. Many of them have experienced life in opposition. They recall vividly the devices to which a party with a small majority can be driven. Sir Marcus and his two vice-chairmen have between them 70 years in the Commons. It has been time spent chatting to colleagues rather than sweeping into Westminster in a ministerial car. But not even Sir Marcus is unassailable. Four years away from the next election, the committee's ability to warn the government publicly that policies need changing is working well enough in terms of keeping the party together if not in contributing to Mr Major's cheerfulness. By 1996-97, it will have to show that it knows how to be publicly loyal as well, perhaps even to unpopular policies which are too late to alter. To fulfil that role the junta that took power in May will have to come down to earth.</p>

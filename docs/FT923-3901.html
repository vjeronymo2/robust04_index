			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Austria told to cut car plant grants: Chrysler in subsidies dispute THE European Commission has given Austria three weeks to cut state subsidies to a Chrysler plant near Graz or face duties of 10 per cent on minivan imports into the EC. Commissioners will call for the imposition of duties after September 30 if they are still unhappy with the Austrian stance. A final decision would be taken by EC member states. The issue is highly sensitive for Austria, but Commission officials say it is in the government's own interests to co-operate. 'Since they have applied to join the EC they must accept that sooner or later they will have to fall in line with Community rules,' said a Brussels trade official yesterday. Vienna has offered to cut subsidies from 33 per cent to less than 20 per cent of the Sch4.2bn (Pounds 213m) cost of the factory. But the Commission would like the level of state aid brought down to 8 per cent, in line with rules on state aid applied to the wealthiest EC countries. That would involve the US car-maker reimbursing some of the Sch693m of subsidies which have already been paid. Austrian trade officials said yesterday such a solution would be unacceptable. They pointed out, however, that, if subsidies for the final phases of the factory were blocked, the overall level of state aid for the project would fall to about 16 per cent. Austrian experts will start talks with the Commission today. The Graz factory is a joint venture between Chrysler and Steyr Puch, which will manufacture 13,000 Voyager family vans this year. Most will be exported to the EC to compete with the Espace van made by Renault and Matra. The 1972 free trade agreement between Austria and the EC outlaws subsidies which distort competition in the Community. This would be the first and probably the last time that duties would be imposed under the agreement. It will be replaced at the end of the year by the European Economic Area (EEA) - a free-trade zone between the EC and the European Free Trade Association. The EEA agreement includes similar safeguard clauses, but Austrian and EC officials said yesterday it was unclear whether the existing duties would have to be renegotiated at the end of the year. The level of duty suggested is the same as that imposed on Voyager vans imported direct from the US.</p>

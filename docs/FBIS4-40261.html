			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "President B. Yeltsin Makes </F> an Inspection Tour of the Country"]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk -- On 14 June President B. Yeltsin  once again set out on a tour of the country. This time he has  come to the city of Blagoveshchensk, situated at the confluence  of the Zeya and Amur Rivers, where Russian soil ends.    Economic matters constitute the chief reason why Yeltsin has  made the many-hour flight from Moscow. More accurately, he  intends to familiarize himself on the spot with the painful  problems which get on the nerves of the population of Amur Kray,  while adopted government decisions are still not being  implemented. In other words, Yeltsin, freed from the grueling  confrontation with the representative power in the form of the  soviets, is returning once again to the practice of inspection  tours and live contact with people.    The priority issues which the local leaders intend to  discuss  with the president include border trade, the creation of a free  economic zone, and the kray's electricity supply. Each of these  has had noticeable repercussions on a Russia-wide scale.  Therefore, before the president left Moscow, Blagoveshchensk was  visited by Vice Premier A. Shokhin; Yu. Shafranik, leader of the  Ministry of Fuel and Energy; and representatives of the Ministry  of Finance and other departments. To all appearances, the  president does not intend to get away with promises to  investigate everything but to adopt some decisions on the spot.    According to A. Korabelshchikov, his aide, Yeltsin is  interested in the reaction of the regions' leaders to his recent  economic edicts, particularly as another block of documents is  being prepared in this field. He intends to speak about the  progress of the economic reform at the final conference in  Blagoveshchensk. In addition, Amur Oblast is one of the few  producers of soybeans in the country. The oblast's people  produce this crop with difficulty, but things are extremely bad  with regard to reorganizing the matter. Therefore, local  agrarian specialists have invited the president to a collective  farm, that is to say, to the "Partizan" Limited Partnership.    After familiarizing himself with the problems of Amur  Oblast,  it is in Yeltsin's plans to fly to the Tuva Republic. Although  this invitation is linked with a jubilee, the 50th anniversary  of the former Tuva's joining Russia, the president will not  merely attend a demonstration concert by local dancers who wish  to show their art on a mountain pasture to the accompaniment of  the guttural sounds of national instruments. Problems of  developing national culture and museum work and the position of  the intelligentsia will be discussed with the republic's  leadership.    In parallel, just as in Amur Oblast, the president plans to  investigate why a whole number of programs approved in Moscow  with assurances of financial support -- particularly those aimed  at developing the road network in the republic, creating an air  bridge between Kyzyl and Moscow, and also constructing a plant  for the processing of hides -- have come to a standstill or have  not been started up at all. It was explained to IZVESTIYA's  correspondent in the presidential apparatus, however, that the  president will not take an aircraft full of money to Kyzyl, as  was formerly the case at Barnaul. There will be a discussion of  executive discipline -- which seems sensible.</p>

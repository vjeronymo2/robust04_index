			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150 program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to the following determinations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted by the Federal Government; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in FAR Part 150, section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal, state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Minneapolis-Airports District Office in Minneapolis, Minnesota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Metropolitan Airports Commission submitted to the FAA on Marcy 30, 1992 the noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from November 1, 1990 through March 16, 1992. The Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on December 10, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion through the year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on December 10, 1993, and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180 day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submitted program contained twenty two (22) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and/or off the Airport. The FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outright approval was granted for thirteen (13) of the specific program elements, six (6) elements were approved on a voluntary basis only, and the remaining three (3) were disapproved. The three disapproved elements consisted of an extension of Runway 4/22, which was disapproved for purposes of the Part 150; a Standard instrument Procedure (SID), which was disapproved due to safety and efficiency concerns; and a freeze on Stage 2 operations during the nighttime hours, which was disapproved since the required Part 161 process had not been successfully completed. Additional information is provided in the Noise Compatibility Plan and in the Record of Approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator on June 8, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above, the Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Room 617, Washington, DC and at the administrative offices of the Metropolitan Airports Commission located at 6040 28th Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions on this FAA determination may be directed to the individual named above under the heading  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Issued in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=2 --> Robert A.

Talks between Algirdas Brazauskas, president of  Lithuania, and Ion Iliescu, president of Romania, began at 1400.  The closed meeting of the two presidents lasted half an hour.  Following this a meeting of the state delegations headed by the  heads of the states was held.

He stressed that their  two countries have many similarities -- both Lithuania and  Romania are currently solving problems of economic reform and  privatization. Algirdas Brazauskas also mentioned that there  were very many similar trends in the foreign policy of both  states. For example both states give priority to good relations  with neighboring states.    Prospects for integration by both the states into the  European Union, and the implementation of the NATO Partnership  for Peace program were discussed by the presidents.    Nerijus Maliukevicius, the president's spokesman for the  press, told ELTA that Algirdas Brazauskas acquainted the  Romanian president and the delegation with the social and  economic situation in Lithuania.

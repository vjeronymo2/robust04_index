			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Utro" program presented by Sergey Lomakin] </F>   [Text] The Public Opinion Fund is continuing to work with  us and continued its efforts over the New Year period, as  strange as that may seem. It questioned citizens in the streets  and at home, and as usual asked them the most extraordinary  questions. This time the Fund was concerned with the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon, as most of us are, too. The following  question was asked: Which of the following characteristics,  listed below, would you say most suits Vladimir Zhirinovskiy?    Defender of ordinary people--10 percent    Supporter of B. Yeltsin--1 percent    Cunning and adroit fraud, striving for power by any  means--28 percent    A democrat--2 percent    Opponent of B. Yeltsin--9 percent    Honest and sincere person, evoking absolute trust--6  percent    A fascist--13 percent    Adversary of democracy--4 percent    Could not respond--27 percent    So, drawing on its conclusions, the Public Opinion Fund is  convinced that Zhirinovskiy was undoubtedly the man of the month  this past December, a new type of politician who became familiar  to Russians directly from the television screen. He beat a path  into the hearts of voters by sneaking into the intimate circle  of a family dinner, entering every house directly, and offering  simple solutions to those who had lost their former bearings in  life.    And so, at least one-sixth of those asked have absolute  trust  in Zhirinovskiy and look to him as a defender of the people.  Only more than 40 percent do not perceive him as an amoral and  socially dangerous politician. [sentence as heard]. Apparently  up to one- third of our questionnaire participants have not  fully taken a stand on the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon.    The two-week serving of television-concentrated demagoguery  was all Zhirinovskiy needed to satisfy more than 10 million  hopelessly confused and despairing Russians. It is as if the  naive and trusting Petrukha -- whom you may remember from the  film "White Sun of the Desert" -- looks up at the figure looming  over us and says in a questioning and idiotically direct way:  Vladimir Volfovich, reveal your little face.    This was the opinion of the Public Opinion Fund, which, by  the way, fully respects the choice of the Russian people, as  does our "Utro" program, who voted for Zhirinovskiy and other  representatives of electoral blocs. This is something sacred.</p>

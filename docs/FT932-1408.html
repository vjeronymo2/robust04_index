			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Cabinet approves care bill THE German cabinet yesterday approved a bill to extend health insurance to the 1.1m elderly and chronically sick who need residential care and who are not covered by the social welfare system. The bill, which will go to parliament at the end of July, has encountered fierce criticism from business and the trade unions. The statutory scheme would be financed through increased national insurance contributions from workers and employers. The financial burden on industry is to be offset by making the first two days of sick leave unpaid. Up to six unpaid days a year would be allowed. The main business lobbies, including the German industry federation and the employers' federation, have attacked the plan as an unwelcome burden in the depths of a recession. Unions are also infuriated by the move on sick pay and have warned they will protest against it.</p>

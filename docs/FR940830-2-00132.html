The 25 largest merchant acquirers presented in last year's edition of the Card Industry Directory accounted for 48.75% of the Visa/MasterCard volume going through merchants; this year's roster held the merchant contracts that accounted for 64% of 1992's billings. Concentration was especially pronounced at the top end of the market, with the 10 largest merchant acquirers representing $148.6 billion in bank card billings_49% of 1992's market, up from 33.7% in 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of merchant locations served by the leading acquirers did not change appreciably between January 1, 1992, and January 1, 1993. The aggregate total of 1.6 million was only a 3 percent improvement, or 47,248 locations. But as the bank card industry expands the utility of Visa and MasterCard cards to include health care providers, grocers, movie theaters, and restaurants, the composite profile of the bank card merchant is changing. Still, the average value of credit card transactions in 1992 was virtually unchanged from 1991 at $65.48, the industry's leading merchant acquirers report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most remarkable growth on an individual-acquirer basis occurred at National Bancard Corp., which jumped into the No. 1 position on the strength of 36% dollar-volume growth. Most of NaBANCO's $10.5 billion dollar gain was the result of the acquisition of CFC Financial Services' merchant portfolio. Other big gainers in 1992 were NationsBank, which moved from eighth to fifth on the list; First USA Merchant Services, breaking into the top 10 for the first time as the sixth largest acquirer; and First Premier Bank, the former First Interstate of South Dakota. First Premier entered the merchant acquiring business in 1989 and vaulted from the No. 13 position in 1991 to become the tenth largest acquirer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two banks are new to the top 25 this year: National Bank of Detroit and Mercantile Bank. Dropping out of the industry's upper echelon are CFC Financial and MBNA America. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information in this chapter was compiled through direct contact with executives at the acquiring organizations. In situations where the information was unavailable, estimates were made on the basis of consultation with industry experts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> [Pages irreproducible.

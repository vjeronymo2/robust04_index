			<p>BFN     [Text] France is not ready to grant a Cambodian government  request for arms to fight the Khmer Rouge. Deputy Foreign  Minister Surin Phitsuwan said yesterday after a recent meeting  with the French foreign affairs permanent secretary.    Surin added that Australia, which had also been approached  by  the Cambodian government, had made no decision on the matter and  the United States was only interested in supporting military  training in Cambodia.    Surin, who returned from an overseas tour, stopped over in  France after he attended a meeting of ambassadors and  counsellors in Morocco. He arrived in Bangkok from Kuala Lumpur  yesterday.    Apart from narcotics suppression and the Cambodian conflict,  Surin said the talks with French officials included discussion  on SEA 10, a Southeast Asian grouping which includes the six in  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the three  Indochinese nations and Burma.</p>

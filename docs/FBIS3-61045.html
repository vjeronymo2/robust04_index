			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, deputy director, Russian </F> Academy of Sciences IYe, member, Presidential Council: "The  Russian Concept of Security in the Year 2005"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prediction </H5>   People familiar with strategic planning know that  predictions  may be made a year, a year and a half, or two or three years  into the future. Beyond that, science ends and art begins. At  this moment intuition and imagination should begin to play a  greater role than a knowledge of facts and trends, and the  ability to analyze them.    This almost axiomatic premise would seem to be more  applicable to Russia than anywhere else, because in Russia,  everything is moving, collapsing, growing, and serious political  scientists are extremely reluctant to make predictions even a  month into the future. However, it is in the present that we can  predict the policies of Russia relatively far into the future  with much greater confidence than has ever been possible in the  last several decades. Fifteen or so years ago this would have  been impossible because it was obvious that the system was  rolling downhill, and things were about to explode. But as for  how many explosions there would be, and what would follow them,  this was unclear. Three and even two years ago the old system  was undergoing decomposition and disintegration, but it was  still hanging on, and no one was sure when development would  begin.    Many things have become clearer this year, 1993. A  superimposition of a large number of phenomena and  events--dramatic expansion of the property-owning class, of the  stratum of people working in the private sector (they now  represent over a third of the employed), growth of the "gray,"  unregulated and unaccountable economy, which was nonetheless  feeding millions, and B. Yeltsin's victory in the spring  referendum--transformed quantity into quality. There appeared in  the politically and economically active and competitive part of  the population a certainty, a latent feeling that Russia "will  break out," and become a mighty country of prosperous and free  people. Russia crossed over the mountains dividing its  totalitarian past from a normal future. The descent into the  valley of normalcy is perilous. A misstep could still mean  disaster. But it's even harder to go back.    New elites whose interests are predictable and are already  rather clearly discernible began forming quickly. These were the  new bourgeoisie, moving from trade, essentially military, to  production. These were the directors of state enterprises  undergoing privatization, who were becoming capitalists. These  were the political elites, coming together with the first two  and quickly gaining strength. And finally, these were the  military, whose influence was visibly growing in a time of  weakness of state power and political instability at the borders.    The main vector of the interests of these elites is already  clear--moderate state nationalism, economic reintegration of a  significant part of the former USSR while avoiding brutal and  costly actions of political reintegration, and a desire for  cooperation, especially economic, with the outside world. In  this case the failed hopes of aid from the West are visibly  intensifying neo-isolationist sentiments and self-reliance. A  course of rapprochement with Europe, with the West, remains a  priority, but internal and external limits imposed upon this  rapprochement, as well as the economic ties of regions of  southern Russia, Siberia and the Far East are partially  reorienting interests in the direction of Asia and the Far East.  The need for settling conflicts and preventing their spread is  generating a habit of relying on military force--albeit at lower  levels. The main interests are now focused on internal survival,  on keeping instability at Russia's borders from encroaching. But  despite the fact that such a focus makes Russia not even a  continental but just a regional power in terms of its present  interests, the elite does not perceive Russia to be as such, and  it is certain that it will once again become a mighty  continental power. At the same time hardly anyone is ready for  serious sacrifices in behalf of greatness, and all the more so  on behalf of Russia's return to the status of a global  superpower, which had been imposed on it by the vagaries of  history--the postwar vacuum in Europe, superimposed over  possession of nuclear weapons and residual communist messianism.    This is the group of interests that will determine Russian  policy over the course of the next decade. The country will go  through a time of crisis, which will last another year or two.  Then stabilization will begin, and then an ascent. After 5-6  years, if political disintegration, which is extremely  improbable, or a catastrophic social explosion does not occur,  an economic boom will begin in Russia.    By 2005 Russia will more likely be a dominant economic  center  and a leading political force in a fraternity of states  consisting of Belarus, Ukraine (or the states that form on its  territory if it falls apart as a result of the economic disaster  that has begun there), Kazakhstan, and possibly Uzbekistan and  Kyrgyzia. The fate of the Transcaucasian countries is unclear.  Most likely if they are able to quench the flames of open  conflicts in the foreseeable future, they will have extremely  close political and economic relations with Russia as well.    But this time Russia will be pursuing a relatively equal  policy in all directions. However, cultural and spiritual  traditions, the ongoing instability in Asia, and mighty, and  possibly already unstable China will prod it toward alliances  with the West.    The strategy of the national security of the newly ascending  capitalist Russia of the year 2005 will depend to a certain  degree on what happens in the 12 years separating us from that  moment. If in this time Russia becomes a part of a  military-political association or strategic alliance extending  from Vancouver to Tokyo, if it comes closer to Europe  politically, if it comes closer to or even enters the European  free trade zone forming around the expanding European Community,  and if it is able to achieve real membership in the European  market, and become an object of massive capital investments,  Russia's strategy will be European, oriented on maintaining the  status quo of world development. Imperial impulses, unavoidable  for such a mighty country that is additionally undergoing an era  of early capitalism, will be easily contained by the advantages  of membership in a Euro-Atlantic-Pacific strategic association.    Moscow will be forced to pursue another strategy, even in  terms of Russia's security. But it is becoming a normal country,  and it will be forced to pursue a normal policy. And this means  that it will strive to change, which is inconsistent with its  national interests.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEARS DIDN'T HURT MERMAN'S APPETITE  </P> <P> Martin Gottfried's lovely 30th anniversary tribute to "Gypsy," (July 2) struck  a particularly nostalgic chord in me.  </P> <P> At the time of the New York production, I was working for columnist Earl  Wilson, whose office was upstairs from the Broadway Theater. Every Wednesday at  3, the air would be split by that wonderful brassy fanfare of the overture.  </P> <P> While interviewing and becoming friends with cast members, I had the pleasure  of watching the show backstage. My favorite memory is of Ethel Merman coming  offstage at the end, wiping away the tears from "Rose's Turn" as she cheerily  belted: "OK, where you guys wanna go for dinner between shows?"  </P> <P> DONALD LAZERE  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

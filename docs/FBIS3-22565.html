			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aureliano Biancarelli: "AIDS Increasing Among </F> Women Around the World"]    [Text] The rise in AIDS cases among women all over the  world is worrying the WHO. The organization estimates that there  are about 3 million infected women in the world.    The rise in AIDS among women means more infected children by  vertical transmission. The virus is transmitted from mother to  child during pregnancy, at birth, or during breast-feeding.    In Sao Paulo -- the state which best illustrates the  development of the disease in our country -- the ratio was 43  infected men for every infected woman in 1985. Today the ratio  is four to one.    That ratio -- equivalent to 25 percent -- is much higher  than  in the United States (where 12 percent of cases are women) and  Canada (5 percent). Some African countries are way out in front,  with women constituting more than 50 percent of the cases.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |AIDS in Brazil: Reported Cases by Mode of Transmission                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transmission             |Men                      |Women                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Homosexual               |12,094                   |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bisexual                 |6,284                    |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Heterosexual             |4,919                    |2,923                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug use                 |7,910                    |1,815                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hemophilia               |663                      |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transfusion              |1,100                    |702                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vertical transmission    |440                      |418                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Unknown                  |4,044                    |652                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |37,454                   |6,510                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Note: Of the total 43,964 reported cases, 18,128 have already died.          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Ministry of Health bulletin, November 1993.                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      AIDS Cases in Sao Paulo (62.8 percent of national total)      Cases reported in state      Mode of Transmission (both sexes)   Description      Number      Mode of           Number                               transmission   Total cases      27,637      Homosexual        7,391   Men              23,221      Bisexual          3,106   Women            4,416       Heterosexual      3,939   Already died     18,089      Intravenous       8,731  (both sexes)                 drugs                                Hemophiliacs      246                                Blood             618                               transfusion                                Vertical          677                               transmission                                Unknown           2,929   Source: State Secretariat of Health Epidemiological  Bulletin, November 1993      In Brazil, the increase in the disease among women is linked  especially to intravenous drug use and unprotected sex.  According to experts at the Ministry of Health, it is the man  who becomes infected through drugs or by homosexual relations  without the use of condoms and who then passes the disease on to  his wife or girlfriend.    According to data from the Sao Paulo Secretariat of Health,  48.85 percent of the women were infected through heterosexual  relations. Another 29.8 percent caught the virus through  intravenous drug use. According to the Ministry of Health, our  country currently has 43,964 reported AIDS cases. The figure may  be at least 20 percent higher. Of the official total, 18,128  have already died.    The number of infected individuals -- those who have not yet  manifested the disease -- ranges from 500,000 to 700,000,  depending on one's source. Sao Paulo State has 62.8 percent of  the cases. It needs to be remembered that Sao Paulo has less  underreporting and is faster at recording reported cases. Rio de  Janeiro State is in second place with 6,208 cases.</p>

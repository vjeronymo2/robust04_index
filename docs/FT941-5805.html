			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Drugs and seeds help Zeneca grow 42% A solid performance from drugs, seeds and speciality chemicals helped bioscience group Zeneca post a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1993, at Pounds 627m before exceptional items. The company's first set of figures since the demerger last summer from ICI was boosted by currency gains as well as volume growth. Pre-tax profit after exceptionals was Pounds 642m, in the middle of analysts' expectations. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, described the year as 'successful . . . despite less than ideal trading conditions'. Trading profit rose to Pounds 713m, a 21 per cent increase. Some 14 percentage points of this increase came from volume growth, 1 percentage point from increased prices and the balance from currency fluctuations. Strong cash flow of Pounds 833m, a Pounds 151m increase over 1992, helped cut year-end net debt sharply from Pounds 391m to Pounds 188m. Gearing fell from 11.7 to 25.7 per cent. Earnings per share after exceptional items were 51.7p (10.8p) and the dividend was confirmed at 27.5p. The company issued a trading statement on January 21, so there were few surprises yesterday and Zeneca shares fell 3p to 763p. Underlying sales growth in the biggest division, pharmaceuticals, was 5 per cent, rising to Pounds 1.87bn. The top-selling drug, heart treatment Tenormin, saw sales in constant currency terms fall 22 per cent to Pounds 464m in the face of generic competition. Mr John Mayo, finance director, said that the rate of Tenormin's decline was slower than with comparable drugs that had lost patent protection. However, growth from other products more than made up for the decline in Tenormin revenues. Sales of the company's second biggest product, Zestril, another heart treatment, rose to Pounds 416m from Pounds 294m. By region, The US continued to be easily Zeneca's biggest drugs market with sales of Pounds 782m (Pounds 661m), but sales in Japan grew more than twice as fast, from Pounds 190m in 1992 to Pounds 261m last year. France moved into third place ahead of the UK. In agrochemicals, trading profit rose just 1 per cent to Pounds 86m on sales of Pounds 1.47bn. The specialities division saw doubled trading profits of Pounds 50m on sales of Pounds 1.03bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

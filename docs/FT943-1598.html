			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (5): Bugs Bunny and the IRA - Complex factors refresh the retail sector An unlikely alliance between a lunatic rabbit, several designer labels, Northern Ireland's peacemakers and a gang of roadworkers is dragging Britain's largest shopping centre out of deep gloom. In the furore about the impact of out-of-town shopping on city centres, problems faced by London's West End have been pushed to the sidelines. That, perhaps, is just as well, as the crisis is now fading. Rents have bounced back to near-boom levels and empty spaces filled as retailers no longer scramble to escape crippling overheads. The problems - as in much of the property market - arose from the Age of Excess. Retailers measure occupation costs according to the front 30ft of their premises. Rents during the 1980s for this 'zone A' space soared to Pounds 350 a sq ft in Oxford Street and Pounds 175 in Regent Street. Then came the crash and a flurry of liquidations. Landlords were forced to repossess and try reletting at market levels, says Chris Austin of Hillier Parker. By 1992, rents were down to Pounds 250 and Pounds 150 respectively. Knightsbridge saw an even more spectacular boom and crash, with Sloane Street racing from Pounds 55 in 1981 to a Pounds 400 by 1989 as it assumed the mantle of a fashion centre. 'This was never sustainable,' says John Buckingham of Jones Lang Wootton. Values almost halved in the slump, although Brompton Road is probably still the most expensive West End location. Then the strange alliance raced to the rescue. Bugs Bunny is setting up shop in the new Warner Bros store on Regent Street, part of a stream of flagship lettings to speciality retailers. One site is being let for more than Pounds 175 - breaking the 1989 rent record, says Mr Austin. This is partly due to a recovering economy but also because of aggressive management by the Crown Estate, which owns the street. Several million pounds have gone into improving the pavements and lighting. A careful policy of tenant selection has also begun to dispel the boredom of 'dead' frontages from airline and similar premises. Only a handful of units remain empty and the transformation has impacted on investment. Hamleys is understood to have sold its lease for around Pounds 18.5m to a Dutch fund, showing a yield of less than 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, Gucci has helped turn Bond Street back into an international attraction after moving to new premises, says Mr Buckingham. Versace confirmed the revival by taking the old Midland Bank premises and Fahey has slotted between Asprey and Hermes, paying Meteor Properties around Pounds 600,000 a year for the former Air France space. Donna Karen New York is the latest fashion name to move in, taking the old Gucci store, now transformed by the new Japanese owner. Development is also happening, despite the fact that rents are static at around Pounds 200 a sq ft. CIS is renovating its section of the street after years of inaction and London &amp; Regional has paid Pounds 8.75m for possible redevelopment of the former Refuge Assurance holding. Scottish Widows also has a scheme for the Oxford Street end, all of which will enliven an image blighted by empty windows. Another long-awaited transformation is happening in Oxford Street, where Westminster Council road gangs are widening pavements and generally giving one of the world's most famous shopping streets an appearance it deserves. If the Ulster ceasefire holds, this could coincide with a revival in trade from tourists put off by bomb fears. Rent growth normally lags a year or two behind tourism figures, but this time any increase would be icing on a cake already baked by rising domestic demand. Tesco has seen its new Metro store turn into a roaring success and probably wishes it could have also taken the neighbouring unit. This is said to be the only vacant prime pitch west of Oxford Circus but is already reserved. The likely rent of more than Pounds 270 a sq ft shows how Oxford Street shopping has climbed back off the floor. There are still businesses who would like to escape rent levels set at the peak of the boom but they, too, face some relief. Next April new business rates come into force, and bills could drop 15 per cent in Oxford Street and as much as 40 per cent in Sloane Street. Investors are also betting on growth. Despite Burford's highly conservative spending strategy, it beat off several other potential buyers by paying Pounds 94m for the Trocadero on Piccadilly Circus, perhaps the most popular tourist shopping and entertainment pitch in London. With long-term finance now in place, chairman Nigel Wray might be forgiven for sitting back and enjoying the 9 per cent return. But he has bold plans to increase the current estimate of 14m visitors a year, with bold plans for the 120,000 sq ft of remaining space. The impact should ripple out to boost values in the surrounding shopping.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, June 22 (AFP) -- The United Nations has  installed radar stations in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to  pinpoint assailants, the Danish defence minister said Wednesday  [22 June].    Hans Haekkerup said in a written reply to parliament's  Defence Committee that "these radars were set up in Tuzla,  Sarajevo, Bihac and Mostar, after Tuzla airport was shelled on  May 17."    At the time, Denmark had complained that the UN Protection  Force [UNPROFOR] had not responded to requests for air support  by the Danish contingent, which was being attacked, had made.    The radars, which have a 30 kilometre (19 mile) range with  20  metre (66 foot) accuracy, can pinpoint the location of guns and  canon and thereby enable the United Nations to riposte.</p>

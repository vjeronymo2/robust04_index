			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Cost of rail strike put at Pounds 330m for July The signalling strike could cost the British economy about Pounds 330m this month, according to an estimate by a leading accountancy firm. Mr Maurice Fitzpatrick of the accountants Chantrey Vellacott bases his calculations on British Rail's estimate that each day's strike results in lost revenue of Pounds 10m. In total, there are 125,000 rail workers and Mr Fitzpatrick assumes that a further 375,000 people are unable to work because of the strike. Assuming that the output of each commuter is worth about 1.5 times that of a railway worker, Mr Fitzpatrick calculates that each day-long strike will cost the economy about Pounds 55m in lost output. This week's three-day stoppage will result in a loss of Pounds 165m. A figure of Pounds 330m still represents only about two-thirds of 1 per cent of July's total gross domestic product. If the rail strike were to end this month therefore the affect on the full-year GDP would be negligible. But Mr Fitzpatrick calculates that if the strike continues to worsen into September, with stoppages affecting eight days a month, it could reduce full-year GDP by about 0.2 per cent. The Institute of Directors estimates that the strike has already cost industry 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. Its employment spokesman Mr Ira Chalpin said yesterday that the dispute was 'damaging the reputation of this country as a reliable place to do business'. However, Mr Andrew Sentance of the London Business School cast doubt on the Pounds 330m estimate. 'Business can find other ways of doing things and even if those ways are more costly, the extra costs for one company constitute revenues for another group,' he said. For high street banks with a network of London branches and many staff commuting into the capital from the Home Counties, this week's extended rail strike means a greater use of coaches. Lloyds Bank has been using about 80 coaches to bring up to 4,000 staff into London at a cost of Pounds 50,000 a day. Camp beds have been set up in the bank's Lombard Street headquarters for a few essential staff. Midland Bank has been hiring more than 50 coaches, at a cost of about Pounds 10,000 a day, to bring 500-600 employees to their offices and branches. National Westminster Bank's bussing operation has been smaller. But many other large employers such as Imperial Chemical Industries and companies in the engineering industry reported yesterday that the strikes would have little impact on their operations. It is estimated that only 7 per cent of bulk materials are carried by rail. The likely impact of the dispute is to encourage more companies to switch their freight business from rail to road. The impact of this week's stoppages on commuters may also be less serious because many are going on holiday and this will reduce the need to travel by rail over the coming weeks.</p>

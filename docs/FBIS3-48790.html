Japan will maintain an  outline of bilateral support, such as the $1.8 billion in aid  that Japan promised to Russia in April. However, as for  emergency and humanitarian aid, including food and medical  supplies, the Foreign Ministry will carefully select Russian  Government agencies eligible for such aid and study whether aid  is needed at all.    This was disclosed by a senior Foreign Ministry official on  the morning of 21 January. As for the plan to review economic  aid to Russia, the same official pointed out that "we have no  choice but to scale down the monetary and financial measures of  the past" because of the resignation of Gaydar, first deputy  prime minister and economic minister, who had been promoting the  radical introduction of a market economy, and former Deputy  Prime Minister Fedorov's refusal to become a cabinet member. He  also explained that some people are concerned about the  possibility that the escalating trend in Russia of seeking  "major-power chauvinism" may create "antipathy against  `handouts' termed humanitarian aid."</p>

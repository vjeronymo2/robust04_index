			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index closes at new peak THE FT-SE 100 Share Index reached a new all-time closing high last night, having earlier come within a few points of its intra-day peak. Optimism on interest prospects in the UK and across the range of countries in the ERM was buttressed by strength in UK government bonds and by demand for stock index futures. Increased activity by UK private investors was reported, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose to yet another peak. Buyers were in the majority from the opening of the market. Spurred on by the future, the Footsie turned strongly ahead at mid-morning and by mid-session showed a gain of 31 points at 2,974.4; but the market proved unwilling to challenge the mid-March intra-day peak of 2,986.9, and share gains were trimmed later. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 26.4 at 2,969.8, comfortably exceeding the previous closing high of 2,957.3 achieved on March 8. Gains among second line stocks were equally widespread, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gaining 30.5 to 3,392.8. Seaq volume rose to 681.3m shares from Thursday's 616.4m which was worth Pounds 1.41bn in customer business value. Business in non-Footsie stocks, finally around 59 per cent of the total, increased strongly towards the close. The continued strength of the Footsie Mid 250 Index, together with the turnover in non-Footsie stocks indicated UK private investor activity. Sharelink, the execution-only stockbroker which came to the market a week ago, said it had seen more transactions this week than in the whole of August last year. Some equity strategists warned yesterday that interest rate cuts by ERM members should not be taken for granted. Mr Ian McCafferty of NatWest Securities suggested that ERM members 'have not abandoned currency stability as a policy aim,' and will conduct policies accordingly. But such warnings fell on deaf ears yesterday afternoon when it was clear that investors were gearing themselves up for a strong start on Monday morning to the second leg of the UK equity trading account. This week has brought gains of around 1.5 per cent in the Footsie stocks and about 2.6 per cent in the Mid 250 listed issues. Long-dated government bonds gained just over one point but the near dates showed little change. The issue of Pounds 1.5bn tranches of existing bonds was announced.</p>

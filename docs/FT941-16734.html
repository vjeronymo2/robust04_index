			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Parent's Charter to go to 20m homes The government will deliver copies of a revised Parent's Charter to 20m households next month at a cost of about Pounds 2m, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. The duties of schools and responsibilities of parents will be set out in the document which is part of the Citizen's Charter initiative. In response to claims that this would be wastefully expensive, Mr Patten said distributing door-to-door was the cheapest method for the taxpayer and ensured that all parents and 'others concerned about education' would be fully informed. Mr Patten said the move reflected the interest which Mr John Major, the prime minister, had taken in education and likened Mr Major to Mr George Bush, the former US president, who said he wanted to be an 'education president'. He said: 'John Major has a target of becoming an education prime minister. That's why when he talks about the back-to-basics message he talks about education.' Mr Patten refused to commit himself to a response to the call by the National Union of Teachers, made on Thursday, for this year's National Curriculum tests to be abandoned. He said the NUT had made no suggestion that it would stop teaching the National Curriculum before the tests and he questioned the union's motivation for wishing to abandon them. However he said he would consider the matter further before making a formal response. He said he would not deviate from the government's response to Sir Ron Dearing's report on the curriculum, published on Wednesday, which said tests should take place in mathematics, English and science this year.</p>

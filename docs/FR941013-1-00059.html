			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Conveyance System Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would establish requirements for conveyance systems to control organic HAP emissions occurring during the transfer of a regulated material containing organic HAP between two regulated material management units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements. Under the proposed rule, a ``conveyance system'' would be defined as a device other than a container used to transfer material to or from tanks, containers, surface impoundments, enclosed treatment units, or other regulated material management units. Examples of a conveyance system include a pipeline, individual drain system (with all associated drains, junction boxes, and sewer lines), channel, flume, gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed air emission control requirements are the same for existing conveyance systems and new conveyance systems. These requirements would not apply to either: a conveyance system in which all regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the requirements specified in the general standards; or a conveyance system designated by the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission controls in accordance with rule provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each conveyance system required to use air emission controls, the owner or operator would be required to use one of the following systems: (1) a conveyance system which uses a cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device; (2) a conveyance system which uses an enclosure that is connected through a closed-vent system to a control device; (3) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an enclosed pipeline in which all joints or seams between the pipe sections are permanently or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed flange); (4) a conveyance system which is designed and operated as an individual drain system in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 61.346(a)(1) or 40 CFR 61.346 (b)(1) through (b)(3); or (5) any other conveyance system which is designed to operate as a closed system such that the conveyance system operates with no detectable emissions (as determined by procedures specified under the rule) at all times that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material is in the conveyance system except under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Equipment Leak Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP would require owners and operators of affected facilities to control organic HAP emissions from leaks in pumps, compressors, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, flanges and other connectors, and product accumulator vessels that either contain or contact a regulated material which is a fluid (liquid or gas) and has a total organic HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight. The equipment leak standards would not apply to equipment that operates less than 300 hours per calendar year, or equipment for which the owner or operator is already complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 63 subpart H. For each equipment component subject to this standard at either an existing source or a new source, the owner or operator would be required to perform the leak detection and repair program and implement the equipment modifications required under 40 CFR 61.241 through 61.247.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Air Emission Control Equipment Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specific design, performance, and operating requirements are proposed for each cover, closed-vent system, and control device installed by the owner or operator to comply with the tank, surface impoundment, container, conveyance system, enclosed treatment unit standards of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed requirements for covers are determined by the type of cover used and the type of regulated material management unit on which the cover is installed. Requirements are specified for vapor-leak tight covers (i.e covers that operate with no detectable emissions as determined by procedures specified under the rule), external and internal floating roofs installed on tanks, floating membrane covers installed on surface impoundments, and container enclosures requiring continuous or frequent worker access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

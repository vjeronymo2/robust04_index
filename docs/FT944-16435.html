			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Submarines in BAe's sights British Aerospace may be known for its metal bashing skills, but the financial engineering involved in yesterday's agreed bid for VSEL was first class. Most importantly, the deal would broaden BAe's narrow capital base. The additional capital should bolster customers' confidence that the group can handle large contracts without significant cash-flow problems. It should also help BAe make the scale of provisions against the troubled turboprop operations necessary for their eventual disposal. VSEL's Pounds 284m cash would be a bonus. In earnings terms, the tax benefits would be particularly striking. BAe could offset VSEL's profits against its huge unused capital allowances, trading losses and ACT. These should drive BAe's tax rate down from 33 per cent to 25 per cent and make the acquisition earnings enhancing. Lastly, the additional consolidation would have the advantage of making a successful GEC bid for BAe less likely because of competition concerns. The financial conjuring does not invalidate the industrial logic, though its validity would take longer to prove. In the short term, BAe admits it would struggle to maintain VSEL's profits in spite of the remaining Trident work. In the longer term, the new grouping would need prove its worth by winning contracts such as the second batch of Trafalgar submarines. By linking the two groups, the chances of winning would be significantly enhanced. In spite of the financial and industrial logic of BAe's offer, the deal could yet be undone by GEC's offering a competing cash bid. If successful, that could leave BAe struggling to dispose of its turboprop business without a conventional rights issue.</p>

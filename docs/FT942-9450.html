			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: Architecture as an art - Colin Amery signs off from this page Is architecture art? It is a fair question, since this is my last Monday column for the FT on the Arts page - although I shall still be writing for the FT and still on a Monday. Once upon a time, especially around the last turn of the century, it was commonplace to talk of architecture as 'the mother of the arts'. Today the debate about architecture has become the mother and father of all debates, but whether or not it is an informed debate about artistic virtues is highly questionable. Even the secretary of state for the environment joined the militant tendency of architect haters last week by describing many of them as 'arrogant creators of brutal and alienating buildings'. Of course Mr Gummer is not wrong; but he should be aware that in the last decade things have improved considerably. There is greater public awareness of architecture, brought about by a reaction to both the brutal horrors of the 1960s and the boom follies of the 1980s. There is more informed interest in conservation - witness more than two million members of the National Trust, a lively conservationist television programme (BBC 1, One Foot in the Past), and the growth of 'historic home' magazines. At the commissioning level, there is much more concern about hiring good architects, which in turn has lead to more competitions, as developers realise that good buildings are good business. During the period I have been writing on this page, I have been lucky enough to sit on many juries and competition adjudications and have been involved with a range of new buildings that all demonstrate architecture as an art, and never as just a hand maiden of nihilist modernist propagandists. The Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott-Brown succeeds in being a complex work of art in itself while never overwhelming the paintings. The Supreme Court in Jerusalem designed by the Karmi brother and sister team is a unique example of a late 20th century monumental building that is timeless in its relationship to its environment, in this case the sensitive stones of the Holy City. At the Tate Gallery at St Ives, Cornwall, Eldred Evans and David Shalev produced a building of such pristine clarity and form that it gleams as a work of art almost more brightly than some of the collections it displays. It was an excess of talent which divided the jury of that competition. The debates and discussions that took place during the selection of architects for these three buildings was always at a highly intense level. Client bodies and benefactors for buildings of this calibre should never be under-estimated: they show great concern and, in some competitions, are frustrated by the lack of an adequate creative response from architects. What has become increasingly clear, is the need for architects to bring practicality and art together. This is not such an Herculean task if architects are prepared to take the client on board as they move from concept to detail. Clients often know far more about the way they want their buildings to work than the architects - and there is such a thing as creative collaboration. There were some happy signs in last week's Sunday Times/Royal Fine Art Commission Architecture Awards that commerce and industry have, despite the recession, completed some innovative and worthwhile new buildings. The Building of the Year 1994 went to the Cable and Wireless College in Coventry, designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Cable and Wireless has shown itself to be a brave patron. For its refurbished London office, sculptor William Pye was commissioned to design a brilliant water feature. In Coventry, its training school for advance communication technology does not adopt the obvious architectural language of 'high-tech'; it is much more low tech, almost vernacular, with its sweeping roofs and lattice of glazing. Commerce triumphed, too, with a dazzling new Sainsbury store at Canley, also near Coventry, an elegant glass and steel pavilion designed by Lifschutz Davidson. Both Sainsbury and Cable and Wireless are major companies that see the real value of good design. These two new buildings are worthy prize winners because they bring art to life. That must be the role of good architecture.</p>

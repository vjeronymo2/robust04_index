			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANTERBURY DOWNS' OPENING GETS BOOST  </P> <P> The sale of Canterbury Downs' stock to Michigan investors Herbert Tyner and  Bernie Hartman improves the track's chances of opening for a sixth season on  April 27 as scheduled.  </P> <P> Brooks Fields Jr.; his nephew, Brooks Hauser; Scottland Inc., and Santa Anita  Realty Corp. signed over 100% of the track's stock as well as Santa Anita's  management contract to Tyner and Hartman Thursday for an undisclosed price,  believed to be less than $4 million.  </P> <P> "The track is sold," Fields said. "Tyner and Hartman own all of the stock."  </P> <P> Control of Canterbury won't officially change hands until a related deal is  completed with the track's prospective operators.  </P> <P> Still pending is Tyner and Hartman's agreement in principle to sell operational  control and a substantial portion of the track's stock to Ladbroke Racing  Corp., a British bookmaking firm with extensive holdings in U.S. race tracks.  </P> <P> T. G. Preston of Mona, Meyer and McGrath, a Minneapolis public relations firm  representing Ladbroke, said the deal with Tyner and Hartman should be completed  within three weeks.  </P> <P> Preston said, however, that Canterbury will "open on the backstretch, April 12"  to permit horses and trainers to prepare for the season while the Ladbroke deal  is made final.  </P> <P> David Goodwill, vice president of Ladbroke's U.S. operations, confirmed that  Ladbroke is seeking 100% operational control.  </P> <P> Ladbroke, Tyner and Hartman jointly paid $20,000 in fees last week to the  Minnesota Racing Commission so that their required background investigations  can proceed. The investigations and licensing are expected to take about 30  days.  </P> <P> Ladbroke officials also have been at Canterbury this week formulating policy  with the track's staff.  </P> <P> Fields and his partners, who built Canterbury in 1985 and added improvements  the next year for an estimated total cost of $80 million, owned the track for  five years. During that time, the track lost more than $40 million.  </P> <P> During Canterbury's first two seasons of thoroughbred racing, average daily  attendance had been more than 12,500, 20% higher than projected, and the  average daily wagering handle was $1 million, about 5% below projections.  </P> <P> The track's experimental harness racing meet in the fall of 1986 generated a  loss of $5 million, however, and daily average attendance and handle for the  thoroughbred meet declined steadily in each succeeding season to 7,239 and  $844,525 respectively in 1989.  </P> <P> During the last five years Ladbroke -- owner of more than 2,000 betting shops  in Great Britain as well as the Hilton International Hotel chain -- has bought  several American race tracks in financial trouble.  </P> <P> In 1986, Ladbroke bought Tyner and Hartman's lease on Detroit Race Course for  an estimated $13 million. Last year it acquired three other tracks, including  Golden Gate Fields in Northern California.  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's rock around the bocks - Frank McGurty finds that American beer drinkers are turning to smaller breweries AMID the hubbub of a crowded City of London pub, an American expatriate stood at the bar, quietly considering his impending return to the US. Suddenly, as he raised a pint of Fuller's London Pride to his lips, the hoppy aroma triggered a thought that filled him with apprehension - soon there will be nothing to drink except sudsy, soulless American beer. Not long ago, the US's reputation for boring brew had been well-deserved, but as our home-bound tippler was to discover this month at the Greater New York Beer Expo, that image has become a bit dated. The genre was once defined by the likes of Bud, Miller High Life and Coors - bland, characterless lagers produced in vast quantities by a few big brewing groups. In the past five years, however, a host of small, independent 'microbreweries' has sprung up around the country, introducing a receptive niche market to porter, stout, and ales of all descriptions. The ever-restless American imagination has even managed to spin out some rather eccentric inventions of its own. (Have you tried Cerveza Caliente, a chilli-flavoured lager?) The variety is just what one would expect in an overheated consumer culture with an unslakeable thirst for choice. The mystery is why the brewing industry took so long to tap the latent demand. If anything, choosing among the plethora of beers is daunting. This helps explain a parallel phenomenon - a proliferation of beer festivals, at which the curious imbiber can spend an evening sampling the offerings of dozens of brewers. The trend began on the west coast, home of the greatest concentration of microbreweries and 'brew-pubs', an unfortunate term for bars and eateries that produce their own specialty beers. Curiously, the festival concept was slow to arrive in New York city. The first, and surely not the last, was held in a hanger-like convention hall at the Jacob Javits Convention Center on Manhattan's far west side. It featured about 50 vendors representing the entire spectrum of American brews and a few imports as well. In contrast to English real ale festivals, at which punters pay a small admission fee and buy pints a la carte, the expo was an all-you-can-drink affair. For Dollars 25 at the door, the sturdy drinker could work his way around the room, trying an ounce or two of everything on tap. First stop was a timid one, although there is nothing timid about Royal Oak, a classic English bottled ale made by Dorchester's Eldrige Pope. After reassuring the palate with a familiar benchmark, it was time to become better acquainted with the domestic fare. A good place to start was with Anchor, the long-established San Francisco brewer, which has arguably done more than any other American beer maker to inspire the recent renaissance. Anchor Steam, made in unusually shallow fermenting vessels, combines the smooth characteristics of lager with the assertiveness of ales made with top-fermenting yeast. Because its bold taste stands up so well to chilling, Anchor Steam is well-suited both to the American summertime climate, and to the American inclination to ice every brew as if it were a can of Budweiser (the US variety) even in the dead of winter. Amid the continued dominance of pale, watery lagers, a surprising number of US brewers are now making porters, one of the darkest and most full-bodied of brews. Anchor Porter, milder and more creamy than its English counterpart, is one of the best. Regrettably, Sierra Nevada, which produces an excellent porter of its own, was not represented at the event. Bock beer is another dark beer that stands more in the centre of the American brewing tradition. Like lager, bock (meaning 'strong beer' in German) is made with bottom-fermenting yeast, but unlike its paler cousin, it has a nuttier, roasted malt taste, which also stands up to colder temperatures better than more traditional top-fermenting ales. Latrobe Brewing's Rolling Rock Bock won plaudits from several expo-goers. With a taste very reminiscent of light, crisp Rolling Rock lager (also brewed under licence in the UK), this is hardly surprising. Zip City, a New York city brew-pub, also featured a bock. But its tap ran dry early in the evening so the raves the beer won from some drinkers had to be taken on faith. By contrast, there were resonances of Anchor Liberty Ale, with its strong hoppy aroma and burgundy hues, across the exposition floor. A good examples was Pete's Wicked Ale, an especially robust drink with hints of caramel around the edges. An English friend who has lived in New York for several years lauded Pete's as 'a typical American ale', which in itself speaks well for the quality. Samuel Adams Boston Stock Ale, made by the upstart Boston Beer Co and distributed widely, might have evoked similar praise if it had not been by-passed in favour of more exotic fare. A cluster of beefy lads, whose expansive girths suggested the breadth of their expertise, pointed the way. 'I love this Big-Nosed Blonde,' said one, referring to one of fancifully named creations of McNeill's Brewery of Brattleboro, Vermont. These included a concoction called Duck's Breath, a mild ale with herbal undertones and such a smooth finish that it almost tickled the tongue. The sweetish Slopbucket Brown Ale was immediately identifiable as such by an Englishman who claimed to have grown up with a bottle of Newcastle Brown in his hand. Dead Horse Ale was more full-bodied with a chocolatey edge. New Haven Brewing of Connecticut took a more staid approach to naming its products, but shared McNeill's determination to distinguish itself from the crowd. Indeed, its Elm City Golden Ale takes the prize as the most distinctive beer at the expo, according to one highly subjective view. With its mild maltiness, the exceptional smoothness of a Czech pilsner and a delicious buttery texture, Elm City seemed to capture the spirit of the new American brews. It gave a respectful nod to European traditions so long ignored in the US, while asserting an individual character that refuses to be ignored in its own right. ***** ADDRESSES AND INFORMATION Anchor Brewing, Mariposta Street, San Francisco, California 94107.

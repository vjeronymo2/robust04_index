			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commenting on a statement signed by 40 people's  deputies of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet, in which they refused  to participate in the voting on the draft constitution,  Vyacheslaw Kuznetsow, first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman,  stated: "I think that the behavior of these people's deputies  is very illogical, the more so since some of them were members  of the Constitutional Committee. They have stated that they are  against the form of voting. I, personally, believe that this is  just an unwillingness to adopt the basic law," Vyacheslaw  Kuznetsow concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]Oki Electric Co., Ltd. has developed the ``OP32/50N''  RISC chip for embedded applications such as in high performance  page printers and facsimile machines. The design of the new chip  is based on the PA-RISC architecture of Hewlett Packard Co. The  new chip operates at 33MHz, and provides performance of 39MIPS.  A DRAM controller and DMA controller are integrated into the  chip, and an internal cache memory is provided for permanent  storage of data and instructions.    Oki Electric has developed the OP32/50N RISC chip for  embedded control applications such as page printers, facsimile  machines, and portable type information devices. The design of  the new chip conforms to Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC architecture,  meeting the specifications for level 0, which does not include a  memory management function. The OP32 series might also be used  in ASIC microcomputers to incorporate customer-requested  functions, and as the CPU core of ASSP (application specific  standard product) chips. When this is done, Oki Electric claims  that it will become possible to modify instruction sets  according to user requests.    The OP32/50N integrates a DRAM controller which can manage  four memory banks, and a 4-channel DMA controller. The CPU core  provides 8K byte and 4K byte cache memories for instructions and  data, respectively.    The address and data busses within the CPU core are both 32  bits wide. The maximum address space which can be accessed is 4G  (2&lt;sup&gt; 32&lt;/sup&gt; ) bytes. This is divided into 4M  (2&lt;sup&gt; 22&lt;/sup&gt; ) byte banks for management.  <H5>  Instructions Permanently Resident in Cache </H5>   The new chip provides the capability of storing data and  instructions permanently in cache memory. This is called the  ``cache freeze'' function, and is used to store instructions  having particularly stringent processing time restrictions, and  for data which is frequently accessed.    The areas which can be used for permanent storage are set in  2K byte units for the instruction cache, and in 1K byte units  for the data cache. The cache freeze function is activated by  software after the desired data or instructions are read once  using an input/output command.  <H5>  39 MIPS Operation Achieved at 33MHz </H5>   The OP32/50N executes 39M instructions per second (based on  VAX-11/780) while operating at 33MHz. Source power is +5V and  power consumption is 3W. The chip is sealed in a 208 pin PGA  package, and is scheduled to be shipped in the spring of 1994.    In 1995, Oki plans to commercialize the OP32/60C CPU core  and  the OP32/60N microcontroller, which will operate at 40MHz on a  source voltage of +3.3V. These products will use 0.5&mgr;m CMOS  technology.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on talk of curbing long-end issues TREASURY prices rose at the long end yesterday amid renewed speculation that the US government may curtail issues of new long-dated securities to save on borrowing costs. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/2 at 106 21/32 , yielding 7.435 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16 at 100 15/32 , yielding 4.732 per cent. Prices rose primarily in response to a press report that officials in Washington have become increasingly serious about reducing the amount of 30-year bonds it issues. Although there was nothing new in the story, suggestions that supply at the long end could shrink boosted an already firm market, and provoked some short-covering by dealers. The return of Japanese buyers to the market after the Christmas and New Year holiday break also contributed to the positive tone. GERMAN government bonds gained a quarter-point helped by fresh buying interest and some switching out of long-dated bunds into shorter-dated securities. The Liffe bund futures contract jumped from its opening of 87.68 to a high of 87.88 before closing at 87.81. Volume in the Liffe futures contract was normal at 41,500 contracts. Traders said the longer end of the maturity range was suffering from worries over the outcome of the 1992 wage round and the prospect of higher inflation. The bund market is awaiting a batch of economic data this week including unemployment figures for December and industrial production and retail sales figures for November. Traders said the market will be looking for confirmation of a slowdown in the German economy. Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bond prices ended sharply higher, helped by strong demand for the 15-year issue from both domestic and foreign buyers. UK government bonds drifted up in dull trading yesterday as traders reported only sparse interest from foreign and domestic buyers, many of whom are only just returning from the holiday break. The gilt market is waiting for fund managers to start reallocating their portfolios for the new year. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose by less than a half-point to 115 1/8 to yield 9.51 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds continued to rise in yesterday's half-day session, helped by the strength of the yen and last week's unexpected half-point cut in the official discount rate to 4.5 per cent. However, modest profit-taking limited the gains in both the cash and futures markets. Traders said the bond market remained bullish, helped by the yen's strength against the dollar and lower short-term interest rates. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.35 per cent and moved to 5.32 per cent before closing at 5.34 per cent. The unsecured overnight call money rate traded at around 5 5/16 per cent, sharply down from its level of 5 9/16 per cent at the previous close on December 31. Three-month certificates of deposit traded at around 5.4 per cent. The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction Y800bn to Y900bn of January 10-year bonds later this week. The coupon on the new issue is expected to be around 5.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent. The coupon on the December issue of 10-year government bonds was 6 per cent, but yen bond yields have dropped since then.</p>

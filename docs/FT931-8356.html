			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel poised to freeze Airtours bid timetable THE TAKEOVER Panel is likely either today or on Monday to freeze the timetable of Airtours' hostile Pounds 215m bid for Owners Abroad, its rival tour group. Owners Abroad would have had to produce its final Day 39 defence document on Monday, but the Office of Fair Trading has yet to forward its recommendation to the trade and industry secretary as to whether the bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In the event that the bid is referred, the offer will lapse; if the bid were not referred, Owners Abroad would normally have two days to produce its defence after the trade secretary delivered his ruling. Removal of the threat of an MMC referral would refocus shareholder attention on the value of Airtours share offer and partial cash alternative. It would also throw a spot-light back to the intentions of Thomas Cook, which is controlled by WestDeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank which has large interests in the travel industry. Thomas Cook's proposed tie-up with Owners Abroad, in which it would have made a net Pounds 2m injection of cash in return for a 10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad, had been put on hold until after shareholders have decided whether to reject the Airtours' bid. However, some City observers have begun to question whether Thomas Cook would not tear up the existing strategic alliance agreement after Airtours' final offer, in favour of buying a blocking - though not controlling - stake in Owners Abroad. Schroders has been advising Thomas Cook on its banking side and Thomas Cook said it appointed James Capel as broking advisers early in the new year. James Capel advised Thomas Cook when Midland Bank sold the travel group to the Germans in 1991.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer Marks and Spencer has again been hoist by its own reticence. Yesterday's two-paragraph trading statement came earlier than the stock market expected but was typically terse. Without hard figures to go on, investors chose to assume the worst. That could be a mistake. Careful reading suggests that decent trading over Christmas at least made up for a poor November. If the cash cost of the post-Christmas sale was similar to last year, and volumes have gone up, gross margin should actually have improved. After yesterday's 3.5 per cent fall, though, the shares stand at their lowest rating relative to the market for some years. In part, that reflects the de-rating of the sector as retailers have lost the benefits of inflation and high street property has lost its attractions. Nor are M&amp;S's defensive qualities the height of fashion while recovery stocks are available elsewhere. That said, the margin erosion revealed by Burton yesterday is a reminder that not all retailing recovery stories will have the anticipated happy ending. If budget tax increases take the edge off consumer spending through the summer, M&amp;S's unbroken record of earnings growth will start to count for more.</p>

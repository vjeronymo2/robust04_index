			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Companies told to tackle age bias THE INSTITUTE of Personnel Management today warns companies to tackle age discrimination voluntarily 'before social pressures force legislation to outlaw discrimination against older workers'. A survey of more than 1,000 members found that 80 per cent thought age discrimination was a problem in UK companies. The institute says that the recession has made the position worse. An even greater proportion of members - 86 per cent - thought there should be either legislation or a government-sponsored voluntary code of practice to prevent the specification of age ceilings in job advertisements. A separate survey, conducted earlier this year by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research group, found that almost a third of job advertisments specified an age bar - up from a quarter four years ago. Four out of five advertisers giving a preference wanted someone under 45. The government has so far ruled out the kind of anti-discrimination legislation found in North America and France. The institute itself is opposed to introducing laws, but its code of guidance recommends companies not to specify ages in job advertisements. The study finds that personnel managers themselves held some stereotyped views about older workers: 66 per cent thought they were less able to accept new technology, 63 per cent thought they were less able to adapt to change, and 48 per cent thought they learnt less quickly.

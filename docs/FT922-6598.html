			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Observer: Whistle-stop tour Sir Terence Conran, for one, must be reflecting on the circumstances that caused Michael Julien to quit as boss of Storehouse at just 54. It took the company's creator about 18 months to decide he did not wish even to function as a non-executive director alongside the ultra-ambitious Julien, who came in as chief executive of Storehouse in 1988. Now Julien has finally decided he cannot take his own frenetic pace, and from July will be recovering from a persistent virus at his French farmhouse. Julien is remembered even in his days as Midland's finance director as an 'exhausting' colleague to be around. But it was also there he really made his mark - in extricating the UK clearer from the Crocker debacle. Since then, he has continued to move at frenetic speed around the corporate flashpoints of Britain - Eurotunnel, for a short time, and then to Guinness, to help restore order after the big scandal. But his driving ambition to rise from finance director into the driving seat took him to Storehouse - at huge personal financial cost as he relinquished his Guinness share options - to run the group just as the peak of the consumer boom slipped inexorably into recession. Boss at last, he failed to silence his doubters. While it took him mere months to knock financial sense into the Storehouse balance sheet, his legendary workaholic characteristics did not deliver any profound grasp of retailing - in contrast his successor, soft-spoken American David Dworkin, who had spells at a host of big name US retailers under his belt before he began making a success as chairman of BhS. Dworkin, chewing thoughtfully on a banana at yesterday's press briefing, is not short of energy himself, but makes less noise.</p>

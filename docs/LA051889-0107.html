			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Justice Department has deported the first Nicaraguan refugees from South  Texas since it began detaining Central American asylum-seekers in February,  officials said. Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said the  deportations do not signal a change in policy and were delayed because "there  were some bottlenecks." Although dozens of Salvadorans, Guatemalans and  Hondurans have been deported since the Immigration and Naturalization Service  began detaining Central American asylum-seekers on Feb. 20, no Nicaraguans had  been deported until Monday. INS spokesman Duke Austin said 10 Nicaraguans were  deported Monday and 16 on Tuesday, with deportation orders pending on more than  100 others.  </P></p>

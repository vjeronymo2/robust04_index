			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following is a comprehensive review  of all items in the 14 June issue of the Arabic-language  newspaper Cairo 'AQIDATI that pertain to political Islamic  issues.  <H5>  Contents: </H5>   1. Developing Curricula To Avoid Preachers' Declining  Standards    2. Plan To Fight Extremist Thought    3. U.S. Companies' Conduct Seen as Offense Against Muslims    4. Yemeni Scholar Fatwa Berated    5. Study Draws Attention to Importance of Chinese Muslims    6. Official Sees Japan as Fertile Soil for Islam  <H5>  DEVELOPING CURRICULA TO AVOID PREACHERS' DECLINING STANDARDS </H5>   In his 300-word column "In Truth I Speak" on page 1 Chief  Editor Samir Rajab says it is "wrong to assume that the Awqaf  Ministry is responsible for the declining standards of preachers  and imams or for the narrow-mindedness of some of them, who see  nothing but torture, vengeance, and the bald-headed serpent from  the grave in our forgiving religion." He explains that these  preachers graduate from al-Azhar and that all the ministry does  is to distribute them throughout its mosques all over the  country after training them.    He says he does not find it surprising that "some of these  preachers are sometimes accused of being behind the waves of  extremism and violence because of the issues and topics they  raise in their sermons, which are often used as a source of  income."    To handle the problem, Rajab suggests to al-Azhar that it  develop curricula at its institutes, colleges, and schools. He  stresses that other "educational, cultural, and sports  establishments" must back the security apparatus positively and  effectively.  <H5>  PLAN TO FIGHT EXTREMIST THOUGHT </H5>   A 300-word report by Muhammad al-Abnudi on page 2 states  that  "The Awqaf Ministry has prepared a new plan to refute  extremists' allegations and fragile arguments by preparing  counter-arguments in response to the books from which they draw  their information." According to the report, a working group of  18 specialized scholars in the various areas of thought will  list the books the extremists read and provide counter-arguments  for every point argued in these "suspicious books" that distort  their thinking.    According to the plan, these specialists will teach the  arguments to four groups totalling 120 imams working for Awqaf.  The working group will start the search for these books on 15  June and lessons will begin next week. The subjects to be  studied, explained, and taught include the application of  Islamic shari'ah, repudiation, apostasy, preaching good deeds  and prohibiting evil, rulings on the permissibility of action,  and the treatment of non-Muslims in a Muslim community.  <H5>  U.S. COMPANIES' CONDUCT SEEN AS OFFENSE AGAINST MUSLIMS </H5>   A 300-word report by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl on page 21 claims  that the famous McDonald hamburger restaurants and Coca Cola are  committing a grave offense against Muslims by printing the Saudi  Arabian flag, with its characteristic Islamic statement "there  is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger," on bags and  soft drinks cans that are "dumped in wastebaskets or trampled  underfoot" after their contents have been consumed.    YEMENI SCHOLAR FATWA BERATED    In the 500-word "In All Frankness" column on page 6 Basyuni  al-Halawani maintains that "Yemeni scholars have indulged in a  cheap game with some of them trying to plunge Islam into the war  of grudges raging on the soil of sad Yemen," giving the enemies  of Islam the chance to distort its image.    He notes that Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami, dean of the  al-Iman College at Sanaa University and a member of the supreme  committee of the "northern" Yemeni Reform Grouping, has made an  Islamic ruling on the "permissibility of killing children,  women, and old people, burning and destroying public utilities,  and seizing the properties of the southerners."    "If he really made that ruling, in the form published by  some  Arab mass media, then al-Daylami is not fit even to be a  mu'adhdhin at a mosque, let alone a dean of al-Iman, faith, and  college," al-Halawani contends.    He states that Islam has a clear-cut stance on "wars of  grudges motivated by satanic whims" and that there is no need to  plunge the name of Islam into such affairs. He regrets that  "most Islamic states are afflicted with a type of scholar who  always tries to employ Islam to serve the greed and ambition of  some Arab rulers."    Stating that scholars' primary duty is to work to close  ranks  and eliminate grudges, he maintains that "those who volunteer to  justify whimsical and criminal conduct that is rejected by  Islamic shari'ah are accomplices to evil-doing and aggression  and will burn in hell."  <H5>  STUDY DRAWS ATTENTION TO IMPORTANCE OF CHINESE MUSLIMS </H5>   Dr. 'Abd-al-Halim 'Uways writes in a 2,000-word article on  page 6 about "Muslims in China: A big Minority Under Communist  Control."    Citing conflicting statistics on the number of Muslims in  China, he maintains that they are "no fewer than 80 million."  He draws Muslims' attention to "enormous human resources" that  deserve attention and care, stating that it is in the higher  interest of Islam to be in the middle of that "ocean" of Muslims  in a country that "might become the first or second power in the  world."    Describing Muslims' social and cultural conditions in China  as wretched, he goes on to identify a "pressing need to teach  Muslims in China and the countries that were in the communist  grip the basic principles that link them with the sound creed  and pillars of Islam."    For this he suggests measures recommended by a study by Dr.  Ahmad Anis, former vice president of the World Islamic Islamabad  University. The recommendations include providing imams and  Muslims in China with the necessary religious education, helping  Chinese and other Muslims learn Arabic as a means of  communication with the Islamic world, helping Chinese Muslims to  build better Islamic academic establishments all over the  country, organizing publications, seminars, and cultural,  academic, and intellectual conferences, helping Chinese Muslims  understand, preserve, and convey their culture and traditions,  and helping them to become good, moral citizens.  <H5>  OFFICIAL SEES JAPAN AS FERTILE SOIL FOR ISLAM </H5>   A 600-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page 20 cites  Muhammad 'Ashur Hamzah, manager of the Kubah Islamic Center in  Tokyo, stating that "Japan is fertile soil for Islam if it is  presented with the right image." Hamzah calls on Islamic states  and institutions to intensify efforts to promote Islam in Japan  by building mosques and Islamic centers and sending trained  preachers who have been taught Japanese.</p>

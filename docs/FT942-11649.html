			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Lufthansa privatisation clears last hurdle The last important obstacle to the privatisation of Lufthansa, Germany's state-controlled airline, was lifted yesterday as the airline and the German government reached agreement on the issue of pension rights for the airline's employees. Lufthansa and the government will be contributing about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in cash payments, provisions and guarantees to ensure that employees' pension entitlements are maintained when the airline moves to the private sector. The pensions issue had threatened to scupper the airline's long-planned privatisation and delay rationalisation measures. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said in Bonn yesterday that the agreement opened the way for the government to reduce its 51.42 per cent stake in Lufthansa. He said the privatisation would take place in stages, starting in the second half of this year, when the state will not take up its rights to new shares under a rights issue. The airline gave few details yesterday but supervisory board chairman Mr Wolfgang Roller said that the airline needed about DM1bn in fresh equity capital. The state's non-participation in the issue will take its holding down to between 40 and 45 per cent. Thereafter the government is likely to sell off some or all of its remaining holding - valued at DM3.1bn at current market prices. Mr Waigel hinted that the first direct sale of shares could take place this year. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, said the solution to the pensions problem would allow the airline to proceed with a further round of restructuring. The plan is to concentrate on the airline's core business and it is likely that marginal activities will be spun off or contracted out to third-party suppliers in an attempt to improve efficiency. The airline has already implemented big reductions in its workforce: a total of 4,000 jobs were cut last year, reducing costs by DM300m. Partly as a result of this, pre-tax losses at the parent company dropped to DM50m in 1993 from DM297m in the previous year. Mr Weber said the group was on track to break even at the operating level this year after losses of about DM500m last year. The pensions issue has dogged the airline's sell-off plans. Pensions are now financed by the VBL, the federal and state pension fund, but the government has no legal obligation to finance pensions once its stake falls below 50 per cent. Under yesterday's compromise, the airline will take over financing the pensions of its 45,000-48,000 active employees. Excluding privatisations in eastern Germany, the government has raised DM11.6bn from privatisations since 1982. It has reduced its industrial holdings from 858 to under 400. The next big privatisation will be that of Deutsche Telekom, scheduled to take place by 1996. Lex, Page 26</p>

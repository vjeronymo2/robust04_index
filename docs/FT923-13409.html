			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark declines 19% to Pounds 4.55m CONTINUING recession and reduced margins were blamed by Matthew Clark, the wine and sherry producer and drinks distributor, for a 19 per cent drop from Pounds 5.62m to Pounds 4.55m in annual pre-tax profits. The outcome was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 249,000 (Pounds 111,000) relating to restructuring and abortive acquisition costs. Sales of continuing businesses increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 39.9m in the year to April 30, boosted by new contracts and some trading down by consumers. However, Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said pressure from multiple grocers and cash-and-carry chains had been unrelenting, squeezing the margin from 13 per cent to 11.4 per cent. Mr Aikens said the group felt profit margins could not fall much lower, but he was not counting on any upturn in the UK economy before next April. The company said it had gained significant share in the British sherry market during the year. This had been complemented by the launch of a premium range of Stone's sherries, capitalising on the strength of its ginger wine brand. Among its agency brands, sales of Taittinger were down 45 per cent in a depressed champagne market. Grand Marnier gained market share in the shrinking liqueurs sector while De Kuyper maintained its position as the most widely distributed cherry brandy. Clark paid Pounds 11m for Strathmore, the Scottish bottled water brand, just after the April year-end. Mr Aikens said: 'The coming year will be one of consolidation, ensuring that both Strathmore and the company as a whole are well placed to develop the markets that we are addressing.' A new joint venture had begun with Inver House Distilleries to market and sell its Scotch whiskies, gin and vodka. The company's sales force had been reorganised to concentrate on key accounts and wholesalers. Earnings per share increased to 33.6p (29.6p), reflecting the acquisition of the minority interest in JE Mather. The final dividend is lifted to 9.25p giving a total for the year of 15.75p (14p). COMMENT Difficult Christmas trading came as an unpleasant surprise to analysts at the interim stage, so Mr Aikens was clearly determined yesterday not to sound falsely optimistic about what is clearly a tough market. His strategy of moving away from the low-margin multiples to supplying pubs, hotel and restaurants makes sense, as does the focus on selling to wholesalers, rather than individual outlets. The company will concentrate on bedding in Strathmore, not least because other possible acquisition targets are only available at fancy prices. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m put the shares, down 4p yesterday to 450p, on a prospective multiple of 12.5. The shares rose strongly after the Strathmore deal was announced, and seem fairly valued until the bene-fits of that purchase are confirmed.</p>

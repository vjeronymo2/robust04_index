			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Tesco considers next move City analysts were divided yesterday over whether Tesco was likely to re-enter the takeover battle for Wm Low following J Sainsbury's bid of 305p a share for the Scottish supermarket group on Thursday. After Tesco's failure to respond immediately with a higher bid, and reports that its directors and advisers were locked in meetings yesterday, there were suggestions that the UK's second-largest food retailer was wavering over whether to raise its offer. Tesco is thought to have expected a bid from Sainsbury of about 280p a share, and has been wrong footed by the 305p offer, which valued Wm Low at Pounds 210m - a 36 per cent premium to Tesco's original agreed offer of 225p a share, worth Pounds 154m. 'I don't think Tesco had really thought through the implications of Sainsbury coming back at that price,' said one analyst. A source close to Tesco hinted the company was anxious not to be seen to have been pushed into overpaying for the 57-store Wm Low group. Most analysts, however, still believe Tesco will make a bid of about 325p a share on Monday or Tuesday. That would leave Sainsbury with the choice of whether to push the price to 350p or more. Others are convinced Tesco will itself bid 350p in an attempt to guarantee victory. 'I think Tesco will bid 350p on Monday,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'I am beginning to wonder if Sainsbury would then come back at 400p.' Shares in Wm Low fell 1p to 323p. However, shares in Wm Morrison, the north of England-based superstore group, gained 5 1/2 p to 139 1/2 p yesterday amid speculation that it might become a takeover target.</p>

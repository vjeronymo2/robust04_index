			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CTK report in the "From the Political Scene" column: "Milan </F> Adam Elected Chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party"]    [Text] Pardubice -- Milan Adam, 66, former minister of  education in the post-November 1989 government, was elected  chairman of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party [CSS] at the 27th  CSS Congress in Pardubice. The participants in the congress  also approved party statutes and the program of this  extraparliamentary party. In the adopted documents, the  Socialists have subscribed to the traditions of the CSS since  1897 when the CSS' predecessor "was born of the will of  nationally and socially minded workers."    However, the status of legal successor to the pre-November  CSS was also claimed by Hirs' Liberal National Social Party  [LSNS] when it was founded in May 1993. Unlike the present CSS,  the LSNS emphasizes the tradition of Benes' National Social  Party.</p>

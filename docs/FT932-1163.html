			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (14): Damage limitation is likely - Alice Rawsthorn investigates an anxious period in arts funding THEY say some acts are impossible to follow. Mr Jacques Toubon has the dubious honour of trying to follow one of those acts. He was appointed this spring as France's new culture minister, succeeding Mr Jack Lang who, during nine years in the post, became one of the most influential members of the old socialist cabinet and the most powerful arts minister in Europe. The Lang era - l'epoch Lang, as Liberation, the French newspaper, called it  -was a gilded period of public patronage for the arts in France. Mr Toubon has taken over at a time when the economy is under pressure and every ministerial budget, including culture, is set for cuts. Mr Lang was lucky. He presided over the opulent offices of the culture ministry at the Palais-Royal at a buoyant time for the French economy. His close friendship with President Francois Mitterrand also helped him to strengthen his position in the cabinet by adding media, architecture, education and, even, the deputy prime ministership to his original culture brief. This left Mr Lang with the cash, and the clout, to implement his ideas. He embellished the traditional elements of socialist arts policy, such as state subsidy and industrial intervention, with modern concepts, notably corporate sponsorship. He spruced up France's old institutions and opened new ones. Paris was transformed by the construction of the glittering grands projets, the monumental modern buildings such as IM Pei's Louvre Pyramid and Jean Nouvel's Institut du Monde Arabe. Mr Lang was doubly fortunate in that his own programmes were accompanied by a stream of petits projets, the provincial architectural schemes initiated by ambitious local mayors such as Mr Jean Bousquet at Nimes and Mr Georges Freche in Montpellier. These played an important part in enhancing the image of France as a dynamic cultural centre. L'epoch Lang has attracted as many criticisms as compliments. Mr Lang was loathed by the right, notably by Mr Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor and Mr Toubon's political mentor. The conservatives cited the decline in cinema attendance and rising illiteracy as evidence of Mr Lang's failure. But the criticism simply attracted more attention to the flamboyant arts minister who, for the past five years, has regularly topped the polls as France's most popular elected politician. Mr Toubon has none of his predecessor's advantages. The economy is in recession. Mr Edouard Balladur has asked all his ministers to make cuts. Given that at least FFr900bn of the FFr1,367bn government budget is committed to salaries and debt service, there will be intense pressure on 'discretionary' expenditure, such as arts subsidies. The new minister will try to minimise the damage. Mr Toubon is a genuine arts enthusiast who has revealed a weakness for his predecessor's flamboyant style in his high profile visit to the Cannes film festival - and his decision to award the Order of Arts and Letters to Elton John, the pop star. Mr Toubon is also an extremely ambitious man. He is the son of a casino croupier who joined the political elite after winning a place at the prestigious Ecole National de l'Administration and now hopes to use the arts as a stepping stone to a more important ministry. He will not want to be remembered as the budget-cutting philistine who demolished the Lang legacy. The problem is that Mr Toubon is ill-placed to resist political pressure. First, he has less influence than Mr Lang. He has inherited the culture portfolio, but not his predecessor's other responsibilities  - media, architecture, education and the deputy premiership. Moreover his main political ally, Mr Chirac, is not in the government. The Paris mayor has gambled that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential elections might be better if he stays away from the political fray. Mr Toubon cannot even count on basking in the reflected glory of provincial arts programmes. The petits projets of the 1980s have brought many French cities to the brink of bankruptcy. Their publicity-hungry mayors are now concentrating on paying off their debts rather than commissioning new buildings. The new minister does at least have the consolation that the cultural tide was turning against Mr Lang, whose gauche caviar style was better suited to the affluent 1980s than the ascetic 1990s. Even the left had turned against him. Mr Eric Rohmer, the French film maker, parodied his policies in his latest movie, The Tree, The Mayor and The Mediatheque. This might make life a little easier for Mr Toubon as he braces himself for the cuts. The critical question is where they will fall. The only hint so far is that Mr Toubon plans to switch the emphasis of expenditure away from Paris towards the provinces. This bodes ill for some Paris institutions such as the Institut du Monde Arabe, which already has funding problems; the Louvre, still in the throes of renovation; and Opera de Paris, which may have to fight harder for its FFr520m annual subsidy and delay its plans for a petite salle. Mr Toubon has already made it clear that there is no question of new grands projets. The old ones are now completed, with the exception of the FFr7.2bn Bibliotheque de France, which is still under construction. But Mr Lang made a pre-emptive strike by sanctioning FFr4bn of work on the scheme. Mr Toubon has conceded that rather than write off the money, the Bibliotheque will go ahead after all.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Bosnia's ethnic leaders appeal for peace: European Community expected to recognise state's independence today ETHNIC leaders made a joint appeal for peace yesterday after fierce fighting flared in the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Many people were reported killed in gunfights and air and artillery attacks, which came on the eve of a European Community meeting to consider recognising Bosnia as an independent state. With automatic weapons fire and explosions continuing, leaders of Bosnia's Moslem, Croat and Serbian communities joined federal army chiefs in a televised plea for peace. As the Yugoslav federal state crumbles, Bosnia's Moslems and Croats generally favour independence, which is pitting them against the republic's Serbs. A Sarajevo radio report claimed hundreds had been killed or wounded in the town of Kupres, but this could not be confirmed. Croat irregulars were reported to have seized the town, prompting a bloody three-day battle in which two Yugoslav army jets were said to have been shot down. In Sarajevo, about 7,000 demonstrators from the three ethnic communities joined in a peace protest, defying gunfire echoing in the streets around them. But at one point gunmen opened fire on the crowd, killing one demonstrator and injuring 10. Yugoslav army Mig-21 jet fighters swooped low over the city repeatedly, in an attempt to drive the demonstrators from the streets. Clashes were also reported near the town of Bosanksi Brod, and thousands of people were fleeing the town of Brcko across a bridge into Croatia. It was the worst fighting in Bosnia since the Second World War. Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic blamed the violence on Serbs opposed to Bosnian independence, saying they were trying to block international recognition. He also accused the Serb-led federal army of failing to prevent fighting. The fighting follows the heaviest clashes for months in neighbouring Croatia. Croatian radio said about 27 people were killed in fighting in eastern Croatia on Friday and the Serb-led Yugoslav army said 25 federal soldiers and Serb fighters were killed. EC foreign ministers appear likely to recognise Bosnia's independence later today. Slovenia and Croatia have already won EC recognition. Most EC states now seem to believe that the only way to improve the dangerously unstable situation in Bosnia is to give it the independent status it voted for by referendum a month ago. The US, which is now seeking to bring its stance in line with that of the Community, is also pushing for recognition of Bosnia. But Spain, and to some degree Germany, argue that the issue of recognising Bosnia should not be separated from the question of giving similar status to Macedonia. Greece has strongly objected to recognising Macedonia under that name, for fear of stirring Macedonian nationalism in northern Greece. The Portuguese presidency of the EC has been trying to find a formula to satisfy Greece. Meanwhile, the first infantry contingent of the UN peacekeeping force sent to Yugoslavia began deployment in war-torn areas of Croatia yesterday.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Amsterdam - Other markets The Dutch market also hosts quarterly figures, both on Thursday, from KLM and Philips. In August, KLM posted a strong increase in net profit in the first quarter of 1994-95, reflecting good demand for air travel sparked by general economic recovery as well as the company's cost-cutting efforts. In the same month, Philips more than trebled its profits in the second quarter of 1994, beating even the most optimistic of analysts' forecasts for the electronics group. UBS reckons that all of the Dutch majors, including DSM and Akzo, could produce positive surprises this week, and says that Philips looks undervalued on discounts of more than 25 per cent for 1995 and 1996.</p>

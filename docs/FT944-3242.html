			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Montague gets new writ from Barclays A second bankruptcy petition has been served on Mr Robert Montague, chief executive of Tiphook, the container rental group, after the breakdown of negotiations between Mr Montague and creditor banks over his estimated Pounds 40m of personal debts. Barclays Bank, which is owed about Pounds 9m, is thought to have served the notice late last week. Mr Montague was issued with his first writ, for Pounds 2.3m by the Royal Bank of Scotland, in September. That was due to be heard last month but was extended until December 22 in order to give Mr Montague time to reach agreement with his creditors, which also include Commerzbank and Lloyds Bank. The Barclays petition is due to be heard on January 9. Of the money owed to Barclays, some Pounds 8m is secured on Mr Montague's 1,300-acre estate at Pusey in Oxfordshire. RBS's outstanding debts are thought to relate to loans made for improvements and upkeep of the estate. Commerzbank is said to be owed about Pounds 12m, of which about Pounds 7m is secured on Mr Montague's yacht, which is up for sale. The latest development in the financial turmoil surrounding Mr Montague will increase pressure on the Tiphook board ahead of its interim results tomorrow which are expected to reveal further deep losses. The group, which has seen its stock market value shrink to a twelfth of its worth three years ago, last year made losses of Pounds 331.1m. If Mr Montague were to be made bankrupt, it would disqualify him from serving as a director of a public company. The Tiphook board has so far remained loyal to its former chairman and present chief executive. It said last night: 'The company regards Mr Montague's private affairs as just that  -private. The company will not comment on speculation until it is presented with the facts.' A banker close to the negotiations said that further discussions may be held between the two sides, but added: 'The banks are pretty fed up with a situation that has dragged on too long.' Mr Montague had wanted to negotiate an individual voluntary agreement, under which he would have sought to pay back his debts over a period of time, but would have been allowed to remain on the board of Tiphook.</p>

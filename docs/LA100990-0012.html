			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: MAKER OF RAM SOUVENIR CAN'T PULL ONE OVER ON THIS FAN  </P> <P> Reader Nick Salata was browsing in the T-shirt section of the Glendale  Sportmart when a "Rams Legends" shirt caught his eye.  </P> <P> He took a careful look at the names and drawings of the 11 legends: Elroy  Hirsch, Tom Fears, Rosey Grier, Marlin McKeever, Tom Mack, Jack Snow, David  (Deacon) Jones, Merlin Olsen, John Cappelletti, Jon Arnett and Bill Munson.  </P> <P> Add T-shirt: Salata said he was tempted to buy the shirt for its comic value,  but decided that $12.96 was too much to pay for elevating quarterback Bill  Munson (No. 11 on the Rams' all-time passing yardage list) to legendary status,  over Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin.  </P> <P> "Besides," Salata said, "it didn't even have Jack Youngblood, although it did  show McKeever as No. 85, Youngblood's number. McKeever was No. 86."  </P> <P> Trivia time: After two games of the American League playoffs, Carney Lansford  has a lifetime playoff batting average of .382 (21 for 55). Who has the highest  playoff batting average for hitters with 50 or more at-bats?  </P> <P> Slam dunkin': Vince Lascheid, the organist at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers  Stadium, was ready for the Cincinnati Reds Monday.  </P> <P> Lascheid played "The Charleston" for Red pitcher Norm Charlton. He played  "What's New Pussycat?" for Red first baseman Hal Morris.  </P> <P> And he played the Dunkin' Donuts jingle for Mariano Duncan, who went three for  five with a home run and four runs batted in in Cincinnati's 6-3 victory.  </P> <P> Sport and society: The Associated Press noted Sunday that it had been 15 years  since ultra-marathon swimmer Diana Nyad tried to swim around Manhattan, only to  call off the attempt after completing 20 of the 28 chilling miles in six hours.  </P> <P> Said Nyad: "I'm amazed that my involvement in such a minor, eccentric sport got  such attention. I suppose in the mid-1970s it was symbolic. Women were making  their mark in sports and my swimming gave respect to the new marathon ethic."  </P> <P> The new what?  </P> <P> Those eastern fans: Steve Kelley, Seattle Times columnist, visited former major  leaguer Larry Parrish on a recent trip to Japan. During the 1989 Japanese  season, Parrish led Cecil Fielder in home runs (42-38) and was leading again  this year before knee problems forced him to retire.  </P> <P> Parrish on Japanses fans: "It sounds more like a college football crowd than a  baseball crowd. They're amazing here. We could be down, 10-1, in the seventh  inning, and they'll still be cheering.  </P> <P> "This definitely isn't Philadelphia."  </P> <P> Priceless remark: Late in the regular season, Pittsburgh center fielder Andy  Van Slyke was batting .405 and had 27 RBIs whenever Doug Drabek was the  Pirates' starting pitcher.  </P> <P> Van Slyke told Pittsburgh writers: "(Drabek) told me he'd give me half of his  Cy Young incentive bonus if he won it. I asked him how much it was, and he  said, 'Nothing.' So I guess I'll get a handshake and a phone call in the  off-season."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Mickey Rivers tops the list at .386, followed by Lansford, Pete  Rose (.381) and Dusty Baker (.371).  </P> <P> Quotebook: Penn State Coach Joe Paterno, on why he doesn't think the drafting  of underclassmen by the NFL will ruin college football: "If our game depends on  young men sacrificing better opportunities, it deserves to go down the drain."

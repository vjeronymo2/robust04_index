			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS SHRINKS 16.5%  </P> <P> Japan's trade surplus shrank 16.5% in July to $5.99 billion, the government  said today, pressured by brisk Japanese domestic demand, lagging U.S. economic  growth and a stronger dollar.  </P> <P> While the July figures were somewhat exaggerated by a firm dollar, economists  said the underlying trend is for smaller surpluses anyway because of a slowing  U.S. economy and continuing robust Japanese domestic consumption.  </P> <P> The July trade surplus declined from $7.18 billion a year earlier, Finance  Ministry figures show.  </P> <P> Japan's surplus with the United States in July contracted to $3.83 billion from  $4.49 billion a year ago.  </P></p>

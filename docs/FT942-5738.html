			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Kenyan charged in central bank fraud Kenyan police charged a local businessman yesterday with cheating the central bank of some 13bn shillings (Pounds 158m), the biggest fraud in Kenya's history, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Prosecutors told Nairobi magistrate's court that Mr Kamlesh Pattni stole from or defrauded the central bank on 36 occasions between April and December 1993. Mr Pattni, 33, pleaded not guilty. Mr Eliphas Riungu and Mr Lazarus Wairagu, who were sacked by the central bank last December, were charged as accomplices. They also pleaded not guilty. Police said they would detain Mr Pattni until Monday when his plea for bail would be heard. The case is unlikely to be heard for several months. Economists said the figure was roughly equal to a sixth of Kenya's annual gross domestic product and was the largest fraud charge since independence from Britain in 1963. It was not immediately known whether the charges were linked to Dollars 210m (Pounds 140m) which Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor, has said was lost in a forward foreign exchange contract with Mr Pattni's Exchange Bank. Bankers says the alleged fraud was discovered last year when the International Monetary Fund questioned why the central bank had two accounts abroad.</p>

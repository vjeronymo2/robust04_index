			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Russian crisis casts shadow and causes yields to rise THE deepening crisis in Russia cast a shadow over the European bond markets yesterday, causing yields to rise across all the main markets. The German bond market was most directly affected by unease over the political uncertainty in Russia. Cash bunds fell back by around a quarter of a point, while the June futures contract on Liffe was trading late in the day at 95.38, down from 95.63 at the opening. The bund market seemed mesmerised both by the events in Russia and by anticipation of this week's repurchase agreement (or repo) auction. Since last week's cut in the discount rate, the market has been looking for a cut of as much as 25 basis points in the repo rate from its current 8.25 per cent, with some optimists expecting even more. Anything less could leave the market seriously questioning the pace at which German rates will fall during this year, with adverse consequences for the bund market, warned Mr Kit Juckes, international analyst at Warburg Securities. FRENCH government bonds were also caught in the fall-out from Russia, but the market gathered some confidence from the firmness of the franc after the weekend's opening round of elections. The early election results merely confirmed the market's expectations, and did little to ease concern that pressure would grow on the French currency in coming weeks. This week's German repo auction could provide an early test. 'If the Bundesbank disappoints, and short rates stay above 11 per cent, the pressure will grow to cut interest rates with the franc outside the ERM,' said Mr Philip Tyson, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. THE UK bond market, meanwhile, lost ground ahead of today's announcement of details of the latest government bond auction. The auction will be of 15-20 year paper, the part of the yield curve which has seen the strongest performance in recent weeks. As a result, longer-dated bonds suffered the biggest losses yesterday, as they did had after the auction was announced on Friday. The reversal in the market was compounded by poor February trade figures with non-EC countries, which showed a sharp pick-up in imports. The 9 per cent gilts due in 2008 lost three-quarters of a point during the day, pushing the yield up to 8.21 per cent, from 8.15 per cent on Friday. Shorter-dated paper also fell back, in part reflecting the fading hopes since last week's Budget of a further cut in UK interest rates. US TREASURY prices firmed slightly in fairly light late trading yesterday, with shorter-dated maturities buoyed by reports of political instability in Russia. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104 5/32 , yielding 6.795 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note firmed  3/32 , to yield 3.874 per cent. Later this week, the market will have to digest new supply, when the Treasury sells Dollars 15.25bn in two-year notes tomorrow and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes on Thursday. ITALY'S Association of Interbank dealers and Treasurers (ATIC) plans to launch a contract to hedge domestic interbank deposits, Reuter reports. ATIC hopes the contract could be up and running in September, with technical specifications ready by June. A three-month Eurolira bond contract already trades on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.</p>

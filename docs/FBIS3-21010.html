			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Airbus: Air Inter to Buy the A319"] </F>   [Text] AIR INTER has decided to order nine A319s from  AIRBUS INDUSTRIE for delivery between July 1996 and mid-1997,  plus nine options. The A319 is the short version of the A320  and has many common features with the latter and with the  stretch version A321, particularly systems and equipment. This  makes for many maintenance and operational advantages and hence,  economy. The cockpit of the A319 will be identical to that of  the A320 and A321. Crews too will need one blanket type  qualification to fly any of the three types. At present, AIR  INTER flies 33 A320s. The airline has also ordered seven A321s  for delivery starting this summer plus 15 wide-body A330s, the  first of which was delivered on 30 December and entered service  on 17 January on the Paris-Marseille and Paris-Toulouse  connections. By February 1995, AIR INTER will receive four more  A330s. The A330 also shares a strong family resemblance with  the single-aisle versions made by AIRBUS INDUSTRIE. AIR INTER's  A319s will be fitted out for 142 single class passengers. To  date, AIRBUS INDUSTRIE has booked 802 orders for its  single-aisle line (A319/A320/A321).</p>

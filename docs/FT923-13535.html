			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Housebuilders warn Lamont of crisis A GROUP of Britain's larger housebuilders are expected this week to write to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to warn him of the deepening crisis in the industry. The group, which is thought to contain most of the 20 largest housebuilders, is concerned at the continuing low level of sales, which they say are impeding recovery in prices. These have fallen on average by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in southern England and East Anglia since the end of 1988. The largest companies are also considering seeking a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, so grave do they believe conditions have become in the construction industry generally. The letter to the chancellor is expected to urge the government to take measures to stimulate the economy, which many builders fear is moving from recession to slump. It is also likely to raise concern over people trapped in homes that are now worth less than the mortgages raised to pay for them. Builders are also unhappy at the Treasury decision to reimpose stamp duty next month on house purchases under Pounds 250,000. They regard the move as unhelpful at this point in the housing market. They say that sales have become increasingly difficult during recent months, in spite of the outcome of the general election which had been expected to encourage greater confidence among purchasers by the removal of political uncertainty. Instead, sales have continued to languish during what is normally one of the busiest selling periods of the year, before the school summer holidays.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Unit trust sales fall sharply Sales of unit trusts fell sharply last month to a net Pounds 470.7m, the second-lowest figure this year and almost 40 per cent down on August's net sales of Pounds 767.1m. Sales for the third quarter were also down, to Pounds 1.88bn from Pounds 2.81bn the previous quarter. The third quarter is traditionally one of the weakest for sales but the figure was also substantially lower than the corresponding period last year when net sales totalled Pounds 2.61bn. However, net sales of unit trusts for the year are still higher than for the same period last year.</p>

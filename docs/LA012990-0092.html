			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INVASION VIOLATED WORLD LAW, JAMAICAN LEADER TELLS QUAYLE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle's three-day mission to help repair damage to ties  with Latin America ended on a sour note today with Jamaican Prime Minister  Michael Manley telling him the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel A.  Noriega violated international law.  </P> <P> "We exchanged views on Panama and we are friends, but friends do not always  agree," Manley told reporters after a meeting with Quayle.  </P> <P> Quayle was greeted warmly in Panama on Sunday by many Panamanians who told him  they were thankful the United States had stepped in to oust Noriega.  </P> <P> But today, Manley, while condemning Noriega as a "menace" to the region, said  his ouster in the U.S. invasion violated world law.  </P> <P> He said that while opposing Noriega, "we also feel very strongly about the  principles of sovereignty and the principles that are involved by the invasion  of one country by another."  </P> <P> "We made it clear . . . that we do not agree with the invasion," Manley said of  talks he described as "frank and useful" -- diplomatic jargon for blunt.  </P> <P> White House officials have acknowledged privately that ambitious plans for  Quayle's diplomatic mission had to be abandoned after most of Latin America,  including U.S. neighbor Mexico, refused to welcome a visit so soon after the  invasion.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSAULTS ON WOMEN, 'RAPE LISTS' ALTER BROWN UNIVERSITY POLICY  </P> <P> Student outcry over sexual assaults on women and anonymously posted lists of  alleged male rapists on bathroom walls has prompted Brown University to require  special orientation seminars starting next fall for freshmen, an official said  Friday.  </P> <P> The Ivy League university will also see to it that every student who comes  forward with an assault or harassment complaint is provided with a trained  advocate who will follow their case through, said Robert Reichley, executive  vice president.  </P> <P> "The fact of the matter is there have been many mechanisms by which woman who  have suffered any kind of assault or harassment could bring their case  forward," Reichley said.  </P> <P> "What we are trying to do most is make sure that henceforth . . . we are going  to, in addition, provide an advocate. That person will be there to provide help  and counseling to whoever wishes to pursue a case," he said.  </P> <P> The steps are being taken in the wake of a stormy forum on campus last week in  which members of the audience -- most of them women -- criticized university  officials for being insensitive and indifferent to the issues of sexual assault  and harassment.  </P> <P> Much of the controversy that led to the forum came from an anonymously authored  "rape list" that has appeared repeatedly on the walls of bathrooms on campus.  </P> <P> The list has contained as many as 30 names of male students who women allege  raped them. In turn, men who have been named have complained to the university,  although administration officials say there is little they can do because the  charges against them have been made anonymously.  </P> <P> Reichley said the university sympathizes with the anger that women on campus  feel, but he said the school in no way condones the list. Janitors have been  scrubbing the list away when they find it and will continue to do so, he said.  </P> <P> "It is no more fair and just for women to write on a wall accusing men of a  serious crime, and to do so anonymously, than it is for men to write the names  of women on restroom walls and suggest they are available," Reichley said.  </P> <P> Reichley said the university will issue a lengthier announcement Monday on  steps it plans to take regarding sexual assault and harassment on campus.  </P></p>

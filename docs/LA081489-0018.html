			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> About 700 Rolling Stones fans who had paid $3 each got to hear the legendary  band jam for an hour Saturday night when the group launched its 1989 tour with  an unpublicized appearance at a small New Haven, Conn., club. The band opened  the 11-song set at Toad's Place with "Start Me Up" and played several songs  from their new album, "Steel Wheels," which is to be released Aug. 29. The show  also featured several Stones' classics, including, "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Honky  Tonk Woman," "Brown Sugar," and "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll." Word that the Stones  were going to play at Toad's had leaked out over the last several days, and  hundreds of fans were turned away before the Stones took the stage at 10:45  p.m. The Stones have traditionally opened new tours with impromptu shows at  small venues. The tour resumes in Philadelphia on Aug. 31.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Yorkshire Water Yorkshire Water's strategy to increase its presence in the clinical waste sector gathered momentum yesterday with the purchase of Dyvell (Holdings) for Pounds 5.2m. Mr Jonson Cox, managing director of Yorkshire Environmental, said the addition of Dyvell would propel the clinical waste division into the 'number one slot' with a market share of between 20 and 25 per cent. Dyvell is, in effect, a start-up business with just one incinerator and several contracts to build further facilities to process clinical waste for health authorities and hospital trusts. The threat of increased environmental regulation from the EC and loss of crown immunity in the UK mean that trusts and authorities are seeking improved methods of disposal. Some Pounds 30m is budgeted for investment in new incinerators for the enlarged division. This will mean that the clinical waste operation is unlikely to produce a profit for about two years. The group further strengthened its business with the Pounds 6.1m purchase of a profitable environmental laboratory group in the Netherlands. Yorkshire will integrate this with ALcontrol, its existing laboratory business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 19 May -- By today's decrees Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk has reorganized the power ministries  [defense, interior, and internal affairs] of the Republic of  Crimea, despite the fact that he does not have a constitutional  right to do so.    Main directorates will be set up on the basis of the  Ukrainian Security Service and the Interior Ministry. They will  be subordinated directly to the Ukrainian Security Service  chairman and the Ukrainian Interior Minister. Administrative  and service premises, armaments, means of transport, and  property which in the past were used by the Security Service and  the Interior Ministry of the Republic of Crimea are being handed  over to them.    Major General Ivan Kolomitsev has been appointed by Leonid  Kravchuk as chief of the main directorate of the Ukrainian  security service in Crimea.    ITAR-TASS has learned that by decision of the Cabinet of  Ministers, an additional post of deputy minister and chief of  the Main Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea has been  introduced onto the staff of the central apparatus of the  Ukrainian Interior Ministry. Militia Colonel Valeriy Chernyshov  has been appointed to this post.    By decree of the Ukrainian president, the Ministry of  Justice  of the Republic of Crimea has also been reorganized into the  main directorate of justice in the Crimea. From now on it will  be subordinate to the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Acquisitions boost Bombardier BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group building shuttle wagons for the Channel tunnel between England and France, reported sharply higher revenues and earnings for the third quarter and at nine months, partly due to consolidation of two recent acquisitions. All segments of the business contributed higher sales and operating profit, except transit equipment which was affected by problems with the CDollars 650m (USDollars 505m) tunnel contract.

Bombardier, which includes Canadair, Short Brothers of Belfast and Learjet of the US in its aerospace group, where the total order backlog is nearly CDollars 5bn.

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: AMWEST INSURANCE GROUP EXPECTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS  </P> <P> Amwest Insurance Group, a Woodland Hills provider of bail bonds and other  surety bonds, said it expects to report a loss of between $750,000 and $1  million for the fourth quarter of 1989.  </P> <P> Amwest blamed the deficit in part on numerous claims made against contractors'  bonds underwritten by Amwest.  </P> <P> When it issues such bonds, Amwest promises to pay to finish a construction  project if the contractor can't finish it for any reason. The bonds at issue  were partially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, but the  claims still helped produce a loss, Amwest said.  </P> <P> The loss also will reflect additional reserves that Amwest has been setting  aside because of Proposition 103, an insurance-reform measure whose  implementation is still being debated by state authorities. A key part of the  measure is a rollback in customers' premiums, and Amwest has created the  reserves in the event it must pay rebates.  </P> <P> For all of 1989, Amwest said, it expects to post a profit of $1.31 million to  $1.59 million, down from earnings of $3.62 million in 1988. The exact figures  should be released in mid-February, Amwest said.  </P></p>

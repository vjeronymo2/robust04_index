			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> TRAILERS FOR THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> Santa Monica may receive 10 trailers to serve as shelters for homeless people  -- if officials can find a place to park them.  </P> <P> City Councilman David Finkel said the trailers will be supplied by Los Angeles,  which acquired several of the portable shelters last year but ran into  neighborhood opposition when trying to place them.  </P> <P> Finkel said he anticipated similar resistance once Santa Monica pinpoints a  place for the trailers. Nevertheless, he said the plan represents a "wonderful  opportunity" for the city to help the homeless.  </P> <P> Members of the Chamber of Commerce are helping Finkel in his search for a site  where the trailers can be parked. One goal is to relocate to the trailers some  of the transients who live in Palisades Park.  </P></p>

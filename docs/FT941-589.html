			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts rebound as crude oil prices fall UK government bonds rebounded by around 1 1/2 points at the long end yesterday morning as a fall in crude oil prices following Opec's decision not to cut output helped to quell fears of rising inflation in the UK, analysts said. They added that last week's steep decline in gilt prices sparked some light buying of cash gilts across the yield curve early in the day. The rise in gilts helped to cut the semi-annual yield differential between 10-year gilts and 10-year German government bonds to around 143 basis points from 153 basis points on Friday. However, gilts had surrendered some of their gains by the afternoon as investors who had been seeking to lighten their holdings used yesterday's short-lived rally to do just that. Mr Simon Briscoe, gilts analyst at S. G. Warburg, said the early rebound in prices did not come as a surprise but that it was not enough to restore investor confidence. 'The market remains riddled with nervousness and uncertainty,' he said. However, Mr Briscoe said the shortage of ultra-long dated gilts helped them to outperform other maturities, with the yield on the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 dropping by 15 basis points. By contrast, yields at the short end only fell by six basis points, traders said. The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe touched a high of 107 1/2 in good volume before dropping back to 106 15/32 in the late afternoon, for a gain of  3/4 points on the day. Italian government bonds surged by nearly three points yesterday on rumours that the right-wing alliance headed by the media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, would win enough votes in the general election to be able to form a government. The strength of the lira helped to fuel the rally, traders said. They said the rumours were based on leaked private exit polls taken during Sunday's voting. However, they added that the outcome of the election, which was still going on yesterday, was far from certain. One trader warned that caution could soon return to the market, especially when investors took a closer look at the 'tax cuts for growth' policies of the right-wing alliance. The June contract of the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe rocketed to 112.67 before trading at 111.60 in the late afternoon, up 1.71 points on the day. German government bonds drew strength from the release of German inflation data for the month to mid-March, which were in line with expectations, and from market hopes that the Bundesbank would announce a further easing of between five and eight basis points in its repo rate this week. The June contract of the bund future on Liffe stood 0.53 points higher in late trading at 96.32. Denmark's decision to introduce a 30-year government bond has unsettled Copenhagen's mortgage bond market, traders said. The 30-year government bond will be launched on April 6 with a 6 per cent coupon and will extend the yield curve from the current limit of 10 years. Last year, Denmark's mortgage credit institutions introduced a 30-year series with a 6 per cent coupon. The mortgage bonds proved attractive and outstanding volume rose to about DKr160bn. However, traders said non-residents appeared to have been selling the 30-year mortgage bonds with a view to re-investing in the 30-year government bond. In general, Danish bonds prices recovered in line with other European bond markets, with the price of 2026 mortgage bonds moving up from Friday's 84.30 to 85.55 and the 8 per cent government bond due 2003 rising from 106.95 to 107.80. US Treasury bonds were firmer yesterday as flagging commodity prices brought a measure of cheer to the market after a week of sustained weakness. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at 90 31/32 . The yield eased to 6.968 per cent, after ending Friday's session above 7.00 per cent for the first time in 10 months. At the short end, the two-year note inched  1/32 ahead to 100, yielding 5.108 per cent. The weekend brought a welcome break in a steady stream of bad news for the US Treasury market. At its Geneva meeting, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised the prospect of lower oil prices when its members decided to extend the current production ceiling, rather than reduce output. The positive scenario for inflation-sensitive fixed-rate investments was given immediate support yesterday. In trading on the New York Merchantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery closed over a dollar lower at Dollars 14.08 a barrel. Prices for gold and non-oil commodities were also showing big declines. However, after last week's protracted weakness, the modest rebound in bonds was hardly encouraging. Traders appeared to be looking ahead to a batch of crucial economic figures to be released later in the week. In particular, the market was awaiting March employment data due out on Friday. The report will provide hard evidence of the extent to which the economy has slowed in the first quarter, after an unsettling growth spurt in the final three months of 1993.</p>

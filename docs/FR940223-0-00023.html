			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _If a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the geographic area of the State in which the claimant resides or, if the claimant is not a resident of a State, in which the hearing officer holds the disability hearing; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The designated geographic service area of the Office of Hearings and Appeals hearing office having responsibility for providing the hearing before an ALJ. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In cases in which a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the hearing officer travels to the State in which the claimant resides to hold the hearing. In those infrequent cases in which the claimant is not a resident of a State, the Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing in a location in a State that is convenient for the claimant and the hearing officer. With respect to these cases, the final regulations define the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing to mean the geographic area of the State in which the claimant resides or, if the claimant is not a resident of a State, in which the hearing officer holds the disability hearing. This definition is consistent with the congressional intent underlying section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990 in that it treats the claimant and his or her representative in the same manner as if a State agency hearing officer held the disability hearing. In the final title II regulations relating to cases in which a Federal disability hearing officer holds the disability hearing, the term ``State'' has the meaning assigned to it in current &sect;404.2(c)(5), except that the term also includes the Northern Mariana Islands. In the final title XVI regulations relating to such cases, the term ``State'' means a State as defined in current &sect;416.120(c)(9). This definition of ``State'' in the final title XVI regulations &sect;416.1498(d)(3)(i)(B), was omitted from the text of the proposed rules, although it was discussed in the preamble to those rules (58 FR 4950, 4951). Its inclusion in the final rules represents a technical correction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are basing the maximum amount allowable on the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area. We will determine the maximum amount allowable for travel between these two points under the existing regulations, i.e., subject to the existing limitations in paragraph (d)(1) and paragraph (d)(3) (herein to be redesignated as paragraph (d)(4)) of &sect;&sect;404.999c and 416.1498 (relating to travel within the United States and a claimant's request for a change to a more distant hearing site) and pursuant to the applicable rules governing rates and conditions of payment under paragraphs (a) through (c) of &sect;&sect;404.999c and 416.1498. Under our existing regulations, we will not reimburse a representative's travel expenses unless the distance he or she travels, i.e., the distance to the hearing site from the representative's residence or office (whichever he or she travels from), exceeds 75 miles (&sect;&sect;404.999c(d)(2) and 416.1498(d)(2)). The final regulations provide a similar limitation. Under the final rules, we will use the point within the appropriate geographic area that is the farthest point from the hearing site as the representative's travel origination point (equivalent to residence or office under the existing regulations) for purposes of determining the maximum amount allowable for reimbursement. The final rules provide that if the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area does not exceed 75 miles, we will not reimburse a representative for any travel expenses. This is consistent with the 75-mile rule in the current regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the final regulations, actual reimbursement for a representative's travel expenses is limited to the lesser of: (1) Actual travel expenses incurred and allowable under the regulations (whether travel actually originates within the designated geographic area or outside that area); or (2) the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from the farthest point within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

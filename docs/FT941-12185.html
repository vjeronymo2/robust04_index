			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Part-timers hit the exchequer's pocket: Philip Coggan, in the third of a series on the tax base, looks at changes in the labour market The changes in the UK labour market during recent years have been much trumpeted - the old pattern of males working from nine to five, five days a week, is no longer the norm. New jobs, when created, are increasingly part-time or involve self-employment and are often taken by women. The implications of this for Britain's tax base have not received much attention, but the change in working practices could be a factor in the government's funding difficulties. A number of the 'supply-side reforms' made by the Thatcher administration were designed to encourage the growth of part-time and low-paid employment. But the proportion of the income of part-time workers taken in tax will be smaller than from their full-time colleagues because of the system of allowances. For example, an individual can earn Pounds 3,445 a year before paying income tax, and in the 1993-94 tax year pays a rate of only 20 per cent on the next Pounds 2,500 of income. The effect of this can be quite substantial. While an individual earning a salary of Pounds 12,000 will pay Pounds 2,001.25 in tax, two people earning Pounds 6,000 a year each will pay a combined total of just Pounds 1,002.50. Similar shortfalls can occur with National Insurance. In the current tax year, employees only start paying National Insurance when they earn Pounds 56 a week. Once they pass that threshold, they pay 2 per cent on the first Pounds 56 and 9 per cent thereafter (up to Pounds 420 a week). So an individual earning Pounds 12,000 a year will pay Pounds 876 in National Insurance contributions; two people earning Pounds 6,000 each will pay a combined NI bill of just Pounds 672. Furthermore, any employee who works fewer than 15 hours a week does not have to be covered by employers' National Insurance. There is thus a strong cost incentive for employers to keep working hours below that level. The impact of replacing full-time workers with part-timers might be even greater than the above example suggests. Replacing one full-time employee with two part-time employees working the same hours may reduce the overall salary bill. As Mr Steven Webb of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out: 'Part-timers not only work fewer hours, they get lower rates for doing so.' Over the past decade, there has been a gradual substitution of female for male, and part-time for full-time, workers. According to the Department of Employment, in March 1983 there were 9.05m female employees (excluding the self-employed, the armed forces and those on government training schemes); in September 1993, there were 10.55m. During the same period the number of males in employment fell from 11.98m to 10.88m. Meanwhile, between March 1983 and September 1993, the number of people in part-time employment rose from 3.96m to 5.5m, while those working full-time fell from 16.57m to 15.39m. A further development is the growth of self-employment, which has risen from 2.21m to 2.99m between the above dates. Schedule D revenues (which reflect tax on the self-employed) have gradually been increasing their proportionate contribution to income tax receipts. But the self-employed have a more generous National Insurance system and have more opportunity to offset expenses against their tax bills. They are likely to pay less taxes than salaried individuals with the same earnings. Not all the arguments run in the same direction. It may be that labour-market flexibility and the growth of self-employment will bring more people into the workforce than would otherwise have been the case. If the economy is working more efficiently, both output and tax revenues will be increased by the changes. Furthermore, the tax philosophy of the Thatcher government, to reduce headline rates while eliminating allowances, may have increased overall revenue by bringing more people into the tax net. A good example would be the taxation of company cars. The switch from direct to indirect taxation also means that part-time workers are simply paying tax by a different route. Nevertheless, the logical implication of the labour market changes is that a pick-up in growth could generate less additional income tax revenue than in the past. If so, those in full-time employment will need to bear the greater burden of direct taxation, and the government could find that growth does not so automatically lead to tax cuts, as in the 1980s.</p>

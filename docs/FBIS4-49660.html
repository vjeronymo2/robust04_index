			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stanley Tcheung and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation, headed  by Hsu Hui-yu, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF), Monday [9 May] met with mainland authorities  to discuss the March 31 Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan  tourists were robbed and murdered.    This was the first time since the crime that SEF officials  and crime experts were allowed to visit the mainland to probe  the investigation into the incident, which has frozen  Taiwan-mainland ties.    Hsu said his delegation, comprised of victims' relatives,  lawyers and forensic scientists, hopes mainland authorities will  reveal all the facts pertaining to the crime.    "Only by doing so can the fragile Taiwan-mainland ties  return  to normal," Hsu said.    Mainland authorities Monday turned down the Taiwan mission's  request to see autopsy reports and instead showed them slides  and taped records about the condition of the bodies.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  (ARATS), SEF's mainland counterpart, also rejected the mission's  demand to interview the four men arrested for their alleged  involvement in the crime. SEF and ARATS are non-official  conduits for mainland-Taiwan relations.    ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li Yafei, who was among the  mainland officials meeting with the Taiwan delegation, said  people in the mainland feel as sad as the people in Taiwan do  about the accident and the mainland authorities have tried their  utmost to crack the case.    According to a report by the Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO, Wu  Liming, a suspect who was charged for complicity in the crime,  works for the Hangzhou armed police.    All 32 passengers and crew aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao  Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang were found burnt to  death in a small room in the boat on April 1. Luggage and other  belongings were missing.    Although mainland authorities arrested the four suspects and  said they have tried their best to investigate the accident, Hsu  said many suspicions surrounding the incident remain.    News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the  Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters,  especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene.  Relatives of the victims, who were furious over the autopsies  carried out without their consent, were confined in their  hotels, and SEF officials were three times refused permission to  visit the mainland to probe the case.    Taiwan has since suspended cultural and educational  exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its  economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's  inappropriate handling of the incident.</p>

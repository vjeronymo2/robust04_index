			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Procter seeks to excel with a new formula: Fairy Liquid's market dominance has been challenged / P&amp;G's response is far from mild THE BATTLE for dominance in the market for washing-up liquid has produced one of the subtlest though most significant brand-name shifts this year. Procter &amp; Gamble has decided to abandon its market-leading Fairy Liquid brand name and call its new washing-up liquid Fairy Excel. The change is small - designed to retain a successful brand name that first appeared in the shops 32 years ago - but there is a lot at stake. P&amp;G was the biggest-spending television advertiser in Europe last year. The trade periodical Euromarketing says P&amp;G spent Dollars 486m promoting 11 large brands in the European Community's six biggest markets. In the UK alone, P&amp;G spent an estimated Pounds 70.5m on advertising last year - Pounds 10m of it on Fairy Liquid, which had UK sales of Pounds 61m. The Fairy Liquid brand is sold in 10 countries, from Finland to Saudi Arabia  -Fairy Excel has already been launched in Germany. P&amp;G, a marketing-driven giant and one of the most secretive of multinationals, has achieved a dominating 42 per cent share of the UK market with Fairy Liquid. Two years ago P&amp;G's rival, Lever Brothers, piggy-backed on Persil, its successful washing powder brand, launching a new washing-up detergent, Persil Liquid. Lever spent an estimated Pounds 4m on television advertising for the new brand in its first five months. But according to marketing industry estimates Persil Liquid has taken no more than an 18 per cent market share. P&amp;G is spending about 16p on advertising for every Pounds 1 in sales while Lever Brothers is spending at almost twice that rate. So if Fairy Liquid remains the first-choice brand for those who do not have a dishwasher, why fiddle, albeit mildly, with a powerful brand name? P&amp;G makes a point of not disclosing any information it regards as commercially sensitive. 'Anything inquiring into our marketing and research we regard as confidential information and we are not prepared to disclose reasons why,' was the official comment yesterday . But part of the reason for the new brand name lies in P&amp;G's marketing philosophy - that it must never even be seen to be challenged. An important factor may have been decisions by the Independent Television Association's copy clearance executives, who monitor the content and claims of every television advertisement to cut claims which are demonstrably false. When Persil Liquid was launched the committee examined its claims of product superiority and allowed its advertising campaign to go ahead. Mr Alan Mitchell, editor of Marketing magazine, said: 'Procter's bible is keeping a definable and demonstrable performance gap of consumer benefits - 'we give a better product to the consumer and shout about it'.' The response from P&amp;G was swift. Within two weeks of the launch of Persil Liquid P&amp;G staged a big price promotion in all retail outlets, giving a two-for-the-price-of-one offer on Fairy Liquid. P&amp;G also speeded technological improvements to its detergent. Initially it brought out a new formula Fairy and the copy clearance committee carefully assessed its claims for the new formula, and again did not refuse to allow the claims to be made. Mr Mitchell said: 'The committee finally said: 'It's a nil-all draw, neither is superior'. The entire raison d'etre of the P&amp;G marketing bible had been swept away.' P&amp;G had to make a comeback by using its other strength - product innovation. That innovation is a detergent P&amp;G says shifts 50 per cent more grease, but with a molecular structure which penetrates skin less readily. According to Mr Mitchell, P&amp;G has scored a marketing success with its new brand name. 'It's very clever. They have changed the name, which focuses on the fact they have a new product . . .a demonstrably better product.' At the same time the look of the branding will still be dominated by the comfortably familiar word Fairy. P&amp;G will not say how much it has invested in research and development of the new liquid. But the cost of the battle for brand leadership is heavy. Fairy Excel promises softer hands. P&amp;G's hands are still punching. P&amp;G sells assets, Page 19</p>

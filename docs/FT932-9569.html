			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Collective panic will not help The great British historian, Thomas Macaulay, knew 'of no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality'. There is, however, one almost as ridiculous: the Tories in one of their fits of collective panic. The near hysteria with which many MPs, ministers and, above all, the Tory media, have reacted to the shock government by-election and local election defeats in mid-parliament, were to be predicted. But the phenomenon is all too familiar. Unfortunately, my memory goes back to the losses of Torrington and Orpington to the Liberals under Harold Macmillan. Such results tell us nothing about the result of the next election. Forecasting the next election is as unreliable an activity as forecasting the timing of economic 'green shoots'. How far do economic factors explain what has happened? Not nearly as much as supposed. Various indicators have been tried to explain government popularity. All have succumbed to Goodhart's Law; as soon as a measure is used as a policy target, it lets us down. The least unpromising is real personal disposable income because it is comprehensive, taking in benefits as well as pay, and allows for taxes and inflation. It has proved remarkably steady in the medium term. The average annual increase has fluctuated at about 2 1/2 to 3 per cent - from which between a  1/4 and  1/2 per cent should be deducted to get disposable income per capita. Straight-laced economists have often regarded these increases as too high, because they have not left enough over for investment and exports. Nevertheless, when real personal income growth has been much below these rates it has tended to bounce back, while much higher increases have proved unsustainable. The achievement of relatively high rates of growth of this variable has never been a sufficient condition of government re-election. The first Wilson government was defeated in 1970 in spite of an above-trend increase in its last full year of office. The Heath government was defeated in 1974 in spite of an extraordinarily high increase of 6.4 per cent in its own last year, and an average of 5 per cent over its whole term. Lord Callaghan was defeated in 1979 in spite of an even more extraordinary growth rate of 7.7 per cent in real incomes in 1978. One is tempted to say that a reasonably good growth of real income is not a sufficient, but a necessary, condition of re-election. Even this comes up against the fact that John Major was re-elected last year in spite of a  1/2 per cent fall in disposable incomes in the recession year of 1991. A mechanical analysis might say that the present prime minister benefited from the achievement of the normal 2 1/2 per cent a year average real income growth over the 1987-92 parliament. But it is more realistic to suggest that he benefited both from distrust of Labour and the widespread feeling that there had already been a change of government when he took over from Lady Thatcher. At any rate a recovery to 2 1/4 per cent in disposable income growth in 1992 - well ahead of general economic recovery - did not prevent the political losses of a week ago. There is one negative feature of which one can be confident: the futility of cliche populist reactions such as a cabinet reshuffle or replacing the chancellor. The problems remain the same; the officials analysing them remain the same. There is just Whitehall gossip about the new occupant, whether he reads his briefs, rewrites speeches and so on. The odds are that a new chancellor - after an initial period of tough-sounding reassurance of the financial markets - would be more tempted than Norman Lamont to make gestures in the direction of cheap money and plenty of it, and avoiding the fiscal changes required to eliminate the structural budget deficit. The present chancellor has everything to gain and nothing to lose from sticking to sound money policies. The time for a symbolic change at No 11 has gone. None of this means that we should pass over in silence the handling of Britain's membership of, and departure from, the exchange rate mechanism - which remains abysmal, whether one was a supporter or an opponent of membership. Incompetence by one's own side is less forgivable than incompetence by the other. Nor is it made more tolerable if one shared as a bystander in some of the mistakes. But simply putting a new face in the Treasury would achieve less than nothing. What is needed is a public inquiry into the full chain of events, covering prime minister as well as chancellor, officials as well as ministers, Bank of England as well as Treasury. Any inquiry would have to go back at least to the choice of entry parity in 1990 without properly consulting the German authorities; the failure to rethink the parity when a combination of events made it less appropriate; the ignoring of the warning signals given by the divergence indicator - when the government refused either to raise interest rates or to realign; the conduct of the notorious Bath finance ministers' meeting; the failure of communication with the Bundesbank in the days before Black Wednesday last September; and the official surprise at the extent of the run on sterling in a foreign exchange market with a daily turnover running into hundreds of billions. A model might be the Franks Committee investigation of the events leading up to the seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Although this had anodyne conclusions, the narrative was revealing and accepted by both opponents and supporters of the Falklands war. Meanwhile, the biggest obstacle to the improvement of UK economic policy is the failure of free-market and sound money Conservatives to understand the arguments for institutional reform and for more use of rules rather than government discretion. This was a cause central to Friedrich Hayek, who died just over a year ago and whom such leaders claim to revere. (The proceedings of a conference held to commemorate the first anniversary of Hayek's death will be published by Macmillan in spring 1994. S F Frowen (ed) Hayek: The Economist and Social Philosopher; A Critical Retrospective.) At a recent lunch I heard the go-go New Zealand finance minister Ruth Richardson take legitimate pride in a 1 per cent inflation rate - the lowest in the OECD, and which was at last being accompanied by healthy growth. She did not fail to pay tribute to one of her Labour predecessors, Sir Roger Douglas, for establishing the independent Reserve Bank, which had made this achievement possible. A British cabinet minister was present, one of the few with untarnished reputation. Instead of inquiring further how an independent central bank can fit into a British-type parliamentary democracy, he just asked why it was necessary if the government displayed enough will-power. How can one begin on the fallacies in this simple question? Who knows where this minister will be in a year or two, and whether his will is going to prevail or not? Heroic acts of will-power are an unreliable, and even undesirable, basis for constitutional democracy. All the great exponents of limited government, from John Locke to the founders of the US Constitution and onwards, have called for institutions which will do least damage when manned by people of common-or-garden ability and morality. The point about an independent central bank is not that its governors are better or cleverer or more heroic than parliamentarians, but that, given the right constitution or contract, they have every incentive to achieve stable prices. Parliamentarians rightly have a multiplicity of objectives and time horizons. The quality of Conservative thinking was better in the 1970s - when reacting to Labour in office - than today, when the leaders squabble about which of them are to be the masters.</p>

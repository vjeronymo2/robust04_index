			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F> program]    [Text] At a news conference this morning, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai commented on President Bill Clinton's  remark earlier in the morning on the United States' willingness  to resume talks with the DPRK. He said:    [Begin Kumagai recording] We welcome the present move toward  the U.S.-DPRK talks. We would like to continue to maintain  close cooperation with the countries concerned to strongly urge  North Korea to demonstrate by its actual behavior that it  observes the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and will fully  implement the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]  safeguards agreement. [end recording]    Kumagai also said that until the DPRK accepts nuclear  inspections, it is necessary to consider various measures,  including sanctions, at the UN Security Council.</p>

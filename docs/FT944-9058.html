			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Transport links set for EU priority Two additional transport projects in Britain are to be added to the European Union's list of priority schemes under its programme of trans-European networks, Charles Batchelor writes. The West Coast Line between London and Glasgow and a road connection across Wales and southern England to the Channel tunnel have been added to the original list of 11 projects. Local authorities along the route of the West Coast Line had been lobbying the government to add it to the list. Plans are being prepared for a Pounds 500m upgrade of the 30-year-old track and signalling. The schemes on the priority list will be put for final approval to the EU summit to be held in Essen, Germany, next month. The trans-European networks are intended to form strategic transport links across the continent. They will be eligible for EU help with feasibility studies and other funding.</p>

Zhu said China and Japan have gained "a historical  opportunity" to further develop ties as China is now striving  for a shift to market economy from the traditional planed  economy, the officials said.    He made the remarks when he was lunching with Yoshio  Sakurauchi, head of the Japanese Association for the Promotion  of International Trade.    The vice premier spoke highly of the association for having  made "precious contributions" to the strengthening of Japan's  trade and economic ties with China, they said.    In a separate meeting, Zhu briefed a group of leading  Japanese bankers on the current economic situation in China and  its reforms on finance and taxation.    In the evening, he dined with leaders from six organizations  for Japan-China friendship and called on them to continue their  efforts to help solidify bilateral relations, the officials said.    Earlier in the day, he met Japan's International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, State Minister for Economic  Planning Manae Kubota and former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe.    Zhu arrived here Wednesday [23 February] for a nine-day  visit. He is leaving Tokyo Saturday for western and southwestern  Japan to take a first-hand look at corporate activities there.</p>

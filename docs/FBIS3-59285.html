			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ming Hua (2494 5478): "Criminal Gangs Grow </F> Internally and Infiltrate Abroad"]    [Text] Clan power controls village and township  enterprises, has command over the local economic lifelines, and  creates local criminal gangs of its very own kind.    Many Hong Kong and Taiwan criminal gangs extend their  operations to the mainland; they directly or indirectly build up  their power. "Investment" is the protective coloration that  allows them to establish bases.    In addition to the well organized activities of underground  criminal gangs in the big cities, gang activities on the Chinese  mainland--characterized by clan power--are now extending to many  towns and townships. Especially in areas where town and township  enterprises have had a good start, these gangs have gradually  become a dominating one-sided power, as they claim to work for  the interests of the clan.  <H5>  Control of the Rural Economy by Clan Power </H5>   GAIGE SHIBAO once reported that it was discovered that  control of part of the rural enterprises in Anhui Province was  completely in the hands of certain big families. Certain clans  monopolized the positions of heads of townships, towns, and  villages. Anyone of a different clan seeking work in the  enterprises was up against all kinds of difficulties, and the  distribution of wages and other benefits was decided  unilaterally by the head of the clan in question. Such clan  power conglomerates also had their own law enforcement  personnel. Anyone who would violate the "clan rules" or would  not follow orders, would suffer physical punishment. The only  way for weaker and smaller families and clans is to submit to  the bullying and the willful oppression by the powerful clans.  In some rural factories, they forcibly seized all incoming  orders and business contacts, and that has led to quarrels  between some clans and even fighting with weapons. Local  government and police are always very much afraid to get  involved in such cases because the so-called "local snakes"  [gang bosses] are too powerful. Some clan forces hold most of  the administrative leadership power in the villages and  townships and have command over the economic lifelines of the  areas in question. In September of 1991, the bloody "7  September" riots that occurred in Qinghai Province and that  shocked and frightened the central authorities, were also caused  by different clans fighting for local farming and grazing  resources. At the start of the riots, the public security  authorities found it impossible to effectively intervene, and  after the event they asked clan chiefs and local notables to  mediate. There had to be no pressuring, only a peaceful  procedure could do it in order not to evoke anti-government  sentiment.    Starting this year, officialdom is sounding off all its  propaganda instruments to create momentum for starting the Three  Gorges project and to prepare public opinion for the large scale  resettlement of population from the reservoir site. The  propaganda is mostly praising the transferees at the reservoir  area for the way they support the government project, and for  the way they are willing to "give their homes to the  government." However, in actual fact, according to the  revelations of a nongovernment newspaper in Wuhan, resettlement  of people from Fengdu, Zhenxi, and other transfer areas in  Sichuan is meeting with great resistance. Main resistance comes  from the clan forces, now agglomerated into one force and not  averse to getting into clashes with government personnel. The  purpose pursued by this kind of clan power is not the commission  of criminal acts, but rather the protection of the people's  homesteads, of course also hope of gaining more benefits from  the transfer. Whenever faced with this kind of a situation, the  special work team in charge of population resettlement had to go  to great trouble buying over or persuading the various clan  chiefs. It has to be acknowledged, though, that the inflation of  clan power in the villages has created a new pattern of its own  among the local gangs.  <H5>  Criminal Societies Encroaching on Religious Organizations </H5>   Now that there is strong popular demand for religious  freedom, it is a matter of great concern for officialdom that  more and more common people have taken to various religious  activities, breaching the "three freedoms" policy of officialdom  as far as it concerns religion, and weakening the centripetal  force in politics. But an even greater concern is that the  increased religious activities provide another sanctuary for  underground gangs.    One of this year's issues of the NEIBU BAODAO warns of the  encroachment on religious organizations by criminal gangs. It is  reported there that the several nationwide religious incidents  in recent years, such as the activities of the Hu Han Pai in  Yiwu County in Zhejiang Province, the "Da Zhao Sheng" incident  at the time of the Asian Olympiad involving followers from ten  provinces, and the "end of the world" incident started in 1991  by a Protestant sect in Hebei Province, are all cases of  infiltration by "underground hostile forces" and by "religious  forces from abroad." The actual fact was that in all these  incidents some underground criminal organizations seized the  opportunity to make capital by cheating religious followers out  of their "offerings." When banned and suppressed by the  government, members of the criminal gangs involved will proclaim  their "religious belief" as justifying their resistance against  the government. The cohesion among religious believers is a  factor that the government cannot ignore.  <H5>  Infiltration by Criminal Societies from Hong Kong and Taiwan </H5>   One contributing factor for the appearance of local criminal  gangs and underground criminal societies on the mainland was the  deterioration of public order on the mainland itself, but then  there was also the catalytic effect of infiltrations by criminal  gangs from abroad. Judging by news and case histories published  by the public security agencies, criminal societies from Hong  Kong and Taiwan are expanding their activities to the mainland  in a variety of forms. One is the direct dispatch of persons to  contact on the mainland criminal gangs or former convicts or  former inmates of "reform through labor" institutions, set up  lodges, and then slowly broaden out. It has been revealed that  Hong Kong criminal societies have expanded their territory in  Guangdong Province to include Shenzhen, Shantou, Dongguan, and  Guangzhou. Criminal societies from Taiwan, while being  constantly subjected to mopping up operations by the  authorities, are also expanding their activities to the  mainland. Their main areas of operation are Fujian Province and  Xiamen, but they have also appeared in Guizhou and Guangxi.    Of course, the Hong Kong and Taiwan criminal societies had  to  camouflage their infiltrations of the mainland. For this  purpose, the economic reform and opening up on the mainland  provided the criminal societies from abroad with an excellent  opportunity and shield. It was then that "mainland investments"  became for some of these criminal elements the best protective  talisman.    Investments were not only sure of being welcomed by the  local  governments, who were eager for quick success and instant  benefits, but the mainland public security agencies and police  forces frequently became eager behind-the-scenes backers for  personages of criminal societies that came over as Hong Kong or  Taiwan businessmen. Quite a few case histories show that some  personnel of the public security agencies on the mainland had  been bought over by the criminal societies.    At one time the case of Zhang Zhen [1728 4176] had caused a  sensation. The case showed clearly that authorities on the  mainland would pay no heed to any other consideration when it  comes to attracting investments. The great boss of Taiwan's  criminal society, (gangster emperor) Zhang Zhen, after spending  money lavishly, became for a time the honored guest of high  cadres. It is difficult to verify whether Zhang Zhen really  "washed his hands in a golden bowl," but with his "outstanding  business achievements" in Taiwan and his "reputation" he was  indeed accepted by the mainland, and he also became joined in  sworn brotherhood with an artist, a painter.    Wu Dongtan [0702 3159 3389], president of the "Tiandaomeng  Taiyanghui" [Sun Society of the Divine Truth Brotherhood] of  Taiwan, invested 100 million yuan in Fujian Province, which made  him a favorite person in that place, and a luxurious villa  became his base.    In their exploration of the mainland territory, Hong Kong  and  Taiwan criminal societies have nothing else in mind but  "profit." According to data with the Hong Kong police, most of  the many firearms cases, large-scale drug smuggling cases, and  illegal labor cases prosecuted since 1988 involved criminal  organizations from the mainland, which goes to show that  commission of crimes by joint operations of criminal societies  within and across the border have now become the trend.    It is already common knowledge that some members of criminal  mainland societies cross the border and commit crimes in Hong  Kong, with the plotting and organizing having been done by  lawless elements across the border. To evade arrest by police,  members of Hong Kong's underworld escape and hide out in  Shenzhen and Guangzhou, where they are protected by local  criminal gangs.  <H3>  Toward Improved Weaponry and the Use of Science and  Technology </H3>   A publication of a certain public security agency revealed  that there were criminal gangs operating in certain areas of  Jiangsu Province under such names as "Xiaoyao [Carefree] Gang,"  "Mudan [Peony] Gang," and "Meihua [Plum Blossom] Gang." Some of  these organizations have an obvious political character, as they  declare their intention to actually constitute a "second  political regime" in their region.    The criminal societies on the mainland are in the process of  getting better weapons and applying more science and technology.  With the cooperation of criminal societies in Hong Kong and  Taiwan, they equip themselves with advanced items of armament  and communication instruments, such as cordless telephones, high  frequency radio stations, various kinds of rifles, and high  speed boats. In an anti-drug campaign carried out in November of  1991 with the participation of regular army units in the  southwestern border region, it was discovered that the bandit  gangs in the hinterland had not only radio stations transmitting  orders from bosses across the border, but also excellent  weapons, even rocket launchers. After their annihilation, large  amounts of weapons of an advanced type were captured. Whenever a  criminal organization launches a large-scale action, they will  temporarily hire forces to cover their operations. Along the  Fujian coast, so-called "snake heads" [gang bosses] will  surreptitiously ship over "human snakes" to Taiwan, and this  according to an entire set of operational processes, in which  each link is carried out in a division of labor, and every item  done to perfection.</p>

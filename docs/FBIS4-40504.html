			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol by </F> Larisa Zhalovaga; place and date not given: "Vitaliy Masol:  `If There Were Market Relations in Our Country, I Would Be an  Independent Man Today'"]    [Text] The Ukrainian parliament is currently waiting for a  new prime minister. Among the most probable candidates is  Vitaliy Masol, former head of the government, who resigned from  his post after the 1990 students demonstrations. It is quite  possible that Masol's "second coming" to the Cabinet of  Ministers will become a reality, since he enjoys support from  the leftist majority in parliament. We present to our readers  an interview with the candidate for prime minister by a  KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent.    [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, what do you think of the  prospect of again sitting in the prime minister's chair?    [Masol] If I am to work in the government, I should know  that I will be supported by parliament, to avoid the following  situation: I am appointed as head of the Cabinet of Ministers  today, and tomorrow, I will be asked why the economic situation  is still unstable. Stabilization will take place in neither  three days nor a month. Thus, when the three main state  officials live like a swan, crayfish, and pike in the same lake,  I want to be neither a swan, nor a crayfish, nor a pike.  Moreover, I am currently morally pleased that I had once  properly assessed the situation. Three years have already  passed, and these years have confirmed that my conclusions were  correct. I said, and still say, that I very seldom make  mistakes in my predictions. I was against the introduction of  hard currency. Ukraine was not ready for that; we should have  established a banking system first. People were shouting:  "Conservative, Moscow's protege!" When I was saying that we  should not break ties with Russia, no one believed me: "We are  feeding Moscow!" Tell me what real grievances, regarding the  economy, were presented against the Masol government in 1990?  None. It was simply -- "Down with Masol!"    [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, the leftists have  overwhelmed the new government. Will they be able to assume  responsibility for forming the government? What kind of a  government could there be?    [Masol] Personally, I would like very much that the leftists  be able to form the cabinet. I would like that new  politicians-realists appear, first of all, in the Executive  Branch. In my opinion, among the recently elected deputies  there are people who are able to soberly assess the situation  and begin implementing reform. Regarding the leftists, they  must establish a unified bloc with the centrists. They must  cooperate to stabilize the economic situation. Decrees that  have been blocking production must be rescinded, the system of  taxation must be reformed, and the pricing mechanism must be  altered.    [Zhalovaga] You were against shock therapy...    [Masol] We have not had shock therapy. We have had a  stress-shock therapy, because no economic policy has been  conducted. It was decided: "We will not meddle in the life of  enterprises and kolkhozes. Do whatever you want to do." That  was all. But first, there should be discipline and order in the  state. How are you going to maintain and oversee them is  another question.    [Zhalovaga] To which period of history can Ukraine's current  situation be compared?    [Masol] I think that there have been no analogous situations  in world history. It is simply ridiculous to compare today's  Ukraine with postwar Germany -- these are two incomparable  situations. Although we had relative wealth, we ended up in  poverty. Currently, I am categorically against our heading  toward poverty while promising wealth at the same time. I do  not know how many years we need to reach the same volume of  agricultural production as we had three years ago.    [Zhalovaga] So you believe that our country has its own way.  How would you describe it?    [Masol] Russia was, is, and will remain for many years our  primary market. No one will allow us to enter the West with our  meat, milk, or butter. There are strict market relations.  Fight. Ukraine is currently losing the Russian market, and at  the same time, the West is conquering it. Plus, there has been  a resolution to introduce customs duties! If Ukraine loses the  Russian market, it will be very hard for us to survive, because  the agricultural sector is a priority in our country. We were  delivering a great volume of agricultural production to Russia,  which was allowing us to pay for gas and oil deliveries.    [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, would you like to be an  owner?    [Masol] If there were market relations in our country, I  would be, if not a rich man, at least not poor. I would be an  independent man today.</p>

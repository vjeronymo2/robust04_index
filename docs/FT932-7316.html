			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / S Korean military chief sacked SOUTH Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday sacked the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in a continuing purge of the military under the new civilian government. In his first three months in office, Mr Kim has replaced many senior commanders in an attempt to impose firm civilian control over the military, which ruled the country for the past 32 years. Most of those dismissed have been army officers who are members of the Hanahoe (One Mind) society, which plotted the last coup in 1979 and includes the two previous presidents, Mr Chun Doo-hwan and Mr Roh Tae-woo. Hanahoe consists of the graduates from the Korean military academy in the 1950s. In what is regarded as a move to reduce the influence of the army, the biggest and most powerful service, Mr Kim appointed the air force chief, Gen Lee Yang-ho, as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to replace Gen Lee Pil-sup of the army. The position has previously been held only by army generals. The appointment of the air force chief may also be an attempt by Mr Kim to make amends to the junior services after the recent arrest of a dozen air force and navy officers on corruption charges including bribery to obtain senior commands. The air force and navy complained they were being unfairly punished, since Mr Kim was ignoring suspected cases of corruption in the army. The corruption charges have threatened to damage severely relations between Mr Kim and the military when tensions are growing with North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons programme. Mr Kim then tried to improve ties with the military by cancelling plans to prosecute the officers for corruption, although they were dismissed from the service. The current purge, however, has support within the military, particularly among younger officers who have seen their chances for promotion blocked by the older generation affiliated with the former military dictatorship.</p>

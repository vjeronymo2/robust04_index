"We are preparing our negotiations with Geest and the  government intends to get more active in the negotiations with  Geest in the future," he said.    "We can't leave it entirely up to the (Banana Growers)  Association because they do not have the expertise to deal with  this critical issue."    Mitchell was providing an update on the government's  position  on bananas and the outcome of recent discussions with Phillipe  Darmuzey, the European delegate to the Caribbean.    He said action was to be taken on three fronts as far as the  european union was concerned.    Efforts are to be made to access Stabex [expansion not  given]  funds provided under the Lome Convention as compensation for  loss of earnings on exports of bananas.    The possibility of accessing funds under the Lome VI  regional  indicative programme for agricultural assistance and bananas  particularly was also addressed, Mitchell said.    Funds under this programme were recently dislodged following  discussions with European officials in Brussels, he said.    "Now that the Greek presidency is taking certain initiatives  in the European Union we discussed how we could assist the  process in lobbying or by any other activity in ensuring we have  a special assistance fund developed for assistance of the banana  industry," Mitchell reported.    On the question of a reported proposal by the U.S. company  Chiquita to purchase bananas from the Windward Islands, Mitchell  said no proposal had been put forward.    "We are prepared to look at all the options but I would not  want to interfere with the long-standing understanding  relationship with geest unless I were to see something  substantial," Mitchell said.    A one-year interim contract with geest expired at the end of  1993 and the Governments of Grenada, Dominica, St Lucia and St  Vincent and the Grenadines and banana officials are preparing to  re-negotiate.    Officials of the Windward Islands Banana Association  (Winban)  have prepared a document for perusal by governments and industry  officials going into the negotiations.    Sources said the removal of a clause which binds the  Windward  Islands to selling bananas exclusively to Geest is among the  proposals which Winban has made.</p>

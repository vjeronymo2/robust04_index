			<p>BFN     [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by  Gisela Hopfmueller at the Innsbruck University Hospital on 30  May -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Gisela Hopfmueller was able to telephone  the foreign minister at the Innsbruck University Hospital and  ask him personally about his state of health this morning.    [Mock] Thank you. The operation on the vertebral disk was  successful. Yesterday I walked a few steps, and today I will  walk a few more. I hope I will be able to leave the hospital at  the end of the week.    [Hopfmueller] Disk problems are generally very painful. Are  you still in pain?    [Mock] No. Before the operation I was in great pain which  was sometimes distracting. Since the operation, I have not felt  any pain at all. I am still a bit suspicious. I was surprised  that I have not had any pain since the surgery. After all, I  had been warned that it would be unlikely that I would not feel  any pain afterwards.    [Hopfmueller] Is the matter over with this treatment or will  you need further treatment?    [Mock] The doctor told me that if I follow his instructions,  everything will be fine. He is very satisfied with me.  Occasionally, he seems to have some doubts, but I hope I will  be able to dispel them in time.    [Hopfmueller] You mean the doctor doubts that you will take  good care of yourself?    [Mock] Yes. I promised him that he will be pleasantly  surprised.    [Hopfmueller] Foreign Minister Mock, there is only 14 days  until the referendum on European Union [EU] membership. At the  moment, there is the impression that the mood might swing toward  a majority of EU opponents. Do you share this view?    [Mock] I am not so much worried about whether or not the  mood  is going to swing over, because, in the end, it will be the  citizen who will make the decision on 12 June. For me, it is  important to provide information -- as far as I can do here, via  the telephone and via the letters that I get and that I can  dictate -- about what is at stake -- namely, not the fate of any  party or any person, but Austria's position in Europe for the  next 50 or 80 years, whether we will have our say and  participate in decisionmaking or whether we remain an appendage  outside.    [Hopfmueller] You say you are still trying to provide  information. Have we not meanwhile reached a point where  emotions on all sides have in effect replaced material arguments?    [Mock] One can certainly note this. However, this does not  change the fact that one still has to provide information,  especially since emotions have replaced arguments. One must try  to clarify misunderstandings, and to get rid of such abstruse  arguments, such as that our water will be taken away and that  the National Bank will export our gold to Brussels or some other  place, and to get rid of such nonsense, which often frightens  older people, in particular.    [Hopfmueller] Is it really possible to change something over  these last 14 days before the referendum?    [Mock] Look, the matter is so important that one cannot  constantly ask whether or not something is useful. If one is  convinced of something, one must work until the very end, and  then the voters will decide.</p>

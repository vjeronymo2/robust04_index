			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold talks on insurance in Tokyo on June 1 and 2 under the  resumed "framework" trade talks, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  said Friday.    But Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet  meeting that he has not heard about financial services in  denying a reported U.S. intention to begin talks in that area  together with insurance.    The Finance Ministry is in charge of negotiations for  insurance and other financial areas.    On the insurance, Fujii suggested that Japan would not offer  any new commitments. "We must pin our utmost efforts to  realizing the positive steps" included in the March  market-opening package, he said.    The package promises deregulation and simpler licensing in  Japan's insurance business.    The two nations agreed in informal talks earlier this week  to  reopen bilateral trade talks that have been ruptured since  February.    The breakthrough came on consensus over creating both  qualitative and quantitative yardsticks instead of imposing  numerical targets to assess Japan's market access on each of the  negotiation sectors.    The insurance business is one of the three priority areas  alone with automobile and auto parts and government procurement  of telecommunications and medical equipment.    Turning to domestic issues, Fujii said a "clue" for solving  bad-loan problems was observed at the previous day's release of  the fiscal 1993 business results by major commercial banks.    Japan's 11 major commercial banks said they wrote off some 2  trillion yen worth of domestic bad loans, more than double the  amount of the previous year.    The total amount of bad loans -- with bankrupt borrowers or  on which no interest has been paid for six months or more --  inched up to some 9 trillion yen, and most bank officials said  the emergence of new nonperforming loans has peaked.    Fujii said he welcomes the banks' efforts to reduce the  amount of bad loans.    Referring to the consumer price index reported at the  cabinet  meeting, the finance minister said, "I got the impresssion that  prices remain low both in Tokyo and nationwide."    The Management and Coordination Agency reported that May  consumer prices in Tokyo rose 0.6 percent from the year before  but the rate of gain shrank 0.2 percentage points from the  previous month, with the consumer price index (CPI) standing at  107.5 on a 1990 basis of 100.    Prices nationwide in April rose 0.8 percent from a year  earlier and gained 0.2 percent from March, with the CPI standing  at 107.3.</p>

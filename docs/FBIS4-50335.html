			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 18 (CNA) -- Taiwan has not violated any  international ban on exports of whale meat, a Council of  Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday [18 May].    The COA issued eight permits to export 321 tons of old  frozen  whale meat between 1988 and 1993, said Li Jen-chuan, director of  the COA's Fishery Department. "The meat had been stockpiled  before Taiwan formally banned commercial whaling in 1981," Li  explained. The International Whale Commission did not formally  ban commercial whaling until 1985.    Taiwan decided to allow exports of such meat only after it  could not obtain assistance from the United States and Japan for  handling the meat, Li noted. Taiwan originally had 450 tons of  whale meat in its stockpile, but 129 tons of the meat rotted  while in storage. Local dealers managed to sell the remaining  meat by October 1993. The last batch, weighing 220 tons, was  exported to Singapore.    Li said the 232 metric tons of whale meat the U.S.-based  Animal Welfare Institute claimed it had found in the Russian  port of Vladivostok was not necessarily from Taiwan. "If the  meat was old and frozen, it might have been transshipped to  Russia by the Singaporean company which first bought the meat  from Taiwan," Li said, adding that no international trade rules  can prevent such transshipment. If the meat was fresh, Li said,  it might be Singaporean traders who used the Taiwan-issued  export permit for old frozen whale meat to ship the fresh meat  to Russia. "We hope the American conservation group can further  investigate the case before blaming Taiwan," Li said. "It's  unfair to fault US for failing to prevent whale meat smuggling,"  he added.    Li made the statement after the U.S. group, in a Tuesday  news  conference in Washington, D.C., accused Taiwan of being involved  in a smuggling operation orchestrated by Japan's largest whale  meat distributor.</p>

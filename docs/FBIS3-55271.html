"The  presidential telephone buzzed. I took the receiver. Boris  Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) says that he came to a conclusion that he  needs a national security aide and that I should be that aide.  I had a second to think it over."    In Baturin's words, he understood that "it would be  inappropriate to refuse or ask questions. ... Not because he  (Yeltsin) was harsh or anything but I felt he really needed it."    Baturin said that he had a first brief talk with the  president about his new functions Thursday and "we'll have a  more detailed conversation probably two or three days after the  holidays (Russian Orthodox Christmas).    "I will be coordinating the activities of special services  and supervision and decision making on everyday matters which  must not encumber the president," Baturin explained.    He said that, in addition to foreign intelligence, services  such as government communication, border guards and  counterintelligence "which brings about the largest number of  problems daily" report to the president.    Unlike the foreign intelligence which must present a report  to the president once a week, there is no telling when a  decision on counterintelligence will have to be made. "The  president entrusts his national security aide with making a  decision jointly with the chiefs of these services. I should  naturally report to the president," Baturin said.    He will brief Yeltsin on the situation in general terms and  report strategic issues on which the president alone has the  right to make a decision.    Unlike the national Security Council which is a consultative  body, the national security aide "will have to do business with  special services daily."    Baturin said that a concept of national security existed  which covered the activities of special services and defined the  kinds of political and other activities which might harm  Russia's national interests.    He told Interfax that following his appointment he had a  talk  with chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service at their  invitation. "Their attitude (towards establishing the position  of a presidential national security aide) was very positive.  They view this as an essentially new approach to security  matters. We had a very good, productive, meaningful talk,"  Baturin said.</p>

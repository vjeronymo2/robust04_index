This is what Colonel Miloslav Cech told us  yesterday. Recently, he has been appointed new commander of the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Military Police in former  Yugoslavia. Colonel Cech will assume his post on 17 March in  Zagreb. He will replace a French officer in this position and  will stay in it for one year.    "The Czech Army has received high recognition since their  officers have been appointed to the UNPROFOR command. Experts  from European armies have had the opportunity during various  meetings to learn about the qualities and capabilities of our  professional soldiers, who were given priority over their  colleagues from other countries." This is the way the new  commander describes the fact that the number of Czech officers  in high positions in the UNPROFOR peacekeeping forces have been  increasing recently.    Jiri Novotny has become commander of the UNPROFOR Sector  South Operational Staff, where the Czech soldiers are active.  One of the Czech officers is likely to become the commander of  the entire sector as of April, and another the commander of the  Military Police in that part of the former Yugoslavia.    Apart from Colonel Cech, who will be in charge of soldiers  from 20 countries, 22 additional Czech military police members  will be active in the former Yugoslavia. The Czech UNPROFOR  contingent should reach almost 1,000 troops this month.</p>

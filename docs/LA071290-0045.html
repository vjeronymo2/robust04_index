			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: IF OUR KIDS WERE IN CHARGE, WE'D BE UP A TREE  </P> <P> For years, it's been a standard greeting: "Hi, Honey, I'm home." Only nowadays,  a kid answers.  </P> <P> According to national real-estate marketing research, children of the  two-income, two-career family have inherited the role of prime occupants of the  house.  </P> <P> They didn't pick out the house or design it. They don't even pay for it, but  most of them spend more time in it than their parents. The obvious question is:  Why don't children have more input into where they live than they do? The  obvious answer is: Have you seen the way kids live when there are no adults  around?  </P> <P> First, their choice of a house would be one humongous room built in a tree with  a rope ladder. Anyone wanting to enter would have to have the secret code word.  The entire house would have only two appliances: a television covering one  wall, and a microwave covering the other wall (replacing Phyllis Diller's  fantasy: an oven that flushes). Basketball hoops would be positioned over  wastebaskets, clothes hampers, the kitchen sink, towel racks and clothes hooks.  There would be no beds -- only pillows on the floor in front of the Nintendo  library.  </P> <P> The bathroom would be self-cleaning, with a water heater the size of an active  crater. Every child would have a plug implant so that wherever he is in the  house, he could plug in a stereo, a radio or a hair dryer.  </P> <P> They would live in a disposable world. Disposable underwear, disposable towels,  disposable clothes, disposable dishes and containers. The center of the floor  would have a campfire so their friends could sit around and play with matches  and toast marshmallows.  </P> <P> Off on one small tree branch would be a separate room the size of a broom  closet. This would be for Mom and Dad. When they didn't pay attention or messed  up, they would be made to go there without television, dinner or human sounds.  The tree house would have a small patch of grass at the bottom of the tree,  which the parents would be required to cut with scissors every two days.  </P> <P> Parents wouldn't spend a lot of time in their room, as they would have chores  and be sent on errands to pick up videocassettes every night. Yet, they would  have to clean it every 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Pure fantasy, you say with a laugh. Don't be too sure. I have just described my  son's apartment.  </P></p>

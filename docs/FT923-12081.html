			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / London's extra funding outlined MR JOHN REDWOOD, the local-government minister, yesterday spelt out the scale of funds allocated to London by central government, with figures showing that inner London authorities receive nearly Pounds 900 more for each adult than country regions. In outer London, the amount from grants and business rates was about Pounds 300 extra. The figures - presented to a conference on Europe organised by local-authority associations - will be used by ministers to defend the government's plans to introduce a property-based tax in April next year. London Tories are concerned that the council tax will sharply reduce the proportion of total government grants to the south-east. In the current year, the government allocated local authorities more than Pounds 700 for every adult outside London and other big cities compared with Pounds 1,000 in outer London and Pounds 1,600 in inner London. Under the property-based local tax, councils in London and the south-east will be expected to raise more than if poll tax had continued, because of the large number of relatively expensive homes in the area. The amount authorities are expected to raise from poll tax reflects broadly the number of adults in their areas. Although final figures are not available, one recent estimate put the shift in grants away from London at about Pounds 300m. Mr Redwood's figures also highlighted the difficulties the government may face in the south-east, outside London. Shires in the north, the north-west and the Yorkshire and Humberside region all receive at least Pounds 100 a head more than the southern shires, which are likely to see a fall in their proportion of government-allocated money. When the council tax legislation went through parliament, some Tory MPs expressed fears that the south-east would lose out through the change.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. URGES SOVIETS, CHINESE TO CUT ARMS TO CAMBODIA  </P> <P> A senior Bush Administration official Friday called on the Soviet Union to hold  down its shipments of arms to Cambodia and complained that the level of  shipments has risen as Vietnam prepares to withdraw its troops from that  country.  </P> <P> In a speech to an international symposium on Indochina, Richard H. Solomon,  assistant secretary of state for East Asia, also urged China to limit its  supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, the radical Communist faction blamed for the  deaths of more than 1 million people when it ruled the country between 1975 and  early 1979.  </P> <P> Solomon's remarks suggested that the Bush Administration is making a last-ditch  effort to work with the Soviet Union and China in trying to prevent civil war  from widening in Cambodia within the next few weeks. Vietnam has said it will  pull out its remaining 26,000 troops by Sept. 26.  </P> <P> "The issue comes back to whether the Cambodian factions, encouraged by their  foreign supporters, can join together in a political process of national  reconciliation," Solomon said. "The U.S. will use its influence to move events  in this direction. China and the Soviet Union must do the same."  </P> <P> China has given military, political and financial support to the Khmer Rouge  for more than a decade. Since the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia that ousted  the Khmer Rouge from power, the Soviet Union and Vietnam have backed the  government in Phnom Penh headed by Hun Sen.  </P> <P> The United States and its allies have supported the non-Communist resistance  groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. These groups have also received support  from China, and Sihanouk has repeatedly insisted that the Khmer Rouge be  included in any new coalition government in Cambodia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 11 Shipments Reported  </P> <P> In Bangkok, a government spokesman said Thai intelligence officials reported  that since the beginning of the year Moscow has sent at least 11 shipments of  arms, weighing about 14,000 tons, into Cambodia through the port of Kampong Som  alone, United Press International reported.  </P> <P> The spokesman said the shipments included more than 100 tanks and armored cars,  along with large quantities of artillery, helicopter gunships, explosives and  ammunition. In addition, he said, a squadron of 16 Soviet-made MIG jet fighters  has arrived at an airport in Phnom Penh.  </P> <P> A 19-nation peace conference to avert civil war in Cambodia ended in a  stalemate in Paris last month after delegates failed to agree on the role the  Khmer Rouge should play in a political settlement.  </P> <P> In his speech, Solomon emphasized once again that despite what he called the  "genocidal violence" of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, the Bush Administration  would still be willing to go along with a settlement in which the Khmer Rouge  becomes part of a future coalition government in Cambodia.  </P> <P> "From an American perspective, we want no role for the Khmer Rouge in a future  Cambodian government," he conceded in remarks to an international symposium in  Los Angeles on the future of U.S.-Indochina relations.  </P> <P> "However, the judgment of Prince Sihanouk, of China, and of the ASEAN (Assn. of  Southeast Asian Nations) countries . . . has been that the chances for peace  are better if the Khmer Rouge is included in a four-party interim government,"  he added.  </P> <P> Solomon's speech also reflected a growing concern by the Bush Administration  that Soviet arms shipments could help the Hun Sen regime keep power in Cambodia  after the Vietnamese pullout.  </P> <P> At the symposium, which was sponsored by The Times, Times Mirror Co. and the  Asia Society, other speakers also emphasized that the solution to the Cambodian  problem must include the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> "If you try to exclude the Khmer Rouge from a settlement, you invite civil war  and continuation of the conflict in Cambodia," said Kishore Mahbubani,  Singapore's deputy secretary of foreign affairs.  </P> <P> He urged the audience of more than 200 diplomats and scholars to stop viewing  the Cambodia problem as a clear-cut moral dilemma, saying: "There are no  morally clean positions. There are only morally ambiguous choices."  </P> <P> In addition to the Khmer Rouge, a peaceful solution must also include three  other crucial players -- Hun Sen, Sihanouk and Son Sann, head of the Khmer  People's National Liberation Front, several speakers agreed.  </P> <P> Referring to the monthlong Paris conference, Mahbubani said, "The real untold  story . . . is that Vietnam and Hun Sen came with no mandate to compromise on  the two key issues" of power-sharing among the four groups and the role of the  United Nations in a peacekeeping force.  </P> <P> Despite the disappointing outcome of the Paris talks, speakers at the symposium  described them as an important first step toward peace.  </P> <P> "We Cambodians feel very encouraged that it took place at all," said Vora Huy  Kanthoul, associate executive director of the United Cambodian Community in  Long Beach. Noting that it takes time to find a political solution, he asked,  "How can we expect to solve in a month a problem that took 20 years to  develop?"  </P> <P> Jim Mann reported from Washington and Elizabeth Lu from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

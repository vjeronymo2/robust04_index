			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS ARE URGING LOW-COST HOUSING AT AUTO PLAZA SITE  </P> <P> The Rev. William R. Johnson Jr. is among a group of community activists  promising to muster 1,500 people for a rally this afternoon to pressure city  officials to sell a site alongside the Artesia Freeway for low-cost homes.  </P> <P> Alfonso Benson Sr. is a member of Johnson's Curry Temple congregation and a  city planning commissioner. Benson says he will fight "tooth and nail" against  selling the site for housing.  </P> <P> At issue, in what could become a bitter confrontation among people who all  believe they have the city's interest at heart, is how to best use a 55-acre  parcel in the southern end of the city where Compton Auto Plaza now stands.  </P> <P> For more than a decade, the city has been pinning its revitalization dreams on  the site and pouring its redevelopment resources into it. Today, though, just  one auto dealership is operating on the site; a 288-room hotel that was to open  there a year ago has been stalled several times by financing and construction  delays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Owner-Occupied Townhouses  </P> <P> As Johnson and other members of the South Central Organizing Committee (SCOC)  see it, an owner-occupied townhouse development with peaceful, tree-lined  streets would provide inexpensive housing and also show Compton residents that  "gangs and drugs do not have to control the area, that (residents) can control  it," he says.  </P> <P> Johnson agrees that city officials have the responsibility to see that the land  is used in ways of greatest benefit for the community. "But we are saying that  many of the suggested uses they are proposing are more like pipe dreams than  they are practical," he says.  </P> <P> Benson says: "We're trying to build a tax base for the city." Pressuring an  economically disadvantaged city such as Compton to sell its most valuable  commercial land at a discount for housing, he says, would be "pitting poor  against poor."  </P> <P> What makes the site attractive to SCOC, an activist group working in Compton  and several other Southland inner-city areas, is the same thing that makes the  site so valuable for development.  </P> <P> Street and other improvements are already in place. And freeway access is good:  The land is alongside the Artesia, a major east-west traffic artery, and a mile  or two from two other major freeways -- the Harbor to the west and the Long  Beach to the east. In addition, the light-rail line that is to begin operating  next year will stop at the site. The station has already been built.  </P> <P> Michael Nuby, redevelopment project director for the site, says: "The city has  a direct need for a development that is income-generating and, basically, the  (housing) would not bring the economic return to the city that  retail/commercial development would."  </P> <P> Several developers, Redevelopment Manager Cynthia Coleman says, are knocking on  the city's door asking to locate on the site.  </P> <P> The council is trying to determine the best use of the site, she says, with the  plan to develop a new auto plaza largely abandoned.  </P> <P> At the afternoon rally at Compton Auto Plaza, SCOC leaders say they will ask  the city to hold off making commitments to developers for 120 days to give the  organization time to conduct an an independent study of the site.  </P> <P> The SCOC, Johnson says, proposes that the city sell 10 to 12 acres on the north  side of the property along Greenleaf Avenue. To make homes affordable to people  with annual incomes of less than about $26,000, SCOC leaders say, hundreds of  homes must be built at once in assembly-line fashion, which would require a  large, vacant site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money for Construction  </P> <P> Another key to the success of a low-cost housing development, SCOC says, is a  pool of money to pay for construction.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony has committed $3 million of the Los  Angeles Archdiocese to develop low-cost housing and has promised to raise $5  million more. Bishop E. Lynn Brown of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church  has promised $250,000.  </P> <P> SCOC is also considering sites in South-Central Los Angeles for low-cost  housing, which would be modeled after a successful development in New York  City.  </P> <P> The organization also says it would have to buy land for the homes at a  discount. Compton officials say the city has tried that approach for two  decades to encourage new development, but several failures have made officials  and residents wary of that strategy.  </P> <P> City Councilman Maxcy D. Filer says: "As I understand it, the council is not in  a mood to give any write-downs or give any more land away."  </P> <P> Filer says he has told SCOC leaders who approached him about the housing  development that the best use for the land would be commercial, which would  allow the city to reap sales tax revenues and also provide jobs for its  residents, a quarter of whom receive some sort of public assistance.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore -- who ousted longtime incumbent Floyd A. James  in the April 16 election, in part, she says, because residents were unhappy  with the council giveaways -- echoes Filer's sentiments.  </P> <P> "There is definitely a need for affordable housing, because we're a poor  community," she says. "I'm just not sure that's the best site."  </P> <P> Moore also points out that the city's lower-income homeowners are paying much  higher property taxes than residents in surrounding cities because Compton's  only source of tax revenue is from property. A commercial tax base is  important, she says, to bring in sales tax revenues.  </P> <P> The Rev. Reuben Anderson, another SCOC leader and pastor of Tower of Faith  Evangelistic Church in Compton, says the city will never be able to attract  businesses until it "stabilizes" its population. Most current residents are  renters, he says.  </P> <P> The city, Anderson says, "has had a shot" at trying to draw development to  Compton. Now it should consider the SCOC plan to create a community of  homeowners who would have a "vested, instead of an investment" interest in the  city.  </P></p>

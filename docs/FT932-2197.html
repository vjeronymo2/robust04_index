			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Reclaiming an unfair tax IN 1991 Customs and Excise decided that a number of nursing agencies operated as 'principals' rather than 'agents' and were therefore liable for VAT on the whole of the bills paid by their clients for home care assistants (though not for registered nurses) instead of only on the commission element as previously. This extraordinary ruling has been overturned on appeal. But meanwhile many invalids and disabled people have paid out VAT which should not have been charged, in some cases to the tune of several thousand pounds. Please could you indicate how they should set about getting a refund from Customs and excise? Any refund which is due should be sought from the nursing agencies who have submitted bills to their clients. If the agencies have overpaid VAT they will reclaim it from the Customs and Excise. The rights of clients to reclaim may depend on the form of bills rendered to them. If the bills showed VAT as a separate item and it is found that the VAT was not properly chargeable, the amount shown as VAT should be returned. If the bills did not show VAT separately the clients may well have no legal right to a refund. In such cases they should ask the nursing agency if they would be willing to make a refund. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Insurer tightens broker network JOHNSON &amp; HIGGINS, the New York-based insurance broker, has announced a number of transactions designed to strengthen the UNISON network, which links more than a dozen independent brokers through exclusive co-operation deals. J&amp;H and the German UNISON partner, Jauch and Hubener, are to establish a joint venture holding company to be based in the Netherlands. The new company will acquire a 25 per cent stake in AB Max Mathiessen, the Swedish partner in UNISON. Separately, J&amp;H and Jauch &amp; Hubener are to buy a stake of between 10 and 12 per cent in Gras Savoye, the French partner. J&amp;H has 50 per cent stake in the Spanish broker, Gil y Carvajal. The moves take place against a background of increasing competition among big international insurance brokers, especially in Europe, where companies are more likely to buy their insurance from brokers rather than directly from insurers. J&amp;H's main competitors have stepped up their European operations in recent months. In February, Marsh &amp; McLennan acquired full control of its French subsidiary, Faugere et Jutheau. Willis Corroon, which until the merger of Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black in October 1990, was part of the UNISON network, has recently completed the acquisition of stakes in a number of small and medium-sized brokers. Last year Aon Corporation, which owns the US broker, Rollins Burdick Hunter, acquired the Dutch broker, Hudig Langeveldt. Mr David Olsen, chief executive of J&amp;H, said he expected competition between the main international brokers to increase. He said he ultimately envisaged room for only three genuinely international insurance brokers. At least seven brokers - including Alexander &amp; Alexander and Sedgwick, as well as Willis Corroon, Marsh, Aon and J&amp;H - would lay claim to this status. Reliance National recently announced its intention to sell a seventh international broker, Frank B. Hall.</p>

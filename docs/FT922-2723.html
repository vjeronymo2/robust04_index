			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Failed savings and loan group's officials in Dollars 1.5bn lawsuit THE US government has filed the biggest lawsuit to date against the officers and associates of a failed savings and loan institution - a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) legal action charging former officials of the Arizona-based Western Savings and Loan with civil fraud and racketeering. The lawsuit was filed at the weekend by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the federal agency responsible for disposing of assets of failed savings and loan groups. The RTC, in an attempt to recover damages, has over the past year filed more than 100 claims against former savings and loan officials across the US. The legal action, which is bigger than the well-publicised Dollars 1.1bn US government lawsuit filed in 1989 against Mr Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings of California, came just minutes before the statute of limitations was set to run out at midnight on Saturday. Phoenix-based Western Savings failed and was seized by federal regulators in June 1989. The institution's demise is expected to cost US taxpayers about Dollars 1.7bn, whereas the failure of Lincoln Savings is likely to cost about Dollars 2bn. Among those named in the RTC lawsuit are Mr John Driggs, Western's former chairman and the scion of a politically prominent Arizona family that founded the group in 1929. The suit named several borrowers as well as a Phoenix law firm that acted for Western. The charges contained in the 200-page lawsuit include fraud, racketeering, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. After its seizure by the federal government, Western Savings was sold off by the RTC in pieces. Two years ago the San Francisco-based Bank of America acquired West-ern's deposit base of about Dollars 3.4bn.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Marriott shareholders in lawsuit against company A GROUP of preferred shareholders of Marriott, the hotels and management services group, has filed a suit against the company and its management, Reuter reports from Washington. The group says a corporate reorganisation would take away 'the vast bulk of Marriott's income-producing assets'. That, the plaintiffs said, would leave them with virtually all of the depressed property assets and the bulk of its large interest expense. The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court April 2 by H. B. Korenvaes Investment, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, AKT Associates and UBS Securities. The group holds the equivalent of a 6.4 per cent stake, or about 6.85m common shares, in Marriott. The stake includes 2.2m preferred shares convertible into common stock. 'The plaintiffs are to receive nothing in this reorganisation plan except an as-yet undisclosed reduction in their conversion price,' the group said in the suit. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to stop the reorganisation being carried out.</p>

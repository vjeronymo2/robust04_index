			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): Latin Americans look anxiously across border THE defeat of President George Bush will initiate a period of uncertainty across Latin America. Although most governments will naturally declare their contentment with Mr Clinton, most would have preferred the continuity of another Bush term. With the exception of two issues - the proposed free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and Mr Clinton's desire to see the end of the Castro government in Cuba - the election campaign provided little insight about the incoming administration's attitudes to Latin America. During the campaign, Mr Clinton cast doubt on the value of US aid programmes and trade concessions such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative: bad news for the reconstructing economies of central America and small Caribbean countries. His qualified approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement coincided with high praise for President Carlos Salinas of Mexico. On issues relevant to most of the rest of the continent, he was mute. From the Latin leaders' perspective, however, Mr Clinton shares neither Mr Bush's experience of the region nor his friendship with many of its leaders. They also expect their relations with Washington to become more complicated. Mr Carlos Bolona, Peru's economy minister, believes Mr Clinton's arrival at the White House will lead US Latin America policy to be more oriented towards human rights, the environment, the fight against drugs and promoting democracy. By contrast, the Bush administration emphasised economic reform and trade, a policy that coincided with the agendas of most Latin American leaders. Despite fears among Latin governments, there is a widespread view in Washington that shifts in US policy will not be dramatic, partly because Latin America is the fastest growing market for US goods.</p>

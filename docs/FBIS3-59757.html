Overview </H5>   The important S&amp;T-related measures of the Ministry of  Posts  and Telecommunications (MPT) are 1) promoting pioneering R&amp;D  in  the field of telecommunications; 2) "Telecommunications Frontier  R&amp;D," which promotes R&amp;D of basic, advanced technologies  in the  field of telecommunications; 3) space communications technology  R&amp;D; 4) global environmental measurement technology R&amp;D;  and 5)  radio-wave utilization technology R&amp;D.    1) &yen;193.00 million were newly approved this fiscal year  for "pioneering R&amp;D in the field of telecommunications"  because  the active promotion of R&amp;D in telecommunications, a field in  which technology is highly advanced, is essential in order to  have an advanced information society in the 21st century.    2) &yen;802.00 million are appropriated in this year's  budget  for "Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D," which involves basic,  leading-edge R&amp;D projects that will contribute to  advancements  in telecommunications.    3) &yen;1.265 billion are appropriated in this year's budget  for advanced satellite communications R&amp;D, etc., the purpose  of  which is to establish Japan's future independent technology base  in space development.    4) &yen;378 million are appropriated for the R&amp;D of  technologies aimed at global-scale environmental conservation,  e.g., remote sensing technology in which electromagnetic waves  are used for environmental observations, and for surveys of  developments relating to radio-wave utilization and information  communications for global environmental conservation.    5) &yen;94.00 million are appropriated in the FY93 budget  for  several R&amp;D efforts to develop frequency bands not yet used  and  redevelop frequency bands that are already used, and the R&amp;D  of  stratospheric radio relay systems.    The R&amp;D expenses of the Communications Research  Laboratory  account for most of the MPT's S&amp;T general account budget. As  the  only national laboratory that handles information and  communications, the Communications Research Laboratory does  wide-ranging research, from basic to applied, that covers the  fields of information, communications, and radio. The MPT set up  a Kansai branch in May 1989 as a base for carrying out basic and  advanced R&amp;D centering on Telecommunications Frontier  R&amp;D, set  up new government research offices, and outfitted a full-scale  research system there that was completed in August 1991. The  MPT's S&amp;T general account budget is &yen;7.882 billion, in  which  &yen;7.298 billion are for the Communications Research  Laboratory (see Table 1).    As for special-accounts-related funds, money from the  Industrial Investments Special Account will go toward new  investments in communications and broadcasting facilities during  FY93, and will provide the necessary funds for maintaining  special R&amp;D base facilities. And, as a measure for activating  public-sector R&amp;D activities, the MPT will promote financing  and  investment enterprises of the Japan Key Technology Center.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Promotion of Pioneering R&amp;D in the Field of  Telecommunications </H3>   R&amp;D of Advanced 3-D Image Information Communication  Technology    The active promotion of R&amp;D in the high-tech field of  telecommunications is essential in order to have an advanced  information society in the 21st century. However, it is a  high-risk, high-burden field where it is difficult for the  private sector to develop technology on its own. Therefore the  government must actively promote pioneering R&amp;D that bridges  the  gap between basic research and applications.    To that end, since FY92 the MPT has been marshalling the  technological strength and talent of industry, government, and  universities to carry out R&amp;D on technology for sophisticated  3-D-image information communications using holographic  technology. The MPT will continue that effort during FY93 as  well.  <H5>  C. Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D </H5>   In order to establish the technology base to support an  advanced information society in the 21st century, since FY88 the  MPT in cooperation with industry, other government  organizations, and universities has been carrying out  "Telecommunications Frontier R&amp;D," which is basic and  pioneering  R&amp;D in the field of telecommunications .    In FY93 the MPT will continue R&amp;D efforts from FY92 on  seven  topics in three fields and will add one new topic. The MPT will  also expand its selection of public-subscription research, which  is broad and general research themes that the ministry offers  for public subscription. In addition to setting up places for  research exchange with the researchers of the world, the  ministry will also promote international joint research by  extending invitations to foreign researchers.    The following is a summary of the individual R&amp;D themes.  <H5>  1. Super-High-Speed Communications Technology </H5>   (1) R&amp;D of Super-High-Speed, High-Performance  Communications  Technology Based on High-Temperature Superconductors    The MPT systematically carries out basic research and  development relating to various uses of the superconductivity  effect in telecommunications. This effort involves the R&amp;D of  super-high-sensitivity reception technology based on  superconducting elements, high-efficiency superconducting  antennas, and technology to counter superconductivity EMI  (electromagnetic interference).    (2) R&amp;D of Unexplored Electromagnetic-Wave Technology    This involves the R&amp;D of vacuum ultraviolet coherent  light  source technology, technology for generating squeezed light,  electromagnetic wave technology based on semiconductor carriers  (far-infrared laser light), and ultra-short-pulse, high-output  light sources.  <H5>  2. Bio-Intelligent Communications Technology </H5>   (1) R&amp;D of Super-Efficient Encoding Technology Based on  Sensory Organ Models    The objective of this R&amp;D is to efficiently compress and  reduce the increasingly larger amounts of information handled in  telecommunications. This effort involves the development of  information processing methods that model the excellent sensory  mechanisms of humans (the feature extraction functions of  vision, etc.), and the R&amp;D of technology to encode sensory  information, such as voice and image information.    (2) R&amp;D of Meta-Intelligent Functions for  Next-Generation  Communications    This research involves modelling on a computer the  high-level  intelligent activities of humans, and building a  voice-recognition/response system with advanced functions for  inference, learning, association, conceptualization, etc.    (3) R&amp;D in Connection with Biofunctions    This is to develop technology for making non-destructive  measurements of the functions with which living organisms  respond to biochemical stimuli and receive, transmit, and  process information. The objectives of this effort are to  elucidate the physical and chemical characteristics of the  macromolecules, cells, cell membranes, and other such components  of living organisms, and to elucidate the organic information  system mechanisms of living organisms.    (4) R&amp;D of Molecular Element Technology for Advanced  Information Communications (New)    This is to research and develop basic technologies such as  molecule manipulation technology, molecule assembly technology,  and technology for evaluating those characteristics. The  objectives of this effort are the development of advanced  information communications elements that are a breakaway from  conventional semiconductors, and the realization of functional,  high-density, high-efficiency molecular elements whose base  materials are biomolecules and organic molecules.  <H5>  3. Highly-Functional Network Technology </H5>   (1) R&amp;D of Basic Technology for  Super-Multiply-Changeable  Networks    This is the R&amp;D of basic technologies for functionally  optimizable changeable networks that have multiple information  sources, i.e, the R&amp;D of control technology for sophisticated  integrated networks that integrate both cabled and wireless  connections, and advanced communications processing technology  in wide-area networks.    (2) R&amp;D of Network-Human Interfaces    This is basic research to realize intelligent interfaces,  with which networks can comprehend intentionally ambiguous human  expressions, so that the advanced functions of next-generation  communications networks will be easy to use.  <H5>  4. Telecommunications Frontier Research Public Subscription </H5>   The purposes of this effort are to supplement and perfect  basic and pioneering R&amp;D, to foster creative research by  young  and talented researchers, and to improve regional R&amp;D  capabilities.  <H3>  D. Major FY93 Research Efforts at the Communications  Research Laboratory </H3> <H3>  1. R&amp;D of Advanced Satellite Communications and Broadcast  Technology </H3>   This is the R&amp;D of advanced migrator satellite  communications  technology that uses the Ka band and millimeter-wave band, and  advanced satellite broadcast technology that uses the Ka band  (21 GHz) in the communications satellites that will be launched  by an H-II rocket in FY96 (COMETS).    During FY93, the MPT will continue the development of  repeaters that will be mounted on satellites, and will begin the  development of on-ground experimental facilities.  <H3>  2. Research on a Next-Generation Communications-Broadcast  R&amp;D Satellite </H3>   Aiming for the realization of early-21st-century migrator  digital voice broadcasts, high-volume inter-satellite  communications, etc., the MPT is carrying out the necessary  research for launching the next-generation  communications-broadcast R&amp;D satellite (COMETS) in FY99. The  satellite will be loaded with high-output repeaters; a large,  10-meter, expansive antenna; and inter-satellite communications  technology that uses millimeter waves and light.  <H5>  3. R&amp;D of Aviation and Maritime Satellite Technology </H5>   This is the R&amp;D of aviation and maritime communications  technology that uses satellites, the objectives of which are to  guarantee communications with ships and aircraft, and to  establish systems that can handle on-land mobile communications.    During FY93 MPT researchers will continue migrator satellite  communications experiments using a type-V engineering test  satellite (ETS-V). Then, based on the results of those  experiments, they will develop ultra-small portable earth  stations and equipment for circuit control experiments.  <H5>  4. R&amp;D of Inter-Satellite Communications Technology </H5>   The expansion in space activities brings with it the need  for  new inter-satellite communication technology and technology for  building large-scale antennas in space.    For that reason, the MPT has developed equipment (repeaters  and multi-beam antennas) for experimenting with S-band (2-GHz  band), millimeter-wave and optical inter-satellite  communications. That equipment will be mounted on a type-VI  engineering test satellite (ETS-VI) that is scheduled for launch  in FY94. During FY93 the MPT will be engaged in coordination and  support tasks involving the satellite equipment developed thus  far.    In connection with the Space Station Program, which is an  international joint project, the MPT will continue research on  large antenna assembly technology.  <H3>  5. R&amp;D of High-Accuracy Time and Space Measurement  Technology Using Cosmic Radio-Wave Emissions </H3>   This is to develop "accurate space and time measurement  technology" suitable for the age of manned space activities. The  technology will be a fusion and evolution of the space  measurement technology represented by very-long-based  interferometry (VLBI), and time measurement technology  represented by atomic clocks and precise time comparisons.    To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue VLBI  experiments for observing plate movement around Japan and  observing fluctuations in the earth's rotation, along with the  R&amp;D of space VLBI.  <H5>  6. Research Involving Communications Satellite Experiments </H5>   Although it is an era when communications satellites are  actually being put into practical use, considerable  technological development is needed in order for small- and  medium-scale users to create advanced information networks that  exploit the features of communications satellites and then to be  able to directly access satellites on their own and thereby  utilize their networks.    For that reason, as a satellite communications advanced  usage  pilot project, the MPT will use a part of the CS-3 to conduct  operational experiments on networks in a form that is close to  actual use.  <H5>  7. R&amp;D of Space Weather Forecasting Systems </H5>   Geared toward the age ahead of rapidly evolving space  communications and manned space activities, this is research for  the purpose of forecasting the main causes of danger in the  space environment, such as cosmic radiation that affects humans  and space equipment, and making practical space weather  forecasting systems so that such dangers can be avoided.    During FY93, the MPT will continue to maintain equipment for  automatic transmission of remote data and equipment for solar  magnetism observations, and carry out the basic development of  space observation equipment for use on-board satellites.  <H3>  8. Research on Communications Technology Based on Small  Satellites </H3>   Small, light-weight satellites are advantageous in that  communications and observation systems using multiple satellites  are easy to configure because small satellites are inexpensive  and can be realized in a short period of time. In addition, such  satellites can be used for demonstrating satellite-mounted  equipment and technology in space.    The MPT will develop communications technology that is  suitable for these small satellites, such as store-and-transmit  technology, inter-satellite data exchange technology, etc., and  will work to establish the basic technologies for building  communications systems and observation systems that use small  satellites. To that end, during FY93 the MPT will develop a  store-and-transmit communications device EM and inter-satellite  radar.  <H3>  9. Augmenting Related Observations During the Term of the  STEP Program </H3>   Elucidating from a global viewpoint the processes of solar  energy transport that change the earth, oceans, and atmosphere  is essential in order to accurately grasp global environmental  changes. In combination with the Solar-Terrestrial Energy  International Joint Research Program (STEP) that runs from 1990  to 1995, the MPT will carry out supplemental observations using  the facilities of the Communications Research Laboratory to  study planetary atmospheres, solar wind, the ionosphere and  magnetosphere, etc., and through that research make an  international contribution.  <H3>  10. Research on Space Communications in Distributed  Satellite Systems </H3>   Highly reliable space communications systems will be  realized  by the development of technology for distributing several small  to mid-sized satellites in close orbits and making them operate  together in linked fashion as a group. To that end, the MPT will  conduct research on technology for high-precision control of  satellite orbits and technology for dynamic communications  circuit control.    During FY93 the MPT will develop and test a relative  satellite tracking device of an orbit control system.  <H3>  11. Research on Two-Frequency Doppler Radar for Observing  Rainfall from Space </H3>   The purpose of the rainfall radar that will be carried on  the  TRMM (tropical rainfall observation satellite), the polar  orbiting platform, and the space station, is global-scale  observation of rainfall distribution, which significantly  affects the global environment. The MPT will trial produce  rainfall radar and will mount that radar on aircraft for  in-flight experiments, the purposes of which are to investigate  the basic technologies needed for the development of rainfall  radar and to study ways to gather and process the data. During  FY93 the MPT will produce the reception part of the rainfall  radar that will be carried on aircraft and will trial produce  and test the data processing section of the rainfall radar that  will be carried on the TRMM.  <H3>  12. R&amp;D of Global Environmental Measurement Technology  Based  on Sensors That are Active in Certain Optical Regions </H3>   The MPT will develop active sensors that utilize light  suitable for accurate global monitoring of the troposphere,  which accounts for most of the earth's atmosphere. In  particular, the MPT will develop laser radar for use on-board  future satellites.    During FY93 the MPT will research and develop methods of  pumping solid-state lasers with semiconductor lasers that will  lead to longer-life and higher-efficiency solid-state lasers.  <H3>  13. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology  Using Short-Wavelength Millimeter-Band Electromagnetic Waves </H3>   In global environmental problems, the importance of  stratospheric ozone layer formation and extinction, and trace  amounts of gaseous components such as chlorine compounds and  nitrogen oxides, which effect the condition of thermodynamic  stability in the upper layers of the atmosphere, are cited. The  MPT will research and develop millimeter and sub-millimeter wave  spectroscopic reception technology that is helpful in observing  trace amounts of those gaseous components.    During FY93 the MPT will continue working on the production  of 200-GHz-band and 270-GHz-band radio-wave meters, which  started in FY92, and will develop small, light-weight  spectrometers for those frequency bands.  <H3>  14. R&amp;D in Connection With Constructing Global  Environmental  Measurement Information Networks </H3>   The MPT will carry out R&amp;D in connection with a global  environmental measurement and information network for collecting  global environmental data from observation points scattered over  broad areas and converting that data into databases. Through  that network, environmental researchers will be able to use the  global environmental data and information obtained by research  and government organizations within and outside of Japan. To  that end, since FY91 the MPT has been researching and developing  technology for retrieving global environmental data and  information, and technology for interconnecting different kinds  of networks.  <H3>  15. International Joint Research on Advanced Electromagnetic  Wave Utilization Technology for the Global Environment </H3>   In a joint effort with the University of Alaska in the U.S.,  the MPT will develop equipment for measuring the mid-level  atmosphere, and, joining in with the U.S.'s high-output  radio-wave emissions facilities and other such observation and  experimental facilities in Alaska, the MPT will conduct  comprehensive observational research of the polar mid-level  atmosphere to elucidate the mechanisms of global environmental  fluctuations.    In FY93 the MPT will develop an imaging rheometer to measure  horizontal electron density distribution, a Rayleigh Doppler  rider for air temperature and wind measurements, and a wide-area  milliwave radiometer to measure trace amounts of ozone gas in  the atmosphere.  <H3>  16. Research on Global Environmental Measurement Technology  Based on High-Resolution 3-D Microwave Imaging Radar </H3>   The MPT will develop high-resolution 3-D microwave imaging  radar that will be carried on aircraft and technology for  related experiments, data processing, and analysis, the purposes  of which are to deal with environmental damage and natural  disasters in a quick and mobile manner and to effectively  predict environmental changes resulting from that damage.    Unlike conventional composite-aperture radar from which only  flat images can be obtained, clear 3-D images can be obtained  with this system by using the strength of scattering between two  antennas and multiple polarized waves, and polarimeter functions  that accurately measure changes in scattering phase.    In FY93 the MPT will develop the main compound  polarized-wave  antenna.  <H5>  17. Development of Frequency Resources </H5>   (1) Research on 40-GHz and Higher Radio-Wave Propagation    This frequency band is characterized by the facts that  systems utilizing it can be made smaller and lighter, and that  it enables wide-band, high-density, multi-channel  communications. In addition, this frequency band has  applications in remote sensing. The basic atmospheric  propagation characteristics that take into account attenuation  due to atmospheric particles (rain, fog, snow, etc.) and the  scattering due to objects must be adequately grasped.    To that end, during FY93 the MPT will continue work from  FY92  to maintain a 90- to 100-GHz scattering meter, standard  scatterers, and a scattering meter calibration device for the  purpose of conducting scattering meter calibration experiments.    (2) R&amp;D of Optical-Region Frequency Bands    For the purpose of utilizing the optical regions in which  huge amounts of information can be transmitted with one beam,  this effort involves elucidating the characteristics that  electromagnetic waves have in optical regions, and the R&amp;D of  optical communications using spatially propagated signals that  do not degrade under poor atmospheric conditions, such as fog.    During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections  that  will be used in model communications experiments and begin the  trial production of an antenna for both optical and radio-wave  use.    (3) R&amp;D of Technology for Intelligent and Effective  Utilization of Radio Waves    In order to cope with the increasing demand for on-land  mobile wireless communications and the diversification of  transmitted information, since FY85 the MPT has been involved in  R&amp;D for using the quasi-microwave-band in on-land mobile  communications. During FY93 the MPT will research and develop  technology for intelligent and effective utilization of radio  waves that is based on the research results obtained thus far.  The technology involves dynamically changing system  configurations in correspondence with the usage of frequencies  in the quasi-microwave band in order to use radio waves as  effectively as possible.    (4) R&amp;D of Millimeter-Wave Private Communications  Technology    Concomitant with the development of an advanced information  society in recent years, the demands for high-speed, high-volume  wireless transmission and private transmission are rapidly  expanding.    To deal with that, MPT's efforts during FY93 involve the  maintenance of a system for experimenting with millimeter-wave  radio-wave propagation, fading-related R&amp;D, and trial  producing  a flat millimeter-wave antenna.    (5) R&amp;D of Mobile Microwave-Band Communications  Technology  (New)    To cope with the tightness of frequencies concomitant with  the increased demand for mobile communications and the  introduction of sophisticated services in recent years, the MPT  will research and develop the technologies needed for realizing  microwave-band (3-10 GHz) mobile communications systems. During  FY93 the MPT will maintain devices for measuring microwave-band  reception electric field strength characteristics and multipath  propagation characteristics.    (6) R&amp;D of Technology for Effective Utilization of  Broadcast  Frequencies (New)    To cope with the tightness of ground-based broadcast  frequencies, the MPT will carry out R&amp;D relating to the basic  technologies for effective utilization of broadcast frequencies:  basic technologies relating to the introduction of digital  technology in broadcasting systems, i.e., achieving narrower  bandwidths by means of efficient compression, achieving faster  transmission by efficient modulation, reducing ghost and noise  trouble, and reducing the electric power needed for transmission.    Efforts during FY93 include the investigation of information  compression technology using encoding methods that are suited to  broadcasting, and the R&amp;D of technology for efficient  compression and encoding of high-detail moving images that is  also applicable to transmission routes where problems such as  ghost signals are severe.    (7) R&amp;D of Millimeter- and Submillimeter-Wave-Band  Device  Technology (New)    To cope with increasingly greater radio-wave demand from now  on, the MPT will comprehensively and systematically research and  develop functional device technology that will become the key  technology in realizing systems in the as yet unused 70-GHz and  higher millimeter- and submillimeter-wave bands.    During FY93 the MPT will prepare basic film-forming devices  (sputter devices), etc., and will conduct research on basic  thin-film formation techniques, etc.  <H5>  18. R&amp;D of Stratospheric Radio Repeater Systems </H5>   If unmanned aircraft can be floated in the stratosphere at  altitudes of about 20 km, where the currents in the upper  atmosphere are relatively stable, and used as radio repeater  bases, they would cover broad areas of about 300 km in diameter.  More so than in the case of satellites, that would also enable  mobile communications using simple terminals.    Aiming for the development of such stratospheric radio  repeater systems, the MPT has been developing radio repeaters,  antenna systems, and radio control systems, and will conduct  R&amp;D  in connection with electromagnetic environmental measures.  During FY93 the MPT will maintain the receiving sections of a  microwave power transmission experiment system and will equip  the data storage section of an electromagnetic environmental  measurement device.  <H5>  E. Summary of FY93 Industrial Investment Special Account </H5> <H5>  1. Maintenance of R&amp;D Base Facilities </H5>   To maintain the large facilities used in the R&amp;D of  advanced  telecommunications technology, large sums of money are needed in  comparison with the frequency of usage, and there are  difficulties in single-handedly maintaining such facilities.  These kinds of facilities and equipment are maintained as  "special R&amp;D base facilities" by government support through  communications and broadcasting organizations, and are provided  for joint use to people engaged in R&amp;D pertaining to  telecommunications technology.    During FY93 the MPT will continue to maintain advanced image  communications facilities, etc., as special R&amp;D base  facilities.  <H3>  2. Japan Key Technology Center Funding and Investment  Enterprises </H3>   Established in 1985 in accordance with the Law for  Facilitating Research in Key Technologies, the Japan Key  Technology Center was instituted for the purpose of supporting  private-sector research in key technologies that is difficult  for the private sector to promote on its own. Through the Japan  Key Technology Center's loans and investments, the MPT provides  support so that telecommunications R&amp;D in the private sector  will be energetically and smoothly facilitated.    Table 3 shows new telecommunications R&amp;D efforts that  the MPT  started as investment projects in FY91. As for financed  projects, 11 efforts in the field of telecommunications were  started in FY91. The contents of the research cover many  branches: radio and satellite communications, transmission,  image communications, networks, etc.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

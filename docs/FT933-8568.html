			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: University BES launch - At a Glance Another FT-SE-linked Business Expansion Scheme has been launched, this time by sponsors Hodgson Martin. The Balliol and Magdalen Companies seeks to raise Pounds 20m through six BES companies to finance accommodation for students and dons at the Oxford colleges. Investors have a choice of returns. They can buy shares in the Gilt-Edged Companies offering 121p after five years for every 100p invested (equating to an annual return of 14.1 per cent to a higher rate taxpayer after five years) or in the FT-SE Companies. The latter offers a minimum return of 60p plus a variable return based on a return of 1.6p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 index. There are automatic 'lock-ins' at rises of 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the index. Hodgson Martin says that if the index rises by 50 per cent over the investment period, the annual return to a higher-rate taxpayer will be 17.3 per cent compound. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.

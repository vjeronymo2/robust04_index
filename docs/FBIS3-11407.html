The election office also established the number  corresponding to each candidate on the voting ballot, a sheet  that includes the list of candidates and also information with  respect to the name of the movement or party, the respective  number, a photograph, and the candidate's name.    The majority of the candidates, including three women, are  not well known. They registered, knowing beforehand that they do  not stand a change of being elected.    According to their respective identification number, the  candidates include Guillermo Aleman, Luis Eduardo Rodriguez,  Jose Antonio Cortes, Jose Galat, Andres Pastrana, Enrique  Parejo, Gloria Gaitan, Doris de Castro, Efrain Torres, Ernesto  Samper, Jose Guillermo Barbosa, Alberto Mendoza, Oscar Rojas,  Maria Diaz, Miguel Meza, Miguel Zamora, Antonio Navarro, and  Regina Betancourt.    According to recent voter polls, Conservative Andres  Pastrana  and Liberal Ernesto Samper are both in the best position to win  the elections. They are closely followed by former guerrilla  Antonio Navarro Wolff, former secret police director Miguel  Meza, and former Liberal Minister Enrique Parejo. If none of the  candidates obtain an absolute majority of votes, which would  seem to be the case, a second election round will take place on  29 May between the two candidates that received the most votes.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The personal chemistry test - How to choose the right PR consultant Selecting a public relations consultancy may seem a daunting task requiring a great deal of time, long lists of criteria and scores of interviews with potential agencies. But, in many ways, the process boils down to personalities. 'The most important thing is to look for personal chemistry,' says Stephen Whitehead, head of PR for the UK operations of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company. Finding the perfect PR is not as simple as spotting a stranger across a crowded room. 'It is not the same as meeting someone at a party and having a nice chat with them,' says Whitehead. 'You want someone who will stand up to you. We do not want someone who is going to say 'yes' all the time, because we believe that out of disagreement comes creativity.' Most companies and PR consultancies agree, however, that a few standard steps must be taken. The first is to develop a concise, but comprehensive, written brief that expresses clearly why the company wants PR. According to Meg Holmes, general manager of the PR Register, which steers clients through the selection process, the brief should set out requirements in a number of areas, including customer relations, corporate affairs, crisis and issues management, internal communications, parliamentary lobbying and links with charities. The next step is to select a range of agencies. Information about consultancies is available in directories such as the Hollis UK Press and Public Relations Annual, which lists 1,200 agencies, separated into specialist categories. Organisations such as the PR Register, the Public Relations Consultants Association, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and the Institute of Public Relations will also advise companies on appropriate agencies. 'The temptation is to go for too long a list of agencies,' says John Brown, deputy chief executive at Burson Marsteller, a leading agency. 'But it wastes your time as a client and the agency's time in preparing presentations.' He recommends a short list of no more than six consultancies. Brown says companies should whittle down their choices by setting exact criteria for what they want the PR to accomplish. 'By saying we need A, B, C and D you can probably get down to five or six agencies that could possibly meet these needs,' he says. Each consultancy on the list should see the brief, and then prepare a 'credentials' or 'chemistry' presentation. 'After these meetings we guarantee that one or two will drop off the list,' says Holmes. The final two or three agencies should be invited to give a full creative presentation, which usually lasts about an hour. Companies should insist that those who will work on their business give the pitch. 'Some agencies tend to have luminaries to do the presentation and then the secretaries do the work on the account,' warns Steve Gebbett, director and head of marketing at Charles Barker, a London-based agency. The ultimate decision should be based on the programme and how it conforms to the company's brief, awareness of the company's market and competitors, political sensitivity, creativity - and, of course, the all-important personal chemistry. Finally, 'do not think the world will change just because you have appointed a PR company', says Kenneth Miles, director general of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. 'But do expect something to happen and have an idea how to evaluate it.'</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Arts: Purcell's 'Fairy Queen' Only 25 years ago Benjamin Britten made his arrangement of The Fairy Queen because it was thought 'impractical' to stage Purcell's music together with the Shakespeare play for which it was written and pretty difficult even to persuade an audience to sit through the whole of the musical score. How quickly attitudes change. One of the hits of the Aix-en-Provence festival in recent years was just that: a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with the play suitably shortened, that incorporated all of Purcell's music performed by Les Arts Florissants under William Christie. That production spawned a successful recording and on Saturday the musical performance arrived in concert at the Barbican, with just a lacing of dramatic high spirits. This group plays the music as though each performer knows it inside out and loves every note. With only ten musicians (a string quartet plus a few each of wind and brass) this was essentially chamber music in style and the performers' intimate understanding of what each other are doing was half the joy of the evening. A piece like the famous air 'Ye gentle spirits' became liquid and flexible, seemingly freed from its bar-lines. There are those who find this aspect of Christie's Purcell too French in flavour, as though niceties of nuance have replaced good, solid English rhythmic impetus. The counter-argument is that his Fairy Queen takes flight in imagination and is so full of life, magical, poetic, sensitive, that it makes most other performances sound earthbound. In Les Arts Florissants' previous visits to London the weakness, if there was one, was the singing. This time Christie brought a very respectable cast, including one outstanding singer in the soprano Veronique Gens, who delivered the Plaint with immaculate beauty, and a pair of well-versed English tenors in Charles Daniels and Mark Padmore. Like the instrumentalists, they worked as a team, holding the audience spellbound through long, cumulative sections of the score. There was no play. Instead Jeremy Sams set the scene with a linking narration, which Harriet Walter delivered with the aplomb of an Anna Russell ('Imagine a fairyland as conceived by Capability Brown'). And Graham Spicer, producer or 'metteur en espace' as his task was described when rendered into French, added a few judicious movements: just a single wink to cap Coridon and Mopsa's lascivious duet. Whether such additions are necessary is a matter of opinion. When Christie and his musicians are on stage, I am inclined to think that there is more than enough to stimulate the imagination, for Purcell's delightful and magical world seems to lie at their fingertips.</p>

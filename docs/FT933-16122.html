			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Election fall-out over NZ reform: Controversial plans for sweeping healthcare changes THE New Zealand government is pressing ahead with a sweeping and costly shake-up of the health service despite an opposition promise to return to the former system if elected in a general election later this year. Controversy, which could resonate in Britain and the US, has surrounded the reforms since they were announced in 1991 by the then health minister, Mr Simon Upton. He was replaced by Mr Bill Birch in March as government concern mounted over the electoral damage the plan was causing. One of Mr Birch's first acts as minister was to launch a NZDollars 3m (Pounds 1m) television campaign to explain the changes - a move labelled by the opposition Labour party, which leads in opinion polls, as 'political propaganda'. The changes, which came into force this month, are directed principally at funding, with the aim of introducing business efficiencies. In future, large public hospitals, which have been renamed as crown health enterprises or CHEs, are expected to be run on business lines. New managers have been hired from the private sector at high salaries. The CHEs are expected to return a dividend or make a profit, and compete with private hospitals. Healthcare funding is being split from the provision of services. Four regional health authorities (RHAs) are taking over a budget of NZDollars 4bn. The RHAs also get a further NZDollars 1bn to fund the cost of disability services, previously the responsibility of the Social Welfare Department. The RHAs are known as the 'purchasers' of services. They will buy services from the CHEs and any private organisation that can make competitive bids. Doctors, after difficult negotiations, have agreed to a system of contracts with the RHAs. The government was accused of being undemocratic when it sacked elected members of the former hospital boards and replaced them with its RHA and CHE appointees. The meetings of these groups will not be open to the public. The government believed the old system was wasteful and inefficient. But the cost of setting up the news system has been substantial - more than NZDollars 30m. Ms Helen Clark, health spokeswoman for Labour, has warned of privatisation through what she says is the 'Americanisation' of health services. In defence of the new system, Mr Birch said: 'Money was dished out to the old area health boards. But the elected members thought they were accountable to their voters, so there was a conflict.' He added that the old boards always blamed the government for not giving them enough funds and claimed there was a lack of skill and competence in the boards. He maintained that while the public would not notice any immediate difference, he expected real improvements would soon start to show, including reduced waiting times for surgery. In response to criticisms last week that the new system was underfunded, the minister announced that health would be given an extra NZDollars 128m in the next financial year.</p>

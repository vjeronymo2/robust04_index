At the conference, Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial  party committee, made a speech entitled "Attach High Importance  To And Realistically Achieve the Propaganda and Ideological Work  Under the Market Economic Conditions."    Sun Weiben said: To achieve the 1994 provincial tasks for  reform, opening up, and modernization, the people from higher  levels downward across the province should unite as one and make  concerted efforts, all fronts should work closely in line with  the central task of the party, and it is also necessary to  strengthen and improve the propaganda and ideological work and  to upgrade the level of serving the overall party work  situation. At the national propaganda and ideological work  conference, Comrade Jiang Zemin set forth major propaganda and  ideological work tasks under the conditions for setting up the  socialist market economy. The province should strengthen the  active and creative nature of the propaganda and ideological  work and the sense of responsibility for carrying out the work  and further successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth  manner.    Sun Weiben pointed out: The 1994 propaganda and ideological  work priorities are to further organize the people to study the  third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to  implement to the letter the task of arming the whole party with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics; to persist in the principle of linking  theory with practice; to emphatically solve the practical  problems; to conduct the education on the purpose of the party  within the party, conduct the education on the Chinese nation's  traditional virtue, and conduct the education on ardently loving  the socialist motherland among the youngsters in line with the  provincial fighting targets for economic and social development  and the provincial work tasks; to strive to cultivate the new  persons with ideals, education, morality, and a sense of  discipline; to vigorously support the production of the  spiritual products reflecting the main melody; and to strive to  create high-taste, high-style, and high-grade cultural works so  as to satisfy the people's increasingly higher spiritual and  cultural demands and to mobilize the people's spirits and  vitality. We should vigorously strengthen the management of  cultural markets and ensure that our literary and artistic works  and cultural markets conform to the main melody of the times and  the social progress.    Sun Weiben said: We should prominently propagate and explain  the relationship between reform and development and stability  and provide an accurate media orientation for reform and  construction. The press work should closely coordinate with the  propaganda work. Both the press and propaganda fronts should  tightly grasp the accurate guidance orientation, have a  clear-cut stand to support reform, and go all out to safeguard  political and social stability. We should prominently attend to  the propaganda on economic work, reform, and opening up and  create a good ideological and media environment for making  Heilongjiang prosperous and developing Heilongjiang.    Sun Weiben stressed: We should realistically strengthen  leadership and really bring into play the functions of the  propaganda and ideological work departments and their work  contingents. The party committees and governments at various  levels, all fronts, and all departments should foster the  awareness of mass propaganda and form cohesive power for  strengthening the propaganda and ideological work. That whether  or not the leading cadres pay attention to and achieve the  propaganda and ideological work should be regarded as a key  indicator for assessing their political awareness and leadership  ability. That whether or not the propaganda and ideological  work and the spiritual civilization are successfully carried out  should be regarded an important standard for judging their  success or failure. To achieve the propaganda and ideological  work, the party committees and governments should work according  to the practice of the central authorities and in line with the  real demands for strengthening the propaganda and ideological  work, and gradually increase the economic input to the  propaganda and ideological work.    In regard to the issue concerning the construction of the  propaganda and ideological worker contingent, Sun Weiben pointed  out: It is necessary to cultivate a propaganda and ideological  worker contingent with the spirit of contributions, the style of  respecting professional work, the strong sense of political  awareness, proficiency in professional work, and moral  integrity. The party committees at various levels should  enthusiastically show concern for this contingent, try every  possible to help improve their working and living conditions,  and make them happy and do their jobs cautiously and prudently.    The major tasks of the provincial propaganda and ideological  work conference are to study, relay, and implement the  guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference; and to study the tasks, targets, and measures for  strengthening and improving the propaganda and ideological work.    Present at the conference were Provincial Leaders Tian  Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Yang Guanghong, Wang Xianmin, Li  Qinglin, Liu Hanwu, Sun Kuiwen, and Dai Moan; and responsible  comrades of the propaganda departments at various levels.    Yang Guanghong, standing committee member of the provincial  party committee and director of the propaganda department,  relayed the guidelines of the national propaganda and  ideological work conference.</p>

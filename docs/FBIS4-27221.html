			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 28 KYODO -- The prolonged recession has  boosted the number of unemployed workers to a 10-year high of  1.94 million, a government report said Saturday [28 May].    The Management and Coordination Agency said the figure,  based  on its survey conducted in February, represented an increase of  370,000 or 23.6 percent over a year earlier.    The agency said the number of employed increased 170,000 to  62.9 million.    It said the number of jobless was the highest since 1984  when  the agency began the annual survey on the labor situation.    Agency officials said the number of employed and unemployed  was estimated on the basis of polls taken on about 100,000  people more than 15 years old in the survey conducted in  February this year.    The survey showed that the number of unemployed on a job  hunt  accounted for 1.29 million, the agency said.    It said male workers who lost jobs as a result of  reorganization or bankruptcies totaled 70,000, accounting for  9.1 percent of the total number of jobless males, up from the  previous year's 7.8 percent.    The figure for females stood at 60,000, accounting for 11.5  percent, up from 7.0 percent the year before, the agency said.    The agency said those who were unemployed for less than  three  months accounted for 44.3 percent of the total, down 6.0  percentage points from the year before.    In contrast, the agency said those who were unemployed for  three- six months and more than one year climbed 4.2 and 1.2  percentage points to 20.1 percent and 16.5 percent.    The survey showed that 2.53 million workers took up new jobs  over the past one year, with 26.9 percent changing jobs in  search of better conditions.    Those who were forced to seek new jobs as a result of  restructuring and business failures increased 2.9 percentage  points to 8.3 percent, the agency said.    The agency said job changing workers decreased 160,000 in  the  manufacturing industry and 20,000 in the wholesale-retail and  restaurant sector while those in service and construction  industries increased 130,000 and 100,000, respectively.    It said 7.11 million workers said they want to find new jobs  with better job security.</p>

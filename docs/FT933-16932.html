			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: Not convinced by gas competition argument Sir, Your editorial, 'Abolishing the gas monopoly' (June 29), is right to argue that social obligations imposed on public utilities are compatible with competition. However, in arguing for greater competition in domestic supply of gas you make one dubious point, ignore another and reach an unproven conclusion. The electricity industry in England and Wales is not a convincing model of competition. Electricity privatisation did not result in a truly competitive market. It produced a duopoly with knobs on - with two big generators, regional supply monopolies, a subsidised nuclear sector financed by a levy on consumers' bills, and imports of French electricity subsidised by the French government. Moreover, the regulatory body, Offer, regulates prices too far downstream from the generating sector, where two-thirds of costs lie. This is not open competition. You fail to address what benefits competition would deliver to consumers. Neither you nor Ofgas, the gas regulator, has made clear what the costs and benefits would be of the break up of British Gas's vertically integrated business. Given the limits on consumer choice over an undifferentiated product, coming from a single set of pipes, there is no guarantee that consumers would gain from the abolition of price regulation. Therefore, we are not convinced by your conclusion: 'The introduction of competition would also bring nearer the day when regulation could be relaxed'.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other coordination issues discussed were the difficulty of defining and receiving information on dropouts from some local educational agencies and the fact that agreements should be limited to those education agencies which plan in-school activities. With regard to obtaining information on school dropouts, the Department has initiated discussions with the Department of Education with the goal of working out a common definition and systematic approach for identifying and serving dropouts. In the meantime, States are encouraged to negotiate agreements with State educational agencies to facilitate this task. With regard to limiting the agreements required at the local level with educational agencies, &sect;628.545(c) is amended to reflect these concerns by the addition of the qualifying terms ``appropriate'' and ``which participate in JTPA programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Transfer of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters raised questions concerning timing issues not addressed in &sect;628.550 of the interim final rule: whether transfers must occur at the beginning of the program year; whether they may occur at any time during the 3-year funding period; and whether the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program. The Department does not address these issues in the final rule, leaving the first two issues to be addressed at the Governor's discretion. In response to the third issue, the provisions are applicable to the 1993 title II&hyph;B program; this issue is addressed in the transition provisions at &sect;627.904(k)(2) of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, paragraph (b) is revised to permit transfers of up to 20% of the title II B funds allocated to an SDA under section 252(b) of the Act to title II C. This change is consistent with the amendment made to section 256 of the Act by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;227.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Title II&hyph;A_The Adult Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the general requirements of title II&hyph;A appear in subpart E of part 628 of the interim final rule. There are a few specific requirements of title II&hyph;A which appear in part 628, subpart F. These include sections on eligibility; requirements to assist hard-to-serve individuals; types of training services, counseling and supportive services; and linkages and coordination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to commenters who were confused about whether the provisions of the formula for allocation of funds set a maximum age of participation at 72 years, &sect;628.605(a) is amended to clarify that there is no maximum age of participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters asked for clarification on the determination of the 65-percent threshold of serving the hard-to-serve. Section 628.605(c)(1) is amended to clarify that all participants, including the non-disadvantaged (10 percent window), are considered in determining the 65 percent who are hard-to-serve. Section 628.605(c)(2) now addresses the question of when, in the service continuum, an individual is counted for determining compliance with the 65-percent barrier requirement by clarifying, as discussed earlier, that it is calculated upon participants who have received a service subsequent to objective assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters questioned the inconsistency in the provisions regarding the ten-percent window in section 204(d) of the Act and the provisions for eligibility in the basic title II&hyph;A program, set forth in &sect;628.605(e), when an older worker is in a joint program between JTPA and title V of the Older Americans Act. As discussed in connection with the provisions of &sect;628.320, this inconsistency has been addressed by the Congress in amendments to the Older Americans Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, on the regulatory provisions of &sect;628.605(c) and &sect;628.803(d) addressing the 65-percent requirement, several commenters asked what would be the ramifications of non-compliance. Of course, the Department does not expect difficulty in meeting these requirements. Since the Act imposes these percentage service requirements, as well as the requirement on the in-school, out-of-school 50/50-percent ratio, on participants and not to funds, the Department believes that they would be the subject of administrative corrective action by the SDA and, subsequent action by the Governor under the provisions of section 164(b)(1) of the Act and part 628, subpart G of the final rule, as appropriate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

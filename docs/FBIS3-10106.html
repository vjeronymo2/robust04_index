			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Expecting Better Relations </F> With Antilles. Antilleans Voting Government Parties Out"]    [Text] Willemstad/The Hague -- The cabinet and all major  parties in the House of Representatives believe that the outcome  of the elections on Curacao and on the other islands, will have  a favorable impact on relations between the Netherlands and the  Antilles. According to Antillean and Aruban Affairs Minister  Hirsch Ballin, a "wind of change" will blow across the islands  with the new party PAR [Antillean Restructuring Party].    VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  Representative  Wiebenga, chairman of the Permanent Chamber Committee on  Antillean Affairs, also believes that dealings with winner and  presumable President Miguel Pourier will be better than with his  predecessor Mrs. Liberia-Peters. Just like the VVD, the PvdA  [Labor Party], D66 [Democrats 66] and CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal] are also pleased with the outcome. All parties consider  Pourier to be a competent and reliable politician.    According to Wiebenga, the opposition's victory, including  on  St. Martin, is no reason to lift Netherlands control over St.  Martin right away. "Problems are still too big to do so.  Improvements will have to take place on St. Martin itself. In  addition, we will first have to wait for the elections for the  island councils, which are only scheduled for next year." In  the island councils, the parties who have won now, are still in  the minority.    The new party PAR, which won a historic victory on Curacao  last Friday during the elections for a new Antillean Parliament,  is only two months old. The party won eight of Curacao's 14  seats, and overwhelmingly defeated Maria Liberia-Peters'  governing PNP [National People's Party], which fell back from  seven to three seats. On the other Antillean islands, the  governing parties were also defeated.    The governor will charge the PAR with forming a new  government, with Party Leader Miguel Pourier as presumable  president. After consultation with parties from the other  islands, he will see which national coalitions can be formed.  Until then, Paula's resigning interim cabinet will stay on.    Last October, the PAR started as a movement which stood up  for "the preservation of the Antilles" during the referendum on  Curacao's political future.    Former President Maria Liberia-Peters admitted the PNP's  loss. "The population has spoken, and we will respect its  decision. Apparently, we failed to express our views clearly  enough."    The MAN [New Antilles Movement], under the leadership of Don  Martina, kept its two seats, and the Democratic Party its only  seat. In Curacao, two parties will disappear from Parliament:  FOL [Workers' Liberation Front] had three seats, Our Country  one.    On St. Martin, the rule of the Democratic Party (DP) of  controversial Leader Claude Wathey, has come to an end. The  opposition party SPA [St. Maarten Patriotic Alliance] won three  out of the Windward Island's three parliamentary seats. Two  years ago, the SPA had already defeated the DP during the  elections for the island council, but was nonetheless kept out  of the island's government.    On Bonaire, the UPB [Bonaire Patriotic Union] had to cede  two  seats to the oppositional Democratic Party-Bonaire headed by  Jopie Abraham. The governing parties, the Democratic Party, and  the WIPM [Windward Islands People's Movement] respectively, only  remained in power on the smallest islands of St. Eustatius and  Saba.</p>

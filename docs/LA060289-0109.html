			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN STATE WILL RESUME KOALA EXPORTS  </P> <P> The Australian state of New South Wales will send three koalas to Japanese  zoos, ending a one-year ban on exports of the cuddly marsupials imposed after  several died abroad.  </P> <P> Two young males, Bindi and Taronga, will leave this month for Tokyo's Tama Zoo.  A third male will be sent to Higashiyama Zoo in Nagoya next month.  </P> <P> New South Wales last July became the only state to ban exports after at least  eight koalas died abroad in three years, many in Japanese zoos. Experts believe  the cause of death was partly stress because of a change of environment.  </P></p>

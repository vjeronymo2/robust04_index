			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Hanson considers buying British Coal HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday said it would give consideration to buying British Coal once any financial information on the privatisation of the coal producer is made available. Mr Martin Taylor, deputy chairman of Hanson, yesterday confirmed the company's interest in looking at all the information the government produces for the forthcoming privatisation of British Coal. He did not rule out offering to buy the whole of British Coal - the government's current plan is to split it into units before privatisation. But he also made clear that Hanson, which holds a large interest in the US coal company Peabody Mining, had made no commitment to bidding for it and that no decisions could be made until all the information had been made available. Coal mining is one of the core businesses on which Hanson intends to concentrate. He said: 'We are in the coal industry in the United States, and our obligation is to look at whatever the government says about British Coal and what it wants to privatise. 'Having looked at the terms and analysed them we would decide whether there's something which makes us want to make an investment.' In 1990, Hanson spent a month in negotiation with the government to buy PowerGen, one of the newly privatised electricity generators. The negotiations failed, bringing down Hanson's share price, but many commentators believed Hanson's involvement had a strong effect on PowerGen's management and may also have helped the government to raise more from the eventual privatisation of PowerGen than would otherwise have been the case. Other companies have expressed an interest in buying British Coal. They include Anglo United, which owns the Coalite smokeless fuel business and has been researching a possible British Coal acquisition since 1989, and Ryan Group, the UK's largest privately owned coal producer, which has said that it will bid for a part of the company on privatisation. Anglo's ability to buy British Coal has been constrained by its recent financial performance, which was below earlier expectations.</p>

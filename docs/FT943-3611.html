			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Retailing losses take toll on Liberty Shares in Liberty fell by 33p to 355p yesterday, as the retailing and textile group tumbled into the red in the six months to July 30, following sharply increased losses on the retailing side. Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 305,000, against profits of Pounds 602,000 previously, as trading losses in the retailing division grew to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 561,000). Mr Patrick Austen, chief executive, described the performance as 'dis-appointing', though he stressed that poor first halves were not uncommon - Liberty's year is heavily weighted to the second half. Having steered the group through full enfranchisement of its non-voting shares since his arrival in May 1993, he has rejigged the divisional and management structure - creating separate textile and brand products divisions - and had 'bitten the bullet' and closed the store in New York's 5th Avenue. This had been the flagship of a five-store US chain, but the other stores were all closed by January 1992. The US closure had staunched regular first-half losses of about Pounds 200,000, said Mr Austen, but had cost Pounds 606,000. This was included in retailing's trading losses. However other factors contributed to the decline. The group said that the first day of the sale had coincided with a rail strike and that the 'extremely hot weather' had kept shoppers away. There had also been several primary 'disruptions', when the London flagship store - and Regent Street itself - was closed after a firebomb and other bomb alerts. Mr Austen said Liberty was trading 7 per cent up year-on-year until June, but that in July it was 5 per cent down. However since the period-end the group was back to a 5 per cent increase over last time. Group turnover rose 2 per cent to Pounds 38.3m. The interim dividend is held at 1.85p in spite of losses of 3.44p (earnings 0.25p) per share.</p>

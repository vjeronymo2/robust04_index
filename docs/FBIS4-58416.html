			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] have declared tomorrow,  Wednesday, a day of national mourning and have asked the people  of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to observe a general  strike.    In a statement distributed in the occupied territories  today,  the two fronts said that the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement will constitute one of the most dangerous and  difficult periods in the Palestinian people's struggle because  complete coordination now exists between the Palestinian side  and the occupation forces, as the statement put it.

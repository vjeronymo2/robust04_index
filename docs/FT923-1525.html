			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / SNP keeps its strategy under wraps THE Scottish National party gathers in Perth today for its annual conference with only three MPs compared with five last year, but with its confidence apparently unshaken. The party is keeping strictly private any recriminations over its performance in the general election - in which it failed to make inroads into Labour's industrial heartlands, in spite of seeing its share of the vote rise by 7 percentage points to 21 per cent. Private, too, are wrangles over its future strategy. The only scheduled discussion of the party's national plan is during a 90-minute session tomorrow afternoon, from which the press and public are banned. Reports from national office bearers, including a brief appearance by the former deputy leader, Mr Jim Sillars, will also be heard in closed session. Mr Sillars resigned from the deputyship after losing his Glasgow Govan seat to Labour, and condemning the Scottish electorate as '90-minute pat-riots'. The list of resolutions for public debate shows the usual SNP preoccupations with agriculture, forestry, fishing and dampness in housing, but the subject that seems set to provoke fiercest argument is privatisation. Possible privatisation of the Scottish water industry has been touted as the next big issue to rouse the Scottish public as the poll tax did. That has yet to be demonstrated, but the issue is certain to excite delegates. Fanning the flames will be an amendment that calls on the party to face up to the reality of privatisation and drop its commitment to renationalise all utilities if elected. A resolution supporting a referendum on Maastricht will attract interest, but is likely to cause less agitation in Perth than it would in Brighton or Blackpool in the coming weeks, as the SNP has the distinction of being one of the most solidly pro-European parties in Britain.</p>

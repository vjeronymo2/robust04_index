			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Fund of eastern promise - Unit trusts OPERATING a risk-averse fund management style in a volatile region like south-east Asia may sound contradictory. But Adaline Ko, manager of Save &amp; Prosper's south-east Asia Growth unit trust, has been doing just that for 11 years with considerable success. The fund was launched in 1978 (Ko joined in 1982) and is one of the largest in the Far East sector (excluding Japan), with Pounds 185m under management. Its performance has been consistently above average: it was third best performing out of 15 funds in its sector over the seven years to September 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright; 12th out of 26 over five years, 20th out of 43 over three years, and 17th out of 54 over one year. However, its lower-risk strategy, has kept it from the very top of its sector, as it is competing with more volatile single country funds. Management of the fund is carried out by a four-person team at Flemings in London, which bought Save &amp; Prosper in 1988. The team visits the region about twice a year for a few weeks at a time, and makes a total of about 200 company visits. Additional research comes from sister company Jardine Fleming, based in Hong Kong and with offices throughout the region, as well as other international securities houses and local brokers. Investment strategy starts with asset allocation. Quarterly strategy meetings discuss economic and market fundamentals, and can lead to complete shifts in direction. The fund's high turnover - which Ko calculates at an average of 200 per cent a year - is largely attributable to periodic decisions to withdraw almost completely from one or two markets in favour of heavy investment in others. 'If you can get certain markets right, you are three-quarters of the way there,' says Ko. The top-down style is also seen as more appropriate in a region where company accounting and disclosure standards are not always up to European or US levels. Most shares move with the market as a whole, rather than in response to company news. There have been many changes in the fund's style during the time that Ko has been involved, including the recent move to concentrate the fund  - it now holds 88 stocks, compared to 116 two years ago. Of the top 10 stocks, mostly regional blue-chips which account for 30 per cent of the fund's holdings, the top three are Hong Kong listed: Hutchison Whampoa, Cheung Kong Holdings, and HSBC Holdings. Each of them accounts for more than 4 per cent of the total. Other top 10 companies are: Renong (Malaysia), United Engineers (Malaysia), ACMA (Singapore), Advanced Information Services (Thailand), Krung Thai Bank, New World Development (Hong Kong), and Arab Malaysian Corporation. The largest holdings form a stable core for the fund - most have been in the portfolio at least two years, some considerably longer. The present regional allocation is 29 per cent in Hong Kong, Malaysia 25 per cent, Singapore 12 per cent, Thailand 15 per cent, Korea 12 per cent, Philippines 2 per cent and Indonesia 3 per cent. Historically, the fund's current weightings are low for Hong Kong and high for Malaysia. The graph shows the fund's performance against the FT-A index for the Pacific Basin excluding Japan, which covers similar markets but includes Australia and New Zealand, which do not form a big part of the fund's portfolio, and excludes Thailand, which does. One concern for the fund, Ko says, is the risk of becoming trapped in illiquid markets, particularly the smaller ones such as Indonesia and the Phillipines. A manager has to balance the possibility of the market rising against the possibility of becoming stuck when sentiment turns bearish and volume plummets. 'Before you get in, you have to think if you can get out first. We would never put a majority of the fund into a market we knew it would be difficult to get out of, no matter how good it was,' Ko says. Ko is originally from Hong Kong, and says that a closeness to the culture can help in understanding how the markets are behaving. At other times though she has to distance herself from her roots. Such an instance came in the Chinese crisis of 1989, when student democracy protests in Tiananmen Square were brutally suppressed. Regional markets, particularly Hong Kong, reacted strongly to the events. Ko describes managing the fund during this time as hair-raising. But the decisions she took proved successful. Hong Kong's stock market plunged in the early stages of the protests, but then bounced back. At this point Ko sold a large chunk of her Hong Kong holdings, reducing them from around 50 per cent of the fund to 20-25 per cent. The market then started to drop again, and fell even more heavily on news of the massacre. Markets in Singapore and Malaysia collapsed in sympathy, but Ko believed that there was no fundamental reason for this, so she shifted funds withdrawn from Hong Kong into both markets - in time to see them pick up again. Such successes tend to be forgotten, but are a fund manager's job, Ko accepts. The mistakes loom larger in her mind. One decision she is currently regretting is moving back into Korea in a big way last year, in expectation of interest rate cuts and economic recovery. It now seems she made the move too early - the first wave of recovery came, but has so far failed to take off, and the market has been hit by a clamp-down on the use of false names for financial transactions. The fund has not lost money in Korea so far, but there is an opportunity cost when other markets in the region are performing well. Ko has scaled the holding back (from 20 to 12 per cent) and is now expecting a real recovery early in 1994. Charges. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent, and the annual is 1.5 per cent. The current bid-offer spread is 5.99 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 35 a month. The fund does not qualify for full Pep investment, so a maximum of Pounds 1,500 can be invested by this route.</p>

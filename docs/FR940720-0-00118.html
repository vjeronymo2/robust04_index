			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from EMI which suggested that an RIA be performed under the guidelines set forth in E.O. 12291. EPA will examine these comments in the context of E.O. 12866. In connection with every ``significant regulatory action'' as defined at section 3(f)(1) (Annual effect on the economy of $100 million *&blank;*&blank;*), E.O. 12866 requires an RIA be performed. EMI submitted that the second and third independent criteria for a ``major rule'' under E.O. 12291, were met by both the NPRM and CARB's Utility Engine Rule currently before EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In relation to the second criterion for determining whether a rule is ``major'', EMI stated that its member manufacturers of farm and construction equipment will incur costs in attempting to comply with EPA's rule and CARB's Utility Engine Rule. EMI also states that both consumers of farm and construction equipment and California's economy will incur costs as a result of geographically diverse emission standards. EMI makes reference to no evidence or cost data in support of its claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMI points to the potential of diverse or multiple emission standards as its support that United States farm and construction equipment manufacturers would be unduly hindered in the international marketplace as evidence that the rule meets the third criterion for a ``major rule''. Again, EMI makes no reference to any examples of costs or evidence to support its belief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA still believes that an RIA is not needed for the NPRM or the final rule. Today's rule does not itself impose any increase in costs to individual industries or the State of California. Indeed, the rule merely sets out definitions and criteria for nonroad authorization requests. California makes cost determinations as part of its own rulemaking and provides the rulemaking record to EPA as part of an authorization request. At the same time, EPA notes that while its rule does not impose any direct costs on equipment manufacturers, the more narrowly the scope of preemption is drawn, the more opportunities California has to impose costs through regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of E.O. 12866, OMB notified EPA that it considered the action a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA stated that the proposed rule did not contain any additional information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (PRA). The purpose of the PRA is ``to minimize and control burdens associated with the collection of information by federal agencies from individuals, businesses and other private institutions, and State and local governments.'' 5 CFR 1320.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received comments from two parties claiming that the PRA applied to the proposed rule and that such application would require changes within the proposed rule. North American Equipment Dealers Association (NAEDA) and EMI indicated that the ``primary use'' test would cause an increase of burdensome paperwork, with manufacturers dependent upon dealers and end users to provide the requisite information to determine primary use. At the same time, EMI noted that EPA did not specify any particular paperwork requirements. In addition, EMI did not indicate that any information need be submitted to EPA. Instead, EMI apparently supposes that under the PRA a greater administrative burden would be created by implementing a primary use information collection system as opposed to a ``designed for'' test and information collection system, and thus claims the latter should be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds these comments are not relevant to the question of whether the Paperwork Reduction Act applies to the proposed and final rule. Although EPA finds the comments helpful in understanding the distinction between the ``primary use'' versus ``designed for'' issue, the comments fail to set forth any basis for asserting that the final rule, which adopts the proposed primary use test, contains any additional information collection requirements. Indeed, the comments presuppose the applicability of the PRA and focus on options to make information collection less burdensome without recognizing the significance of the fact that EPA has not required any information collection from manufacturers, dealers, or any private entity. EPA did not propose and has not included in the final rule any paperwork requirements and thus imposes no burden upon manufacturers, dealers or end users of nonroad equipment to submit to EPA any information regarding the use of nonroad equipment. EPA recognizes that in order for California to receive authorization from EPA for non-preempted nonroad equipment, California must present sufficient information that nonroad equipment is not used more than 51 percent as farm or construction equipment. California may thus require submission of relevant information to determine primary use, but EPA has not.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply towards this rulemaking. EPA has not set forth any specific requirements for these entities to collect or submit any data to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> N. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, EPA stated that the proposed regulation would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA determined that the proposed rule would affect manufacturers of nonroad equipment, a group without a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received public comments which suggested that the proposed rule would in fact affect small entities. One small business equipment dealer commented that if the proposed rule and CARB's Utility Engine Rule are enacted, and nonroad farm and construction equipment is separately regulated by California, then it would be adversely impacted. This same dealer, along with the Far West Equipment Dealers Association (FWEDA), stated that a scenario would arise where new and used nonroad farm and construction equipment purchased outside California would cost less than that found in California, and would thus adversely affect dealers of such equipment within California. FWEDA provided examples of several pieces of farm or construction equipment, and their projected cost increases in order to meet proposed CARB emission standards, in an effort to present the price differential for California dealers of such equipment. In addition, FWEDA states that the purchasers/users of their farm and construction equipment within California will be at an unfair cost disadvantage in relation to users outside of California's boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis, the issue is whether the final rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. EPA makes no change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its determination in the NPRM that the final rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities since the rule imposes no burden on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  entities. However, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reminds the parties which submitted comments on the applicability of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that California is specifically preempted from regulation of farm and construction equipment under 175 horsepower. The pieces of equipment cited by FWEDA as being potentially affected are preempted from regulation by California. Thus, the apprehension that such equipment will cost less outside of California is unfounded, as such equipment will be subject only to the federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

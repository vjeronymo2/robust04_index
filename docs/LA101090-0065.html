			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KERKORIAN AGREES TO PAY $35 MILLION TO SETTLE LAWSUIT  </P> <P> MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp. have agreed  to pay $35 million to settle a class-action suit filed in connection with the  1986 sale of the company.  </P> <P> The settlement, which came as the reclusive Kerkorian was scheduled to take the  stand in the 1-week-old trial, was tentatively approved by Los Angeles Superior  Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. on Tuesday, after both sides expressed  support for the agreement.  </P> <P> The only opposition came from four MGM/UA insurance carriers who had already  reached a separate settlement with shareholders. That settlement would be  canceled under the new agreement. The insurers, who approved the earlier  settlement over MGM/UA's objections, argued that they will now be exposed to  further liability.  </P> <P> The settlement, if finally approved Nov. 19, would end four years of often  rancorous litigation between former MGM/UA shareholders and Kerkorian. It would  also mean as much as an additional $3 per share for the parties to the suit,  according to the plaintiffs' attorney, James W. Mercer.  </P> <P> J. Michael Hennigan, Mercer's partner, said the agreement represents a victory  for stockholders, who initially sought $200 million. "When we look at the  number of shareholders likely to be represented, we think this is an extremely  favorable result for the class," Hennigan said.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, MGM/UA said it was forced into the "bad faith"  settlement by its insurance carriers, which had earlier agreed to pay $8  million to $20 million for a partial settlement of the suit. Under that  agreement, all defendants except Kerkorian and Tracinda were absolved of  liability. MGM/UA filed suit against the insurers as a result of the  settlement.  </P> <P> MGM/UA declined to say whether the company will pay the $35-million settlement  on behalf of Kerkorian and Tracinda. But Terry Christensen, Kerkorian's  attorney, said the company fully expects to recoup the $35 million, plus  punitive damages, from the insurance companies. Christensen also said MGM/UA  denies any wrongdoing in the case.  </P> <P> The class-action suit arose from the $1.5-billion sale of MGM/UA to Turner  Broadcasting Co. Shareholders maintained that Kerkorian undervalued the parent  company in a plan to reacquire United Artists, and eventually the MGM/UA name,  at a sweetheart price. MGM/UA maintained that the company negotiated a strong  deal for its shareholders.  </P></p>

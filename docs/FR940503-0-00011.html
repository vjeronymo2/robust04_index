			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Revision to Eligibility Record Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, the intent of the eligibility record date is to give long-term depositors a priority in purchasing stock. It has been the OTS's experience, however, that converting associations have opted for the minimum 90-day period for determining who is a long-term depositor. Upon review of this area, the OTS does not believe that use of the minimum 90-day period is a meaningful indicator of long-term depositor status and should be substantially lengthened. Thus, the OTS is amending the existing rule to require that the eligibility record date be set at a date no less than a year prior to board of director approval of the plan of conversion. In so doing, the OTS stresses that the one year period is a minimum time period; converting associations are encouraged to establish longer time periods to maximize the stock purchase priority for long-term depositors. The OTS also is requesting public comment as to whether a longer minimum time period would be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Priority to Account Holders and Voting Members Residing in the Association's Local Community <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current conversion regulations require that, following the subscription offering of conversion stock to account holders, all nonsubscribed shares be sold either in a public offering or a direct community offering giving ``a preference to natural persons residing in the counties in which the association has an office.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, the regulations currently permit a converting association to conduct a community offering of conversion stock in the local community, prior to a general public offering. The current regulations, however, do not permit converting associations to give account holders and voting members in those local communities a priority to purchase stock in the initial subscription offering. The OTS, has, however, on a case by case basis, recently permitted thrift subsidiaries of mutual holding companies to prioritize stock purchases in this manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR 563b.3(c)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon consideration of its favorable experiences with local community stock priorities in stock offerings of thrift subsidiaries of mutual holding companies, the OTS now believes it is appropriate to require converting associations to give the local community a more meaningful opportunity to participate in all conversions on a priority basis at the subscription offering stage. Accordingly, new &sect;563b.3 (c)(2)(i), (4)(i), and (5)(i) have been added to extend this preference to the eligible account holder, supplemental eligible account holder and other voting member priorities in the subscription stock offering. The preference in each priority group will be to those persons who reside in the association's ``local community'' or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting association. The term ``local community'' is defined in new &sect;563b.2(a)(19) to include all counties in which the converting association has a home or branch office, each county's standard metropolitan statistical area or the general metropolitan area of each of these counties and such other similar local area(s) as provided for in the converting association's plan of conversion, as approved by the OTS. Current &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(i)&hyph;(ii), 4(i)&hyph;(iv) and (5)(i)&hyph;(ii) will be redesignated as &sect;563b.3(c)(2)(ii)&hyph;(iii), (4)(ii)&hyph;(v) and (5)(ii)&hyph;(iii). For purposes of consistency, section 563b.3(c)(6)(iv) is revised to conform with new section 563b.3(c)(2)(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, 12 U.S.C. 1464(b) and 12 CFR 545.11(b) establish that a federally chartered savings association may accept and maintain deposit accounts within its discretion and subject to criteria established by the association. The OTS solicits public comment on whether a converting association should have the ability to prevent depositors who do not reside in the local community from participating in a conversion. In addition, the OTS specifically solicits comments as to whether an association, in anticipation of conversion, should be permitted to: (1) refuse to open accounts for potential depositors residing outside the local community, and (2) close accounts of depositors residing outside the local community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / People: Non-executive directors Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia, has accepted his first non-executive directorship by joining the board of Coats Viyella, Britain's largest clothing and textiles company. The former foreign secretary has told the Geneva-based committee he would take a pay cut, which would be off-set by the Pounds 15,000-Pounds 20,000 package he is expected to receive from Coats. A Coats spokesman explains that Lord Owen had been an acquaintance of a number of directors for some time and that his 'experience and understanding of international affairs will bring new and valuable insights to the company'. Although his role at the textiles group will be secondary to that in the former Yugoslavia, the company says he will attend the board meeting in London next month. Lord Owen says that for some time he has wanted 'to gain more experience of international business and now that the hectic pace of the negotiations has eased off, I have the time to pursue other activities'.</p>

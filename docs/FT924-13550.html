			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / OECD cuts growth forecast THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has drastically cut its forecast of growth in the industrialised world next year, largely because of sharp downward revisions of expected output in the US and Europe. Internal OECD forecasts now suggest that growth in the organisation's 24 member states will be only 2.1 per cent in 1993, compared with 3 per cent forecast for next year in June. It has scaled back its forecast of US growth to 2.4 per cent in 1993 from 3.6 per cent in June and its growth forecast for Japan to 2.6 per cent next year from 3.1 per cent four months ago. It expects Japan to grow by 3 per cent in 1994. These figures imply that growth in the European member states of the OECD will be about 1.5 per cent next year compared with the June forecast of 2.4 per cent. The OECD now expects unemployment in Europe will average 10.4 per cent of the labour force next year against expectations in June of a 9.3 per cent jobless rate. Unemployment in all OECD countries is now expected to average 8.2 per cent in 1993 against 7.3 per cent four months ago. The figures for the US and Japan are more precise than those for other parts of the OECD because it has just completed its annual surveys of these economies and will publish them shortly. Although the picture is incomplete, OECD officials decided to publicise the figures because of the marked deterioration in the industrialised world's economic prospects since mid-year. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD economics and statistics department, disclosed some figures during a visit to Japan this week. He blamed the bleak growth outlook on restrictive bank lending, a lack of business investment and private consumption and high long-term US interest rates. The OECD now expects its member states will grow by 1.5 per cent overall this year, compared with forecast growth of 1.8 per cent in June and 2.9 per cent forecast in July 1991. Both Japan and the US are forecast to grow by 1.8 per cent in 1992 against growth of about 1 per cent in the OECD's European member countries this year. The OECD said yesterday that it now expects unemployment in Europe will rise to 9.9 per cent this year against its June forecast of 9.3 per cent, while the jobless rate in all its members is expected to average 7.9 per cent against 7.5 per cent in the previous forecast. The OECD declined to provide any breakdown of its European growth or jobless forecasts, although earlier this month Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the organisation's secretary general, put German growth this year at 1 per cent. About the only good news is that inflation will stay subdued. The OECD has left unchanged its forecasts that inflation, measured by the GDP deflator, will average 3.5 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent in 1993 in its 24 member states.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Taras Lariokhin] </F>   [Text] The Hague, 25 Apr -- Russia is proposing to hold a  third international peace conference in 1999. This is stated in  a note by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The document  was read out today in the Palace of Peace at a session of the  Administrative Council of the permanent chamber of the  International Court of Arbitration by Leonid Skotnikov, the  Russian ambassador to the Netherlands.    On the instructions of President Boris Yeltsin and on behalf  of Russia as chairman of the two peace conferences at The Hague  in 1899 and 1907, which adopted the international convention on  the laws and customs of war, the Russian foreign minister  appeals to all states with a proposal to discuss the idea of  convening a third international peace conference, the note says.    The agenda of the proposed conference, the document says,  could include questions of improving the system of the peaceful  settlement of disputes, filling the gaps in international  humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts, and also  creating a system of international criminal justice in relation  to crimes against peace and mankind and other international law  violations.</p>

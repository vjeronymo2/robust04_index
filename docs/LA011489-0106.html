			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> OLYMPIC LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ORANGE LUTHERAN AGAIN DEFEATS WHITTIER CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Upset is a term usually reserved for a victory by an underdog. But to use it  for Orange Lutheran's 76-68 boys' basketball victory over Olympic League rival  Whittier Christian Friday at Orange Lutheran would be a misnomer.  </P> <P> Sure, the Lancers had lost to the Heralds 10 of the previous 11 games in the  past 5 seasons. And Whittier Christian has won six consecutive league titles,  although last season it tied with Orange Lutheran for the championship. But a  changing of the guard is in the making.  </P> <P> Last season the Lancers won the second of their two games against the Heralds.  </P> <P> The Lancers' improvement has continued. Early this season, they nearly knocked  off Capistrano Valley and forced Long Beach Wilson to double overtime before  they lost. Clearly, Orange Lutheran would challenge the Heralds this season.  </P> <P> No surprises then about the two consecutive home victories by the Lancers over  the Heralds? "No, I'm not surprised," Lancer Coach Jerry Simmons said.  "Whenever you put 10 basketball players on the court, anything can happen. I  didn't know we'd gel together like we have."  </P> <P> So does the Lancer victory qualify as an upset?  </P> <P> Said Simmons: "It's not really an upset. (It's) just two good teams that met  each other and battled back and forth. We just happened to be the one who had  the most points at the end."  </P> <P> After a 17-17 first quarter, the Lancers built a lead of as much as 7 on Daryl  Cole's basket with 5 minutes 38 seconds left in the half. Cole, a 6-foot 4-inch  junior, led the Lancers with 20 points.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran stretched its lead to as many as 13 on three occasions late in  the third quarter and was up 65-55 in the fourth after a basket by Pat  Bagatourian (19 points).  </P> <P> "I was real happy we were able to maintain our lead and stop their drives when  the came back," Simmons said.  </P> <P> The Heralds closed to within two twice early in the fourth quarter, but were  unable to take the lead.  </P> <P> "I've felt right from the beginning of the season they'd be one of the best  teams in the league," said Bob Brown, first-year Whittier Christian coach.  "They've proved they are a quality team."  </P> <P> The Lancers, rated No.2 in the Southern Section 2-A, improved their record to  12-3 overall and 5-0 in league play. Whittier Christian is 10-4, 3-1.  </P> <P> Ontario Christian 59, Santa Margarita 58 (OT) -- Mike Guevara made a 3-pointer  to tie the score, 55-55, with about a minute left in regulation for Santa  Margarita (5-8, 0-4), but the Eagles missed a shot as time ran out in overtime.  Freshman Dan Bathey had 19 points and Jeff Layne 15 for Santa Margarita. DENNIS  KAISER  </P></p>

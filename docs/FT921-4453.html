			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Revamping pensions law THE INADEQUACIES of trust law as a legal basis for the regulation of pension funds have been thoroughly exposed by the Maxwell saga. So, too, have the operations of the scanty checks and balances operated by the fund management watchdog, IMRO, and the Maxwell pensions funds' professional advisers. It follows that the House of Commons Social Security Committee's plea for a new pensions act will be difficult to resist. The chief regulatory problem concerning pension schemes relates to the inherent conflict of interest between the employer, whose representatives usually control the board of trustees, and the beneficiaries. Maxwell was an extreme example of the abuse of that potential conflict. But as the Select Committee rightly points out, the independence of pension fund assets from the finances of the employer has always been a myth. And the existing trust law framework has been far too heavily tilted against the interests of the beneficiaries, in terms of security, access to information and the ability to seek redress against incompetence or fraud. The merit of a new pensions act, a proposal fiercely resisted until recently by the dinosaurs of the pensions lobby, is that it would strengthen the independence of fund trustees and clarify some of the ambiguities surrounding the ownership and control of fund assets and surpluses. The committee's recommendation for a watchdog based on a beefed-up Occupational Pension Board also makes good sense. There are attractions, too, in the report's proposal for a relatively quick inquiry process before establishing the detailed contents of the legislation. Profit centre Yet the vested interests at stake in occupational pensions are such that even the fall-out from the Maxwell saga will not guarantee an easy passage for such legislation. The build-up of surpluses has encouraged employers to regard pension funds as a profit centre. That might appear to fly in the face of their fiduciary obligations as trustees, but in the real world it means that employers will only reluctantly forfeit control of these funds. The select committee's call to look into the case for a compensation scheme will similarly be attacked on the ground of its likely cost. On the more immediate issue of whether to compensate the Maxwell pensioners, the committee remarks that Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the spectacle of so many witnesses washing their hands of their responsibilities. And it recommends that an incoming government after the election should confront those banks which hold disputed share certificates of the pension funds with a view to extracting compensation; also the American and other investment banks who dealt on Mr Maxwell's behalf. The government's role, according to the committee's chairman, Mr Frank Field, would be to top up this contribution to ensure that pension rights are reinstated. Failed dismally The government has sticks and carrots to deploy in its dealings with the financial community. But even suitably reinforced moral suasion is unlikely to work unless the government itself admits a large measure of responsibility. Successive governments have encouraged the growth of private sector pension funds through substantial tax reliefs. They have failed to heed calls for an adequate regulatory framework. In the specific case of the Maxwell funds, the government's 1986 Financial Services Act failed dismally, since IMRO put no barrier in the path of Mr Maxwell's fund management company, despite clear warning signs. A government that has been prepared to compensate everyone from the investors in Barlow Clowes to the frustrated passengers of British Rail is in a weak position to argue with people who were mostly dragooned into the Maxwell pension funds as a condition of employment. Paying compensation for the Maxwell theft would raise issues about other victims of smaller frauds. But there is a prima facie case for compensation from the government and the bankers. They will both have to offer powerful arguments to escape the logic of the pensioners' case.</p>

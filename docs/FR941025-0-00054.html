			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Floodplain Management and Land Use Requirements in a Flood Control Restoration Zone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several comments concerning the elevation requirements in the proposed rule. One comment suggested that the local community should be the responsible entity for determining which structures should be elevated and also for determining the level at which these structures should be elevated. There were several comments requesting that FEMA apply the two-foot elevation that was supported in the legislative history instead of the three-foot requirement as established in the proposed rule for ``developed areas''. Two comments requested that structures be allowed to be constructed at grade in deep flood areas because elevating to three feet will not significantly reduce flood damages. Concern was also expressed that the elevation requirement was unreasonable because of the costs associated with the three foot elevation requirement and that this elevation would not aesthetically fit in with existing structures not built at this elevation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress, under Section 928 of Public Law 102&hyph;550, 42 U.S.C. 4014(f), directed FEMA to ``develop and promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months after the date of enactment of this subsection''. The law is specific in stipulating that the NFIP minimum elevation requirements for new construction in impacted areas subject to flood depths less than five feet and for infill, redevelopment and rehabilitation, regardless of flood depth, could not exceed three feet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FEMA believes the law is clear in establishing the floodplain management criteria in a flood control restoration zone. FEMA also believes that it is in the best interest of the NFIP to require structures to be elevated to the lower of either the AR BFE or the three-foot elevation permitted by the statute because of the increased flood risk to which properties will be exposed during the restoration period. Furthermore, the three-foot elevation of structures would afford additional protection from flood events that may exceed the capacity of the decertified flood protection system, which at a minimum must provide at least a 35-year level of protection in order to be eligible for a flood control restoration zone. The floodplain management criteria established for a flood control restoration zone also recognize that there is a chance that the project will not be restored. Consequently, the elevation requirement of three feet limits the exposure to the National Flood Insurance Fund if the project is not restored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The floodplain management criteria established are the minimum standards for the adoption of floodplain management regulations within those areas designated as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A). Any community may exceed the minimum standards by adopting more restrictive requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those seeking variances would use procedures that communities have established to deal with hardship and other unusual conditions. Communities administer the variances according to 44 CFR 60.6(a). We emphasize that while variances may reduce floodplain management requirements, they do not reduce flood insurance rates. By law, flood insurance rates must be charged commensurate with the risk to which a building is exposed. Any person seeking a variance to reduce floodplain management requirements should investigate the impact of the variance on the cost of flood insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the widely accepted protection techniques available for new construction of residential structures and non-residential structures provide practical and affordable alternatives that can be designed to be compatible with existing construction in a flood control restoration zone. For non-residential construction, the NFIP provides the option of elevation or floodproofing to resist the effects of flooding. Rather than specify an elevation or floodproofing method, the regulations give the property owner or builder the flexibility to choose the most appropriate technique. Similarly, there are several common, affordable methods of elevating residential structures, including elevation on earth fill, foundation walls, posts, piles, and piers. In some cases, it may be advantageous to use a combination of elevation methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Explosive health costs likely to fuel deficit THE US budget deficit is likely to reach Dollars 650bn (6.8 per cent of gross domestic product) within a decade unless Congress and the White House agree austerity measures, Mr Robert Reischauer, director the Congressional Budget Office, an independent advisory body, said yesterday. Sharp increases in the deficit towards the end of the decade - from the present level of about Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197.3bn) - would mainly reflect explosive growth of federal spending on health care. Mr Reischauer, however, was pessimistic about the chances of health-care reform generating significant budgetary savings before 2000. This was because reforms were likely to extend insurance coverage to 35m more people, improve the benefits provided under federal programmes and raise reimbursement rates in the public sector, to bring them more closely into line with private sector payments to doctors and hospitals. He was more optimistic about short-term economic prospects. The economy had entered a period of 'self-sustaining' growth, said Mr Reischauer, and would expand at an annual rate of about 3 per cent over the next two years. This would bring unemployment down to about 6.5 per cent by the end of 1994, compared with 7.3 per cent today. Consumer prices were likely to increase at an annual rate of only 2.75 per cent over the next few years. Mr Reischauer was testifying before the Senate budget committee following the release of the CBO's semi-annual economic forecast. Committee members were sceptical about his forecast which implies employment rising at a monthly rate of 200,000 over the next two years, much faster than in the recent past. Consumer confidence figures released yesterday showed the Conference Board index fell slightly to 77 against 78.1 in December. The stabilising of confidence does not imply economic weakness but suggests that some of the surge at the end of last year was a temporary reaction to President Bill Clinton's election victory. Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said yesterday that a Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn fiscal stimulus was likely this year. Mr Reischauer reacted unenthusiastically, pointing out that a small fiscal stimulus would do little for growth and worsen the longer-term problem of reducing the deficit. The latter was likely to climb modestly over Mr Clinton's first term, from Dollars 310bn this fiscal year to about Dollars 357bn in fiscal 1998, he said. It would then nearly double over the next five years, pushing the ratio of federal debt to 80 per cent of gross domestic product, the highest since the aftermath of the second world war. The main problem was runaway growth of spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal programmes for the elderly and poor, which would account for 7 per cent of GDP by 2003 against 3.7 per cent today.</p>

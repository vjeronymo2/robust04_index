			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: COMPOSER GRANT FOR BENNY CARTER, 82; 'JAZZ GOES TO SCHOOL' GETS  UNDER WAY  </P> <P> Tally up another kudo for the indefatigable Benny Carter.  </P> <P> The 82-year-old composer/saxophonist/trumpeter, who just last week was in New  York to conduct his orchestra at the "Hearts for Ella" American Heart Assn.  benefit at Avery Fisher Hall, is one of 18 jazz artists, and the sole Los  Angeles resident, to receive a grant from the 1989 Meet the  Composer/Rockefeller Foundation/AT&amp;T Jazz Program.  </P> <P> The grants, which total $283,000 and were announced recently, pair the  composers with a sponsoring music and performing arts organization for which  the composers create original works and then serve as artists-in-residence to  oversee the work's performance.  </P> <P> "We look forward to the results of these creative collaborations, and to  continuing our support of Meet the Composer in this initiative to stimulate  exchanges between jazz composers and artists working in other art forms,"  stated Alberta Arthurs, director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Arts and  Humanities Division, in a press release.  </P> <P> Carter, who received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1989, was awarded $15,000  to write two 20-minute pieces to feature vibraphonists Lionel Hampton and Milt  Jackson. The commissions, sponsored by the Lincoln Center of the Performing  Arts in New York, will be debuted at a later, unscheduled date with the  16-piece Classical Jazz Orchestra.  </P> <P> Other recipients included pianist Billy Taylor, who will write a 15-20 minute  work to be performed by his trio and the Juilliard String Quartet on a national  tour; saxophonist Julius Hemphill, who will concoct a 45-minute work for IMP  ORK, a 30-piece improvisational orchestra, also to be performed nationally;  guitarist Kenny Burrell, who is currently appearing at the Indigo Jazz Club in  Compton, who will write a work featuring the Boys Choir of Harlem; and pianist  Stanley Cowell, who will compose a 15-20 minute jazz piano concerto to be  performed with the Toledo (Ohio) Symphony Orchestra.  </P> <P> Meet the Composer was founded in 1974 to foster the creation, performance and  recording of works by contemporary American composers and to develop new  audiences for these works. The group sponsors over 4,000 such performances a  year. Information: (212) 787-3601.  </P> <P> Carter, whose latest LP is "Cookin' at Carlos 1" (Musicmasters), can be heard  leading a superlative mainstream band -- pianist Hank Jones, bassist Ray Brown  and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and singer Sylvia Sims are among the members --  on NPR's American Jazz Radio Festival, which airs locally on KLON-FM (88.1),  March 2, 10 p.m. The group plays such Carter classics as "Key Largo" and "Easy  Money."  </P> <P> The International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation (IOAJA) has kicked off its third  annual "Jazz Goes to School," a seven-week program that brings jazz and jazz  history to students in Los Angeles elementary and junior high schools.  Conceived and conducted by drummer Washington Rucker, JGTS utilizes various  musicians to demonstrate subjects such as "The Blues," "Boogie Woogie &amp;  Swing to Be-Bop" and "The Future of Jazz" to enthusiastic youngsters at schools  that included La Salle Elementary, Foshay Junior High and 54th Street  Elementary.  </P> <P> "The program is really progressing and each year we increase the size and the  scope of it," said Ruth Roby, IOAJA's executive director. "And the kids love  it. The letters we get from them are incredible. A lot of them say things like,  'We thought jazz would be old folk's music, but we like it.' And we get high  praise from teachers and principals as to what it does for the children."  Information: (213) 469-5589.  </P> <P> Any discographers out there looking for work? G.K. Hall &amp; Co. is  establishing a 17-volume "Jazz Discography Series" and is seeking contributions  from published discographers, or those with substantive works in progress.  These ardent folks will be asked to ferret out such facts as dates and  locations of recordings, listing of all released and unreleased tracks,  identification of soloists, etc., for recording sessions by the likes of Herbie  Hancock, Jaco Pastorius, Paul Chambers, Sonny Rollins, Artie Shaw and  Thelonious Monk. Information: Gary Carner, G.K. Hall Jazz Discography Series,  18 Becket Road, Belmont, Mass. 02178-3905.  </P> <P> The thumping two-beat sounds of Dixieland and traditional jazz will be served  up at the 11th annual Pismo Beach Mardi Gras Jazz Festival, being held  Friday-Sunday. Tickets are $30 for all concerts. Information: (800) 443-7778,  (805) 773-4382.  </P></p>

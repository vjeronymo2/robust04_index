Korean Authorities Urged To Stop War </F> Provocation Moves Against North" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Tokyo, February 2 (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim Chong-su,  chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful  Reunification, in a statement February 2 said that the scheme of  the United States to introduce a military intelligence team and  a large quantity of latest weapons into South Korea and stage  massive military exercises are an unpardonable criminal act to  further reduce South Korea not only to a colony and military  base but also to a nuclear forward base and military  intelligence centre of the United States and, for the present,  bar the DPRK-USA talks and bring the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the grave brink of war.    Noting that the United States has no intention at all to  solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula by peaceful  means and still seek to stifle the DPRK with strength, he said:    "This is a shameless perfidy to the dialogue partner. The  United States must immediately stop the reckless new war  provocation moves and get out of South Korea without delay and  the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime must unconditionally discontinue  its flunkeyist treacheries and stop seeking North-South  confrontation."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prague, April 29 (CTK) -- Parliament today  passed the bill submitted by Viktor Dobal (ODA) [Civic  Democratic Alliance] amending the law on extra-judicial  rehabilitations. The aim of the amendment is to enable property  to be returned to Jewish individuals or their heirs. Debate  surrounding the proposed return of property to the Jewish  communities which was confiscated under the Nazi regime and  post-war Czechoslovak communist governments has continued for  almost four years now.    The restitution law passed by the Federal Assembly in 1991  set 25 February 1948, the date of the communist take-over, as  the limit before which claims cannot be made. The act was  passed despite the appeals of the Federation of Jewish  Communities (FZO), which protested the 1948 limit "would exclude  from restitution almost all Jewish property which was  confiscated after September 1938 and which in most cases has not  been returned". [passage omitted]    A bill resolving many property claims of Jewish legal  entities and individuals was drafted by ODA deputies around  Viktor Dobal. The first part of the bill concerned 202 buildings  and sites formerly belonging to the religious Jewish community.  The list of property included 45 synagogues, 30 plots of land  where synagogues stood before the occupation, 24 cemeteries, 12  sites where cemeteries formerly were, ten religious schools and  ritual baths. The second and third sections of the bill deal  with the restitution of Jewish individuals, estimated at a few  hundred. [passage omitted]    A further government bill, produced in April, allows for the  redressing of property crimes committed between 1938 and 1945,  but only if the properties now are in state ownership. While  the government accepts in principle that it should pay  compensation for property in private or community ownership that  is restituted, it insists on limiting restitution to property  that was the subject of an approved restitution claim before 25  February 1948 and that has not already been returned to a  claimant.    In his opening speech to the parliamentary debate, Dobal  said the amendment had been drawn up in such a way as to  preserve the restitution concepts already made part of Czech  law, and to take into account the process of privatization  currently taking place.    He emphasized that the amendment did not concern  newly-founded restitution claims, did not even extend the amount  of property or cases of property having been taken away, nor did  it even extend the circle of persons with property claims. Its  only aim was to define more precisely those persons, in order to  remove the disharmony in court and clerical work in the judgment  of the situations of persons to whom property should have been  returned in accordance with post- war restitution laws. After  the communist coup of 1948, however, the property which had been  going to be returned to them was transferred to the state  instead.    Dobal said that from the above point of view both the law on  extra-judicial rehabilitations and the land law (his amendment  to which is also being debated today) discriminated, de facto,  against Jews, in the form in which they were passed by the  former Czechoslovak Federal Assembly.    The amendment was part of a wider bill which Parliament  failed to pass on February 18 because of the part concerning the  problem of Jewish physical persons, Dobal said.</p>

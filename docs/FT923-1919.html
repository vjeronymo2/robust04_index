			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (4): Window of opportunity opens - The danger of failure in the Uruguay Round of talks is grave / Trade for any normal human being would by now have consigned the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation to the realms of failed diplomacy, and would be battening down for trade war. There is much to be pessimistic about. Failure would put at risk international trade growth, estimated by economic modellers to be in the region of Dollars 195bn a year by the end of the decade. The danger of failure is now grave. As negotiations towards the ambitious Uruguay Round trade deal drag through their sixth year: Deadlines so often set and missed can no longer be moved. The most critical is the expiry in March next year of the US fast-track arrangements, which prevent the US Congress from unstitching the agreement, instead forcing it to either accept it or reject it in full. Even if EC and US leaders can put aside their differences and reach agreement before the end of the year, negotiations over trade in services, and on market access, need months of attention. Fierce disputes over shipping, financial services, and even ostensibly small matters such as trade in bananas, lie in wait. The creation of the single European market from January 1993, and agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement, signal an emerging preference for regional and bilateral trading arrangements which could easily harden into trade blocks. Exporters, particularly in Asia, fear that this will foster protectionism and undermine the multilateral rules that provide order in world trade. Trade disputes are mounting relentlessly. Many have been held in suspense in recent years, as negotiators have hoped a Uruguay Round settlement would provide new rules to resolve them. Most imminent is a dispute between the US and the EC over the EC's oilseeds subsidy programme, and over a boost for subsidised US wheat exports, which could spill over at any time into trade war. Queueing behind this dispute are simmering conflicts that include coal, steel-dumping and public-procurement policies. For the past 21 months, progress in the Uruguay Round has been stalled by a clash between the EC and the US over liberalisation of farm trade. The nub has been Europe's profligate farm subsidy regime, which has for many years wreaked havoc in the world food trade. Painstaking negotiation has brought the US and the EC to within inches of a conclusion - so close that most observers are baffled that agreement remains so elusive. Foremost among the dogged optimists who remain convinced that a Uruguay Round deal will eventually be agreed is Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which polices world trade, since 1980: 'I still have great confidence in the sagesse des nations. What we are doing is like climbing the last few metres of Everest without oxygen: we have to train a lot to be able to do it, and the last 200 to 300 metres are tremendously difficult.' He remains confident that success will eventually come, because publication in December last year of the 'final act' - a draft Uruguay Round text - took talks 'beyond the point of no return', and because it provided negotiators for the first time with a concrete picture of what stood to be gained: 'The round has had more results than we think,' he says. Furthermore, failure of negotiations would leave unresolved the problems that forced trading countries to the negotiating table in the first place. As a result, Mr Dunkel believes that a breakdown of the round could not be sustained for long: 'If we came to the tragic situation of missing the fantastic opportunities the round is offering, I will think it was an accident.' He recalls that throughout the turbulent and often hostile talks since 1982, when a new trade round was first proposed, a large number of governments have reformed their policies very much in line with the multilateral objectives of Gatt. The Gatt is being used more extensively than ever before, he notes. It is seeing unprecedented activity in handling disputes, examining regional trade agreements, reviewing countries' trade policies, not to mention dealing with a long queue of applications for accession and observer status - including Taiwan, China and a number of east European countries and former Soviet republics. It is closer than at any time in its history to having a membership that embraces the entire world. He believes that the Uruguay Round has been so difficult because it is 'completely different' from previous rounds. Its dauntingly wide-ranging agenda, covering everything from textiles to telecommunications, touches upon areas that governments have always regarded as their autonomous preserve - such as domestic farm subsidies or rules on services and intellectual property. There remains perhaps one window of opportunity through which the light of Mr Dunkel's optimism can shine: that between yesterday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty, and the US presidential elections on November 4. Hope rests on statements made by leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations, who met in Munich in July. At the end of the meeting, Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is widely believed to hold the key to a breakthrough on farm trade, concluded: 'I'm not only optimistic, I will go further. I expect that we will at last have reached (a breakthrough) by the end of this year.' The French referendum was critical because EC partners were unwilling to endanger the unpopular President Mitterrand's prospects of a positive referendum vote by further enraging French farmers with a Uruguay Round settlement that involves cuts in farm subsidies and volume cuts in food exports. France is Europe's leading farm exporter, so its farmers have most to lose from new concessions. With the referendum over, French opposition can be overridden. The US elections provide a deadline because it is doubtful whether any deal could be negotiated in the limited time between November 4 and the expiry of fast-track authority. Even assuming President Bush is re-elected, upheaval in the administration is inevitable. It is unlikely to be 'business as usual' until January. One can only hope that Mrs Carla Hills, the chief US trade negotiator, can stick to her guns when she says: 'This is the final - I repeat - the final week of the Uruguay Round. There will be no extension. The time for rhetoric has passed. Now is the time for straight talk and bottom lines.' Unhappily, she made that promise on December 3 1990.</p>

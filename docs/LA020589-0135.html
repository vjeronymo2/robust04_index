			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS ASSAIL SCHOOLS CHIEF FOR REDECORATION  </P> <P> The superintendent of the Mountain View School District, which is in a contract  dispute with employees, has come under criticism over what disgruntled teachers  say is a lavish bill for redecorating his office.  </P> <P> A partial bill of $11,909 for furniture and carpet installation in Supt. Julian  T. Lopez's office was approved by the school board this month. At the same  time, the district is stuck in a labor impasse involving the amount of annual  pay increases for teachers and program cutbacks.  </P> <P> A state-appointed fact finder has been called in to review the district's  financial situation and will eventually make a non-binding recommendation to  the school board on resolving the pay dispute. At the same time, a group of 120  elementary school teachers have filed grievances against the district over the  reassignment of three physical-education instructors, which teachers say has  left them overworked and jeopardized student safety.  </P> <P> The leader of the teachers' union criticized Lopez for lacking financial  perspective.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Luxury  </P> <P> "What we object to is not the fact that he is redecorating the office but that  he is redecorating at the students' and teachers' expense," said Kathleen  Hoolihan, president of the 314-member Mountain View Teachers Assn. and a  teacher at Cogswell Elementary School. "There are three or four (purchase  orders) which total about $13,000, and we don't think that's all of the cost of  redecorating his office."  </P> <P> Lopez, who became superintendent in July, bristled at the suggestion that  redoing his office was a luxury.  </P> <P> "It's ridiculous," Lopez said of the teachers' charges. "We are bargaining and  negotiating. What does that really have to do with buying furniture?"  </P> <P> Robert Beavers, the district's associate superintendent for business services,  said the changes were made to accommodate Lopez, a nonsmoker, moving into an  office occupied by the previous superintendent, who chain-smoked.  </P> <P> Defending the changes for health reasons, Lopez said: "There's not enough money  in the world to subject myself to that kind of exposure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Priorities Shifted  </P> <P> The superintendent acknowledged that the district's financial priorities have  shifted since he took over but argued that the changes have benefited students  with increased educational activities. The cuts the teachers are objecting to  have diverted funds to new programs that directly benefit the 8,484 students in  the district, he said.  </P> <P> "One of the things I've done is pump money into the schools and encouraged them  to take field trips," he said.  </P> <P> Besides field trips, Lopez said, the district is moving to replace temporary  trailers with permanent portable buildings on the district's crowded campuses.  </P> <P> As part of a pay adjustment for the last year of a three-year contract, the  district had offered a 2% increase for the school year that started in  September, contingent upon the teachers surrendering 30 minutes of class  preparation time during the week. The teachers -- who have asked for an 8.5%  increase -- refused, and the district implemented a 1.5% increase and  restructured preparation time for elementary teachers.  </P> <P> Under the contract, elementary teachers are allowed two hours a week to prepare  for their classes. Thirty minutes of that free time was guaranteed when the  district provided three physical-education teachers in 1987-88 to take over  each elementary teacher's physical-education class for one period a week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Double-Size Classes  </P> <P> But those physical-education instructors were reassigned this year, and the  classroom teachers have had to double up their physical-education classes with  a colleague's once a week to keep the 30 minutes as preparation time, Hoolihan  said.  </P> <P> District officials said that classroom aides were added this year to help  teachers supervise the double-size physical-education classes.  </P> <P> Lopez said that the district made the change in an attempt to find more  efficient ways to operate and that he does not believe in having  physical-education specialists supervise an elementary teacher's  physical-education class.  </P> <P> In September, the teachers began doubling up on classes once a week. Since  then, one student suffered a broken arm, and a teacher broke a leg. In each  case, Hoolihan said, a single instructor was supervising a class of up to 70  children.  </P> <P> "One teacher out there with all those children isn't safe," Hoolihan said.  "This may happen in any (staffing) situation, but the teachers feel it was the  lack of adequate planning. We feel this program was arbitrarily cut to save  money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Playground Safety  </P> <P> Because of the injuries, Hoolihan said, teachers at Cogswell have given up the  preparation time to teach their own physical-education classes, five days a  week. Hoolihan said the teachers' grievances against the district over the loss  of the physical-education specialists will go before an arbitrator in March.  </P> <P> Lopez denied that the changes have had any effect on playground safety.  </P> <P> The physical-education specialists often taught more than one class at a time  last year, Lopez said. "The only difference is it was someone else doing it  other than the classroom teachers.  </P> <P> Lopez took umbrage with the teachers' allegations, which he said were unfounded  and unbecoming.  </P></p>

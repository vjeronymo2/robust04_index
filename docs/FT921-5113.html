			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies Surely the foreign exchange market is in danger of over doing its love affair with the dollar. The latest US indicators may point to recovery, but it is hard to see the economy roaring ahead to the point where short-term interest rates have to be raised in an election year. Thus, there seems little justification for extending the surge which took the dollar over DM1.67 and Y132 in late European trading yesterday. Some appreciation of the US currency was inevitable as the prospect of still lower US interest rates receded. It has been fuelled recently by a rise in Treasury bond yields which has restored their attraction to international investors. That could continue to underpin the dollar, but a further strong advance does not seem justified, at least against the D-Mark. The Bundesbank will hardly relish the inflationary impulse from a weak German currency. The yen's case is different, not least because Japanese investors seem to have lost all faith in their own stock market. So the Bank of Japan will remain under pressure to cut interest rates. That is not the only reason why yesterday's intervention left the market unimpressed. Local institutions are covering short dollar positions ahead of the financial year-end. Last but not least, the yen is scarcely helped by the capital outflow going to redeem the plethora of equity-linked bonds launched in Europe in the mid-1980s.</p>

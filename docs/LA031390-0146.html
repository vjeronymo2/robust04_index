			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAPPLETHORPE LEAVES $1.3 MILLION TO HOSPITALS  </P> <P> Robert Mapplethorpe, the homosexual photographer whose work helped spark a  controversy over government funding of the arts, has left $1.3 million to the  two hospitals that treated him for AIDS.  </P> <P> Beth Israel Medical Center in New York received $1 million and New England  Deaconess Hospital in Boston received $300,000, it was announced Monday.  </P> <P> Mapplethorpe died of AIDS a year ago at the age of 42.  </P> <P> "Robert Mapplethorpe's legacy as an artist is well established," said Michael  Stout, president of the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. "This gift is his  legacy as a caring human being who wanted to make life more bearable for people  with AIDS."  </P> <P> After his death, Mapplethorpe's works, along with those of artist Andres  Serrano, ignited a firestorm when Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected to  government funding of an art show entitled "The Perfect Moment," a Mapplethorpe  retrospective that included photographs depicting gay couples and  sadomasochistic images in addition to his trademark shots of flowers and  celebrities.  </P> <P> The Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. canceled the show in response to  pressure from Helms and other congressmen, after which several Corcoran board  members resigned and artists pulled out of Corcoran shows to protest the  cancellation.  </P> <P> Eventually, Corcoran president Christina Orr-Cahall was forced to resign, and  Congress passed a ban keeping the National Endowment for the Arts from funding  art deemed "obscene." The ban expires September 30.  </P></p>

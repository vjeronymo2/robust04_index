			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Berlusconi confirms interest in GS MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate whose privately-owned Fininvest holding company also controls the listed Standa retailing group, yesterday confirmed his interest in buying GS, the supermarkets chain owned by the state-owned SME foods, catering and retailing concern. SME is being split up before disposal as part of the government's privatisation drive. However, the fate of its retailing activities remains unclear amid signs that IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which controls SME, would like to retain significant roles in retailing and catering. GS accounted for almost 40 per cent of SME's total group sales of L5,814bn (Dollars 3.9bn) in 1991. Apart from GS supermarkets, the unit includes a rising number of out-of-town hypermarkets, which are one of the fastest-growing areas of Italian retailing. Mr Berlusconi bought Standa in 1988 from the Montedison chemicals group. The company, which is Italy's biggest retailing concern, made net profits of L31bn on sales of L4,028bn in 1991. Although earnings have improved substantially in recent years, Standa continues to suffer from a downmarket image and an unfocused range. However, its Euromercato hypermarkets subsidiary has shown sharp growth following heavy investment in new outlets. Mr Berlusconi said Standa's 1992 sales, not due to be released until later this year, improved by 10 per cent last year, coming in 'some L30bn over budget'. Mr Berlusconi also said that Mondadori, Italy's biggest publishing and magazines group, should show sales of L1,600bn last year, against L1,460bn in 1991. Mr Berlusconi confirmed the group, which was subjected to a bruising battle for control between himself and Mr Carlo De Benedetti before being divided in 1991, was now in sound financial shape.</p>

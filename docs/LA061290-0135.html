			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NO SWEAT? Will his vote against the sweatshop bill (B1) cost Assemblyman Curt  Pringle (R-Garden Grove) votes in his district, where the sweatshops are  located? . . . Hard to tell, says Democratic opponent Tom Umberg, who plans to  make an issue of it. . . . Pringle found the bill unfair to manufacturers, but  Umberg called it an issue of values: "This was a choice between corporations  and children. . . . Whether he loses votes or not, he's on the wrong side."  Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

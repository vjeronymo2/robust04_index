			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Strong &amp; Fisher, the sheep skin processor and leather clothing manufacturer 70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, yesterday reported a 60 per cent fall in interim profits, from Pounds 5.23m to Pounds 2.17m. Although turnover for the six months to end-June was static at Pounds 44.4m, operating profits declined from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 675,000. The pre-tax figure was struck after a Pounds 535,000 profit arising from the disposal of surplus land and buildings and interest receivable of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 918,000). Mr Michel Buswell, chairman, said the balance sheet remained strong, with healthy cash resources. The leather division was still profitable, he added, although the second half would be adversely affected by the weakness of the dollar. Earnings per share came out at 0.9p (2.7p) basic, or 0.8p (2p) fully diluted.</p>

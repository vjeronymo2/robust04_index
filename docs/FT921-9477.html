			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: The Cutting - Bush Theatre Maureen O'Brien is an actress whose first stage play displays an actorly delight in the linguistic possibilities of the theatre. She stretches silences and kneads language into unearthly stop-start rhythms. The Cutting, apparently based on a true story, weaves this language around a series of meetings between a middle-aged male psychiatrist and a young female prisoner on remand for apparently murdering her mother and feeding her, bit by bit, to the birds. Dominic Dromgoole's staging is by contrast brutally unpoetic. For much of the first act, Sian Thomas' Judith stands mute and unblinking in the dingy prison set, staring out of an imaginary window and wearing the patience of both psychiatrist and audience wafer-thin. The shrink's job is to coax an explanation from Judith of her mother's macabre death, thus releasing her from both the physical limbo of detention and the psychological limbo of her silence. Just as he is about to abandon her as a hopeless case, Judith begins to speak. Bit by bit, the job becomes a mission and professional interest becomes personal affection. Paul Freeman, watery blue eyes uncannily focused, is not given much of a progression beyond the obvious one from exasperation to love, but he keeps attention pinned on the subject of the play, whose personality unfurls with her story. The fascination of this woman lies in her resistance to facile categorisation. Thomas' cut-glass diction, and Judith's capacity to soar from fractured monosyllables into metaphorical speech, make it impossible to pop her into any of the obvious social - or theatrical - pigeonholes. At best she becomes the figment of a wholy original imagination, while at worst, like the play, she seems precious and stagy.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pressac advances 10.5% Pressac Holdings, Nottingham-based electro-mechanical engineering group which specialises in circuit board manufacture, lifted interim profits by 10.5 per cent and anticipated 'a tangible increase in sales' during the second half. Pre-tax profits for the six months to January 31 increased from Pounds 619,000 to Pounds 684,000, on turnover up slightly to Pounds 16.3m, compared with Pounds 15.9m. The group has been in a holding pattern in recent months as weak demand from continental Europe has offset growth in the US and the fragile recovery of the UK. This prevented Pressac from gaining full immediate benefit from its heavy investment in automotive components. But the introduction of new products, not least circuit boards for heated wing mirrors, eased pressure on margins. Operating profits rose from Pounds 842,000 to Pounds 912,000. Component sales to the automotive industry rose by 15 per cent during the first half and new contracts won in the US come on stream this month. In Europe there is some hope that depletions of production schedules in the first half will be restored in the second. Delays in production schedules meant a build-up of stocks, which in turn had affected gearing, raising it by the end of the first half to 51 per cent. Mr Geoff White, the chief executive, said that by the year-end gearing should be back to where it started the year - 41 per cent. First-half earnings per share were 1.71p (1.55p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p. Total payments for 1992-93 were 2.57p.</p>

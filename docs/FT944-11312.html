			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A job for the CBI The chancellor's 'Wise Men' and the Confederation of British Industry have recently drawn attention to the plight of the unemployed. At a time when many are pointing to other - more promising - features of the UK's economic performance, they are right to remind the chancellor that a colossal labour market failure remains. The Treasury panel of independent economic forecasters is well-known for its inability to reach a consensus about what Mr Kenneth Clarke should do next. And yet - as a special section of its latest report points out - only one of the Wise Men, Professor Patrick Minford, expects unemployment to fall much below 2m during the next three years if the government does not make greater efforts to reduce it. Politically, nothing would do more to tarnish three further years of recovery than a failure to get the unemployed back to work. But any policy to reduce unemployment confronts a danger. Wage growth - one of the traditional causes of inflation in the UK - has been unusually subdued in the recovery to date. But this will not last long if many people stay out of work so long that employers think they are no longer suitable for the jobs available. Firms will then fill vacancies by offering higher wages, rather than giving the jobs to the unemployed. Re-connecting the long-term unemployed to the labour force is thus in employers' own interests, and it was encouraging to see the CBI take up the issue in a report published last week. Its study goes beyond the standard prescriptions of more training and education, to suggest reforms which could have a more immediate impact. Predictably, the authors are better at identifying the government's failings than in proposing ways of improving the contribution of employers. It suggests reforms to the tax and benefit system to improve incentives to offer, and accept, low-paid employment. Similarly, the CBI believes the employment service could do more to bring companies and the unemployed together. There is much the government could do in these areas. But the report implicitly recognises that sustainable economic growth, which will produce jobs, will require changes in attitude as well as changes in policy. The UK economy seems unable to employ a large proportion of its workforce without stimulating inflation. This will change only if more employers decide to fill vacancies with relatively low-paid workers, who must be trained, rather than tempting their competitors' employees with higher wage offers. On past experience, state subsidies can take companies only so far down this route. Persuading the government to act in the long-term interest of UK business is one thing. The CBI would do even more for the unemployed, and the economy at large, if it convinced its members to do the same.</p>

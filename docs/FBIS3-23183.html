			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, Press Association] </F>   [Text] A new trans-Irish border opinion poll tonight  confirmed an overwhelming demand for Sinn Fein and the IRA to  renounce violence and enter political negotiations.    The survey--being detailed in tomorrow's Irish Independent  newspaper and on BBC TV's On the Record--coincides with this  weekend's Sinn Fein annual conference in Dublin.    It also highlighted large support for a security crackdown  on  all para-military groups if the terrorism continues.    The poll was carried out last Wednesday in the Irish  Republic  by Irish Marketing Surveys and on Wednesday and Thursday in  Northern Ireland by Ulster Marketing Surveys.    It came at the height of growing speculation over the timing  of the long-expected response of the IRA and their Sinn Fein  spokesmen to the Downing Street peace declaration.    Earlier tonight, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams made it  clear in his keynote speech to the party conference that more  time was required for consultations about the joint Anglo-Irish  declaration.    The cross-border survey showed a 79 percent endorsement of  the principle in the Downing Street declaration that it would be  wrong to impose a united Ireland in the absence of the  freely-given consent of a majority of people in Northern Ireland.    And an all-Ireland figure of 76 percent--80 percent in the  Republic and 68 percent in Northern Ireland--supported the  decision of the London and Dublin governments to go ahead with  new inter-party talks on Ulster's future, given that the  republican movement has so far failed to reply to the peace  statement.    Of those questioned on the southern side of the border, 94  percent agreed with calls on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce  violence.    In Northern Ireland the figure was 85 percent--87 percent of  the Province's Protestants and 82 percent of the Catholics.    The security clampdown was supported by an average 75  percent  in the two parts of Ireland. In Ulster the move was backed by  88 percent of the Protestants and 61 percent of the Catholics.    Adults over the age of 18 took part in the survey--1,053 in  the Irish Republic and 863 in Northern Ireland, reflecting  population and other factors.</p>

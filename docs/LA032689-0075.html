			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELICIOUS APPLE FARM  </P> <P> We stayed at the Apple Farm Inn &amp; Restaurant, 2015 Monterey St., San Luis  Obispo 93401, phone (805) 255-2040, as a result of Jerry Hulse's recommendation  in "The Heart's Hideaways" (Feb. 12) and it was everything Hulse said it was .  . . and more! Very charming, spotless, friendly and beautifully decorated. And  delicious! It was our favorite spot for a three-day getaway. I'm keeping the  whole page of "The Heart's Hideaways." Thank you so much for this story.  </P> <P> MR. and MRS. DON SHEARING  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates  </P></p>

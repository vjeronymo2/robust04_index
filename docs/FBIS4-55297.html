			<p>BFN     [Text] Our reporter Zlatina Georgieva has learned that  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov has prepared a  decision on discontinuing the prerogatives of the National  Assembly on the basis of Article 86, Paragraph 1, and in  connection with Article 64, Paragraph 3, and Article 98,  Paragraph 1 of the Bulgarian Constitution. The decision has not  yet been submitted to the National Assembly office.    The decision might sound strange, but legal experts in the  National Assembly pointed out that according to the  aforementioned articles the National Assembly could adopt such a  decision and then adopt a special procedure for setting new  elections, whose date should be fixed by the president of the  Republic.    According to a member of the Radical Democratic Party, of  which Yordanov also is a member, Yordanov's motives are related  to the fact that the National Assembly is not adoptingthe  important economic bills and is thus blocking reform in the  country.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> $639,000 TO SUPPORT SCIENCE PROGRAMS  </P> <P> UC Irvine biology professor Eloy Rodriguez has received a $639,000 grant to  support science education programs and science summer camps for minority and  low-income children.  </P> <P> The three-year award was given by the California Postsecondary Education  Commission's Eisenhower Grant Program, university officials said.  </P> <P> It will help pay for Rodriguez's KIDS camp (Kids Inventing and Discovering  Science), an intensive four-week summer school program at UCI for about 50  bilingual and Spanish-speaking students ages 5 to 11.  </P> <P> "A growing number of youngsters are left out of the educational loop,  particularly if they are poor or not proficient in English," said Rodriguez,  who recalled excelling in high school science classes yet was discouraged from  pursuing college by guidance counselors.  </P> <P> "The KIDS program was designed to engage these students and to keep them  excited about scientific inquiry," he said.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, 43, who studies toxicology in plants, said the summer camp will be  expanded next year to include children from other ethnic groups.  </P> <P> The funds will also help support Project Storyline: Science, a model that  Rodriguez and his colleagues are developing for teacher training and science  instruction for children in kindergarten through eighth grades. The aim is to  create 35 instructional courses that deal with basic scientific concepts.  Twelve of those courses will be translated into Spanish.  </P></p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Denmark, Finland feature in quiet week EQUITY markets were relatively calm last week with even the arrival of a new US president doing little to stimulate activity, and the FT-A World index was barely changed in local currency terms. The Pacific Rim was quiet ahead of the Chinese New Year holidays. In Europe, the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to lower interest rates, for the time being at least, came as no surprise; but some disappointing corporate news, particularly in France, left some markets weak. Lyonnaise-Dumez affected Paris as its shares lost some 14 per cent in two days on news that 1992 profits would be down about 65 per cent on 1991. However, the underlying strength of the market showed itself and the CAC-40 index actually showed a slight gain on the week. Some analysts believe that hopes of lower European interest rates and the possibility of the change of government in March is currently supporting sentiment. Denmark and Finland showed the widest fluctuations from an otherwise average week with, respectively, an 8 per cent rise and a 7 per cent fall in local currency terms. Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank in London, comments that Denmark was encouraged throughout the week by hopes that the Social Democratic party would be able to put together a new government. The formation was finally agreed yesterday afternoon. However, Mr Tron does not expect a change in the tight economic policy pursued by the former administration, while expectations of a 'Yes' vote in the second Maastricht referendum due in April should further encourage the market. Finland fell as talks between the government and opposition parties failed to reach agreement over plans to increase funds to support the banking sector from FM20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) to FM50bn and the HEX index slipped 5 per cent on the week.</p>

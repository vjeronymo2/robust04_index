			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "DPF Beats Records in Drug </F> Seizures"]    [Text] For the Federal Police Department [DPF], 1993 was  the year of drugs. The volume of drugs seized between January  and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the  big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine  seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by  the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the  drug out of circulation.    According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase  in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become  the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and  Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide  range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports  pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug  in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many  ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats  or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be  sold on the U.S. or European market.    Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest  producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and  Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack  of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon  Region, to transport the coca base.    In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with  international organizations and foreign governments for the  purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany,  Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have  been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign  experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the  results are visible in the considerable number of  "mules"--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they  boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro  and Sao Paulo.  <H5>  Operations Cover Entire Country </H5>   Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not  restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted  in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two  metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato  Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in  Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia.    And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu  (Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice  of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the  region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which  makes access and policing difficult.    The various operations taking place in 1993 included the  destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco  Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a  little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known  as "Monte Santo," "Ouricuri," and "Independence," took place  with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate  the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region.  <H5>  Amphetamines Gaining Ground </H5>   A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the  appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market.  Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the  country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of  laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more  than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two  illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the  other in Florianopolis.    The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA,  whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured  on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the  laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang  with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande  do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new  escalation of drugs in our country.  <H5>  Battle Against Illegal Prospecting </H5>   The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action  in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug  traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani"  arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a  survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest,"  which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations  beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three  aircraft and a large quantity of fuel.    The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency  stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara  Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the  protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and  cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were  seized.    In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the  year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the  drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving  underage girls forced into prostitution.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / EC calls for full telecoms competition THE European Community should open all international and domestic telephone calls to full competition by 1998, according to one of the two EC commissioners responsible for telecommunications liberalisation. In a speech to post and telecoms representatives in Brussels yesterday, Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said he favoured the controversial combination of a set target and short timetable for full telecoms liberalisation. He ruled out an 'immediate big bang' to open up the telecoms market, but he said a longer transition period - for example, up to the end of this century  -'would restrict the development of the single market without justification', and impede technical advances. Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, are expected to submit formal proposals to their Commission colleagues within the next two weeks in the hope that EC telecoms ministers will be able to discuss the Commission plans at their meeting on May 10. If approved, the plans will trigger a long and possibly acrimonious debate between member states, some of which are fiercely protective of their national telephone monopolies. France, Belgium and Germany, for example, think it will be difficult to achieve full liberalisation within five years, while Britain and Denmark have already made moves to open their markets to competition. Mr Van Miert tried to soothe potential opposition yesterday by making clear that liberalisation had to be accompanied by important safeguards to preserve benefits for all users. 'What I am aiming for is not a change from the current highly regulated monopolies based on member states to an unbridled free-for-all,' he explained. But he ruled out an intermediate stage during which only telephone calls between EC member states would be opened to competition. Mr Van Miert said that most telecoms operators and regulators consulted by the Commission over the last six months had opposed the suggestion, which was originally favoured by Brussels. Liberalisation would give all potential operators, including those from outside the EC, access to European telephone networks. But Mr Van Miert hinted in his speech that the Commission should press for equal access to third-country markets in return. According to Mr Van Miert, the Community should first reinforce existing EC measures which open up specialised telecoms services representing 20 per cent of the market, before preparing full liberalisation of the remaining 80 per cent.</p>

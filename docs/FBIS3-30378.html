			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Endre Juhasz, administrative state secretary </F> at the Ministry for International Economic Relations, by Katalin  Bossanyi; place and date not given: "Customs Lifted, Rights of  Freedom Extended"]    [Text] Hungary's Association Agreement with the European  Union comes into force today, 1 February. We interviewed Endre  Juhasz on this occasion on the significance of the agreement and  the chances of the Hungarian economy to catch up with and  integrate into Europe.    [Bossanyi] What do we have to know about today: What will  change compared to the already known export allowances?    [Juhasz] The trade section of the association agreement came  into force in March 1992, therefore, the paragraphs of the  agreement that are valid from today do not affect the already  functioning trade system. In fact, in 1993 in Copenhagen, a  decision was made on accelerating and extending this. For  Hungary, and the European Union [EU], the 1 February date rather  has a significance of principle. From today, the regulations  that deal with the other three market economy freedom rights --  in addition to the trade agreement -- will begin to operate.  These apply to the movement of labor, capital, and services.  Through this, rights and obligations that are very important  for Hungary come into force, and at the same time, the  implementation of the cooperation program can also begin. The  preparation of the legal harmonization program belongs here, and  the planning of projects affecting industry, agriculture,  investment development, and education and training, which we  have not been able to start yet. The cooperation also extends  to various areas of transport and traffic, environmental  protection, and culture.    [Bossanyi] Let us look at the already existing section of  the Association Agreement, namely the trade section. In your  experience, is the agreement entirely advantageous for the  country or are there any areas where we are now in a  disadvantageous position for various reasons?    [Juhasz] In 1992, the agreement had a clearly dynamic effect  because Hungarian exports to the European Community increased  much faster than exports to other areas that have similar market  economies -- for example the countries of the European Free  Trade Association [EFTA] or the United States. This no longer  applied in 1993, mainly due to the western recession. The  decline of our exports to the EU was more marked than to other  regions.    [Bossanyi] Does this mean that the Association Agreement did  not give us concrete advantages in the deepening recession?    [Juhasz] On the contrary. Without the agreement, our  exports would probably have fallen even more. Even then, we  managed to use our preferential quotas, except in some areas of  agriculture. However, the lack of competitive Hungarian products  was the main reason for the latter.    [Bossanyi] Did we also fill our textile quota?    [Juhasz] We had the opportunity to do so, exports were not  hindered by the quotas. In this area, the decrease of labor  applied to imported materials with the purpose of reexport was a  disadvantage for us. Quotas no longer exist in other industrial  areas. However, there are so-called customs ceilings and  customs quotas. If we exceeded these, then in theory, the EU  could reinstate the customs but this did not happen last year.  All in all, we can say that the Association Agreement gave  greater scope to Hungarian goods in spite of the recession.    [Bossanyi] When the Association Agreement was signed, many  interest groups -- and mainly the domestic agrarian lobby --  argued that the Hungarian government had given concessions in  the hope of achieving association relatively quickly, and it  does not adequately protect, for example, agricultural exports  from the EC's protectionism. Now they probably feel that their  worries were justified.    [Juhasz] I do not think so because the fact that we did not  make full use of the agricultural quotas mainly has domestic  economic reasons. Naturally, it can always be said that the  doors could have been opened wider in the area of technical  conditions. However, it is our experience that we usually have  problems filling the quotas.    [Bossanyi] The EU very firmly protects and supports its  agricultural producers, while in Hungary, the opposite of this  is happening. The producers of the countries that became  associate members earlier -- Greece, Turkey, and Spain -- also  suffered the same way. Will we also support the agricultural  interests that they represent?    [Juhasz] In the current phase, we have a conflict of  interests with the EU's agricultural lobby because we would also  like to expand our marketing possibilities in the future. The  EU's agricultural producers and their interest groups are our  competitors. Naturally, we are trying to learn from the  experience of other countries but this does not mean that we do  not compete with each other.    [Bossanyi] Are you holding talks on further extending the  quotas?    [Juhasz] In the light of the GATT Uruguay round, the quotas  will presumably have to be renegotiated. The conceptual system  of the association agreement will have to be amended because a  decision was arrived at within the framework of the 1993 GATT  agreement that measures other than customs have to be  eradicated. One of these, for example, is the skimming system.  Our concept was in accordance with a former system, therefore,  this can now be changed. In my view, we will probably have  talks on adjusting the customs and we are hoping to use this to  expand our advantages.    [Bossanyi] These will not only apply to agricultural  products, will they?    [Juhasz] They will. In the case of industrial products, in  the spirit of the Copenhagen program, all limitations will be  lifted within a foreseeable time. From 31 December 1994, all  customs duties will cease to exist in the so-called sensitive  product groups. There are almost 100 of these. Customs duties  will cease to exist on steel products by the end of 1995 and on  textiles by the end of 1996. This affects almost all industrial  products, therefore, we consider that the possibilities of  Hungarian products getting to Union markets are good. In  addition to this, we are also making progress in standardization  and in coordinating the quality requirements, but this is a  continuous task, it is not determined by deadlines.    [Bossanyi] What changes can be expected in the assertion of  the other three economic rights of freedom that are now becoming  a possibility for us?    [Juhasz] The current step of the Association Agreement opens  the markets for Hungary in areas other than trade. However,  these deadlines are relatively long, some are five or 10 years  away, but some areas come into force now. For example, in  purchases by authorities, we can participate in the EU's  contract awarding procedures according to national treatment  from 1 February. This means that, in bids, the Hungarian  suppliers will be treated the same way as the other enterprises  of the Union. At the same time, we will only give them this  right in 10 years' time. This is also part of the process of  catching up.    [Bossanyi] Will our employment chances increase?    [Juhasz] It is well known that very little progress has been  made in this area. However, it is not negligible that Hungarian  workers will have to be treated without discrimination in the  area of the EU as regards their working conditions and pay.    [Bossanyi] Is the associate membership a forerunner to full  membership?    [Juhasz] The government declared that it wants to achieve  full membership by the end of the century. The associate  membership makes it possible for us to deal with this in an  institutional form. Talks on Hungarian membership will begin  when the EFTA talks are completed. This will probably be in  1994. In addition to this, the Union will convene an  inter-governmental conference in 1996 which is meant to  reexamine the institutional system. This conference should  ensure that the Union remains able to function in spite of the  larger membership. It will be decided after this when we can  begin talks on our membership. Based on our current  information, we think that this will be in 1997. This is the  planned scenario. However, a separate government decision is  needed before the application for membership can be submitted.</p>

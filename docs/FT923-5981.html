			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: Bounced The fall of sterling has taken on added significance in the Dorset resort of Lyme Regis, where, in counting his day's takings from holidaymakers, a market proprietor dropped two Pounds 1 coins on the stone floor. One bounced markedly less than the other. Although both looked genuine, the impact chipped the yellow surface of the non-bouncer, revealing grey metal beneath, which turns out to be lead. A further check of the takings discovered a second coin of similar sort. Both are convincingly moulded with milled and inscribed edges and turn the market scales at the same weight as the genuine article - three-eighths of an ounce. What profit the forgers have left after production costs can only be guessed at. But, given the effects of wet weather as well as recession on Britain's holiday trade, the proprietor is regretting having to hand the coins to the police. He has already had bids for them from curio collectors of Pounds 1.20 a piece.</p>

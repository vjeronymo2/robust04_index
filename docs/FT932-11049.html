			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Disability benefit service criticised THE delivery of the new Disability Living Allowance has been a 'nightmare' for many claimants, the Commons social security committee said in a report yesterday. Disability Living Allowance and Disability Working Allowance replaced previous benefits for disabled people in April 1992. There was, says the committee, a 'tremendous surge of claims' for which the government's Benefits Agency was not prepared. By April last year the agency was already swamped with work and it soon became apparent that it was in 'complete administrative disarray'. The committee says it is evident that, a year after introduction of the new benefit, many people were still waiting for too long for decisions on claims for Disability Living Allowance. 'We believe that in certain very serious cases the delays in paying Disability Living Allowance are tantamount to maladministration.' Social Security Committee, Third report: Disability Benefits.

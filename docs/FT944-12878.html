			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Efforts to curb sleaze have a hollow ring: Corruption measures still leave loopholes With the British House of Commons facing almost daily allegations of parliamentary dishonesty, and corruption stories emerging steadily from France and Italy, Europe's commission and parliament are addressing how best to avoid such accusations themselves. The parliament is not in a promising position. Recent reports have tainted it with an image of generous and inefficiently administered expenses, corporate goodies dished out by zealous lobbyists and thinly justified overseas trips at the taxpayers' expense. Mr Klaus Hansch, the parliament's president, says it needs to put itself in an 'irreproachable' position, and this week announced measures to slash expenses. 'The situation has become untenable for cost reasons and for the image of the parliament abroad,' he said, outlining proposals to cut the number of meetings parliamentary committees can hold outside either Strasbourg or Brussels to one every four years from one every year. He has also proposed that the size of delegations visiting non-EU countries be halved. The two measures, he says, will save Ecu5.5m (Pounds 4.32m). But even if the parliament smartens up its image on expenses, socialist MEPs are arguing that arrangements for declaring interests are not sufficiently stringent. There is a mandatory register of financial interests, but it is not published as a parliamentary document and is therefore not widely circulated. Any European who wants to check his or her MP's interests has to travel to Strasbourg or to Brussels to transcribe information by hand. Photocopies are not permitted. Secondly, the Socialist group argues that not enough detail is entered in the register. An MEP has to declare for whom he or she is working, but not what the work is. Further, according to Mr Glyn Ford, Socialist spokesman on parliament rules, only direct financial interest has to be declared. Friendly associations with foreign countries, which result in all-expenses paid holidays, for example, are not recorded. 'I would like to know these things when evaluating members' speeches,' says Mr Ford. 'If someone is giving his opinion on what is going on in East Timor, then an all expenses paid trip to Indonesia is relevant.' Meanwhile, the parliament is discussing how best to ensure that Europe's 21 new commissioners, due to take office early next year, do not harbour political or financial conflicts of interest. Commissioners have always had to take oaths ahead of their period in office, declaring their full independence and promising not to seek earnings from any other source. This led to certain commissioners relinquishing obvious interests. For example, Mr Abel Matutes, the former Spanish commissioner, handed over control of his hotel group to his brother before going to Brussels. This time, the parliament is determined to use the extra powers granted to it under the Maastricht treaty, to vet thoroughly the incoming commissioners. As a result, the appointees will be asked to answer questions in public and on the record for the first time. Parliament points out in a set of recommendations adopted by its committee on institutional affairs that this process will be the 'only democratic element' in choosing the new commissioners, who are appointed by the governments of the member states. The vetting is likely to involve a severe grilling by the appropriate parliamentary committees. 'It will not mean US-style teams of private investigators,' says Mr Julian Priestly, secretary general of the Socialist group. But fairly elaborate and even aggressive tactics are envisaged. The committee on institutional affairs' recommendations says that particular importance will be attached to 'guarantees of independence', including the need to ensure that the prospective commissioners are 'genuinely independent from the national governments that nominated them and also, that there are no potential financial conflicts of interest'. One recommendation states: 'It is highly desirable that a few key political questions - ie on two speed Europe, opt-outs, enlargement to eastern Europe etc - be posed to all the candidates in order to assess their views on the European integration process.' As far as financial interests are concerned, the committee recommends that the parliament should draw up a short and unbureaucratic list of questions to be submitted to all the candidates. As an illustration, it highlights the type of questions raised in the US for completion by presidential nominees. These include such detailed points as financial transactions, investments, obligations liabilities, and any business or other relationships. In spite of the rigorous approach the parliament intends to adopt, the process rings slightly hollow. Its extra powers do not extend to the right to veto individual commissioners. All the parliament can do is mention its misgivings to Mr Santer. Otherwise, it can veto the entire commission, but this would be an unlikely step.</p>

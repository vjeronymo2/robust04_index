			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Ozawa claims he is misunderstood IN DENYING allegations he accepted illegal donations, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the powerbroker who cobbled together Japan's coalition government, yesterday portrayed himself as the misunderstood reformer, unfairly perceived to be most comfortable in the murky shadows of the political backroom. 'I am always supposed to be in the backroom. I am said to be hiding behind the curtain,' said Mr Ozawa, smiling as he deflected allegations that he regularly received Y5m (Pounds 31,000) from Kajima, the construction company at the centre of Japan's latest political scandal. Mr Ozawa admits receiving Y5m last year before defecting from the Liberal Democratic party but says he did not violate political funding laws that he wants toughened as part of political reform. But the case has rekindled public doubts about a politician who thrived in the old system, and is leading the charge for the new. 'People should not read too much into my actions,' he said. 'I am secretary general of the Japan Renewal party and I was the LDP secretary general. I don't have a ministerial position, but I can say what I like in this position.' The fresh allegations have distracted attention from the political reform debate, which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa fears is veering off course. Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if four bills containing the reforms are not passed this year, and the harsh spotlight on Mr Ozawa has not helped the cause. LDP officials said yesterday they wanted a 'thorough' debate on the current batch of scandals and would like to call witnesses from the Ministry of Construction. Mr Ozawa could also be called to give evidence to parliament. The LDP's new-found concern about corruption is cited by Mr Ozawa as a sign that it is trying to find excuses for not agreeing to political reform. He says 'the contents of their stomachs' do not match LDP officials' public statements on reform. 'Leaders of the LDP say they are in favour of political reform, but their real feelings are different. They have 21 complaints but basically these are technical matters, and I find their opposition quite mysterious,' Mr Ozawa said. LDP faction leaders fear the new system of proportional representation and single seats will undermine the old system of patronage cultivated under multi-seat constituencies, which encouraged competition and corruption within the party. But Mr Ozawa says he is confident that younger politicians will defect from the LDP if reform is brought to a parliamentary vote next week. 'Political reform will definitely be decided this year. If we want a happy new year, then we have to conclude negotiations by then,' Mr Ozawa said. If things don't go according to plan and the LDP is able to block the bills' passage, then 'we will ask for the judgment of the people,' meaning that another election will be called. 'Of the LDP's 21 complaints, 80 to 90 per cent could be solved in an hour,' Mr Ozawa said. There are four 'real problems': redrawing boundaries; the division of seats between candidates selected through local constituencies and proportional representation; whether voters should have one or two votes; and the banning of corporate political donations. 'We are willing to make concessions, so there is no reason not to reach agreement,' he said, denying that the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japanese Socialist party, a coalition member, is also opposed to the reforms. There are a few doubters in the SDP, he suggests, but not enough to undermine the legislation. 'Having democracy doesn't mean that everyone has to agree,' he said, referring to the Japanese love of consensus. 'It is a part of democracy to make a decision. We have been discussing reform for five years, and the time has come to make a decision.'</p>

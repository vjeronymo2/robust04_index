			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing parasitic about satellite TV Sir, It was pleasantly surprising to find Christopher Dunkley - in a newspaper which studiously ignores satellite TV listings - devoting his entire column last week to the Sky multi-channel launch (August 25). I wish, though, his tone had been less dismissive of a service which satellite viewers consistently find more attractive than ITV or the BBC. Is satellite television essentially 'parasitical' as Mr Dunkley asserts? Before satellite, was there a dedicated children's channel, or a movie channel, or a sports channel, or 24-hour news? Is the 11,000 hours of original programming supplied by Sky each year of no consequence? And even with re-run channels (UK Gold, Bravo, Discovery, etc), if there is strong audience demand for such material, why deride it? Last weekend, these three channels out-performed Channel 4 in satellite homes. Arts programming is perhaps the prime example of the potential benefit of satellite re-run: huge volumes of eminently repeatable programmes currently gather dust on the shelves of terrestrial channels. Only the viewer suffers from the artificial restrictions of terrestrial spectrum scarcity. As for paying Sky for what viewers previously watched without charge, that only applies to the minority of satellite homes that, until now, took none of the premium channels; and, even for these homes, there are seven brand new channels to add to their available choice. For the 70 per cent of satellite homes which already take movies and sport, all the new channels are a free bonus. By creating a basic pay tier for the first time, Sky allows into the market-place an array of niche channels competitive with its own services which could not survive solely on advertising income. This deliberate stimulation of new satellite channels is not entirely selfless: Sky's premium channels stand to benefit from the increasing attractiveness of the satellite proposition, given that a high percentage of new installers can be expected to subscribe to movies and sport. Already, the surge in dish sales since the multi-channel package was announced is evidence that consumers find the package inviting and the cost affordable. It is clear that the audience values choice, and chooses value. If, as Mr Dunkley concludes, it is 'the programmes we watch', perhaps he should now reflect on why those with satellite seem willing to spend so much of their time watching the 'parasite' channels rather than the terrestrials.

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCKS' HARRIS: DUNLEAVY IS UP TO THE JOB  </P> <P> Del Harris, coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, said Tuesday that Mike Dunleavy, his  former assistant who was named Laker coach Monday, is ready for the job despite  his lack of NBA head coaching experience.  </P> <P> "Mike is a bright guy, and I gave him a lot of freedom of expression here,"  Harris said.  </P> <P> "I've been associated with him since 1977, when he was a player and assistant  coach.  </P> <P> "He will develop -- and has (developed) -- his own ideas as well as assimilate  the things he learned from Nellie (Don Nelson) and me and from playing. He's  willing to take responsibility. He will allow players to play, but when the  tough decision time comes, he's not afraid to take the ball in his own hands.  As a player, he was not afraid to take the last shot, and as a coach, he can  make the tough call."  </P> <P> Harris said that this season Dunleavy alternated setting the Bucks' game plans  with Frank Hamblen, the Bucks' top assistant.  </P> <P> "I think you're dealing with a special guy," Harris said of Dunleavy. "He's a  bright and astute person. It's a tough task with the Lakers, but he is equal to  the challenge." SAM McMANIS  </P></p>

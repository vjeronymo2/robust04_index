			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL JOBS PROGRAM IS OKD  </P> <P> The Centinela Valley Union High School District has approved a youth employment  pilot program, one of two in California to be provided by the nonprofit Jobs  for America's Graduates Inc.  </P> <P> District Supt. McKinley Nash announced he will appoint a committee to implement  the program, which will provide youth employment services and coordinate the  district's existing vocational, work-experience and Job Training Partnership  Act programs.  </P> <P> Nash said the new program is designed to reduce dropouts, increase the  graduation rate and provide stable, quality jobs for "at-risk" youngsters. The  typical participant is a high school senior who comes from a low-income family  or is a member of a racial or ethnic minority, has a C-minus or lower  grade-point average and little or no employment experience.  </P> <P> Jobs for America's Graduates has assisted more than 70,000 young people in 14  states in getting jobs. The State Board of Education recently approved the  organization's plans to start programs in California, according to district  officials.  </P></p>

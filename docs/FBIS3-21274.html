			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Ibrahim Dasuqi Abazah] </F>   [Excerpt] President Husni Mubarak is very much interested  in stability, and has been keen to call on the national forces  to defend stability. His Excellency underlined this call in his  recent speech at the Police Academy and described at length the  dangers facing the country as a result of instability.    We do not disagree with the president about the need for  stability, and reject any attempt to undermine it. But we fully  disagree with the president when he says that terrorism is the  only cause of instability and that ending it will lead to  stability. This is a simplification of the problem. It  disregards the real reasons for and deep roots of the problem.    The real reason for instability is not terrorism, but the  ruling dictatorship that created terrorism. The bullets were  not fired from a vacuum, but due to a painful reality produced  by the dictatorship and its bad policies and abnormal actions.  Had there been a flourishing economy, social justice, and  equality before the law, no crisis would have developed,  suffering would not have increased, and corruption would not  have spread. All these factors created the atmosphere which led  to violence and the spread of terrorism. They established  terrorism as the basis for the bloody way of dealing with the  ruling authority.    Terrorism, if the president would like to know, is not the  direct reason for instability, but the natural outcome of the  regime's dictatorship. Why confuse cause and effect?    Is the purpose of this confusion to prompt the political  parties to stand behind the president against terrorism?    If this was the purpose, it will only achieve something that  already exists, because the parties reject terrorism and have  often announced this rejection on every occasion. What more  does the president expect from them?    Does he expect them to go down on the streets to fight the  terrorists? Or does he expect them to find work for every  unemployed person? There is a home for every naked person;  there is treatment for every sick person; and there is a  punishment for every criminal.    The opposition can do nothing more than reject terrorism and  alert people to its dangers. It will not be able to contain or  end terrorism, whatever means it may have, as long as the reason  for the problem continues to exist. What is the purpose of this  repeated call to defend stability? Why do they deliberately  disregard the factors that threaten stability?    Any observer of the regime's actions on ordeals and crises  can only conclude that the purpose and goal of the call for a  dialogue is to achieve stability for the regime itself, and not  to achieve stability, security, and peace for Egypt--unless we  maintain that the ruling regime is a democratic one that depends  on the popular will and heeds it. In such a case, the regime's  stability or instability would be considered Egypt's stability  or instability. But the reality is that there is an organic  separation between the ruling regime and the broad popular base.  The regime is in one valley and the people in another. Any  attempt to link the regime with the popular base is bound to  fail because the interests of the masses and their daily  sufferings are not taken into consideration by the regime,  except in its propaganda.    The only solution is for the regime to admit that there is  something wrong and start correcting it. This, in short, means  recognizing the need for political reform and accepting the need  for direct talks with the national forces about the steps to  move toward democracy, and about the substance, measures, and  timetable for this transformation. This transformation is the  natural prelude to the achievement of the desired economic and  social reforms. [passage omitted]</p>

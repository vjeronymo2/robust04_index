First, there was the announcement last week by American  Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo, special delegate on the Haitian  crisis of the U.S. secretary of state, of the arrival of the  humanitarian oil shipment for 12 January. The United States then  announced at the last minute, on 11 January, the postponement of  the shipment, with no explanation.    This morning, an OAS spokesman made an announcement to the  contrary. There is therefore confusion on the arrival of the  shipment.</p>

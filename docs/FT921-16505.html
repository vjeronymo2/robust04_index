			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: Easing the path to a united Europe - Worth Watching ONE of the problems of setting up a data communications network to link offices across Europe has been the different approvals procedures and incompatible equipment. One of the few ways of avoiding the headache has been to go for one large supplier which operates in each country, but that involves becoming tied in to their products. Now a group of 11 independent datacoms companies has set up an alliance in order to compete with much larger rivals. The 11 include Pandacom of Frankfurt, Teleinform of Zurich, and Data-range of High Wycombe, in the UK. The aim of the group is to enable those wanting to set up a European-wide network to do so through a single point of contact. The group, European Network Associates, will have a core product strategy to ensure that equipment sold in one country will be available in the others. The group is also hoping to be able to influence the approvals and standards setting procedures. Contacts: Datarange: UK, 0494 441256. Pandacom: Germany, 69 664 0060. Teleinform: Switzerland, 55 37 115.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS CRASH PROBE FINDS NO PROOF THAT TRUCK BRAKES FAILED  </P> <P> Federal investigators found no evidence to support a truck driver's contention  that his brakes failed before the vehicle rammed a school bus into a  water-filled pit, killing 20 teen-agers, an official said Friday.  </P> <P> "From a visual inspection, we can find nothing to indicate a failure in the  braking system," said Lee Dickinson, a National Transportation Safety Board  member. He said investigators would conduct other tests.  </P> <P> The 10-member NTSB team of investigators planned to interview truck driver  Ruben Perez and his assistant, who also was in the truck when it hit the bus  Thursday.  </P> <P> Perez told Texas Department of Public Safety troopers that the brakes failed on  the truck, causing him to go into the intersection and hit the bus.  </P> <P> The bus, carrying 86 passengers, careened into the 40-foot pit owned by the  city of Alton.  </P> <P> The toll from the accident rose to 20 Friday with the death of Yesenia Perez,  15. She suffered cardiac arrest, officials said.  </P> <P> At least 63 people were injured when the bus tumbled into the pit. One student  and the bus driver, Gilberto Pena, 46, remained in critical but stable  condition; another student was still unconscious at Mission General Hospital.  </P> <P> Truck driver Perez, 25, was treated at Mission General and released Friday.  </P> <P> At the site of the accident, a wreath of blue and white flowers shook in the  wind as streams of motorists drove by, some stopping to mourn.  </P> <P> "You can only do so much," said firefighter Raul Garcia, looking into the pit  where the day before he had helped rescue dozens of students and recover the  bodies of others trapped in the submerged bus.  </P> <P> He and a few other men had propped up the 4-foot wreath of carnations at the  edge of the pit. "On behalf of the Alton Volunteer Fire Department," its banner  read.  </P> <P> In the small south Texas towns of Alton and Mission, many drove with their  headlights on as a sign of mourning.  </P> <P> More than 10,000 people filled the Tom Landry Stadium at Mission High School on  Friday night to honor the bus accident victims.  </P> <P> "The emptiness that we feel will not be replaced again," said Sanjuanita  Zamora, Alton's mayor. "A part of our lives has been taken away from us."  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, about 500 people crowded into tiny San Martin de Porres  Catholic Church for the first of the funerals, that of 12-year-old Elda  Patricia Cruz.  </P> <P> "It doesn't help to say why him or why her. Only God knows," Father Frank Gomez  said in the service given in Spanish and English.  </P> <P> Alton, which is about 15 miles from the Mexico border, is part of the Mission  school district. Classes were canceled Friday.  </P> <P> "It's very quiet here," said Dina Chapa, Mission High School assistant  principal. "What we're doing right now is collecting the (victims') personal  belongings from lockers and giving out information, finding out when the  funerals are for the students," Chapa said.  </P> <P> Police said Friday that 86 people were on the bus, rather than 81 as previously  reported. Sgt. Israel Pacheco said several students who escaped the bus with  minor injuries walked away from the accident and were not immediately counted.  </P> <P> The bus was designed to carry 83 people, according to the manufacturer. Texas  law sets no capacity limit but says one student can be standing for each seat  in a bus.  </P></p>

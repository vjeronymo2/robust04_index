			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Amec wins Pounds 22m bridge contract Amec Process and Energy has won a contract worth nearly Pounds 22m to build a 3,000 tonne bridge module for the Tyra West field in the North Sea, the company announced yesterday. The contract, awarded by Maersk Oil og Gas A/S, is the first Danish order won by Amec's large fabrication yard on the Tyne. Mr Tony Eckford, construction operations chairman of Amec Process and Energy, said the Danish sector of the North Sea was undergoing a 'resurgence' of construction work. 'If we can perform on this we are hopeful of securing further work from Denmark,' he said. Work on the module, due for completion late next year, will begin immediately. Within the next few weeks Amec's Tyneside site, which claims to be Europe's biggest topsides fabrication yard, is also expected to receive confirmation it has won an order worth more than Pounds 20m from Shell for a 2,000-tonne module. The two contracts will help maintain the present 1,500 workforce, down from 3,000 two years ago.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: G7 response to Yeltsin IF NOTHING else, the two-day meeting of finance and foreign ministers of the group of seven industrial countries in Tokyo has underlined the west's interest in Russian reform. But the G7 can only propose. It now must wait to see how Mr Yeltsin fares in the referendum due on April 25. Unhappily, even this seems unlikely to resolve doubts about Russia's willingness and ability to implement radical reform. The immediate question, however, is how much of the announced offer of Dollars 43bn is new. The answer is that there is less to it than meets the eye, since it consists mainly of known commitments from institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. One relatively new ingredient is an innovative Dollars 3bn IMF loan facility to help Russia start to curb inflation and the budget deficit. There will also be a Dollars 300m small business development fund mainly financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Meanwhile, the US, Japan and the UK have announced what seem to be additional bilateral loans of Dollars 4bn. Nevertheless, most elements were well known. Some, notably the Dollars 15bn in debt relief agreed earlier this month, will add no new resources, since Russia was failing to service its debts in any case. The second question is whether offers of assistance are in the right form. In a recent report, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe called on the G7 to commit itself to a long-term reform programme on the scale of the post-war Marshall plan. 'One of the worst outcomes,' it argued, 'would be . . . a list of short-term measures hastily put together with a maximum of publicity.' It is far from clear that the G7 has avoided that outcome. But it has committed itself so far that it would have to go further, should that be justified by a serious Russian effort. The imaginative American proposal for a Dollars 4bn fund to promote privatisation of large state-run enterprises may yet be agreed in coming months. The fundamental question, however, is whether there will be a Russian programme to support. The problem is partly that there is limited agreement in Russia on either the ends or the modalities of reform. But it is also that the constitution is perfectly designed to prevent the emergence of coherent structures of authority, both within Moscow and, as important, between Moscow and the rest of this vast country. The G7 has at least provided the moral support for Mr Yeltsin that he wanted. The tragedy is that the G7 is at last showing serious commitment, as Russia sinks into ever greater disarray. Mr Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister, notes that Russia may remain unready for months. In the meantime, the G7 should not forget that some other countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union deserve assistance no less, although they too would be greatly helped by a successful Russian reform.</p>

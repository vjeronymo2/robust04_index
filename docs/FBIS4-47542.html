Proskurina, R.A. Kulman, Ye.I. Deryugina, </F> V.N. Ivanov, Hematology Research Center at Russia's Academy of  Medical Sciences, Moscow; UDC 576.8]    [Abstract] The high cost of imported incomplete Freund  adjuvant (NAF) which facilitates the development of ascite  tumors with the best properties in mice inoculated with  hybridoma cells--the most economical source of monoclonal  antibodies--and the difficulty large-scale in vivo  MCA production due to the need for large quantities of  conditioning reagents necessitated tests of various reagents for  conditioning the mice before inoculating them with hybridoma  cells. To this end, 15-20 week old 18-20 g female mice  irradiated with the help of a [.sup]137[/]Cs source were  used. The method of hybridoma cell cultivation and the  conditioning reagents are described. The findings demonstrate  that with respect to all principal indicators, one of the  compounds under study--hexadecane--can match the commonly used  pristan. When primed with hexadecane, the proportion of mice  with an ascite tumor, its growth duration, and the ascite  volume, and the MCA titer were equal to, or even exceed, the  same indicators in the pristan-primed animals examined with five  different hybridomata. The results make it possible to recommend  the relatively inexpensive and accessible hexadecane in place of  pristan. Tables 2; references 10: 1 Russian, 9 Western.</p>

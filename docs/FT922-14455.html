			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Chaos grips Sarajevo as snipers fire on protesters CHAOS gripped central Sarajevo in the central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday as street battles raged and as snipers fired on peace demonstrators. The snipers killed at least five protesters and wounded dozens, according to one report. Serb guerrillas fought street battles and artillery duels with police and volunteer units loyal to Moslem and Croat leaders. The snipers, thought to be Serbs, fired on tens of thousands of peace demonstrators gathered outside parliament. The demonstrators were demanding an end to the fighting, the sacking of the republic's nationalist-coalition government and new elections. 'We came here as peacemakers,' one demonstrator told a Sarajevo television reporter. 'If we came to fight, we would have brought our weapons. Now we have nothing but our bare hands.' Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia-Hercegovina's president, claims that the bloodshed is the result of a concerted effort by Serbs to seize territory, destabilise the republic and thwart its recognition as an independent state. Serious ethnic clashes in Bosnia-Hercegovina have increased since voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum on independence last month. Serb voters, however, boycotted the vote. The Serbs, who account for 32 per cent of Bosnia-Hercegovina's 4.3m people, oppose being cut off from Serbia by an international frontier. Their leaders have warned for over a year that such a step would lead to civil war. They now advocate breaking the republic into ethnic cantons. The Serbs claim 60 per cent of the republic's territory. The republic's ethnic Yugoslavs, Moslems and many Croats support independence and maintaining the republic's territorial integrity because they are loath to be linked with what is certain to be a Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav state. Exploding mortar shells fell yesterday on Sarajevo's historic, mainly Moslem-populated bazaar area and outlying areas east of the capital. People around the city of 700,000 braved sniper fire to watch artillery shells exploding in the mountains above. Several thousand demonstrators stormed the Holiday Inn hotel, breaking windows and searching for gunmen. Hand grenades exploded inside the building, which Serb militiamen have been using as a base. At least nine people have died and about hundred wounded in fighting in Sarajevo since the violence began early on Sunday morning, local news reports and doctors said. It is the worst fighting in Bosnia-Hercogovina since World War II. Ironically, yesterday was the anniversary of Sarajevo's liberation in 1945 from Nazi occupation forces. The republic's interior minister, Mr Alija Delimustafic, yesterday repeatedly called on the Yugoslav army to intervene on the side of the 'citizenry' to stop the bloodshed. The army's loyalties remain unclear despite almost two days of constant fighting around the city. Yugoslav army infantry units backed by tanks this morning guarded Sarajevo's airport. Mortar shells reportedly rained down on the main television transmission tower above the city and television announcers said they feared the station would come under attack.</p>

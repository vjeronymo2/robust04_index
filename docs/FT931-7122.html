			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US-Japan feud takes to the air - Michiyo Nakamoto reports on the dispute over an aviation accord HARDLY a week passes without a simmering trade dispute between Japan and the US threatening to flare up into an all-out trade war. This week, officials from the US and Japan are meeting in Washington to try to avert a potentially damaging row over aviation rights which has already triggered threats and counter-threats of retaliation. At stake is a large market for Asian-Pacific air travel from Tokyo, an area expected to be one of the largest growth markets for the industry. The Japanese airline industry believes that its entire international operation could be at risk and it is watching the outcome of the talks very closely. The current confrontation began with the refusal by Japan to allow United Airlines, the US carrier, to extend its New York-Tokyo flights to Sydney. Under a bilateral aviation accord signed between the US and Japan in 1952, US carriers have what are known as 'beyond rights'. These give permission to carry passengers not only from the US to Japan but from there on to a third destination. United saw the Japanese refusal as a violation of its 'beyond rights' and took the matter to the US Department of Transport, which also ruled that Japan had violated the bilateral aviation accord. Japan's Ministry of Transport maintains that the flight is not an extension of the New York-Tokyo route but for all practical purposes a separate flight that is aimed at eating into the market for travel between Japan and Australia. The two countries' aviation accord states that US airlines should serve primarily US-Japan traffic. US carriers exercising 'beyond rights' to a third destination out of Tokyo should be carrying mainly US passengers, not Japanese passengers, to that destination. However, given the extra travelling time a Tokyo stop over entails, it is highly unlikely that United will be carrying mainly US passengers via Tokyo. 'It is nothing less than an attempt by United to take Japanese passengers away from Japanese airlines,' says an official at the Ministry of Transport. Japan is prepared to give United the go-ahead on condition that passengers from Tokyo to Sydney be restricted to less than 50 per cent. That, for the Japanese, would be in line with the stipulation that the primary route be between the US and Japan. The US says that it is impossible to quantify what is meant by primary route in the aviation accord. From the US point of view, Japan's refusal to grant United unrestricted 'beyond rights' is an attempt unilaterally to redefine the bilateral accord in order to protect the country's airlines from international competition. 'In order to keep JAL viable, it was necessary to keep market share at all costs,' says a US industry official. The Japanese Ministry of Transport is trying to protect the Japanese market by reining-in other countries' rights and restricting foreign carriers' slots at Narita Airport and at Kansai, which is scheduled to open in 1994, the US official says. Japanese officials admit to being protective of their air traffic. If US carriers, which have a much lower cost-base than the Japanese, are allowed to compete for business from Tokyo to destinations other than the US, Japan's airlines will be devastated. 'The supply-and-demand balance will be upset and we will see what the US domestic industry is seeing - excessive competition leading to prices below cost,' says Mr Chikara Sugimoto, director of international affairs at JAL. But what Japan is most concerned about is that if United is allowed unrestricted 'beyond rights' to Sydney now, it could set a precedent for US airlines wanting to break into the most profitable routes Japanese airlines have: Tokyo to Europe. 'It is a matter of life or death for Japanese airlines,' says Mr Sugimoto. The dispute has led Japan to take an unusually firm stance against the US, with Japanese aviation officials promising retaliation if the US attempts to penalise Japanese carriers for the government's stance. The feeling in Tokyo is that the US is taking excessive liberties with a bilateral accord that was signed more than 40 years ago when the aviation industry was dominated by US carriers and direct long-distance air travel was impossible. That view is shared by other countries such as Thailand and France which have abrogated their aviation treaties with the US. The UK in 1977 renegotiated its US aviation accord. Meanwhile, Australia, which is also concerned about losing its share of travel to and from Japan, has put in a formal request to Northwest Airlines to limit one of its three flights from Tokyo to Sydney to US passengers only. The Japanese government may have to push for a renegotiation of the aviation accord, a Ministry of Transport official said. However, as this would be politically difficult, Japan would prefer to reach agreement on how to define 'primary route' as stipulated in the accord. 'It is a question of interpretation and application,' JAL's Mr Sugimoto says. As aviation authorities face each other across the negotiation table, retaliation may have been averted for the time being. But as similar agreements between the US and Japan have shown, a difference of interpretation is usually the most difficult gap to breach.</p>

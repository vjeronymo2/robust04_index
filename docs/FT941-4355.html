			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / BTR shares rise on higher payout Shares in BTR rose 10p to 387p after the UK-based industrial conglomerate sought to allay market concern by lifting its dividend 13 per cent and giving an upbeat assessment of recovery prospects. Pre-tax profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn last year while sales rose 10.5 per cent to Pounds 9.77bn. Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said: 'The improvements seen in the US and Australia in the last quarter of 1993 have been maintained.' In the UK and continental Europe, with the exception of Germany, recovery was beginning to emerge, albeit slowly and the expected beneficial impact had not yet shown through. 'BTR enters 1994 with a confident view,' he said. Mr Bob Faircloth, chief operating officer, said: 'A little bit of volume increase will certainly have a larger drop-through to the bottom line in 1994.' Analysts were pleased that BTR made a fairly modest provision of Pounds 54m regarding Rexnord, the US industrial manufacturer it bought for Dollars 820m just before the year-end. Renewed questions about BTR's use of acquisition accounting was one reason cited for the relative weakness of the shares last autumn, when a high conversion rate of warrants increased the stock's liquidity. Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said the group had now used all but Pounds 30m of the provisions it made against Hawker Siddeley, which it bought for Pounds 1.55bn in 1991. The group was carrying forward unutilised provisions of only Pounds 128m, including the Rexnord figure. Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said criticism that the group had overpaid for Rexnord was also misplaced. Although most of the US group's business enjoyed a relatively high profit margin, about a third of its sales made virtually no profit, so there was plenty of scope for improvement. Gearing fell from 74 to 63 per cent, after reclassifying convertible notes as debt, in line with the latest accountancy standard, FRS4. Without Rexnord and FRS4, gearing would have been 41 per cent, down from 69 per cent. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 22.4p (19.7p). A final dividend of 7.3p gives a total of 12.25p (10.8p).

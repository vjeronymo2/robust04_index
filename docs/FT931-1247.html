			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finland's Outokumpu expands in Australia OUTOKUMPU, THE state-owned Finnish mining and metals group, is expanding its interests in Australia by earning a majority stake in the Panorama zinc project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Shareholders in Sipa Resources, the small Australian company that owns the project, are expected to give approval today for Outokumpu Zinc to earn 60 per cent of Panorama by spending ADollars 5m on exploration in the next two years and then producing a bankable feasibility study. At the same time, Outokumpu Zinc will buy ADollars 1.6m (Pounds 760,000) worth of Sipa shares, which will take the Finnish group's stake from 14 per cent to 19.9 per cent. Outokumpu Zinc operates Tara in Ireland, the biggest zinc-lead mine in Europe, as well as an electrolytic plant in Finland. The company has been interested in Panorama for some time and originally took a shareholding in Burmin Exploration, a Dublin company, which owned 39 per cent of the project. This stake had reached 25 per cent by the time Sipa recently merged with Burmin in order to gain control of 100 per cent of Panorama. Sipa also bought the remaining 10 per cent from Guardian Resources. The Panorama project covers 3,000 square km (1,150 square miles) and Mr Michael Doepel, Sipa's managing director, says the ADollars 4.5m spent on exploration so far has been rewarded with the discovery of eight deposits. 'We have a base metals province which we hope will match some of the big provinces in Canada,' he adds. There is a long way to go, however. After two more years of exploration, some ADollars 15m to Dollars 20m will have to be spent in the next two to three years for the feasibility study. Construction of a mine would cost about ADollars 200m and Outokumpu would be responsible for finding all the project finance. The Outokumpu group's other Australian interests include 100 per cent of the Forrestania and 35 per cent of the Honeymoon Well nickel projects in Western Australia, as well as 24 per cent of Lady Loretta and 25 per cent of Thalanga, two base metals projects in Queensland.</p>

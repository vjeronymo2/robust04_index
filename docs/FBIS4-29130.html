			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jun 16 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia is concerned  about the increasing tension on the Korean peninsula and hopes  that conflicting sides return to the negotiating table to seek  diplomatic solution, head of the Nonaligned Movement (NAM)  Executive Board Nana Sutresna said here Thursday.    President Suharto has asked Nana Sutresna to investigate  what  steps he can take as the chairman of NAM to help ease the  tension.    The tension in Korea has increased after some Western  countries accuse North Korea of having nuclear facilities and  keep pushing for Pyongyang nuclear inspections.    The United States has proposed economic sanction against  North Korea at the UN level because Pyongyang resists the  inspections.    North Korea announced this week it was pulling out of the  International Atomic Energy Agency after resisting the  inspection attempt.    Flanked by State Secretary/Minister Murdiono, Nana Sutresna  was reporting to President Suharto results of the ministerial  meeting of NAM held in Cairo, Egypt recently.    The participants of the Cairo meeting, according to  Sutresna,  hailed the steps taken by Indonesia as the current NAM chairman,  in trying to help solve the problem on the Korean peninsula.    President Suharto has sent letters to North Korea President  Kim Il-Song and UN Secretary General Butrus-Butrus Ghali  regarding the matter, he said.    He also explained about the upcoming NAM meeting in Jakarta  to discuss the debt burden faced by the 18 most poorest  countries which are members of NAM.    Meanwhile, the NAM chairman has appointed some Indonesian  economists led by Wijoyo Nitisastro to help the NAM member  countries solve their debt problem.    He said that apart from the 18 countries, there are other  NAM  members wishing to attend the Jakarta meeting expected to be  held before August 17, the Indonesian Independence Day.</p>

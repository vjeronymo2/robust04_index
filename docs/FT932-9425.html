			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Rules must be right, and upheld - The safeguarding of the tropical forests cannot be taken for granted TWO ISSUES will decide whether Indonesia's valuable tropical forests survive in good health into the next century: are the rules on limiting timber extraction being enforced, and are the rules the right ones for Indonesia in the first place? The answer most often given to both questions is 'no', a source of concern not only to Indonesian and foreign environmentalists but also to the government and the country as a whole. Large-scale exploitation of Indonesia's rich forests began in the late 1960s, and forest products - mainly plywood - are now the country's fourth most important export after oil, gas, and manufactured goods; in 1991 they earned Dollars 3.7bn, nearly double all agricultural exports put together. On paper, Indonesia's plans look reasonable enough. Of the country's land area of 193m hectares, 144m ha or 75 per cent is classified as forest, of which 66m hectares is supposed to be selectively logged, 48m preserved intact for national parks and vital watersheds, and 30m chopped down to make way for agriculture, new settlements and industry. Implementation of these sweeping plans, however, is another matter, particularly when it comes to the logging concessions which are meant to be exploited in a sustainable manner. In a damning recent report which shook the Indonesian establishment, Walhi, the leading domestic environmental group, not only questioned the economic value of the industry to the country but also cited convincing evidence that logging companies routinely flout forestry regulations. Bribes are paid to forestry inspectors to encourage them to under-report the amount of timber extracted from concessions, Walhi said. It quoted a 1990 forestry department report as saying that only 22 out of 578 concessionaires had actually followed regulations on selective cutting and replanting, and cited another official report which disclosed that only 30 per cent of log production in East Kalimantan on Borneo was reported to the government as required. In the past, the report added, Japanese figures for the import of logs and wood products from Indonesia were far higher than the Indonesian figures for exports to Japan. Walhi concluded that the state captured only 17 per cent of the economic rent from timber in taxes and fees, compared with 85 per cent for the technologically much more sophisticated oil industry. Although the government and big private companies are establishing tens of thousands of hectares of plantations for the pulp and paper and other timber processing industries, the programme is behind schedule and has so far done little to protect Indonesia's natural forests. There is scant transparency in the bidding for natural forest concessions, and the logging industry is dominated by timber magnates such as Mr Mohamad 'Bob' Hasan and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, who have close ties to President Suharto. 'Wood is not being harvested, it's being mined,' says a foreign aid official. Another says: 'The legal loggers are legally logging sometimes and illegally logging at other times. There's no end to the genius involved.' However, the government and many foreign donors agree that big logging concessionaires like Mr Hasan - because of their financial resources and their huge stake in the future of the industry - are more likely to manage forests sustainably than smaller operators who might be tempted to 'asset-strip' their concessions for a quick, short-term gain. There is also agreement that forestry rules are contravened. 'Our government doesn't have the capability to measure illegal cutting,' says Mr Bambang Soekartiko, a senior official of the ministry of forestry. 'We know there is excess cutting.' As for the existing system of selective cutting and replanting, Indonesian and foreign forestry experts are acknowledging that, because of their limited understanding of the biology of forests rich in valuable dipterocarp species, they might not be able to make it work even if the rules were strictly applied. Part of the problem is that a typical forest does not contain equal numbers of large, medium-sized and small trees which would allow regular cropping as each generation reaches maturity. In fact the large, harvestable trees dominate the canopy and thereby stunt their successors which then take many years to reach the required size. Several proposals to improve the rules for managing Indonesian forests and the enforcement of those rules are under discussion, including an extension of concession periods from 20 to 35 years, the use of costly performance bonds to ensure logging companies comply with the law, and the deployment of foreign inspectors. Foreign donors have welcomed the appointment of Mr Djamaloedin Soeryohadikoesoemo as the new forestry minister in the March cabinet reshuffle, although some of them say his decision to adopt a new and little-understood system of forest strip-cutting is a sign of the government's desperation as it seeks save the industry from its own excesses. The idea is to cut long strips of forest - including the smaller trees  - and leave other, neighbouring strips intact, allowing the logged strip to be replanted or seeded from the untouched forest and letting in sunlight to nourish the young trees. Forestry ministry officials say the strip system will be easier to monitor - by satellite for example - and they also believe that natural forest growth will increase from one or two cubic metres per hectare per year to between eight and 14 cubic metres. 'The productivity will increase eight times,' says Mr Soekartiko. Others are sceptical, pointing out that loggers will be tempted to venture into the supposedly inviolate strips of forest to take the most valuable trees, and that the open strips might be used as farms by the settlers who always follow in the wake of the logging trucks. Implementation of the new method has not yet begun in Indonesia. In the meantime, high demand for logs from more than 2,800 sawmills and plywood factories continues to put pressure on Indonesia's forests; the mills and factories have a capacity of more than 50m cubic metres a year, compared with the government's official figure for sustainable log output of 31m cubic metres. One of the few hopeful signs for Indonesia, as it strives to avoid the deforestation suffered long ago in western Europe and more recently in Thailand and the Philippines, is that local inhabitants have become more vocal in their opposition to state-sanctioned logging in their homelands. The inhabitants of Yamdena, an island on the eastern side of the archipelago, and of Siberut off the coast of Sumatra, have won reprieves for their forests, and even the logging companies of Kalimantan are said to be concerned about their own future; they may yet heed Walhi's warning: 'At the current level of deforestation, Indonesia's forests will disappear in the next 30 years.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has concluded, however, that clarifying amendments to the price disclosure and ``unbundling'' provisions of the Rule are necessary to clarify that it shall be an unfair or deceptive practice to impose non-declinable fees in addition to the one for ``basic services of funeral director and staff,'' permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C). These amendments effectively eliminate the imposition of so-called ``casket handling fees'' as separate non-declinable fees charged to consumers who purchase caskets from non-funeral home sources. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission has determined that these fees serve to frustrate the Rule's basic ``unbundling'' requirement by penalizing consumers who decline caskets sold by the funeral home and instead purchase them from third party sellers. The emergence of third-party casket sellers, and consequently, those fees, have developed in the market since the Rule's promulgation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent that these fees include a charge for provider overhead that is not allocated to other items offered for sale, the amended Rule does not prohibit their inclusion in the non-declinable services fee permitted under &sect;453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission further has concluded that repeal of the affirmative telephone disclosure requirement (&sect;453.2(b)(1)(i)) is warranted because its costs outweigh its actual and potential benefits. The record evidence indicates that the affirmative telephone disclosure is an inartful and unnecessary signal to consumers about the availability of price information. The Commission has determined that the Rule's other price disclosure provisions are adequate, and that this provision is unlikely to provide substantial additional benefits to consumers. Record evidence indicates that the Rule is contributing now to increased consumer ``price-sensitivity'' that results in some consumer shopping for lower-cost providers and services. Consumers who call to first arrange a date and time for a funeral service, however, or who request the removal of remains, likely expect an empathetic response, and may be seriously offended by the uninvited offer to discuss prices. Some consumers in that circumstance are likely to interpret the affirmative disclosure as an indication of an unwarranted provider concern with the consumer's ability to afford services. The provision's likely inability to benefit consumers does not justify the imposition of such undue awkwardness and potential offense in what is otherwise an extremely delicate business, social and personal transaction. The Commission has concluded that the integrity of the Rule's price disclosure requirements will be maintained by retention of the requirement to provide price and other readily-available information over the telephone on request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission further has adopted a variety of minor, ``fine-tuning'' amendments in light of the evidence on industry compliance. Those amendments are designed to clarify the Rule's requirements and reduce actual or potential compliance burdens in order to increase provider compliance with, and consumer understanding of, the Rule's disclosures. Those amendments, which do not alter providers' basic obligations or consumers' rights under the Rule, concern the timing of giving the general price list and other disclosure requirements, the casket and outer burial container price list disclosures, and the general ``unbundling'' provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission has adopted several technical Rule amendments that are necessary to correct inconsistencies or unnecessary language in certain Rule provisions, or to complement other recommended amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Little, if any, systematic or otherwise reliable evidence in the record documents industry-wide deceptive or unfair practices concerning Rule-related issues by cemeteries, crematories that do not sell funeral goods, or other sellers of funeral goods or funeral services not presently subject to the Rule. Therefore, the Commission has declined to expand the Rule to cover such entities, as recommended by some rulemaking participants.

Background of this Proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Commission's Findings in 1982  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission required this unique review to determine, at an early date: (1) Whether the Rule is operating as expected in reducing barriers to price competition and increasing informed consumer choice, or whether some modification is necessary to facilitate those benefits; and (2) whether there is a need to continue the Rule after it has had an opportunity to work in the marketplace; termination would be considered if increased competition has largely corrected the problems addressed by the Rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> R&hyph;B&hyph;5 (Statement of Basis and Purpose) at 42261, 42299.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission determined, however, that the Rule's effects on the funeral market may be evidenced more slowly than in other industries due to factors it found unique to the funeral transaction. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  One of those factors was that many consumers would not have exposure to the Rule-required price lists and other provisions for many years because purchases of funerals are infrequent. Unlike other situations, consumers also are unusually susceptible to influence from the funeral director's advice because of the unique combination of emotional stress, lack of experience and information, and tight time constraints. The Commission predicted as a result that the initial stimulus for price competition would likely come from existing or new providers that begin to advertise and otherwise compete on the basis of price. The Commission concluded that it could not say how quickly the Rule's competitive impact would begin to be felt in light of traditional industry constraints on price competition and barriers to entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Id. at 42299.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission nonetheless predicted that the Rule could provide economic benefits for consumers in various ways. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Should greater price competition emerge, for example, the Rule could reduce or hold stable actual prices and overall consumer expenditures for funerals. This would most likely result from increased consumer price-sensitivity, which might lead some consumers to shift from higher to lower-priced providers. Expenditures could also be reduced as consumers decline items previously required in packaged funerals, and as unfair or deceptive acts or practices that induced consumer purchases decline. Finally, the Commission determined that mandatory price itemization was warranted even if some consumers knowingly chose to buy more goods and services than they would have under package-only pricing. The purpose of the Rule is to enhance consumer choice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Id. at 42297.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finally determined that, while competition induced by the Rule could reduce price levels, mandatory itemization presented opportunities for providers to voluntarily raise prices. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Providers could choose to raise itemized prices or the price for the lowest-priced funeral, for example, in order to increase profits or account for increased consumer declinations of certain items. The Commission reasoned, however, that itemization does not require those results because it does not preclude traditional industry pricing methods, such as package pricing and ``graduated recovery'' of proportionately more overhead from higher-priced funerals. The Commission further concluded that providers may not be able to raise prices simply to recoup lost revenue or increase profits as price competition increases under the Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Id. at 42296&hyph;42298. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

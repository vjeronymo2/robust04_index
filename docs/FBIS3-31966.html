			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Interior Minister Enrique Krauss has rejected  the possibility of promoting amnesty for the Chileans under the  protection of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, who  have not returned to the country because they have judicial  proceedings pending with the military justice.    Krauss said that the government is more than willing to  contribute to their return to Chilean society, but noted that no  one can avoid the court proceedings.    Krauss also valued the recent presence in Santiago of the  UNHCR regional chief for South America, and pointed out that the  UN official confirmed the ending of the Chileans' status as  political refugees because of the democratic normalization  taking place in our country.    Krauss also stated categorically that since March 1990 there  have been no political prisoners in Chile, but rather terrorist  criminals who practice violence to achieve political goals.    He pointed out that the expression "political prisoner" is  inadequate and misleading from the point of view of the  political situation in the country. In this regard he accused  the front organizations and the relatives of the prisoners for  spreading rumors about the alleged existence of this kind of  prisoner.    Krauss made these comments yesterday during a conversation  with reporters in La Moneda Palace.    Krauss was asked about the activities carried out by  Mohammed  Benamar, UNHCR chief for South America, to facilitate the return  of about 180 Chileans, who have charges pending or arrest  warrants against them in Chilean courts.    Krauss said that the UN official expressed real recognition  for the Chilean situation in that the progress of our political  process no longer allows for the existence of people who could  claim refugee or asylum status for political reasons. [passage  omitted]    Krauss said that the justice and acting interior minister  told Benamar that those who decide to return to Chile will have  all the guarantees of an appropriate trial to resolve their  situation according to the rules of a state of law.

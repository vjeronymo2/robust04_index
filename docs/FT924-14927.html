			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Discriminating against UK Sir, I am Mrs Absolutely Average working mother with two children and a business to support and I spend discriminatingly as follows: Shoes: Italian or French. Washing machine: Swedish. Dishwasher: German. Car: German. Clothes: 80 per cent Italian or French, usually from Japanese- owned department stores. Television: Japanese. Fax: Japanese. Furnishings: German or French. Computer: American. I buy design and quality. The price of many of the above could increase 50 per cent or more before I would seriously consider the inferior domestic alternatives. The anecdotes multiply. 'People still have money to spend,' it is said, 'but there's nothing new to spend it on.' Is the trouble with British manufacturing not the level of interest rates, nor anything else, but simply the lack of well-designed high quality product? Mary Dalmahoy, Manager and Executive Development Services, 85 More Close, London W14 9BW</p>

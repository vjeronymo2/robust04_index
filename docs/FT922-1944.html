			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: S Korean banking move SOUTH KOREA is to allow the creation of joint-venture merchant banks with foreign partners for the first time in 13 years, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. The Ministry of Finance said up to three merchant banks would be set up this year to 'accelerate the deregulation of the financial industry'. It said each of the new merchant banks would be capitalised at Dollars 38.5m. Domestic financial institutions, mostly banks and insurance firms, must own more than 50 per cent of the joint ventures, it said. Foreign financial institutions will be able to make an equity participation of between 10 and just less than 50 per cent. The ministry said it would give preference to applicants wishing to help small and medium-sized companies move their plants to China, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. According to reports, several conglomerates, including Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar, have sought to set up merchant banks with foreign banks.</p>

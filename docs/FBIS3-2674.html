			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian serb leader  Radovan Karadzic said today that his "Serb Republic of Bosnia"  will not join a Muslim-Croat federation.    He told reporters that only those who do not know politics  would think that Bosnian Serbs will accept the federation.    Karadzic insists on an independent Serbian country,  established in Bosnia or an allied country, and made up of  Bosnian Serbs and other Serbs.    He added that during World War II the Croat-Muslim  federation, under the protection of Germany, killed tens of  thousands of Serbs.    Karadzic said the three warring parties must make  compromises  to reach a final agreement and settle boundaries.    He stressed that 33.3 percent of the territory was enough  for  the Muslims, and that the Serbs would like to exchange part of  the territory in dispute with the Croats.    He also said that the West, which has been biased against  the  Serbs, would make a mistake to push the Serbs closer to Russia,  a traditional ally.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Little hope of recovery: UK unemployment is set to rise further Every postwar recession so far has been followed by a recovery during which unemployment fell. But history may not be repeated on the present occasion. All previous recoveries were initiated by the removal of credit controls which caused a spurt in lending for expenditure on durables and housing. This cannot happen now because there are no credit controls to remove, and because the balance sheets of banks and other lending institutions have been severely weakened by bad debts incurred during the Lawson boom. Consumption will also be checked because house prices have fallen so much and because an exceptionally high burden of household debt persists despite a sharp fall in net lending. And non-housing investment is unlikely to rise much because of excess capacity in the distributive, financial and other service industries  -another legacy of the boom. For all these reasons, I think hopes of any real recovery in demand are going to be continuously disappointed in 1993, rather as happened in the US in 1992. There may be some rise in economic activity but not enough to stop unemployment from increasing further and certainly not enough to bring it down. Unemployment will probably soon pass its previous postwar peak, reaching 3m to 4m this year - an incredible 4m to 5m measured on the pre-Thatcher scale. I expect price inflation to breach the chancellor's target of 1 to 4 per cent (although 'headline' inflation will be damped by the reduction in mortgage rates), because the recent devaluation of sterling will soon lead to import prices 10 per cent or more higher than a year earlier. The effect of this on retail prices will be compounded by the ending of the 'green currency' arrangements which will raise prices paid to British farmers. It remains to be seen whether or not an accelerated rise in retail prices has a knock-on effect on wages, thereby starting a new inflationary spiral. But I am hopeful that, with such high and rising unemployment, wage inflation will continue to decelerate and therefore that any acceleration of price inflation will, for once, be a 'blip'. One of the most disappointing features of last year was the enormous rise, which may turn out to be as large as 6 per cent, in the volume of imports of goods and services. This was at once a cause of the stagnation of output last year and a consequence of the erosion of Britain's industrial base over several years. This year, with recession in Europe aggravated by the pursuit of tight monetary policies by some of our EC partners, Germany in particular, the deficit in the UK's current balance of payments will probably rise further despite the devaluation. If the growth of import penetration seen in 1992 were repeated this year, it is doubtful whether any expansion in activity at all would occur, while the deterioration in the external balance would be even worse. While it is understandable that people should scour the economic statistics for 'green shoots', it is vital that more attention be paid to Britain's strategic predicament. The scale of any recovery in the next 12 months has an importance which is subsidiary to the structural, medium-term problems that dog the British economy. The position now is far worse than at the trough of the previous recession. Unemployment is about  3/4 m higher than it was in 1982. Yet the balance of payments was 2 per cent of gross domestic product in deficit last year, compared with a surplus of 2 1/2 per cent in 1981 - so we start with a balance some Pounds 25bn worse at today's prices than 11 years ago despite lower pressure of demand for labour. The underlying trend in Britain's trade remains so adverse and the prospects for world trade so poor that an expansion of activity based on domestic demand alone could not be permitted for more than a very short time. After a year or two Britain would have finally used up all the foreign wealth which was accumulated at the beginning of the 1980s (all that remains to show for the oil bonanza), and after only three or four more years its overseas indebtedness would be exploding. To convey some feel for the magnitudes involved, I calculate that, to keep the external deficit within tolerable bounds (given present prospects and policies), the expansion of output will have to be so slow as to cause a further rise in unemployment of at least  3/4 m by 1997. Alternatively, if output were allowed, or made, to rise enough to cause unemployment to fall below 3m, the current account deficit would exceed 4 per cent of GDP in 1997 and explode thereafter. It follows that a conventional recovery generated by an expansion of domestic demand, while not (in my opinion) to be expected, is also the last thing to be desired. Ministers have sometimes expressed satisfaction if indicators relating to personal consumption - for instance, retail sales - show signs of expansion. But a consumption-led expansion would only be a frustrating tramp back down the dead end from which we are just emerging. It is a blessing in disguise that consumption is likely to remain so subdued - for if consumption, against the odds, were now to rise substantially, the right policy would be to knock it on the head with an increase in taxation. Sustained growth will now only be possible if it is matched, and preferably led, by an expansion of exports net of import demand. But such expansion will only be possible if we greatly improve the performance of those sectors of the economy which produce internationally tradeable goods and services. This requires large-scale investment, above all in the manufacturing sector, and a sustained improvement in the competitive power of UK industry. The position is made much harder because Europe appears to be locked into recession: great efforts should be made to persuade the UK's EC partners to pursue more expansionary policies. Although a further cut in interest rates and more devaluation might help, it is unrealistic to suppose that the necessary transformation in national performance could be brought about just by manipulating a few macroeconomic instruments. The government needs a new role, not so much interventionist as helpful and healing; and the nation needs inspiring leadership. While the main thrust of policy should be directed towards solving the country's strategic economic problems, urgent consideration should also now be given to the alleviation of unemployment which, apart from costing a great deal in social security benefits and lost tax revenue, is fast becoming a social problem of frightening proportions.

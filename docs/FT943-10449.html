			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Russia's MMM fund president arrested in raid: Move to appease shareholders - UK targets similar operations The conflict between Russian authorities and the shaky MMM investment fund grew yesterday when police arrested the fund's president, Mr Sergei Mavrodi, after a dramatic raid on his apartment in central Moscow. The company froze its operations across Russia after armed tax police broke into the eighth-floor apartment of the elusive Mr Mavrodi, 38, through a balcony door after abseiling from an upper floor of the building. Earlier, he had refused to allow tax authorities into his home and barricaded himself behind its metal door together with his armed bodyguards. Russia's chief tax inspector said yesterday that criminal proceedings have begun against Mr Mavrodi, who is suspected of illegally concealing profits from the state. The dramatic raid on his home was the first legal action against the MMM pyramid fund, which began to topple 10 days ago after a government warning triggered a run by investors. 'The government has declared a war on us,' Mr Mavrodi was reported to have told the Interfax news agency. A crowd gathered outside his apartment building last night, with calls of 'hands off Mavrodi', while police searched his home. Television commercials for his fund were still being aired last night. Yesterday's public show of state force is an apparent effort by the government to appease the millions of MMM shareholders who have seen the value of their holdings plunge over the past two weeks. But Russian financiers fear that the state's strong-arm tactics will extend to tightening regulation of the stockmarket, a measure which western and Russian bankers say could thwart the growth of the country's immature, but developing, financial system. Shares are avidly traded in Russia and domestic capital is rapidly accumulating, but the country has no central stock exchange and government legislation is erratically enforced, as has been highlighted by the MMM case. 'I am very afraid that in the wake of the MMM crisis there will be a movement toward strict state regulation of the stockmarket,' said Mr Andrei Volgin, president of Adamant, one of Russia's leading financial companies. Mr Volgin said there was a 'battle' in Russia between supporters of tighter state regulation and financiers who wanted a self-regulating network of stockbrokers who would trade on an electronic system. A leading reformer in the Russian government, Mr Dmitri Vasiliev, deputy head of the Russian state privatisation body, yesterday also spoke out against stricter government regulation. He said one way to reduce the popularity of pyramid schemes was to offer pent-up Russian capital more sound investment opportunities by speeding up privatisation. 'People have money and are looking for a place to invest it,' Mr Vasiliev said. Russia's small but increasingly sophisticated banking elite argues that the MMM scandal was one of the inevitable growing pains of the transition to a market economy. 'The MMM scandal will not be the last one in Russia,' Mr Volgin said. 'Russian investors must suffer painful personal setbacks before they learn you can't spin money out of air. You can't fight this sort of ignorance with laws.' Editorial Comment, Page 13</p>

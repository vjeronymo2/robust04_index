			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers rise on UAP hope The composite insurance sector burst into life during afternoon trading as marketmakers latched on to a story that UAP, the French insurance giant, had indicated to shareholders that it was seeking to increase its presence in the UK insurance market. 'The market's immediate reaction was to hoist the share prices of all the leading composites,' said one marketmaker. The story emanated from Paris, where chief executive Mr Didier Pfeiffer was quoted as telling UAP shareholders: 'This weakness in the United Kingdom may be dealt with in the current financial year.' Speculation in the market initially focused on Royal Insurance, but quickly spread to Sun Alliance and ultimately to Commercial Union. Insurance sector specialists, however, remained unconvinced by the stories and pointed to the absence of any determined activity in any of the composites' shares. One leading analyst said it was most unlikely that UAP would attempt a major takeover in the UK 'in the middle of the massive privatisations in France', and also said the group 'does not have the financial resources to move for one of the big UK companies'. Sun Alliance ended 14 higher at 404p on 2.7m shares traded, Commercial Union rose 13 to 709p on 861,000 dealt, Royal moved up 12 to 341p on 3.8m transacted and General Accident added 10 at 738p.</p>

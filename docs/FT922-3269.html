			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Cadbury: divisions over ownership and accountability (1) Sir, Sir Owen Green criticises the Cadbury Committee (Personal View, June 9) for being long on accountability but short on drive and efficiency. In fact, while greater accountability can and should enhance the performance of a company, the Cadbury report actually fails to offer the reforms needed to promote such accountability in practice. Shareholders who attend company meetings know full well that these occasions do not make any important decisions. Boards make little attempt to open the company up to scrutiny, while chairmen's answers to questions are usually highly subjective, suitably anodyne and anecdotal. As long as this absence of scrutiny continues, criminal and unethical activity will flourish. Sadly Cadbury does not go far enough and will only 'paper over the cracks'. Simply asking shareholders to submit questions in advance will only add to board control over the general meeting. Only a formal mechanism for allowing shareholders to place resolutions, as in the US, can offer hope for changing the climate so that they will believe they can monitor effectively.

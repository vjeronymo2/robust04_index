			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gisela Bel Heredia] </F>   [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro granted a news  conference to the Cuban reporters accompanying him on his visit  to South Africa. Fidel discussed possible Cuba-South Africa  ties, and Mandela's historic victory.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this  month,  an ANC [African National Congress] representative discussed the  preceding events, and explained that once Nelson Mandela was  inaugurated, South Africa would proceed to establish diplomatic  relations with Cuba. That is their intent. They even included  this in a document known as the New South Africa Foreign Policy  Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] of our relations with Mandela,  the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We have had  close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we are  family. Regarding foreign relations [words indistinct]  conditions, the closer our friendship with a country, the less  we ask to establish ties. We allow circumstances and the  appropriate moment to determine the establishment of ties to  occur. In the special case of South Africa at this time, we  could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son. We  have  not pressed the issue of formal ties, however. I believe that  perhaps tomorrow, it will be brought up in the talks with the  foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with the  foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps, he will bring this up and ties will be established  immediately. We will not bring it up however. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up like a demand or as a  request from us.    It seems something, however, [word indistinct] that those  ties will be established quickly because there are few countries  with whom we have stronger ties in common -- kinship and  fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I did not speak with  ministers from other countries. We talked like old relatives. I  am convinced all of them want the quick establishment of ties,  but out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    [Reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and South Africa  had great differences because of Angola. Did you ever think  then, or later, that you would be here today in the former  capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South African nations. We have  to return to its history. For specific reasons, strong clashes  took place. Now, however, there is a new South Africa in which  such clashes no longer exist, just peace, harmony, respect, and  affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. [Words indistinct] the independence of Angola. We were  in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning of intervention by  foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our support -- for 15  years. So many things happened. We did not have a strong  presence, but it was strong enough because we could not, nor did  it depend on us alone, to attain a position was the problem.  [sentence as heard]    In Angola, we fought with the greatest selflessness. The  rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would said that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted, difficult but not through our fault. Cuba fulfilled  its duty. Cuba contributed to solve the highly difficult  problems that arose. I do not want to criticize anyone. I  believe today is not a day to criticize. Perhaps history will  record this.

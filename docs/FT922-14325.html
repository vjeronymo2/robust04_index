			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Slow progress on mean streets - The Issues: Urban Regeneration ON THE night of her 1987 election victory, Mrs Thatcher stood on the staircase of Conservative Central Office proclaiming her mission for a third term: to work harder for the inner cities. There was a clear political motive for such apparent philanthropy: little by little, the Tories were being squeezed out of Britain's cities. Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Hull were Tory-free zones; Edinburgh, Cardiff, Birmingham and Sheffield looked vulnerable to the same fate. The loss of political support was more galling because the Conservatives could claim significant successes in inner-city regeneration. In Liverpool, for example, the refurbishment of the Albert Dock had created a magnet for 4m tourists a year. The garden festival cleared a 125-acre site and restored an element of civic pride. And the Wavertree Technology Park provided Liverpool with its first A1 office park, attracting top information-technology companies to Merseyside. Much of the burden of regeneration had been borne by the urban development corporations (UDCs), quangos created by Mr Michael Heseltine during his first spell as environment secretary. Local councils appeared to have failed in their urban programmes, spending increasing amounts on costly public-sector projects without halting the decline. The UDCs were expected to use government money to lever in private capital, attracting developers by reclaiming land and putting infrastructure into place. However, in their haste to make progress, they all too often failed to win local support. Mr Harry Rimmer, the leader of Liverpool City Council, says: 'They planted a lot of trees and carried through prestige projects like the Albert Dock. But there were no jobs or training for the riverside communities and that made people cynical.' To fulfil Mrs Thatcher's 1987 pledge, the government launched its Action for Cities initiative, a re-packaging and streamlining of urban aid programmes. With costly breakfast briefings and proliferation of action documents, it did little to win over the local communities. But Mrs Thatcher's departure in 1990 brought Mr Heseltine back to the environment department with new ideas for involving local authorities in urban regeneration. He launched City Challenge, an invitation to 15 city councils to bid for Pounds 412m of funds, with the money going to the 10 councils producing the most convincing bids. Councils were told that the key to success would be to demonstrate effective partnerships between public, private and voluntary sectors. City Challenge was immediately derided as a 'game show' by Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, and a 'lottery' by Mr Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities. But whatever the ideological objections to competing for funds, Labour councils entered the bidding process with gusto. Liverpool won Pounds 48m for a five-year programme of city-centre renovation backed by local businesses, community representatives and voluntary organisations such as the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra which stands to benefit from the restoration of its concert hall. With Pounds 750m on offer in a second round of City Challenge, Liverpool is bidding for further funds for a large development at Speke and Garston. If the Conservatives form the next government, the City Challenge approach will allocate a growing proportion of government funds for regeneration. Money will be concentrated on a few large projects where substantial amounts of private capital can be attracted and the partnership approach can make a significant impact. A Labour government would honour existing City Challenge commitments, but the competitive approach would be scrapped. Partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors would still be encouraged, but funds would be distributed 'on the basis of need'. The UDCs and other government development bodies would be incorporated into locally accountable regional development agencies. This would not be unwelcome to many involved in the UDCs who are already forging informal links with other development agencies in their areas. Whatever the complexion of the next government, the economic downturn poses a challenge to the partnership approach now favoured by all the parties. The recession and the depressed commercial property market have reduced the flow of private capital into urban redevelopment. In Liverpool, for example, the next stage of the development corporation's programme, the clearing of the north docks, needs substantial investment which the private sector is unlikely to provide. The Conservatives' political chances in the inner cities may benefit from the partnership approach which Mr Heseltine has done so much to foster. That is now the commonly accepted wisdom on both sides of the political spectrum, locally and nationally. However, the party's failure to involve the local communities with their programmes has alienated many of those who were supposed to benefit. And the reliance on the private sector to provide the leadership and capital for redevelopment has left their market-based approach temporarily stalled as the recession has taken its toll.</p>

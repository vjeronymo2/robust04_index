			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Community ministers build on summit growth initiative EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday provisionally approved loan facilities worth Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.18bn), to try to speed economic recovery and build on the modest 'growth initiative' agreed at last December's Edinburgh summit. If confirmed, after more work on the details of the loans, the move amounts to a sort of deficit-financing, in which the EC has not previously indulged. The facilities take the form of an Ecu5bn bridging loan for mainly infrastructure projects across the Community; Ecu2bn in European Investment Bank loans for cross-border transport and communications networks; and Ecu1bn in soft loans to small and medium-sized industries. The bridging loan will be repaid, by 1999, out of the structural funds, the Ecu141.5bn regional and structural aid package agreed at Edinburgh. The intention is for the EC to borrow in the markets to speed up this development spending. The soft loans for small to medium-sized companies will have an interest rate subsidy of about Ecu129m, part financed out of the EC budget and part paid for from the structural funds. Agreement on how to share out the structural funds is at the moment held up by a wrangle over how big a share should go to Ireland, one of the four poorest member states which receive favoured treatment to enable them to catch up with average EC income levels. Separately, the ministers failed to unblock a measure increasing EC travel allowances. Germany had blocked an agreement in principle last year, linking any go-ahead to agreement on an EC-wide road charges system and liberalisation of road haulage. Both these issues were the subject of a political agreement on June 19, but Germany appears anxious to see the final text on the road transport measures before surrendering its last negotiating ace.</p>

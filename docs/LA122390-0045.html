			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA DOOMSAYERS DO NOT HELP HOME SALES  </P> <P> Let's get positive!  </P> <P> Having listed, sold and developed real estate in Southern California since  1984, I have had the opportunity to see our industry expand dramatically and  now, deflate on the unpredictable rails of media "doom and gloom."  </P> <P> It has been purported that we are in a severe housing slump. But relative to  what? 1980? 1973? 1988?  </P> <P> The real estate industry, more than almost any other, is one whose survival is  based on public perceptions -- not reality. If the public perceives a bad  market, guess what? The market sours. If perceptions are that the market is  "heating up," bingo! Sales improve.  </P> <P> So what's to be done? How about some positive, upbeat reporting in those areas  of real estate that are thriving rather than focusing on misery and mishap.  </P> <P> STEPHEN FINCH  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Xtra-vision petitions for appointment of examiner Xtra-vision, the USM-quoted video rental stores operator, has petitioned the High Court for the appointment of an examiner. The Ireland-based company said the protection afforded by the examiners legislation would best facilitate the necessary restructuring and should enable discussions, which have been taking place with investors, to progress to a satisfactory conclusion. The company, whose shares were suspended at 2 1/4 p, came to the USM in 1989. The shares at one point reached 100p. Over-expansion, an inappropriate depreciation policy and the growing impact of satellite TV on the market, caused the company to run into financial difficulties by 1991 with debts of IPounds 18m (Pounds 17m). Debts have since been reduced to IPounds 11.5m, but it is apparently having difficulty making repayments under a restructuring agreement with bank creditors made in August last year, and is facing contingent liabilities of up to IPounds 500,000 a year in the UK. Examinership has been sought as a means of maintaining the company as a viable trading unit.</p>

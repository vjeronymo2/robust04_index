			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Venezuela banking pay-out raises fears The eight financial institutions closed down by Venezuela's government this week will re-open on Monday to begin re-paying depositors, the Finance Ministry has announced. Economists warn that the multi-billion-dollar financial assistance provided by the government to ailing banks this year could drive inflation to record levels. The government of President Rafael Caldera has not revealed its detailed plans for the seven commercial banks and one finance company it closed. However, barring recapitalisation by former owners or offers by other investors to buy out the institutions, they are likely to be liquidated. The first payments scheduled for depositors next week will probably go to individuals with small accounts. The tens of thousands of businesses nationwide therefore have no idea when the government will free up larger deposits at the banks and their subsidiaries, or if other normal banking operations will be resumed. Under current legislation, each individual or company holding accounts at the institutions is entitled to a payment of up to about 4m bolivars (Pounds 15,000) from the government's bank deposit guarantee fund (Fogade), regardless of the number of accounts they hold. This will cost the government around Dollars 1.7bn, which may have to be funded through new bond issues. Officials are considering raising the total payment to individual depositors to a maximum 10m bolivars, the same amount paid after the failure - and recapitalisation - of Banco Latino earlier this year. The failure of Latino, the country's second largest bank, sparked the banking crisis. This would more than double the cost to the government, which has already supplied around Dollars 6bn in aid to the eight banks and Banco Latino since this year, creating a government deficit equal to around 10 per cent of GDP. Mr Julio Sosa, the finance minister, said recently that the government expected inflation of 50 to 60 per cent this year, up from 46 per cent in 1993. Some economic analysts are project predict price increases as high as 80 to 100 per cent. Taming inflation was one of the central goals of the Caldera government, which took office on February 2. It remains to be seen if the government's action will stabilise the Venezuelan financial system, in the grip of the second year of a recession, or if other banks that built up large loan portfolios in recent years will face problems later on.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (3): Figuring out the differences - The quality of corporate data ANYONE trying to analyse the accounts of companies in the different countries across Europe should be issued with a strong government health warning: attempts to make comparisons are likely to cause severe headaches. As the deadline for the single European market approaches at the end of this year, one issue still sorely lacking in standardisation is financial reporting. Users of accounts face enormous variations in the disclosure and treatment of information. A survey published at the end of 1991 by the US-based Centre for International Financial Analysis and Research (CIFAR) concluded solemnly: 'In spite of worldwide efforts . . . to harmonise financial reporting practices, the form and substance of published annual reports varies significantly.' CIFAR rated the accounts of 1,000 leading companies in 44 countries by the presence or absence of 90 items classified under seven headings: disclosure of general information, income statements, balance sheets, funds flow statements, accounting policies, stockholders' information and special items. The resulting 'international financial reporting index' ranks the non-EC countries of Scandinavia above many of their EC counterparts. Sweden scored highest of all, followed by Singapore and the UK. At the lower end of the scale, Austria ranked 31, Luxembourg 38 and Portugal 42. The same pattern emerges from individual companies. Ericsson of Sweden has the highest overall index score, followed by the Bank of Scotland, Shell Canada and Union Bank of Finland. Swedish businesses comprise five of the top 10 industrial scores, while those in the UK have four of the top seven among companies in the financial sector. The small number of large companies in some of the countries covered may well introduce distortions which make the index unrepresentative. However, the general findings are borne out by other recent pieces of research as well as more general anecdotes. A report just produced for the European Federation of Accountants (FEE), for example, showed wide divergence in topics such as the flow-of-funds statement, the treatment of assets for valuation and disclosure of pension provisions. Mr Scott Cormack, managing partner of KPMG Peat Marwick's European Business Centre in Brussels, says some of the principal issues treated in different ways across borders which will need to be addressed in the future include accounting for goodwill, foreign currency translations and tax accounting. Many of the variations reflect the fact that accounts produced in different countries are intended to serve different audiences. In the UK, the aim is to provide a 'true and fair view' for investors. Elsewhere, it is often the tax authorities that hold most sway. Mr Cormack distinguishes two basic styles. The 'Anglo-Saxon' philosophy stresses the profit and loss account, especially dividends and earnings, since it is driven by short-term returns. The alternative, which is prevalent in countries such as France and Germany, focuses on the balance sheet. This reflects a longer-term view from more stable financiers and others that companies should build up wealth. In the UK, the semi-independent Accounting Standards Board, whose members are drawn primarily from the accountancy firms, is taking a strong line in developing new guidelines in the former mould. Elsewhere, the regulator is often the national legislature with an eye firmly on tax revenues. Nevertheless, there has been considerable convergence in financial reporting in Europe over the past few years. Partly, Mr David Cairns, secretary-general of the International Accounting Standards Committee, argues, this is a function of the increasing search for international capital, which has helped boost Anglo-Saxon-style reporting. Many companies now produce two sets of accounts: one to meet local requirements and the other for international consumption.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar breaks DM1.70 barrier MOUNTING speculation about further cuts in European interest rates strengthened the dollar yesterday, in spite of a figures showing a slight fall in US factory orders, writes Gillian Tett. After trading around a narrow band at the DM1.69 in the morning, the dollar broke through the DM1.70 level in the afternoon, closing at DM1.7045, nearly a  1/4 pfennig up on the previous day's close. The dollar also gained against the French franc and sterling, closing at FFr5.7450 and Dollars 1.4935. The dollar's rise was partly prompted by the release of data showing that unemployment in France rose by 29,000 or 0.9 per cent in May. Coupled with a spate of gloomy economic indicators from Spain, showing a 7.6 per cent drop in industrial production in April and 1.1 per cent fall in GDP during the first quarter of the year, the figures strengthened market expectations of a new round of interest rate cuts - speculation that grew after US President Bill Clinton called on the Bundesbank to reduce its interest rates at its council meeting today. On the back of the uncertainty about German rate cuts, sterling surged to its highest point against the D-Mark since its devaluation last autumn. During heavy trading it peaked around DM2.555 during the afternoon, before finally falling back to close at DM2.545, unchanged on the previous day. Although this leaves sterling around 1 1/2 pfennigs up on the beginning of the month, the market yesterday remained dubious that sterling would be able to rise further and break though the DM2.60 barrier. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London believes that the bullish tone that accompanied sterling's rapid rise at the beginning of the week is gradually receding, as the market begins to recognise the uneven pace of the UK recovery. 'All this seems a bit premature. The sentiment is right, but the market seems to be reacting too fast,' said Mr Hannah, who predicts that if sterling does rise to the DM2.60 level, the pressure from British exporters will be for further UK rate cuts. Nevertheless, as Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank points out, sterling is expected to continue to make modest gains for some time. 'Over time the short term interest rate gap will move in England's favour and that will help underpin sterling,' Mr Martin said. Meanwhile the yen continued to rally against the dollar, in spite of rumours in Tokyo that the Bank of Japan was preparing for a rate cut next week. After strengthening in the European markets to Y106.8 per dollar from a previous day's close of Y107.0 it opened in New York at Y105.20, close to the post war low of Y104.80.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Scottish rule on Fraser's agenda THE GOVERNMENT showed yesterday that Scotland's constitutional arrangements are on its agenda by listing 'constitutional affairs' among the responsibilities of Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, the new Scottish Office minister of state. There was no indication from the Scottish Office of what Lord Fraser, who was formerly the Lord Advocate, will do in exercising this responsibility, which is part of his home affairs portfolio. He will also take care of health and social work, and will represent the Scottish Office in the House of Lords. According to the department, the designation 'constitutional affairs' has never before appeared in the list of responsibilities of Scottish Office ministers. Lord Fraser has in the past favoured devolution. The Conservatives said in their election manifesto that they remained 'willing to consider ways of improving the government of Scotland' but said proposals had to be judged by the extent to which they would 'strengthen or undermine the union'. Options likely to be considered range from improving the way in which Scottish business is dealt with at Westminster to creating some form of representative body in Scotland to complement the single-tier structure of local authorities which the government plans to introduce to replace the current two-tier structure. The general council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress yesterday postponed a decision on whether to take the unprecedented step of inviting the Scottish National party to address the STUC's annual congress starting this weekend. The general council will make its decision on Sunday after tomorrow's meeting of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, a body dominated by the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.</p>

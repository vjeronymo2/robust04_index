			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Profits at CS Holding surge 65% CS HOLDING, the financial services group built around Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, yesterday reported a jump of 65 per cent, to SFr882m (Dollars 600m), in first-half net income. It forecast a 'very good' full-year profit. The strong result, attributed mainly to soaring revenues from trading, enabled the group to reach for the first time its target of a 15 per cent return on equity. The return would have been higher if the group had not shifted an unusually high proportion of its SFr2.8bn in pre-tax profits to provisions for bad loans. Provisions in the first half reached SFr1.34bn, SFr509m more than in the first half last year. All but SFr9m of the SFr234m pre-tax profit of the group's new subsidiary, Swiss Volksbank, was placed in a contingency provision. This was in addition to SFr472m of excess Volksbank equity transferred to general reserves. Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, said economic activity was recovering, particularly in Switzerland. But with the recovery moving slowly, 'a considerable amount' would probably have to be charged to provisions in the full year. Another CS Holding official acknowledged that the provisions at the interim stage were very generous, but said they were made as a contingency. 'It is better to do it in the first half rather than be surprised in the second half,' he said. Consolidated gross income jumped 44 per cent to SFr6.49bn. Volksbank, acquired in April for SFr1.6bn, provided SFr655m of the rise. Trading income, the group's largest source of profit, soared 83 per cent to SFr2.3bn, while commission income was up 31 per cent to SFr2.2bn. Net interest income ahead 23 per cent to SFr1.67bn. Total operating expenses advanced 37 per cent to SFr3.7bn, with the inclusion of Volksbank figures accounting for two-fifths of the rise. Much of the rest came from big performance bonuses paid at CS First Boston subsidiaries. The addition of Volksbank pushed total assets to SFr343.3bn at June 30, making CS the largest Swiss financial services group.</p>

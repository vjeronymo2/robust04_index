			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor welcomes French truce SIGNALS that the new French government wanted 'trade peace' were welcomed yesterday by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. He called for relations between the 'two new governments' to be placed on a 'more positive footing'. Mr Kantor last week came under fire when, on his first visit as trade representative to the European Community, he refused to offer the usual US homilies about free trade. His insistence on a pragmatic, market-opening policy raised fears that the US would close its own market if its demands were not met. Apparently anxious to show his desire for trade peace, Mr Kantor responded to statements on Tuesday by Mr Edouard Balladur, the new French prime minister, who said that although he would press for 'improvements' to the global farm trade agreement, he wanted 'trade peace with Washington'. The French premier added he did not want to cause a crisis within the EC or the Uruguay Round negotiations over farm trade.</p>

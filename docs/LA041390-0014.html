			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL WHO WILL LEAD?;  </P> <P> PREDICAMENT CRIES OUT FOR A DE GAULLE;  </P> <P> WORD THAT A BROOKLYN RABBI BLOCKED SHIMON PERES' NEW GOVERNING COALITION MAY  SPARK POLITICAL REFORM.  </P> <P> The Israeli government has become so fragile and unstable in the 1980s that it  can barely decide anything. A mere word from President Bush deploring new  settlements in East Jerusalem, a reiteration of familiar U.S. policy, was  blamed by some for the fall of the Likud government in March. A few days ago,  the embryo coalition that was to have replaced that government fell apart as  the prospective prime minister, Shimon Peres, prepared to seek his first vote  of confidence in the Knesset.  </P> <P> The story of the coalition's collapse -- at the whim, it was said, of an aged  Brooklyn rabbi who has never set foot in Israel -- may be exaggerated. Even so,  it is richly symbolic of the besetting problems of Israeli democracy.  </P> <P> In the narrowly divided Knesset, Peres looked to a small sectarian party, the  Agudat Israel, to support him. It has become routine practice for would-be  prime ministers to court the favor of these mini-parties, many of which have  extremist and sectarian views. The Agudat Israel, after weeks of negotiations,  was pledged to support Peres. Then, at the last moment, two of its members  bolted.  </P> <P> One of them explained that he had sought long-distance counsel from the Rabbi  Menachem Schneerson of Brooklyn, a charismatic Hasidic leader in whom many  followers see messianic qualities. The rabbi is vehemently opposed to the Labor  Party's standing promise to swap land (in the occupied territories) for peace.  So much for the Peres coalition.  </P> <P> In Israel, no political consensus has existed on the vital issues for more than  10 years -- since the signing of the Camp David accords, in fact. Meanwhile,  the Palestinian revolt in the occupied territories is a continuing  embarrassment.  </P> <P> Since the collapse of Menachem Begin during the invasion of Lebanon, in 1982,  no government has had the strength to negotiate for a West Bank agreement with  the Palestinians or to control a settlement policy which, however technically  legal, is an irritant and affront to every American Administration.  </P> <P> The institutional structure of Israeli government, moreover, accentuates rather  than eases its divisions. The Knesset confers proportional representation on  every fractional party, however insular or irrelevant its views. Every  government coalition is therefore a fragile mosaic, no stronger than its most  sectarian constituent. This is a recipe for extremism and drift in Israeli  politics.  </P> <P> Parallels are never exact, but Israel's predicament recalls, in nearly every  particular, the nearly fatal paralysis of France in the '50s due to the  Algerian uprising.  </P> <P> When the crisis came, France could call on Charles de Gaulle, a great man of  character who cared nothing for public-opinion polls or for the squalid  compromises on which factional pseudo-democracy operates. A strong presidency  with power to make decisions was grafted onto parliamentary anarchy.  </P> <P> Happily, the spectacle of the Peres disaster seems to have galvanized public  opinion in Israel. The idea that the government itself might turn upon the whim  of some sectarian rabbi in Brooklyn who has never so much as visited Israel has  revolted every sensible Israeli. Reform is in the air. But what kind of reform?  A mild dose of De Gaullism would probably be good for Israel. But who will play  De Gaulle?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Wladyslaw Klaczynski, director of the Press and  Information Department in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, speaks  on the meeting between President Lech Walesa and Bill Clinton:    [Begin Klaczynski recording] The meeting between the two  presidents took place in a very matter-of-fact and calm  [spokojna] atmosphere. President Walesa said that Poland did  not intend to block the [Partnership for Peace] initiative, but  he pointed out all the doubts connected with it, the doubts  arising from the historical experience of our country, and the  doubts arising from the assessment of the situation.    Anyway, President Walesa emphasized the wish, if not to say  a  determined wish, for the process of our country's integration  with European structures, involving equally the areas of  security, politics, and economics, to take place efficiently and  as speedily as possible. He emphasized that this aspiration is  not aimed at cutting Russia off and that this aspiration was not  aimed against Russia and Russia's interests.    Another important element was a statement by Prime Minister  Pawlak who spoke about economic relations between Poland and  Europe, and between Poland and the United States.    President Walesa emphasized on many occasions the need for  more activity on the part of Western Europe in the integration  processes. I would like to stress here what President Clinton  pointed out a few times. He said that he regarded the  Partnership for Peace as an opening of the door and not the  creation of obstacles.

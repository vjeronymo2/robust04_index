			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / House price rise of 3% predicted HOUSE PRICES will rise 3 per cent across the country this year, with sales volume increasing 10 per cent, an economic adviser to Lloyds Bank has predicted. Mr Patrick Moon paints a mixed picture in the April issue of Lloyds Bank's Economic Bulletin, with some regions likely to experience further house price declines and others seeing above-average rises. He says the areas offering greatest scope for revival, based on an analysis of house prices in relation to incomes, include the south-east, Greater London and the south-west. The areas most likely to see further falls are East Anglia, the east Midlands, the west Midlands, the north and north-west of England, and Wales. Mr Moon says: 'Recovery in the housing market this year will depend on a restoration of confidence. With unemployment likely to rise further in 1993, this will serve as a constraint on any recovery in house prices.' The incomes of those in employment will also be influential, he adds. Reports from housebuilders and estate agents indicate a higher level of viewings this year compared with last year. Last week the ombudsman for corporate estate agents reported that the number of properties coming on to the market had jumped in the first two months of the year, but was still below 1992 levels.</p>

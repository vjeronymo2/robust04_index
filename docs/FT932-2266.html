			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hobson turnround to Pounds 210,000 profit Improved trading performance continued into the second half at Hobson, and resulted in the group returning to profit for the year ended March 31 1993. Additionally, the acquisition of Cadismark and rationalisation of its production into the Shepshed Toiletries factory resulted in the cost savings and increased efficiencies envisaged. At the pre-tax level, the profit came to Pounds 140,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 210,000, from turnover of Pounds 9.04m (Pounds 6.35m). Earnings per share were 0.2p (losses 0.41p). The directors said they were committed to the expansion of the consumer products division through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, and commodity trading was likely to diminish in importance in future results.</p>

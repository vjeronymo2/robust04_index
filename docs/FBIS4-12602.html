			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F> Beilin by Karmit Gay; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [Gay] Your trip to Oman seems less certain than before,  since the hosts of the multilateral conference on water asked  the Israelis to postpone their arrival.    [Beilin] It is true, such a request was presented. There  had been a tendency, even a decision to send the preliminary  group on 3 April, but they asked to put it off to 10 April. We  do not know yet whether their demand reflects a desire to change  the parameters of our participation. We will only know it when  the preliminary delegation arrives there. If it transpires that  they want to change the parameters -- namely, to limit our  participation or deny media attendance, we will insist that the  Oman encounter be identical to the other multilateral forums in  every sense. We are definitely not going to agree to any change  of the talks' parameters. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mateus Ngonhamo of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] has once again accused the UN system in  Mozambique, especially Aldo Ajello, of being particularly  critical of that movement and benevolent to the Mozambican  Government. Ngonhamo says that could become a bad precedent for  the country's pacification process.    [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We are worried about the UN  conduct, because the organization is only concerned with the  minor issues but ignores major ones. UN partiality is creating  difficulties for us. Ever since the UN mission arrived in  Mozambique it has never accused the government, except once when  Mr. Aldo Ajello said he would draft a document informing the UN  Security Council that the government was not complying with the  confinement program. That was the only time. This is a very  dangerous situation.    Personally, I think if one day war breaks out in Mozambique  again, the UN elements, notably Mr. Aldo Ajello, will be the  guilty party. He is here to assist Mozambicans holding on to  peace. Instead of letting people hold onto peace, he encourages  them to do otherwise. That is very dangerous for the Mozambican  people. I regret this situation. I think the United Nations  and Dr. Ajello, in his capacity as chief of the UN Operations in  Mozambique, should review their modus operandi. [end recording]</p>

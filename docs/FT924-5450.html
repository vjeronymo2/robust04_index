			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Devaluation keeps attention on Nordic bourses NORDIC bourses continued to attract attention following Sweden's currency devaluation and on hopes that Norway would follow suit, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM resumed its upward trend after Tuesday's brief pause as lower credit market yields gave extra impetus to the market. Export-oriented heavy engineering groups, Astra and Ericsson were all in demand. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 24.7 or 2.9 per cent to 866.0 in brisk turnover of SKr1.37bn after SKr916m. Ericsson B shares jumped SKr9 to 181 in heavy turnover of SKr266m and Astra A advanced by SKr23 to SKr726. OSLO climbed 2.3 per cent on continued devaluation speculation, the all-share index closing 8.04 higher at 354.72 in moderate turnover of NKr266m. Industrial and shipping companies, which would benefit most from a weaker crown boosting their exports, made biggest gains and Norsk Hydro put on NKr3.5 to NKr139.5. HELSINKI rose 5 per cent after the government and trade unions reached an agreement on a dispute over plans to cut jobless benefits and avoided a strike which would have started today. The Hex index closed 40.3 higher at 850.4, banks and finance houses rising by 10.4 per cent. FRANKFURT barely maintained the improved tone of Tuesday's post-bourse during which Volkswagen made a minor recovery, and the stock closed DM2.50 higher at DM271 yesterday. The DAX index climbed 7.44 to 1,517.72 as turnover eased from DM4.6bn to DM4.5bn. Sentiment sank on further consideration of third quarter reports, including VW's, and news that the Bundesbank was keeping its repo rate unchanged at 8.75 per cent weighed further on failing interest rate hopes, described as wishful thinking from abroad. Among other blue chips, Siemens climbed DM7.40 to DM589.50, supported by the view that its profits will remain fairly steady in 1993, in contrast to Germany industry as a whole. Utilities, a conventional defensive sector, were also strong, as Viag gained DM6.70 to DM338.30 and RWE DM5 to DM404. Steels were weak, and Thyssen dropped another DM3.80 to DM154.90 as expectations of strong results for 1991-92 today continued to recede. PARIS survived an invasion by firecracker-throwing farmers and trading was dominated by the futures market, which caused the CAC-40 index to jump more than 10 points in the final minutes. The index closed 0.36 higher at 1,720.97 compared with a low for the day of 1,705.71. Turnover fell back to FFr1.85bn. Eridania-Beghin-Say fell FFr13 to FFr562 in heavy volume of 70,250 shares as some players took the view that the recent Gatt accord between the EC and the US would lead to lower sugar prices. Trading in Hachette and Matra resumed after a two-day suspension following the publication of revised merger terms. Hachette dropped FFr10.40 or 10.9 per cent to FFr85 and Matra dropped FFr10.70 or 5.5 per cent to FFr184. Television stocks featured, with the pay television group, Canal Plus, adding FFr35 to FFr1,045. DUBLIN marked the Irish election by extending its climb from its 1992 lows, the ISEQ overall index closing 37.04 or 3.2 per cent higher at 1,193.90 for a four-day gain of 8.6 per cent. Dealers said that the stock market was in the first phase of a rally on the expectation of a 10 per cent devaluation in the punt, bringing the Irish currency back into line with sterling. Buying was mainly by domestic institutions, and could be expected to enter a second phase when the currency realignment, expected within the next few days, takes place. MADRID closed moderately higher, boosted by strong gains in Telefonica which closed Pta30 higher at Pta1,125. The general index closed 1.72 higher at 211.94 in turnover of Pta19.6bn, bloated by a Pta6bn put-through in the small security company, Prosegur, at Pta1,755 a share. MILAN ended flat after an uneventful trading session. The Comit index rose 0.35 to 446.80 in turnover estimated at less than Tuesday's L270bn. Sme remained in the limelight, the shares rising L192 to 3.6 per cent to L5,553 and hitting L5,590 later in the session. Among leading stocks, Fiat was fixed L11 higher at L4,461 but slipped to L4,385 after hours while Mediobanca closed L45 down at L13,520. ZURICH liked the positive start on Wall Street, and the SMI index closed 6.5 up at 1,886,7. Brown Boveri bearers closed SFr10 firmer at SFr3,310 after an interim report.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- November 25                                      THE EUROPEAN SERIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                   Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1044.03    1045.92   1046.38   1045.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1113.74    1114.39   1114.13   1115.09  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                 13.00      14.00     15.00     Close  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1044.28    1043.12   1043.53   1042.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1112.99    1111.58   1111.61   1111.41  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        Nov 24    Nov 23    Nov 20    Nov 19    Nov 18  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.83   1038.38   1051.29   1047.93   1051.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1110.69   1110.18   1117.40   1110.76   1106.59  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1046.92; 200 - 1116.72 Low/day: 100 - 1042.50  200 - 1109.37  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers meet to finalise export pact REPRESENTATIVES of about 40 of the world's leading coffee producer nations are meeting today and tomorrow in Brasilia to finalise an agreement to retain stocks as a move to boost prices. Between them the countries represent about 90 per cent of world exports. Scheduled to take effect in October, the scheme they have agreed upon envisages the retention of 20 per cent of each country's exports until the price of coffee reaches 75 US cents a lb; 10 per cent will be retained until the price hits 80 cents. Above that level, there will be no retention. Each country will be responsible for implementing its own retention plan. The world's most important coffee producer, Brazil, intends to cover exporters' costs by purchasing stocks ear-marked for retention. It will pay them 80 per cent of face value, deducting taxes and estimated profits, calculated at a combined 20 per cent of the sale price, says Mr Gilson Ximenes, director of the National Coffee Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Concerns about the ability of the financially troubled Brazilian government to meet these obligations have been played down by Mr Jose Eduardo de Andrade Vieira, minister of industry and commerce. Producers have already agreed to establish a new organisation called the Association of Coffee Producing Nations, with headquarters in Brasilia. It will monitor the retention programmes of individual countries, with the assistance of an independent auditor. Germany will sign the new international cocoa agreement aimed at strengthening international co-operation and stabilising the markets on October 1, the agriculture ministry said yesterday, reports Reuter from Bonn. The new agreement, hammered out by producer and consumer members of the International Cocoa Organisation earlier this month and based on a production management policy, is scheduled to come into effect on that date.</p>

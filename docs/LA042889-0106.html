			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE INSURANCE DEPT. HANDICAPPED BY FIRE, CONSUMER GROUP SAYS  </P> <P> The ability of the state Department of Insurance to regulate the insurance  industry and process consumer complaints has been handicapped as the result of  a recent fire at its mid-Wilshire District headquarters, consumer advocates  said Thursday.  </P> <P> State officials acknowledged that the displacement caused by the fire has  resulted in some problems, including the temporary shutdown of the department's  computer system. But they said the disruption of services has been "minimal."  </P> <P> About 500 state office workers from six agencies were displaced by the March 2  fire on the 15th floor of the 19-story CNA Building at 600 S. Commonwealth Ave.  </P> <P> State inspectors discovered asbestos fibers in the building and ordered some of  the workers to leave in mid-March. The remainder of the workers were told to  leave April 3.  </P> <P> The results of a test of asbestos levels conducted by the state Department of  General Services will be released Monday, said department spokeswoman Anne  Garbeff.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City fire officials said Thursday that the blaze, which started in  a computer workroom of the state Department of Savings and Loan, was the work  of an arsonist. A Fire Department spokesman said there were no suspects.  </P> <P> Four of the displaced agencies, including the Department of Insurance, moved to  a Wilshire Boulevard high-rise. But workers in other departments -- including  the Department of Corporations -- are still working out of their homes.  </P> <P> Steven Miller, executive director of the Insurance Consumer Action Network,  said that because of the Insurance Department's displacement, many department  records were no longer available to the public. Some insurance customers have  complained to his organization because they were unable to reach the  department's offices, he said.  </P> <P> "The fact that this has been going on for so long and that the governor has not  ordered General Services to treat this as a crisis and a high priority is  inexcusable," Miller said.  </P> <P> Miller said that when his group asked the department for public documents  relating to a recent request by State Farm for a rate increase, the department  said the documents could not be found. Eventually, the department asked State  Farm to provide the consumer advocates with copies of the documents, he said.  </P> <P> "This kind of disruption is going to disable the department's statutory  regulating functions and their mandate to protect consumers," Miller said.  </P> <P> Carey Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Department in San Francisco,  said, however, that the Los Angeles office is operating at "nearly 100%  capacity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Up and Running'  </P> <P> "People are doing the absolute best they can under the circumstances," she  said. "We are up and running."  </P> <P> Fletcher said the department's computer system has been disconnected since  April 6. She said the system would be removed from the Commonwealth Avenue  building and reconnected at the department's new offices in "the next day or  two." The department will rent a second computer system to handle the "minimal  backlog of cases," she added.  </P> <P> One employee in the department's Los Angeles office who did not wish to be  identified said the office's temporary shutdown came at an especially bad time  because of the confusion caused by Proposition 103, the recently passed  insurance initiative  </P> <P> "It's like the Department of Defense shutting down in the middle of World War  III," the employee said.  </P> <P> Many workers in the department have spent five weeks without typewriters or  computer processors, the employee said.  </P> <P> "We still don't have the capability to send a letter to someone," he said. "All  of this mail is stacking up waiting to be answered."  </P> <P> On Thursday afternoon, calls to numbers listed for the Insurance Department's  Los Angeles office were either unanswered, or answered with recorded messages.  Calls to the department's consumer hot line were unanswered.  </P></p>

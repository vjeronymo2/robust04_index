			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Something is certainly making a difference to Lonrho. Last week's rush of buying took its shares above the 115p price paid by Mr Dieter Bock for the stake he bought from Mr Tiny Rowland. There are three reasons for this change of sentiment. Metals prices, especially gold, are stronger; Gencor's restructuring has revived hopes of it buying a chunk of Lonrho's 73 per cent stake in Western Platinum; the decision to sell the Observer shows Mr Bock is exerting a strong and positive influence. All these factors, though, are flawed as the basis for a sustained recovery in Lonrho's price. While gold is currently firm, the price of rhodium, on which Lonrho arguably depends more heavily, remains depressed. Gencor's primary focus is on Shell's mining assets. It seems in no hurry to increase its Western Platinum stake. As for the Bock factor, the case is not yet proven. Since his arrival Lonrho has moved quickly to sell German real estate as well as the Observer. But even allowing for these disposals, gearing is probably still close to 60 per cent once minorities are excluded. That is not a comfortable starting point for expansion. The time to judge Mr Bock will be when he has revealed what he is going to do with the company and how it will be financed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Naha, June 7 KYODO -- Okinawa Gov. [governor]  Masahide ta will urge the U.S. Government and military to reduce  its bases in Okinawa during a 13-day trip to the United States  starting Thursday [9 June], prefectural officials said Tuesday.    Ota, who has visited the U.S. twice over the issue, is  scheduled to meet commanding officers of the Hawaii-based U.S.  Pacific Fleet.    In Washington he will have talks with representatives for  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary  William Perry as well as with members of the Senate and House  Armed Services Committees.    Some 75 percent of U.S. military facilities in Japan are  located in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost prefecture. Ota hopes  to convince Washington that a partial withdrawal from Okinawa,  which would make more land available for nonmilitary purposes,  will help the prefecture's economic development.    On Ota's wish list are the return of the U.S. naval port in  Naha, and the abolition of parachute training and  live-ammunition exercises.    The governor also plans to meet former Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger, who served as the late U.S. President Richard  Nixon's adviser during the negotiations for the return of  U.S.-held Okinawa to Japan.    Okinawa was reunited with Japan after a 27-year occupation  on  May 15, 1972, under the condition that U.S. forces would be  allowed to continue to use Okinawan bases.    Ota plans to ask Kissinger for more details about a secret  document guaranteeing the reentry of U.S. nuclear weapons and  transit rights in Okinawa in case of emergency. The pact was  signed in 1969 by then Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and  Nixon as revealed in a recently published book, the officials  said.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano cleared to relaunch bid - Rolo investors will decide whether to accept a new offer The Bank of Italy, which supervises Italy's fragmented banking sector, has given Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank, the formal go-ahead to launch an improved bid for 65 per cent of Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) of Bologna. The central bank's approval, which came late on Tuesday, removes another hurdle from Credit's path, but it could be well into the new year before it knows whether it has persuaded Rolo's shareholders that its approach is a friendly one. In the meantime, the door has been left ajar for a counter-bid. At a crucial board meeting on Saturday night, Rolo directors agreed unanimously that Credit's plans for a new offer respected shareholders' and the group's interests more than the Milan bank's original proposal. Those proposals were announced at the end of October and promptly rejected as hostile and inadequate. Although Rolo's attitude to the new plan was widely interpreted as supportive, the bank has since made clear that shareholders alone must decide on the merits of the new Credit offer. While they are ruminating, Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is understood to be considering an alternative offer. This would probably be in alliance with IMI, the former state-controlled financial services and banking group, and supported by Bank Austria, in which Cariplo has a stake. It is unlikely to make a move until Credit has formally launched its own bid, but the terms Cariplo and its allies would have to beat are already clear. Credit has said it will offer L20,000 for each Rolo share, compared with L19,000 in the original plans, and extend the offer to 65 per cent rather than 48 per cent of the company. If successful, Credit would pay some L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn) for the 65 per cent stake. Under Italian takeover rules, the overall value of a counter-bid would have to be at least 5 per cent higher - a requirement which could be met by bidding for more shares or increasing the price per share. Funding a bid is unlikely to be the main challenge for Cariplo. Like many Italian banks, it is unquoted and controlled by a charitable foundation. Earlier this year, the bank postponed plans for a L1,650bn share issue which would have given it a stock market listing for the first time in its 170-year history. But the bank was not compelled to raise funds, and advocates of a counter-bid believe Rolo is within Cariplo's range. More important for Cariplo is that it should win an enthusiastic recommendation from the Rolo board. This could be more problematic, given the conflicting reactions to Credit's latest plans, welcomed as 'friendly' by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman and one of Rolo's largest shareholders, but still eyed with suspicion by some local investors. Credit itself had to work hard to win even Saturday's dry statement from the Rolo board, struggling to dispel the impression that Rolo might simply disappear inside a less efficient 'national' bank. Credit, privatised only a year ago, has argued strongly that it should not be judged only on the basis of relative efficiency. Until the late 1980s, it and other large Italian banks were constrained by archaic Italian banking regulations to operating in parts of Italy - in particular Lombardy and Piedmont - dominated by mature industry. Smaller banks in regions such as Emilia Romagna, where Rolo operates, have been able to take advantage of the faster growth of dynamic small and medium-sized export-led companies. Managers of some of those companies in Emilia Romagna point out, however, that their needs tend to leapfrog national banks such as Credit. Either they require local service, from small regional banks, or detailed export advice and support in foreign markets, where the likes of Credit (and Cariplo, for that matter) are still outclassed by well-established investment banks. 'Small entrepreneurs need a frank relationship with bank managers, and I think it's difficult for bank managers to assume responsibility for decisions if they are employed from Milan or Turin,' says Mr Manlio Maggioli, president of the local employers' association in Rimini, on the Romagna coast. To win over such clients - and, in turn, a whole range of local Bolognese interests from the church to academia - Credit has now made firm commitments, albeit with a time limit, to preserving Rolo's strong regional identity, maintaining a healthy dividend policy, and giving minority shareholders board representation. Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, is expected to approve the new Credit plan at the end of this week, or the beginning of next. This would allow Credit to announce the detailed terms of its bid formally around the middle of next week and launch it a week later with a closing date in mid-January. Whether or not Cariplo then decides to enter the fray, it is clear the complex struggle for control of the Bolognese bank could finally be won or lost on Rolo's own territory.</p>

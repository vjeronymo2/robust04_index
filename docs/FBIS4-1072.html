			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State President F.W. de Klerk by Richard </F> Steyn, Shaun Johnson, and Chris Whitfield in the president's  office in the Union Buildings; date not specified]    [Text]  <H5>  On whether he is still confident about the future. </H5>   [De Klerk] I believe, I am confident, that we are going to  succeed. There is no alternative, and in that sense I think  this period will be written up as the period beginning a new era  which launched South Africa as a very successful state and as a  successful nation.  <H5>  On the fears of Afrkaners and other groups. </H5>   [De Klerk] I believe the Afrikaner nation, and the Zulu  nation and all other nations which form part of the greater  whole of the South African nation, need not fear for their  futures as entities. Already, in terms of the transitional  constitution, there is a sufficient constitutional and legal  base (to protect them). I believe that as long as there is a  commitment among Afrikaner to cherish their language and their  culture and traditions, the Afrikaner nation will continue to  exist. And it can only exist in interaction with all other  South Africans.  <H5>  On the folly of separatism. </H5>   [De Klerk] I also believe that the new 34th principle (of  the  Interim Constitution), in conjunction with the others will lead  to a dynamic negotiation about the strength of the position of  the various cultural groups, nations in South Africa...however,  I don't see the guarantee for the identity of Afrikaners or  other nations existing in separatism in any way whatsoever. But  I think there are various possibilities at which we could look  within the framework of the constitution, as to how we could  strengthen the security of people who feel strongly about their  cultural identity. They are struggling with it, but in Belgium  there are interesting examples as to what can be achieved.  <H5>  On a volkstaat. [Afrikaner homeland] </H5>   [De Klerk] Rather than working for a volkstaat which is  unachievable, I think Afrikaners and the Zulus and others should  look specifically at other (constitutional) options to maintain  their identity.  <H5>  On whether he would do anything differently with the benefit </H5> of hindsight.    [De Klerk] On the major issues and the major decisions, I  have no regrets. On some specifics, yes. With hindsight one  would have done certain things differently, approached  negotiations about a specific issue maybe differently...things  which wasted time. But on major issues no regrets. I would  have taken the same decisions, I would have made the same speech  on the 2nd of February, I would have called the referendum, I  would have abolished the apartheid laws and I would have worked  for the type of constitution which we now have.  <H5>  On the Interim Constitution. </H5>   [De Klerk] I'm happy with the constitution, basically  satisfied. It's not perfect, I think it can be improved, but on  all the goals which we spelt out in the referendum, we have  basically achieved them. We stated 14 principles, departure  points, call them what you will. And all 14 are there, in some  instances to 100 percent satisfaction, in a few instances we got  120 percent -- we actually started out setting our sight a  little bit lower but we got more. In other instances maybe 80  percent, but substantially we have achieved those 14 goals which  we strove for. The transitional constitution and the  principles, I think, lay a sound basis for the right type of  constitution for South Africa.  <H5>  On whether he has considered stepping down. </H5>   [De Klerk] No, I don't lie awake at night. Really, I haven't  thought about it, I have been working so hard. And can I say  that, honestly, in the government of national unity I will be  number one, even if I happen to come second in the election. I  will be number one for the millions of people who are going to  vote for me. I will be there representing them in my own right,  I won't be there as anybody's number two man.  <H5>  On the possibility of being deputy president. </H5>   [De Klerk] If I was to be number two in the hierarchy after  the election, I have no problem with that. It will be a  government of national unity. In a winner-takes-all system it  happens quite often that a former prime minister becomes the  leader of the opposition. We are moving into a unique situation  and I have no compunction about what lies a head.  <H5>  On how the NP [National Party] will perform next week. </H5>   [De Klerk] We are fighting to become the biggest party.  Against even our own expectations and predictions, growing  support is already showing up in the opinion polls. We didn't  expect it to show so soon. There is a particular surge of  support in Natal. And remember, when we talk about being the  biggest party, we are not talking about having 50 percent or  more of the vote in terms of our new system.  <H5>  On the option of staying out of the new Cabinet as an </H5> opposition party.    [De Klerk] Well, that is a constitutional option. Nobody is  forced into the government of national unity. But such a step  would militate against what we set out to achieve. We said it  is our policy that there must be power-sharing. We believe the  country needs co-operation between the major parties. We need  at least a period of stability during which political strife is  put aside and we make a great effort at reconciliation and  creating stability. And, on the basis of that stability, within  the framework of wise and frugal economic policies, creating  dynamic and sustained economic growth. The intensive  negotiation of the past four years has proved itself to be a  powerful mechanism, and this is what a government of national  unity is about, it is a constant process of negotiation. Up  till now we have been negotiating the constitution. In the  government of national unity it becomes negotiation about each  and every important issue which governments have to deal with.  <H5>  On his experiences on the campaign trail. </H5>   [De Klerk] I've had no overwhelming problems so far in this  campaign. The real bitterness of the right wing played itself  out in 1989. It's still there of course, but it no longer  impacts on my meetings and day-to-day activities. The last real  problem I had was at Ventersdorp. Vis-a-vis the intimidation  from ANC supporters, it has been a regular feature. Where it  really got out of hand we laid complaints, and as you know big  fines have been levied now. Those were really bad cases. In  other instances we lived with it where it didn't get out of  hand. Politics isn't for sissies. It's robust and I am not  overly sensitive. You must just see to it that you have a very  strong microphone and it has, sometimes, a very motivating  effect on your own supporters when they see you are not  frightened, and especially when they outnumber the others.    One of the good experiences was at one of my roadshows where  a group of about 80 ANC youths was waving placards, and I think  we had about 800 or so. So I said: "Why do we wait for the 27th  of April? Let's vote now. All those of you who vote for the  National Party put up your hands. It was a sea of hands. And  then I said: "All those who vote for the ANC?" About 15 hands  went up, and it created a great spirit.  <H5>  On how the relationship with the majority party will work. </H5>   [De Klerk] We'll have to develop procedures for that. I've  had interesting discussions with European leaders who are in  similar situations. As a guideline, I would say there must be  room for public dissension, because parties will retain their  identity. On day-to-day matters, on immediate matters where  consensus is reached, obviously we would avoid making the  original dissension public. But where we do want to express our  disagreement -- that is what Parliament is there for. You could  even register your opposition to a decision by taking a vote in  parliament. But then, as happens with boards of directors in a  company, you vote against it but you acquiesce in the decision  of the majority.    One would have to limit such things to major policy issues  where a party needs to say to the public: "If I had the sole  say, this is how I would have done it." It is possible to marry  these things. It happens in every practical partnership every  day.  <H5>  On whether he will be able to criticise the new Cabinet </H5> freely.    [De Klerk] Absolutely yes, that is why I emphasise that I am  not there on the basis of anybody doing me a favour. I will be  there as of right because the constitution says so. Another  aspect which gives me confidence is that in negotiations we  looked at the problem of what happens if you don't get along  well, and we considered whether we should have decision-making  processes -- increased majorities, a voting procedure for  Cabinet -- and we agreed not to do so because that would  militate against the spirit of a government of national unity.  That says in itself you must seek unity, you must seek  consensus, and we opted for consensus rule with regard to  decision-making, without prescribed procedures which introduces  a guillotine.    Because, once you have those, it is so easy to become  confrontational because there is a decisive method in which to  get a decision in any event. I want to avoid that and my  interlocutors agreed with that. So, if the commitment is there  from all sides, this is what the country needs.  <H5>  On "no-go" areas for parties. </H5>   [De Klerk] I'm not a cry baby about the campaign so far. But  what does bother me is when one is prevented from addressing a  meeting. That is essentially wrong. A public meeting is a  public meeting, and other people from other parties have the  right to attend, as long as they don't get out of hand. One  must live with it.    The fact that there are certain inaccessible areas, or  virtually inaccessible areas, is a blot on South Africa's  reputation, and we must work to see that really free and fair  campaigning, full and open campaigning, can be possible at all  times. But you can't be too theoretical about this. I don't  think the DP [Democratic Party] ever held a public meeting  let's say in Swartruggens -- they don't have supporters there.  It is a reality. As a party one analyses where your strengths  lie. The difficulty arises where you really know you can make  inroads, break into new areas -- this is our position -- and  then get barricades.  <H5>  On fears of chaos after election. </H5>   [De Klerk] I think that is overdone. I don't agree. I think  there will be euphoria, depending upon the results of course --  it will determine who will be euphoric and who will not. But I  think there will be festivities and activity, and from radicals  even maybe last gasp sorts of protest. But I think it will die  down soon. I think the public, almost all South Africans, are a  bit tired of politics. They want life to return to normal, they  want their TV and newspapers to become more relaxing and  entertaining. I think that reflects the mood of the whole  country; I really think by 11 May things will basically return  to normal.</p>

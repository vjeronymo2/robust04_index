			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober and Jane Hunter, the American-based </F> editor of ISRAELI FOREIGN AFFAIRS, "an independent publication  on Israel's activities outside the Middle East, and the author  of many articles on Israeli-South African military collaboration  and Israel's nuclear weapons"]    [Text] Testimony in the trial of South African Air Force  Brigadier Johann Blaauw, and South African submissions to the  International Atomic Energy Agency, leave no doubt that  President F.W. de Klerk is still lying about key aspects of his  government's nuclear weapons programme.    First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence  was  the subject of a MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN front page story last week,  which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that  South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or  material from another country, or provided another country with  nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted  that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel,  and its provision of yellow cake urinium to Israel, were not  part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and  conventional weapons.    His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured "was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs."    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation "received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987."    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in "theoretical and practical" research on  "lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices."    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- "to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay"  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: "In September 1985 the South African government  decided to .. stop all work related to possible plutonium  devices and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow  further development work on implosion technology and theoretical  work on more advanced devices."    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack -- or threaten -- nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a "deterrent".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from "total onslaught".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's "list of lies" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Recycling managers arrested FOUR managers from Thyssen Sonnenberg, the much vaunted recycling subsidiary of the Thyssen group, were yesterday arrested on suspicion of exporting toxic waste to France. The four men, who include Mr Gunther Giffels, chairman of the board of management at the Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, will be held in custody until a legal hearing due today, the prosecutor's office in the state of Hesse said. The arrests are likely to cause considerable worry among German recycling companies which fear recurring and cumbersome examinations from public authorities. German authorities, at federal and state levels, are anxious to improve their country's image following scandals involving export of toxic waste. The Frankfurt-based prosecutor's office, which is currently investigating 40 companies for possible violations of Germany's strict environmental laws, is accusing Thyssen Sonnenberg of dumping toxic waste in France by exporting it to a front company on the Franco-German border. Thyssen Sonnenberg denounced the arrests, calling the prosecutor's suspicions 'unfounded'. It said both German and French authorities had given permission, renewed until May 1994, to export waste to its French subsidiary, Lormet, in Pagny sur Meuse. But the prosecutor's office yesterday said: 'We have reasons to believe that Thyssen Sonnenberg mixed toxic waste with normal waste in order to export it. It then could tell German authorities that it was going to recycle the waste in its French subsidiary at lower costs.' The subsidiary was bought a year ago, by Thyssen Sonnenberg and another German recycler called Eumet, the prosecutor's office said.</p>

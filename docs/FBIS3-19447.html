Prime Minister Tansu Ciller received the visiting minister  at  the prime ministerial residence and conferred with him for some  time. Ambassador Volkan Vural, the chief aide to the prime  minister, was also present at the meeting.    In a statement after the meeting, Alain Juppe said that they  affirmed the importance the two countries attach to the  development of bilateral relations. He pointed out that in  recent years France became the country investing most in Turkey.  He added that intensive cooperation is taking place in the  cultural field, and that the Galatasaray University and the  second French high school to be opened in Ankara are examples of  this cooperation.    Juppe stressed that France is very determined to support  Turkey's integration in Europe.    In a statement after the meeting, chief prime ministerial  aide Vural said that the French foreign minister delivered a  verbal message from Prime Minister Balladur to Prime Minister  Ciller. Vural said that Juppe raised the issue of Turkey's  membership in the European Union and expressed France's support  for Turkey regarding this issue. Juppe also said that France  will help strengthen Turkey's membership in the European Union.  The French foreign minister pointed out that Turkey made  important moves toward a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Vural then said that at the meeting Prime Minister Ciller  raised the issue of the DEP [Democracy Party] deputies who were  stripped of their immunity. Vural said: Prime Minister Ciller  said that she observed that the issue is giving rise to concern  in France due to misunderstanding and lack of information. The  prime minister stressed that legislative immunity in Turkey is  more comprehensive than in many European countries, and that  those who were stripped of their immunity continue to be members  of parliament. She noted that they were stripped of their  immunity because of serious allegations that they had links with  a terrorist organization. She added that this must be  investigated by the judicial authorities, and that parliament  only opened the way for the judiciary. The prime minister  stressed that the decision will be made by independent courts.    The French foreign minister said that France respects  Turkey's territorial integrity, and realizes that Turkey is  faced with terrorism. He stated that his country took measures  against the terrorist organization PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] and that France is opposed to terrorism. He stressed  that his government does not have a view regarding the lifting  of immunity, adding that his country would not interfere in  Turkey's domestic affairs.    Official talks were held between the delegations of the  Turkish and French ministries. The Turkish delegation at the  talks was headed by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and the French  delegation by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    In a statement before the talks, Cetin said that he held a  very beneficial meeting with the visiting minister this morning,  and that he briefed him in detail about the developments in  Turkey. Cetin said that Turkey fights terrorism within the  framework of human rights and the law. He added that he thanked  Juppe for the decision made by France regarding terrorism.    Juppe was later received by President Suleyman Demirel at  the  Cankaya Mansion. Foreign Minister Cetin was also present.    Juppe will go to Istanbul this afternoon, and leave Turkey  tomorrow.</p>

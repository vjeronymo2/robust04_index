			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: GPA raises Dollars 100m in preference shares deal GPA, the aircraft leasing company, has raised Dollars 100m through a private placement of convertible preference shares in the US in the latest round of capital-raising which has seen it secure more than Dollars 2bn in the past year. The terms of the preference stock, convertible up to 2002 at Dollars 34 a share, anticipate a recovery in the group's value. While GPA was able to place Dollars 185m of ordinary shares in July 1990 at Dollars 32.50 a share, the downturn in the airline business has seen shares in the unquoted group changing hands at Dollars 24 recently. GPA announced some months ago that it intended to seek a listing, but is still waiting for the right market conditions. The convertible cumulative preference shares, which pay a 7 per cent dividend, have been placed with the Public School Employees' Retirement System of Pennsylvania. On a fully diluted basis, the stake would give the holder a 2.5 per cent share of the group if converted.</p>

Minister of Justice Sawai Phatthano says he had reached the  agreement with his Chinese counterpart during his recent visit  to China. Minister Sawai says according to the agreement, Thai  nationals in China will be under the justice authority  designated under the same category and at the same level as the  Chinese authority. In addition, Thai nationals in China will  now have the right to fight a lawsuit against individuals in  China.    He says Thailand is the 18th country to sign such an  agreement with China. Earlier Thailand and China have signed an  extradition agreement. The minister says he and his Chinese  counterpart have agreed to promote arbitration as a means to  settle disputes over marine trade and transportation between the  countries. The minister of justice says that for the 19 years  of Thai-Chinese diplomatic relations, their cooperation in laws  should be made to support other ties.</p>

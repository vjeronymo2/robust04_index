			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk: "Aim--Second Term of Office; </F> President in Action"]    [Text] "I wanted to, but they would not let me"--this is  one of Lech Walesa's favorite sayings. He wanted to give each  citizen 100 million zlotys, but nothing happened. He wanted to  leave only socks on affair mongers, but he did not manage to do  that, either. Recently, he has wanted to give people the right  to submit their own draft constitutions, but the Sejm rejected  his initiative in the first reading. It is also not clear how  the issue of the recall of Marek Markiewicz will end up.  <H5>  Movement in the Business </H5>   Lech Walesa feels bad when nothing is happening in politics.  He likes to see some movement in the business. However, since  the dissolution of the parliament last year, he has not had many  occasions to really act. He kept the government coalition in  suspense for a while, wondering whether he should appoint  Waldemar Pawlak to the post of prime minister. He teased the  politicians for a little while by demanding three candidates,  but that was all.    Only the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT]  gave him more reasons to act: It appointed Wieslaw Walendziak to  the position of president of the Polish Television. Following  the decision, the president withdrew political support for the  members of the council whom he had himself appointed; he waited  for them to submit their resignations, which did not happen.    He provoked the next confrontation himself by submitting the  bill of the so-called people's initiative; because of that, the  Sejm divided into supporters and opponents of the president,  which livened up the usually boring plenary debates. The  rejection of the bill was instantly taken advantage of by the  president, who withdrew from the work on the Constitution.    Before the public opinion forgot the issue of the  Constitution, the president recalled Marek Markiewicz from the  post of KRRiT chairman and queried the decision granting a  nationwide television license to Zygmunt Solorz.  <H5>  What Does the President Want To Achieve? </H5>   The politicians whom we asked about it unanimously answered  that he wants to gain the post of president for another five  years. The thing is, he is doing it rather unskillfully.    "It is clear to me that the president is making  uncoordinated  movements. By withdrawing from the work on the Constitution, he  wanted to make a political gain; however, there is no one that  could do that with him," says Ryszard Bugaj of the Labor Union.    Bugaj believes that the recall of Marek Markiewicz from the  post of KRRiT chairman is an element in the fight for influence  on the mass media. It is also possible that the issue of  Zygmunt Solorz, owner of PolSat and a license for nationwide  television, is supposed to be the implementation of the slogan:  I will leave only socks on affair-mongers.    At any rate, the president, who has always acted  chaotically,  has now really gotten lost. Contrary to the law, he refused to  participate in the work on the Constitution. It is not known  whether the decision on the recall of Markiewicz was legal as  well. Such inappropriate activities only show his political  helplessness and the incompetence of his entourage.    "The game that he is involved in is drawing him increasingly  deeper," says Bugaj. "In addition, detrimental to his opinion  are such things as the repair of the Namiestnikowski Palace and  buying expensive cars for his family members. He is waging his  campaign clumsily."    Andrzej Potocki of the Democratic Union entirely shares  Bugaj's opinion.    He believes that the president's activities will not endear  him to many voters. Some of his decisions cannot be accepted  even by those who support him. As a result of his actions, soon  in Poland there may be no issue that would not be entangled in  politics. KRRiT activities should be excluded from political  gamesmanship; however, Walesa encroaches on the area of the  political independence of KRRiT in order to subordinate the mass  media to himself.  <H5>  A Man of Action </H5>   "The president is a man of fight and action," says Zbigniew  Siemiatkowski of the Democratic Left Alliance. "He does not  like a stable democracy. His experience suggests that he always  benefits from direct confrontations, and that is why he is  seeking them."    According to Siemiatkowski, the president's entourage does  not fully understand that, in a democracy, everyone is submitted  to certain specified rules of the game. The parliament does not  have the duty to adopt a bill only because it has been submitted  by the president--all the more so because Walesa did not make  any efforts to create a favorable atmosphere around his bill.  The same goes for KRRiT. Respect for the president is not the  same as absolute obedience to him. The council's  representatives, who have been appointed by the president,  attempted to act much too independently. This attempt  encountered resistance and resulted in the recall of Markiewicz  from the post of chairman.    All of this is an element of a political campaign because  only through criticism can one gain the disgruntled.  <H5>  Information Noise </H5>   According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant  Party,  the president is trying to show that he is active on the  political scene and has a lot to offer. He is employing his  favorite tactics: He attacks, usually before leaving somewhere,  and waits to see what positions the pawns on the political  chessboard will take.    "The situation of the president is difficult," says  Piechocinski. "At the moment, he has no political friends.  Apart from that, he is asking himself the question of whether  he can get rid of political duties or whether he must  participate in this game and for the second time run for the  position of the head of state."    Piechocinski believes that the president's activities are  not  easy to interpret. It is not clear whether the president is  against KRRiT or against the division of the mass media, which  has been made by the council. Perhaps he is concerned about the  fact that the mass media are getting away from his control. All  this is not entirely clear.    "Walesa does not have a large combat scenario," says  Piechocinski. "Actually, he has never had it. The aim of his  activities is another term as president; however, so far he has  been making merely information noise and giving the impression  of total instability of the political world."    Only Leszek Moczulski of the Confederation for an  Independent  Poland believes that the purpose of Lech Walesa's actions is  first of all the strengthening of the position of the president  in the political life. He wants to exert greater influence on  what is happening in the country. Political activeness, however  ineffective, is better than lack of activeness. Inaction  disqualifies a politician.</p>

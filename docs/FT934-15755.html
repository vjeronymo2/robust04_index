			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonds LAST MONTH, we drew attention to the fact that direct holdings of bonds provide investors with a fixed income, tax efficiency and, in many cases, a known future value for their capital. Here, we offer examples of how this diverse market can answer some less common requirements. A tax-exempt investor wants a high gross income. Eurosterling bonds pay interest gross to non-UK residents but tax will be deducted from payments to UK residents. There are, however, a number of domestic bonds that pay interest gross to all investors (such income should be declared and could make you liable to income tax). These bonds are from two sectors: namely, supernational bulldogs and housing associations. Supernational bulldogs (domestic sterling bonds for non-UK borrowers issued by multi-government agencies such as the World Bank), are a useful option to gilts and should be compared with gilts bought through the post office register. Alternatively, significantly higher yields than gilts (albeit with higher risk) are possible by buying bonds from housing associations. For example, the Housing Finance Corporation 8.625 per cent 2023 at a price of 101.25 offers yields of 8.25 per cent income and 8.51 per cent gross redemption yield. These compare with the nearest comparable gilt at 7.51 per cent income and 7.27 per cent GRY. A tax-exempt investor wants to buy a bond that bears no income but increases the capital significantly. The tax treatment of zero coupon bonds is complicated and net investors often concentrate instead on the zero dividend preference share market. Consequently, zero coupon bonds are available at high gross yields. One such bond is the Exeter Preferred Capital Zero Coupon Debenture 2002. It is secured on a portfolio of split capital investment trusts, and investors who buy bonds at 51.5 can look forward to repayment at 100 at January 31 2002 - a yield of 8.16 per cent.

Please note that BZW Capital Markets is a market-maker and cannot deal with private clients direct, so those interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   STERLING BONDS FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Coupon                                        percent  Price        Red'n date  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH INCOME  Britannia Building Soc Pibs          13.00    136.75      Irredeemable  Barclays Bank Pibc                    9.00    102.38   Call 11/10/2023  European Inv Bnk Bulldog             10.38    123.63        22/11/2004 BALANCED INCOME AND CAPITAL  Bankers Inv Tst Debenture             8.00    101.50        31/10/2023  The Housing Fin Corp Debenture        8.63    101.25        13/11/2023 ZERO COUPON BOND  Exeter Preferred Capital Debenture    0.00      51.5         31/1/2002 ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARES  Yeoman Zdp                            0.00    199.75        31/12/1998  M&amp;G Inc Zdp                           0.00     55.75         5/11/2001  Johnson Fry Utilities Zdp             0.00    111.25         31/7/2003 INDEX LINKED DEBENTURE  Severn River Index Link Debenture     6.00    121.50         30/6/2012  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Red'n        GRY         Inc                                        Price        sa        Yld  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH INCOME  Britannia Building Soc Pibs             n/a        n/a        9.50  Barclays Bank Pibc                   100.00       8.59        8.79  European Inv Bnk Bulldog             100.00       7.24        8.39 BALANCED INCOME AND CAPITAL  Bankers Inv Tst Debenture            100.00       7.87        7.88  The Housing Fin Corp Debenture       100.00       8.51        8.52 ZERO COUPON BOND  Exeter Preferred Capital Debenture   100.00       8.16         n/a ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARES  Yeoman Zdp                           292.70       7.51         n/a  M&amp;G Inc Zdp                          102.46       7.72         n/a  Johnson Fry Utilities Zdp            229.00       7.53         n/a INDEX LINKED DEBENTURE  Severn River Index Link Debenture    255.00*      4.53*       5.18*                                                    Real     Initial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Interest      NRY       Net inc Issuer                                  Dates    25 percent  25 percent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGH INCOME  Britannia Building Soc Pibs         31/1 31/7       n/a        7.13  Barclays Bank Pibc                      11/10      6.46        6.59  European Inv Bnk Bulldog           22/5 22/11      4.98        6.29 BALANCED INCOME AND CAPITAL  Bankers Inv Tst Debenture          30/4 31/10      5.89        5.91  The Housing Fin Corp Debenture     13/5 13/11      6.37        6.39 ZERO COUPON BOND  Exeter Preferred Capital Debenture        n/a      6.19         n/a ZERO DIVIDEND PREFERENCE SHARES  Yeoman Zdp                                n/a      6.89*        n/a  M&amp;G Inc Zdp                               n/a      7.08*        n/a  Johnson Fry Utilities Zdp                 n/a      6.94*        n/a INDEX LINKED DEBENTURE  Severn River Index Link Debenture        30/6      3.18*       3.88*                                          31/12      Real     Initial  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Assumes inflation at 5 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

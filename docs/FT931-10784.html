			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Letter: Consumer loses if monopoly question not resolved in Post Office privatisation Sir, You correctly state in your leader, 'Parcelling up the post' (February 3), that 'the issues of monopoly power should be resolved before privatisation is begun, not tackled as an afterthought'. Private express operators have responded to customer demand for cross-border service by investing heavily in infrastructure over the last 10 years and have provided through a large and stable workforce a high level of innovation and customer service in an intensely competitive market. Investment decisions made by these companies relying upon past government policy need to be protected as rigorously as those of the private investor taking up shares in a government privatisation. For international express carriers such as DHL, this means not only the freedom to compete, but to do so on completely fair and equal terms in services which are not, for genuine social need, reserved to the Post Office. Not only should the Royal Mail's monopoly be narrowly construed, but it, like every other post office in Europe, should not enjoy any advantage in the adjacent and supposedly unregulated private express market. It would be an affront to both consumer and competitor to confer monopoly rights which will ensure the success of a share flotation at the expense of distorting competition. If the question of monopoly power is not resolved before privatisation, the gains of investors will be at the expense of the consumer. L Patick Lupo, chairman and chief executive officer, DHL Worldwide Express, rue du Noyer 211 1040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

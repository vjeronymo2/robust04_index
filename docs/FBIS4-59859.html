			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdi Fu'ad in Washington] </F>   [Text] After successful talks in Washington, and before  leaving for Cairo, Defense Minister Field Marshal Muhammad  Husayn Tantawi announced that his talks with U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry dealt with military cooperation between  Egypt and the United States and focused on a joint strategy to  ensure security, stability, and reconstruction in the Middle  East. He said the talks also dealt with developments in Yemen,  which he described as very regrettable.    The minister expressed Egypt's hope that all sides in Yemen  will demonstrate self-restraint and use logic to end the  explosive struggle with a view to preserving the lives of  innocent people and sparing the states of the region the  repercussions of this struggle. Field Marshal Tantawi described  his talks with U.S. congressmen as successful. He said the  congressmen understand Egypt's importance and role in the  region, and the U.S. Administration, Congress, and the Pentagon  appreciate President Mubarak's positions and Egypt's role.  Tantawi invited the U.S. defense secretary to visit Egypt;  Perry said he is looking forward to the visit, which he will  make sometime this year.</p>

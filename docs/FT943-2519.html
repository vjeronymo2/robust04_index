			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts: Pretty boys at Wembley - Take That Howard is getting desperate. He's the tall one in Take That who looks as if he would be happier as a human being - and the fans know it. When the girls got the chance to scream for their hero at Wembley on Friday, Howard only rated a modest teeth-aching neuralgia on the hysteria scale, and while the Arena was awash with banners inscribed 'Robbie, I want your body' and 'Essex Girls Love U Mark', there were no 'Show Me How, Howie' placards. Even growing a ridiculous goatee beard has not helped Howard much. Still, not long to go now. Life as a member of a top pretty boy pre-teen band is brief, just the four years it takes for young girls to progress from Barbie to their first bra. Take That are nothing to do with music - they are the warm-up to the day when the pop posters disappear from bedroom walls and real life starts. Yet there is a move afoot to treat Take That seriously. Lead singer and song writer Gary Barlow has won Novello Awards and the Manchester money men behind the hand-picked quintet are constantly tweaking new life into their creation. Certainly they give a good, wonderfully incoherent, show. It starts with the lads rising up to the stage dressed as Gestapo despatch riders and ripping off the Stones' Satisfaction with the bold promise to 10,000 besotted girls You'll get satisfied. It ends with Lulu, who has found a profitable second career as a child minder, leading them into the old disco hit Relight my fire, when they dress as young devils. Now Howard finally flips and bares his bottom in the hope, presumably, of attracting some of the underclothes the girls rain on little Markie. In between there is at least one decent original song in Babe; some impressive aerobics - the Monkees never attempted somersaults, cartwheels, and hand stands; a Beatles' medley which displayed delusions of grandeur; and the inevitable jokey acoustic set just to fool the Musicians Union. Unfortunately, Take That have to be so amped up to combat their non-stop screaming, whistle-blowing fans that the sound system is magnified to a shrill and insubstantial blurr: but who's listening. Fortunately Take That also threw up one fascinating possibility. Near the end the lads emerge in peekaboo tops and boxer shorts and camp around like crazy to Give good feeling. Could the management be preparing for the ultimate, mind-blowing leap, transforming this year's pubescent teases into next year's icons of the gay scene?</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWYERS BACK BILL TO RESTORE SCOPE OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS  </P> <P> The American Bar Assn. urged Congress on Monday to overturn five U.S. Supreme  Court rulings last year that limited the scope of federal civil rights laws.  </P> <P> The lawyers' organization, meeting in Los Angeles, threw its weight behind  legislation introduced last week by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would  rewrite the law so as to nullify the high court's decisions.  </P> <P> The bill would permit employees who are victims of racial harassment to win  damages from their employers and would force businesses to justify as necessary  any hiring or promotion policy that tended to exclude minorities or women.  </P> <P> The bar association vote in favor of the new civil rights initiative came  despite pleas from business lawyers and a top official of the Bush  Administration to hold off action.  </P> <P> The association represents 365,000 attorneys nationwide, and its officials say  they plan to lobby on behalf of the new civil rights legislation when the  Senate begins hearings on the bill later this month.  </P> <P> "Historically the ABA has played a key role in the development of the civil  rights laws, and it would have been a shame if the organization wasn't willing  to go on record now," said Washington lawyer Sally Determan, who proposed the  resolution approved Monday.  </P> <P> The pending civil rights legislation may well spark a fight between the Bush  Administration and congressional Democrats.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald B. Ayer told the bar association gathering that the  Administration will offer legislation to overturn two of the five rulings that  deal with blatant discrimination.  </P> <P> The Bush White House is "committed to strong remedies for intentional  discrimination," Ayer said. But the Administration opposes overturning the  other rulings, he said, because they deal with "quotas" in hiring and  promotions. Ayer described the association's resolution and the Kennedy bill as  a simplistic "wave of the hand" response to a complicated legal issue.  </P> <P> But American Bar Assn. President-elect Jack Curtin, a Boston lawyer, said the  issue was indeed simple. "Does the ABA want to make it easier or harder for  victims of discrimination to gain relief?" he asked.  </P> <P> With that, the delegates voted by a 2-1 margin for a resolution calling for all  five rulings to be overturned.  </P> <P> The five court rulings came at the end of the 1989 Supreme Court term and were  decided on 5-4 votes, with the court's conservative faction in the majority.  They decided the following:  </P> <P> * Black employees who are victims of racial harassment on the job may not sue  for damages. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 gave blacks the same rights as whites  to "make and enforce contracts" and allowed damage suits against violators of  those rights. In Patterson vs. McLean Credit, the court said this law covered  discrimination in hiring -- because that is akin to making a contract -- but  not on-the-job discrimination.  </P> <P> * Women and minorities must challenge an unfair change in a company's seniority  policy within 300 days, even if the women have no way of knowing then that they  will be hurt by it. The case was Lorance vs. AT&amp;T. Kennedy and the Bush  Administration agree that this time limit should be relaxed.  </P> <P> * White employees may challenge a court-approved affirmative action plan years  after it was adopted. This decision in Martin vs. Wilks threatened to unravel  hundreds of city and county plans to hire and promote more minorities. The  Kennedy bill would forbid new lawsuits if the white employees knew about the  plan when it was in the works and chose not to contest it then.  </P> <P> * Employees must no longer prove the necessity of hiring or promotion policies  that tend to harm minorities or women. In 1971, the high court put the burden  of proof on employers if their job policies had a discriminatory impact. But  last year's decision in Ward's Cove Packing Co. vs. Atonio essentially reversed  that doctrine and put the burden of proof back on employees who say they were  victims of discrimination. The Kennedy bill would return to the 1971 standard.  </P> <P> * Managers may use racial or sexist reasons for denying an employee a promotion  if they can furnish other legitimate reasons for their decision. The case was  Price-Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. The Kennedy bill says the employer is guilty of  illegal discrimination if race or sex was one reason for denying a promotion.  </P></p>

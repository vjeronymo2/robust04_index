			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director </F> general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and date not given; from  the "With the Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director  general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction, good evening.    [Abu-Libdah] Good evening to you.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan, has the $5 million -- the first  installment of the money committed by the donor nations --  materialized?    [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinian leadership represented by  brother Abu-al-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi] signed the transfer  application about two weeks ago. We should receive that sum any  minute; it will be used to cover some pressing needs.    [Mu'addi] The staff at the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction is busy preparing lists of cadres  and institutions promised by the PLO to the donor nations. Are  you through with this task?    [Abu-Libdah] Let may say, to begin with, that we promised  the donor nations to revamp certain institutions, and success in  that effort will decide the fate of international aid. We did  that job by constituting the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction. Other institutions are being  founded, now that the members of the Palestinian National  Authority have been named. We delivered on all our legal and  official commitments demanded by the donor nations. We are now  waiting for the donor nations to deliver on their end.    [Mu'addi] It seems that this week the donor nations will  convene a session in Paris. What is their agenda? Will the  matter be settled there?    [Abu-Libdah] That will be a meeting of the secretariat of  the donor nations. It will address a number of the issues that  have been preoccupying us. They will consider our effort to  draw up a budget for the national authority. Hopefully, we will  be able to convince these nations to make good on the promises  they made in January, 1994 and to plug the anticipated deficit  in the budget of the Palestinian Authority, both regarding the  Palestinian police and the central administration. Beyond that,  we are preparing a number of documents, through which we hope to  fill the needs of the authority so it can begin its operation.  Let me make it clear that, since it signed the Oslo accord, the  Palestinian side has done all it can to meet the conditions  required to qualify for the international aid that was pledged  to us. We are at a crossroads. If the donor nations fail to  meet their obligations, we will be hard pressed to fulfill our  commitments toward the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In my  opinion, the peace process must not be built solely on verbal  promises. We are at a stage when we most need for the verbal  pledges to be converted into reality.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director general of  the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and  Reconstruction, thank you.    [Abu-Libdah] Thank you.</p>

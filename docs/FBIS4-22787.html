			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [INFORM-KURANTY report: "Do `Godfathers' Own the City?"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Government is still readying the  law on protection of all persons--from investigators to  witnesses--aiding in the criminal justice process. It is long  overdue, because fear of retaliation keeps those who know  something quiet. The latest victim of contract murder was  sportsman, businessman, and philanthropist Otari Kvantrishvili,  who was killed by a sniper. Shots from hired guns sound  increasingly often on the streets of the capital. And with  impunity. Is it really true that `GODFATHERS' OWN THE CITY?    Moscow was shocked and intrigued by the latest, clearly  contract murder. An unidentified sniper fired several shots and  killed O. Kvantrishvili, a controversial personality about whom  there had been a great variety of opinions while he was still  alive. For some, Kvantrishvili was a famous philanthropist, who  kept out of poverty many previously famous athletes and a  well-known coach, and one of the founders of the Lev Yashin  Foundation for Social Protection of Athletes and of the  sportsmen party. In the opinion of others, behind Kvantrishvili  was a trail of questionable connections, which in the final  count led to his sad demise. Anyway, let us wait and see what  conclusions the investigation will reach. Meanwhile let us try  to reconstruct some events that preceded the tragedy.  <H5>  Nine Months Before the Murder </H5>   In the beginning of August of last year, O. Kvantrishvili's  brother Amiran--an "exposed" kingpin in the Moscow criminal  world--was killed in a classic mafiosi score-settling. The  shooting, which took the life of Amiran and his people, happened  right in front of a commercial company on Yakimanka. Crime  kingpins (many did not make any particular effort to hide on  that day) held a posh funeral for A. Kvantrishvili in the style  of criminal novels. A burial service was performed in the  Vagankovskoye cemetery church, and he was buried right there,  next to the grave of... Vladimir Vysotskiy. Many recalled then  that several years before Amiran's funeral another kingpin from  the Caucasus--Valerian Kuchuloria--was buried at this  prestigious Moscow cemetery.    In the evening, in the Hotel Moscow restaurant, the deceased  was remembered, noisily and with pomp. Among the invited guests  were quite a few famous Moscow personalities with whom the crime  boss was friendly. The only person who did not attend the wake,  according to some sources, was one of the chiefs of the Dagestan  mafia, S. Lukmanov, who was supposed to be in hiding from the  authorities and very carelessly "exposed" himself at the  cemetery.    A little later many mass media also began mentioning direct  connections with the criminal world of the other Kvantrishvili  brother--Otari. Members of the law enforcement community in  confidential conversations advanced guesses regarding his weight  in the criminal world. There were also questions regarding the  Yashin Foundation, which to some looked like a convenient cover  for money-laundering.    Meanwhile, Otari Kvantrishvili continued, with visible  pleasure, to attend society mingling parties and to "shine" on  television.  <H5>  Two Days Before... </H5>   Nikita Simonyan, first vice president of the Russian Soccer  Union, was one of the last persons to see Kvantrishvili alive:    "It just so happened that I saw Otari Vitalyevich literally  a  couple of days before this. He felt fine, was in a good mood.  Together, we had a conversation with Russian Hockey Federation  [RHF] President Vladimir Petrov. We talked about the conflict  between the RHF and the leadership of a number of clubs in the  International Hockey League. By the way, Otari Vitalyevich was  always very interested in the problems of our sport and, being  the president of the Yashin Foundation, gladly helped  impoverished athletes and the disabled. Most of all, however, he  rooted as a fan of Moscow Dynamo. Very often I saw him in the  bleachers at the stadium."    INFORMATION: As our correspondent was told by the  Sports Wrestling Federation, Otari Vitalyevich has done  free-style wrestling for quite some time. He has not earned any  particular laurels in this endeavor, however, and has never been  a member of the USSR national team. He did find success as a  coach. One of his disciples--Yuriy Vorobyev--even rose as high  as two-time European champion. Later Kvantrishvili was awarded  the title "Distinguished Coach of Russia."  <H5>  And the Shots Sounded </H5>   From various sources, we have been able to reconstruct the  picture of the murder. Otari Kvantrishvili left  Krasnopresnenskiy bath house on Tuesday at 1730 in the company  of friends. When he reached the parking lot, three shots  sounded. One bullet hit him in the head, one, in the neck, and  the third, in the chest. Kvantrishvili's companions immediately  took the wounded man to the Botkin Hospital. But it was too  late... Several minutes after being brought to intensive case  unit, Otari died.    Militia personnel who arrived at the site of the incident  established that the shots had been fired from the attic window  of a corner building, No. 4 (No. 29 on Presnenskiy Bank),  located next to the baths. The operatives found a German-made  small-gauge rifle (5.6 mm gauge) with a telescope and magazine,  and three spent cartridges. That the assailant was a  professional the investigators have no doubt. It is quite  possible that having received his "honorarium" the hired killer  had already left Moscow, or had been immediately "removed" by  his own customers in order to cover the tracks.    There are several versions of the cause of the killing. Some  believe that Kvantrishvili was killed on order from the  so-called Slavic mafia, which had been lately very actively  "pushed" by Caucasians. It is possible that the killing is  somehow linked with the recent--second--attempt on the life of  one of the Moscow mafia kingpins going under the nickname  Raspisnoy. Others believe that the three fateful shots are  "greetings from Lubyanka," which decided to sow discord between  two largest criminal groups so that in the fight among  themselves they would eliminate as many of each other as  possible and at the very least would not unite--the latter  holding a threat of unforetold consequences for the city's  safety.    There are also other versions, including some related to  Kvantrishvili's "sports" activities. In particular, with the  sportsmen's party, which the Ministry of Justice had been  refusing to register for quite some time despite tremendous  pressure brought.    Having visited the site of the incident yesterday morning,  our correspondents did not find anyone from internal affairs  organs: "Investigative work" on the site had been completed  during the night. Neither could anything be learned from bath  house employees who, as if on a prompt, totally clammed up.  There were, however, several cars with bored "riders" in them.    INFORMATION: It is a known fact that Otari  Kvantrishvili was a good acquaintance of Iosif Kobzon.  Unfortunately, we were unable to find out the singer's reaction  to the event: He is currently on tour in the United States. In  the office of his company, Moskovit, we were told that Kobzon  already had been informed of the tragedy, but no detailed  information is available yet.    The Yashin Foundation for the Social Protection of Sportsmen  distributed a list of the deceased's achievements: raising  several athletes who earned high titles; founding the foundation  itself; helping Great Patriotic War and Afghan war veterans.</p>

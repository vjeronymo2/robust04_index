			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 WEEKEND PROJECTS: FOLLOW A SIMPLE SCHEDULE OF THINGS TO DO  </P> <P> Nearly everyone, it seems, has a schedule that is too crammed and hectic to  leave enough extra time to finish those undone tasks and tackle those  still-to-do projects. Consequently, most people walk around with a vague sense  that they haven't quite got it all "together."  </P> <P> To conquer this unfinished feeling, you can start to get all of the bits and  pieces of your life together by setting aside 10 weekends to start, finish,  and/or complete the following projects:  </P> <P> Closet commando -- Clean out and organize all of the closets in your house. Get  rid of clothes that are too small or outdated. If you haven't worn it in more  than a year, you probably never will, so those items can go as well. If it  needs to be mended, send it out, or give it to charity. Get rid of shoes that  hurt your feet or are outdated. Clean out and organize bathroom, linen, and  kitchen cabinets as well. Give away or toss duplicates (you don't need three  whisks), or things you never liked and never use (those purple sheets that you  got as a gift, but hate). Tackle one closet or cabinet at a time, and work your  way systematically through the house.  </P> <P> Go for the garage -- The garage is often the last outpost for clutter and items  that you never use. Start early in the morning and pull everything (yes,  everything) out of the garage. Then only put back what you need to save or use.  Throw everything else away or give it to charity. If other people are using  your garage for storage, call and tell them to pick up their things before you  start. Make sure you dispose of any toxics responsibly, and if you must store  mementos in the garage, repack them in clean boxes with clearly written labels  on all sides and store them on a shelf.  </P> <P> Garage sale -- Now that you've cleaned out your closets, cabinets and the  garage, have a garage sale to get rid of your cast-offs. Price everything to  sell -- cheap! Remember this is stuff you want to get rid of. At the end of the  day, pack up everything that is left over, and take it directly to a charity.  Do not take it back into the house or garage.  </P> <P> Car care -- If your car needs attention, now is the time to clean out the trunk  and glove compartment, and get the car washed, waxed, and detailed. Take the  car in for servicing and if you need new tires, get them. After that, regular  attention and maintenance in small doses should keep your car and you, going  for quite some time.  </P> <P> Fix it -- Get everything fixed. Gather up everything in the house that needs to  be repaired and take it out to the appropriate repair facility or call a repair  person to come in. Clothes should go to a tailor or seamstress, small  appliances need to go to appliance repair shops, jewelry goes to the jeweler,  and the clock to the clock repair shop. Don't waste your time or money  repairing things you won't wear or use, and don't try to fix everything  yourself. You probably don't have enough time or talent to fix it all, and the  time you save will be well worth the money spent for the repairs.  </P> <P> Sports hero -- You can be a hero to your sports equipment by taking the time  out to clean, repair, and/or service all of your equipment. Get your bike  repaired, wax your skis, and get the basketball and volleyball out so you can  pump some much needed air into them. Check your fishing gear and organize the  tackle, and take the tennis rackets out to be re-strung. Buy any new or extra  equipment that you need to update and add to what you already have. The next  time a sports opportunity arises, you'll be ready to jump in and take part.  </P> <P> Paper patrol -- Don't wait until tax time to organize your paper work. Get all  of your receipts for the year in order now, and when filing time rolls around,  you'll be well ahead of the game. While you're at it, throw out all of the  accumulated junk mail and catalogues that have been piling up. Go through any  boxes of papers or files that you have, and purge unnecessary papers there as  well. Put what is left in neatly labeled file folders or boxes so that the next  time you need a particular piece of paper, you won't have to spend 20 minutes  searching for it.  </P> <P> Read -- Get rid of all of those backed-up magazines, newspapers, catalogues and  journals that are outdated or that you simply don't have time for, because  they've been accumulating for such a long time. If there is an article you must  read, clip it, and throw the rest of the periodical away. Then spend the rest  of the weekend catching up on the reading that is really important. Make sure  you spend time reading that self-help or business book that you've been meaning  to get to, and polish the weekend off by escaping into that romance or spy  novel that you've been wanting to read for months.  </P> <P> Drop a line -- Catch up on all of your back correspondence. Write letters,  notes or cards to all of your friends and relatives who are always complaining  that you never write. Stock up on stationery, cards, post cards and postage,  and put it all in a portable basket. Once you've caught up with the  correspondence, you can spend a few minutes each day at breakfast -- or while  you're watching TV -- to dash off a note or card so you don't get behind again.  </P> <P> Holiday plan -- The holidays are coming, so now is the time to get a good head  start on the activities and obligations that accompany the season. Buy your  cards, postage, and gift wrapping. Make a list of gifts to buy, and begin  buying some gifts now. If you'll be entertaining, plan your menus or check with  caterers now. If you'll be traveling, firm up your travel plans. The holidays  and the attendant activities will be upon you before you know it, and your  advance planning can mean the difference between a happy and a harried holiday  season.  </P></p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: The hiccs come out of the sticks - A new breed of consumer is forcing retailers to produce less packaging Retailers can play a decisive role in the environmental debate, standing as they do between the consumer and the supplier. Shops are often the first port of call for enraged environmentalists wishing to challenge industrial practices such as unsound tuna fishing, pulp bleaching or excess packaging. And retailers in turn exercise enormous influence over their suppliers by translating these consumer pressures into buying orders. Last week, several hundred food retailers and their suppliers gathered in Dusseldorf at a conference organised by CIES, an international trade association for the food industry, to discuss such concerns and to fathom the impulses of the green consumer. The choice of Germany for the venue was significant since the country's stringent packaging regulations and strident environmental groups have given the green debate impetus. What concerns Germany today will doubtless affect other countries tomorrow. The most pressing concern for many retailers was the introduction last June of Germany's contentious ordinance on the avoidance of packaging waste, the Verpackungsverordnung or VerpackVo, which some have suggested could become the blueprint for the European Commission packaging directive due to be published this year. The VerpackVo's architect, Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, attended the conference and artfully defended the thrust of his legislation which was based on the premise: 'Do not let packaging go to waste'. German industry has, however, largely forestalled the threat of a 'take-back' provision for packaging - outlined in the VerpackVo - by promising to assume responsibility for the management of packaging waste. More than 400 companies are creating a mechanism, known as the Duales System Deutschland, to recover waste from households and reuse the raw materials. Consumers are encouraged to return glass bottles and waste paper to recycling bins but are also asked to separate other recyclable materials, such as plastics, composite packaging and metals, and place them outside their houses in yellow bins and bags provided by the DSD. These are collected every month. The DSD aims to find markets for these materials and recycle increasing proportions of packaging waste. It finances the scheme by licensing a green dot which manufacturers can attach to their goods. The scheme attracted criticism at the conference from European companies which feared the DSD could act as a form of protectionism by excluding foreign products which did not carry the green dot. Although Topfer distanced himself from responsibility for the DSD, he did accept that it had thrown up problems. 'We have 600,000 tonnes of plastic packaging in Germany with the recycling quota at about 50,000 tonnes. The remainder is going into dumps or going to incineration plants,' he said. But Topfer stressed that the DSD was an experimental system that would encourage further innovations and improvements. 'It is a system that is less dirigiste than others and leaves the rules of a free market economy in place,' he said. Many retailers remained less than convinced by his arguments but the message was nevertheless driven home that unless industry acted to reduce, recover and re-use packaging governments would move to do so for them. 'We must prevent politicians coming up with solutions faster than we do because they will always be worse than market solutions,' said Hans Christian Bremme, managing director of Tengelmann, the giant German retailing group. The DSD will perhaps ultimately succeed or fail on the commitment of consumers and it was the mysterious workings of the shopper's mind that pre-occupied many retailers for much of the conference. Patrick Carson, vice president of Loblaws supermarkets in Canada, argued that after the hippies and yuppies, retailers now had to deal with a new social phenomenon: the hiccs, or higher inner-conscience consumers. Such consumers have different priorities from previous generations of shoppers and are concerned about the consequences of their consumption. 'They will leave the tin of tuna - that has been caught by means of a drift net which kills dolphins - on the shelves and they will not come back to your store,' he said. The hicc appears to be a global phenomenon, especially among the younger generations. According to Toshifumi Yamashita, assistant chief executive of the Tokyo Consumers Co-operative, 75 per cent of Japanese consumers said they were interested in environmental activities and an astonishing 27 per cent claimed to be involved in some form of voluntary activity to protect the environment. Although this new breed of consumer poses a challenge to retailers' practices, it also represents a great business opportunity for those who can tap the groundswell. One constant theme reiterated throughout the conference was that good environmental practice was invariably synonymous with good business practice. J. Sainsbury, the UK grocery chain, for example, claimed to save 100 tonnes of plastic and Pounds 150,000 a year simply by removing the polystyrene base from its pizza boxes. While CMB Packaging, the Anglo- French group, said that lighter packaging now meant that 30,000 cans could be produced from one tonne of tinplate compared with 24,000 in 1985. 'You can do the right thing for the right reason and still make money,' said Carson.</p>

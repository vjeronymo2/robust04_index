			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 7 (AFP)--The PLO expressed its  condolences Thursday to the families of the seven Israelis  killed when a teenage Palestinian militant rammed his  explosive-packed car into a bus in the northern Israeli town of  Afula.    An official PLO spokesman said in a statement to AFP: "The  PLO presents its condolences to the families of the victims (of  the attack)," which also left 45 wounded.    "The PLO hopes that all concerned parties will assume their  responsibility to safeguard the peace process and achieve its  aims, to ensure a just and equal solution between the  Palestinian and Israeli peoples," the statement said.    The United States called on PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  Wednesday to condemn the Afula attack, carried out by a  19-year-old member of the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS,  which is opposed to the peace process.</p>

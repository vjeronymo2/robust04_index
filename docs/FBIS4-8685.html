			<p>BFN     [Text] Provocative acts against Albania are still  continuing. At about 1200 on 14 April 1994, approximately 150  Greek soldiers not only approached the official Albanian border  in the Kakavije region but, after being deployed on the terrace  of a Greek border post building, carried out surveillance of  Albanian territory using a camera. At 1300 they withdrew deep  into their own country.    After the 10 April massacre, this action is another  provocative act leading to a further aggravation of tension and  military pressure by the Greek side on the Albanian border.  This provocative act runs counter to the norms of good faith  defined in international acts that regulate the good neighborly  relations between states.    We were also informed that at 1030 today, about 2 miles into  our territorial waters, at latitude 40 degrees and longitude 19  degrees 41 minutes, one of our naval patrol boats in Borshi Bay  detained a Greek fishing vessel, the Aios Vasilis, captained by  Petro Xharka, for violating Albanian laws by carrying out  unlicensed fishing in Albanian waters.    In conformity with the rules and legal procedures, this ship  was accompanied to the port of Sarande and was handed over to  the relevant authorities for further action.    At 1125 today a Greek military patrol vessel was detected  approaching the Greek fishing boat detained by our naval patrol  boat. At 1130 this Greek warship stopped at latitude 39 degrees  38 minutes and longitude 19 degrees 43.5 minutes, about 20.5  miles into our waters.    Considering that the Greek warship violated Albanian rules,  our patrol boat requested that the warship left Albanian waters  immediately. At first the Greek P-52 vessel refused to accept  that it was in Albanian waters. However, later, at about 1230,  the warship left for Greek waters, where it remained until 1320.    This incursion and stay of the Greek patrol boat is another  provocative action that may cause extremely grave consequences.  Our navy is seriously committed to defending legality and  sovereignty in our territorial waters.    Under these conditions, the Defense Ministry of the Republic  of Albania asks the relevant authorities of the Greek Army to  prevent and avoid such military actions that incite and increase  tension on the official border of the Republic of Albania and  further aggravate interstate relations that may lead to  dangerous consequences.</p>

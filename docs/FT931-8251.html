			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: Moving into deeper waters - Shell's new production platform is a milestone for the oil industry One of nature's less obvious amphibians has this week been inching its way into the blue waters of the Mediterranean off Taranto on Italy's south-eastern coast. At almost 19,000 tonnes, the massive hull for Shell's new Auger production platform in the Gulf of Mexico represents a milestone for the offshore oil industry. As reserves in easily exploitable locations are gradually depleted, oil companies are searching for new sources in more hostile terrain, whether on land or ever deeper at sea. The large rectangular structure, built by Italy's Belleli engineering group at its Taranto yard, comprises four 49m-high, twin-core steel towers, linked by a thick steel pontoon belt at the bottom and diagonal struts at the top. Like a giant upturned table, the 109m-long and 88m-wide hull forms the lower part of the new platform, which will stretch offshore oil production technology to unprecedented limits. The completed platform, due to start producing oil early next year, will sit in 980m of water off the US coast. At that depth, it will beat by almost a third again the previous record depth for a platform, and could represent the first step towards a new generation of 'super' oil platforms capable of operating at depths of up to 1,200m. Working in such deep waters has obliged engineers to abandon previous platform technology in favour of new solutions to address the problem of how to create a structure which will be sufficiently tall, yet rigid enough to permit oil to be extracted successfully and safely. The offshore business has until now been dominated by two designs: the familiar 'jacket' - tapering latticeworks of special steels, akin to a modern Eiffel Tower, which are floated on barges to the production site and then carefully tipped over so their feet sink to the sea bed. More recently, large, heavy concrete platforms have been developed for the North Sea, particularly by the Norwegians. Both designs are still perfectly valid for shallow-to-medium-depth operations, explains Umberto Pellegrini, Belleli's project manager for the Auger contract. But as oil companies have pushed ever deeper to sea, the two designs have been showing their limits. A 900m-tall jacket would be prohibitively expensive owing to the amount of steel required, he says. At that height, it might also be insufficiently rigid. As for a concrete platform, its weight would make it wholly uneconomic, he says. 'Tension leg platforms are the answer to the oil industry's need to work in ever deeper waters. They combine stability and size with relatively low weight and therefore lower cost, than conventional designs,' he adds. The first TLP was developed about seven years ago for Conoco's Hutton field in the North Sea. Since then, two more have gone into operation in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. However, the Auger platform marks the biggest and most expensive TLP to date. The hull alone cost around L200bn (Pounds 91m), while the deck, being built by McDermott, the big US engineering group, will cost as much again. On to that must be added the separate modules covering functions such as production and accommodation. TLPs comprise a large floating metal hull - the upturned table - on top of which the deck and modules are mounted. Although seemingly the simplest part of the structure, the hull is in many ways the key to how a TLP works. Because it floats, the hull requires no direct support from the seabed, representing an obvious saving in weight, and therefore cost. But in order to provide the necessary stability and rigidity, the TLP is attached to the ocean floor by 12 steel tendons - in reality 12-inch steel tubes bolted together in 100m-sections - which are put under tension to lock the platform in place. A pair of anchors, stretching up to 3km from each leg, provides further stability in the case of severe weather conditions, such as the hurricanes which can sweep the Gulf of Mexico. The floating technology is deceptively simple, yet lies at the heart of the two key processes involved in preparing a TLP for use. Precisely controlled ballasting and de-ballasting is needed for the first step, due later this year, when the hull will be 'mated' with the superstructure at sea. As no floating cranes exist which are powerful enough to lift an object as heavy as the 20,000 tonnes of completed deck, the process will be carried out by sinking the hull instead. Once in position, pumps in the four columns will start bringing in enough sea water to lower the top of the hull to the water line. In the meantime, barges carrying the superstructure will move precisely into position over the submerged structure. By pumping out the water, the hull and superstructure will gradually rise, eventually reaching their desired operating height. Once there, the superstructure will be welded to the hull at five special anchor points topping the four columns. 'It seems very simple, but it's actually very difficult, especially to avoid bumping,' says Pellegrini. Sophisticated ballasting techniques will also take centre stage when it comes to tensioning the cables linking the platform to the sea bed. The cables are put under tension by shedding ballast in the hull. Only once the platform is fully stable can oil start flowing through the 24 pipes, known as 'risers', which link it with the wells on the ocean floor. Although the Auger platform uses technology which has already been tested before, the depth at which it will operate means it represents a new challenge compared with its predecessors. Moreover, it is the first TLP to have its hull wholly assembled on land before being towed out to sea in one piece. Belleli made three of the four giant legs on the previous TLP, built for the Snorre field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. But once fabricated, they were shipped to the main contractor, where they were then joined to the rest of the hull offshore. Onshore fabrication will set the pace for the even bigger TLPs of the future, the company thinks. Among projects believed to be under preliminary consideration are new platforms for Shell in both the Gulf of Mexico and off the Philippines, and for French oil companies off the Congo. The new TLPs may have to operate in waters of up to 1,450m deep, stretching existing techniques still further. If the orders come through, they will be a godsend to an industry currently suffering from the downward phase of an often highly cyclical business. Low oil prices and worldwide recession, reducing demand for oil, mean new orders for rigs and platforms have become scarce. In Belleli's case, the almost simultaneous launching this month of the Auger hull and two big modules for other platforms will leave the Taranto yard without work. With only about half a dozen companies probably capable of building the big TLPs of the future, Belleli's engineers are setting great store by the experience they have gained so far. No other European fabricator has won a similar order for the US market, which is still largely dominated by US manufacturers. However, even TLP technology could be nearing its limits - at least until more experience is gained with the current generation of platforms in operation. Pellegrini says extending current techniques to produce TLPs capable of working in up to 1,500m is quite feasible. The challenge lies in going deeper. 'That will require new techniques for preparing the seabed templates to which the securing tendons are attached,' he says. And even the most enthusiastic TLP engineers will want to see how their latest brainchilds, such as the Auger platform, perform at sea over a period of time before taking too big a leap further forwards.</p>

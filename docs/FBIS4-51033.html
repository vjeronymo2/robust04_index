			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (XINHUA) -- China will remain  a peace-loving country even it becomes developed in the next  century, said the leader of the Chinese delegation to the 27th  International Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council  (PBEC).    At a session on "China in the 21st century" here today,  Zheng  Hongye, who is chairman of China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade, told the delegates that by the middle of  the next century, China is set to be a middle-level developed  nation and an important force in safeguarding international  peace.    By the end of this century, the Chinese people would  generally lead a relatively rich life, thus greatly  strengthening their purchasing power, raising their level of  consumption, and providing strong support to Asian and world  economic development, Zheng said.    China will open its market in a even large scale by then, he  said, and its total accumulated imports are expected to reach  one trillion U.S. dollars in the seven years till 2000.    However, Zheng added, although the overall economic strength  of China will be markedly improved at the beginning of the next  century, there will still be a big gap between it and developed  nations in terms of per capita income.    He said China together with other peace-loving countries  will  make painstaking efforts to establish a new world order for  peace, stability, cooperation and development.    "China is and will be a peace-loving country. It will never  invade, interfere and bully others and never seek hegemony,"  Zheng said.    At the same time, he pointed out, China will continue to  follow its own development path. "It is impossible for the  Chinese to accept the way imposed by outsiders who try to direct  them to do this or that according to their models and  intentions," he said.    PBEC is a non-governmental organization set up in 1967. Its  membership has risen to 17 with China, Russia and Colombia  formally joining it at the current meeting.    The three-day gathering, which opened on Monday [23 May],  deals with the current economic situation, regional economic  cooperation and specific business issues relating to  telecommunications, air transportation, financial services,  energy and tourism.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Lamont's opportunity to save his chancellorship: The Autumn Statement should mark the end of a difficult time for economic policy TOMORROW, Mr Norman Lamont has a chance to retrieve his chancellorship. His Autumn Statement will be more important than any of the previous set-piece occasions during his two-year tenure of Number 11 Downing Street. It will do much more than detail the government's spending plans for 1993-94 and the two subsequent years and present its forecast for the economy next year. It should mark the end of a difficult rebalancing of policy since Britain was forced to pull sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism eight weeks ago. The hope is that, with a special package of measures to help lift the UK out of recession and lower interest rates, the chancellor will revive business and consumer confidence and point the way to renewed economic growth. But Mr Lamont has a difficult course to steer. He will have to justify cutting some spending programmes and entitlements in a recession. He must hold out realistic hope of recovery and so provide an answer to fears in the country and among increasingly fractious Tory backbenchers in Westminster that the recession could turn into a slump. Last month's outcry about the pit closure programme convinced the government of the political necessity of shifting the emphasis of policy towards growth. On the other hand, the government must stand by its recently announced target of holding underlying inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent band over the life of this parliament. Even though Britain is no longer subject to ERM constraints, it cannot risk upsetting financial markets and causing sterling to fall sharply. While the Confederation of British Industry and much of the press have been clamouring this week for radical action in the Autumn Statement, Whitehall has been trying to deflate overblown expectations. 'A handful of measures' was how one official described the special policy package that the chancellor will disclose on Thursday to boost the economy. Some of this may be presentational prudence. The government naturally wants the package to create as favourable an impression as possible when published. But Mr Lamont is by nature a cautious man. He has has always been averse to giving the economy short-term artificial stimulus. He also sees the Autumn Statement as part of a medium-term framework for policy to encourage growth while taking no risks with rising prices. Much of this year's Autumn Statement is well-known in broad outline. The government will keep within its planning total of Pounds 244.5bn for spending in 1993-94. Priority will be given where possible to capital spending over current spending. Public sector pay will be squeezed. One eyecatching project - the Jubilee Line extension - seems certain to go ahead and should help employment and morale in the south-east's depressed construction industry. Barriers to private-sector involvement in infrastructure investment will be brought down. Other elements of the special package will be targeted to give support to housing and industry. The commitment to growth, first articulated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, three weeks ago is real enough. But the excitement about the government's supposed 'U-turn' has tended to obscure an already substantial relaxation of policy since Black Wednesday. Bank base rates have fallen by 2 percentage points while by yesterday sterling had devalued by 14 per cent, when measured against the Bank of England's trade weighted index. As Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has made clear, the devaluation presents British industry with opportunities in export markets but it also poses dangers for Britain. Speaking at the weekend on BBC Television's On the Record programme, he recalled that the UK had in the past always thrown away the competitive advantage of devaluation by letting inflation erode it. Assessing the likely inflationary impact of the devaluation is probably the hardest economic judgment the chancellor must make this week. Economic theory says a 14 per cent devaluation should result in a 14 per cent increase in the price level over a number of years. The Treasury model of the economy reckons that on average the competitiveness effect of devaluation is lost within five years. But a growing number of City economists are convinced that the economy is so weak that worries about inflation should not act as a constraint on Mr Lamont. In his latest assessment of the British economy, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs, said that inflation in Britain would probably have turned negative by 1994 on pre-devaluation policy settings. He forecast underlying inflation would be about 3 per cent by the end of next year in spite of the large devaluation since September 16. For the time being, the Treasury and Bank of England seem to share the City view that there are no inflationary pressures in the economy. But how long will this be the case? Yesterday brought news of an unexpectedly sharp 2.5 per cent rise in industry's non-seasonally ad-justed input prices in October; two-thirds of the rise reflected higher imported goods costs. How quickly such increases work through to the rest of the economy will depend on how far exporters, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers are forced to absorb costs to keep markets. With the slack in the economy, imported inflation could be absorbed for some time and should not stand in the way of a further cut in interest rates around the time of the Autumn Statement. But with sterling again weak, it is unlikely that Mr Lamont will respond to appeals for a sharp cut of 2 points in bank base rates from 8 per cent. By the end of this week, the chancellor will have the spending part of his fiscal policy for next year in place. Barring surprises, revenue decisions will await the last of the spring budgets in March. Between those two events, interest rates will again be the main instrument for steering the economy. While financial markets anticipate a further substantial easing of monetary policy in the months to come, Mr Lamont will keep a watchful eye on prospective inflation so that he can meet his target. Once Britain emerges from recession, UK official interest rates are likely to be more volatile than in the past.</p>

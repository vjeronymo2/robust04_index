			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ILLUSIONS SHATTERED IN SNOWS OF KRANOYARSK;  </P> <P> ARMS CONTROL: THE SOVIET CONFESSION OF WILLFUL VIOLATIONS SAYS MUCH TO GIVE US  PAUSE ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR -- AND THAT OF MANY PROMINENT AMERICANS.  </P> <P> It is perhaps appropriate that the week that saw the Soviet Union announce the  "Frank Sinatra Doctrine" as the guiding force in its foreign policy began with  the admission that Moscow had been lying for six years about a violation of the  1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. It is instructive that the Soviets  themselves would see fit to draw a parallel between the entertainer with such a  colorful, not to say checkered, past and their own behavior.  </P> <P> Even more instructive has been the truly astonishing reaction to the disclosure  by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that Moscow had known for  some time that its construction of a large, phased array radar near the  Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk was illegal. By and large this admission has  simply been accepted as one more indication of the wondrous benefits of  glasnost.  </P> <P> What seems to be totally absent is an appreciation that the confession speaks  volumes about Soviet behavior -- and that of many prominent Americans. We  ignore these insights at our peril.  </P> <P> Most importantly, it is now an unassailable fact that the Soviet Union is  capable of consciously and willfully violating arms-control agreements. For  years, the Ronald Reagan Administration was berated for asserting this; indeed,  some suggested that the very act of accusing the Soviets was proof that  President Reagan was not truly interested in nuclear arms control.  </P> <P> This observation is particularly significant insofar as there are a number of  other examples of suspected Soviet violations of formal arms-control  agreements. While the evidence to support these charges has not always been as  clear-cut as Krasnoyarsk, it is only prudent now to assume Soviet culpability  in these areas as well -- at least until an opportunity is afforded for a  complete and independent accounting.  </P> <P> The emphasis placed by the last Administration on the verification of  U.S.-Soviet arms-control agreements is, obviously, fully warranted. Here again,  his critics claimed that President Reagan's obsession with exacting  verification arrangements was nothing more than an effort to sabotage the  prospects for agreements.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, toward the end of his Administration, notably in the treaty on  intermediate-range nuclear forces, President Reagan became considerably less  insistent on effective verification -- even as Moscow became more adept at  accepting inspection regimes that appeared intrusive but were, in fact, of  little value should the Soviets be determined to cheat. The resulting  procedures, especially if applied as precedents in other agreements, may well  invite future Soviet arms-control violations.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze's confession on Krasnoyarsk provides an embarrassing indictment of  those self-styled American authorities on arms control who for years contended  that the Soviets were right in averring that this radar was not a violation of  the ABM treaty or who, at the very least, trivialized the significance of this  treaty breach. A list of those who made such representations is a virtual Who's  Who of the U.S. arms-control community. To name but a few of these discredited  apologists: McGeorge Bundy, George Kennan, Robert McNamara, Gerard Smith, Paul  Warnke, Rep. Tom Downey (D-N.Y.) plus the Arms Control Assn., the Federation of  American Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council.  </P> <P> Incredible as it may seem, few -- if any -- of these individuals or  organizations have had the grace to admit their errors. To the contrary, we are  now being told that the Soviet admission on Krasnoyarsk, and Moscow's stated  determination to tear down this illegal radar, in no way vindicates the firm  and outspoken position taken by the United States government about Soviet  non-compliance.  </P> <P> This is simply absurd. Even if one takes at face value Shevardnadze's  preposterous statement that it took Moscow four years to "sort out" the facts  with respect to the illegal character of the Krasnoyarsk facility, there is  simply no reason to believe that such a sorting out would have taken place --  let alone produced the results it did -- absent concerted U.S. pressure. At the  very least, the demonstrated inability of such "experts" to assess correctly  past Soviet behavior and to advocate effective American responses should call  into question their future analyses and recommendations.  </P> <P> Finally, it should be borne in mind that the Krasnoyarsk radar is but one facet  of a comprehensive and ongoing Soviet program designed to reduce Soviet  vulnerability to nuclear attack -- a program fundamentally at odds with the  object and purpose of the ABM treaty. Even if the Krasnoyarsk facility is  destroyed, we should be under no illusion that Moscow has abandoned its  commitment to strategic defense. Instead, the United States must press forward  with its own Strategic Defense Initiative, both as a means of providing for a  more effective deterrent to nuclear war and as a hedge against  as-yet-unacknowledged and future Soviet arms-control violations.  </P></p>

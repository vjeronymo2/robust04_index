			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, deputy foreign minister of  the Islamic Republic of Iran who has recently come to Kabul, in  an interview with a Bakhtar Information Agency correspondent,  said: We have no specific plan for the solution of  Afghanistan's current problems. As a result of meetings and  talks, however, we learned that all sides reject fighting, and  this is a point that raises hope for the future.    Borujerdi said he met with esteemed Professor Borhanoddin  Rabbani, president of Afghanistan; esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud  [chairman of the Kabul City Security Commission]; esteemed Dr.  Najibollah Lafra'i, minister of state for foreign affairs; and  esteemed Hekmatyar. He said he conducted useful talks with them  on the current changes in the country.    The deputy foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran  also said his visit to Kabul has taken place on the basis of  good neighborliness. He said: On my suggestion, Hekmatyar  agreed to give electricity to Kabul for four hours a day. He  expressed the hope that a solution could also be found for  getting food to Kabul.    Answering another question, Mr. Borujerdi said: The economic  cooperation agreements signed by both countries are being  implemented, and cooperation is being carried out in the secured  areas of the country. In response to another question,  Borujerdi said: Afghanistan's Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami can resolve  its internal problems itself. I did meet with Mr. Mazari and  Mr. Akbari. The problems of Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, however, are  this party's own problems. I am confident it will find [words  indistinct] to resolve them. We are ready to help to resolve  their problems [words indistinct].</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Parkland sees better margins as losses are cut MR DENIS Greenwood, chairman of Parkland Textile (Holdings), said that the woollen yarn, worsted cloth and clothing manufacturer was coming out of recession and that in the current year he expected to see a rise in turnover and improved margins. The group reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 2.17m in the year to February 28. Losses in the second half were cut to Pounds 796,000 from the Pounds 1.37m incurred in the first six months. However, stripping out last year's Pounds 2.11m exceptional charges and increased interest this time of Pounds 957,000 (Pounds 351,000), left full-year trading losses fractionally up at Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.14m). Turnover slipped to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 50.7m). Despite the completion of most of the capital expenditure programme, the interest bill did rise after what Mr Greenwood said he hoped would be the last significant payments. He said that wool prices had slowly risen in the past four months after the decline in 1991, thereby stabilising the market, but he added that, in the period under review, margins had been 'poor', with the core Parkland Textile weaving business the weakest performer in the group. Knoll Spinning was now showing signs of improvement, Mr Greenwood said, and Yorkshire Yarn Dyeing had a 'satisfactory' year in the context of the depressed industry. In the garments division, the market remained competitive, though more of the production has been moved abroad, easing margins. Current orders across all divisions were being taken on much stronger margins, he said. Low demand in the UK and the return of sales in the Middle East to more normal levels led to an increase in exports from 10.4 to 15.2 per cent. Losses per share were more than halved to 19.9p (43p) and the final dividend is held at 1p for a total of 2p (2.5p).</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Checks on Boeing 747 engine links ordered by US authority INSPECTIONS were ordered yesterday on 700 Boeing 747 jumbo jets following the discovery of fatigue and corrosion cracks in engine fitments. The airworthiness directive issued by the US Federal Aviation Authority orders operators of Boeing 747 aircraft powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines to check the fuse pins and lugs connecting the engines to the struts on the wings. Boeing said the inspections could take place during routine maintenance and would not require taking the aircraft out of service. The FAA order does not apply to the 747s powered by General Electric CF6 engines, which number about 200. Accident investigators are studying whether possible faults in the fuse pins or lugs could have contributed to the crash of the El Al 747 cargo aircraft in Amsterdam on Sunday. The FAA said in its airworthiness directive there was no evidence that fuse pin cracking was responsible for the Amsterdam crash. The FAA first ordered checks on 747 engine mounts in 1986 after the report of a failure of a fuse pin. It also recommended the replacement, if necessary, of older pins with a redesigned pin. The regulatory authority issued a second directive in 1991 after a 2.55-inch crack was discovered in one of the redesigned pins. Since then it said it had received several reports of fatigue cracks at corrosion sites in the new pins on aircraft equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines. The FAA said a recent fuse pin inspection had revealed a crack in a midspar fitting lug, the fitment through which the pin penetrates. The cause of the cracking had not yet been discovered. It warned that fatigue cracks in fuse pins or lugs could cause failure in the engine support structure if not repaired. It therefore ordered inspections of older pins within 30 days and further inspections every 500 landings. For the redesigned type of fuse pin, initial inspection must now be done after 5,000 landings instead of 7,500. The UK Civil Aviation Authority said the FAA directive would also apply to British registered carriers, adding that British Airways had completed its checks.</p>

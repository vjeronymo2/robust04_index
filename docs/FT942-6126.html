			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Spanish stanza The literary brilliance of London's brokers marches on, with Williams de Broe choosing to head a recent research note on Spanish bonds with the following lines from W H Auden's poem In Memory of WB Yeats: In the deserts of the heart Let the healing fountains start, In the prison of his days Teach the free man how to praise. It used the text to suggest that former central bank governor Mario Rubio's stint in jail was 'of minor importance to Spanish politics and to the Bonos market', and Felipe Gonzalez 'is a good doctor'. Staggering percipience. The boys at de Broe should have concluded with another Auden verse of equal relevance: The glacier knocks in the cupboard, The desert sighs in the bed, And the crack in the tea-cup opens A lane to the land of the dead.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Japanese PM set to quit over loss of majority MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, appeared ready yesterday to bow to demands within the Liberal Democratic party for him to resign to take responsibility for the party's loss of its parliamentary majority. The LDP leader came under increased pressure after the resignation of Mr Junichiro Koizumi, the posts and telecommunications minister, who said Mr Miyazawa 'should have resigned right after our defeat in the election' on Sunday. Mr Miyazawa, 73, has generally been vague in replying to the party's demands in the hope of maintaining power, but indicated that he is likely to resign at a party meeting tomorrow at which other LDP executives are expected to be replaced. Reputedly a reformer, Mr Koizumi presented his resignation as an honourable political act, yet he is a member of a rival LDP faction headed by the openly ambitious Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, who wants the party leadership. The new leader will be the LDP candidate for prime minister at an extraordinary session of parliament early next month. Rival faction leaders claim that Mr Miyazawa must resign in the 'interests of party unity and stability,' but these faction heads are also under attack from younger party members for their role in the party split that led to the election and the end of one-party rule in Japan. The LDP must find a partner to be certain that its candidate will be chosen as prime minister at the extraordinary session, likely to be held on August 2. The resignation of Mr Miyazawa will be cited as evidence to potential partners that the party is in favour of political reform. However, Mr Miyazawa showed more interest in reforming the scandal-stained political system than did the rival factions demanding his head. It will be difficult for one of the newer pro-reform parties to agree to a coalition with the LDP if Mr Mitsuzuka, or a senior member of his conservative faction, takes the helm.</p>

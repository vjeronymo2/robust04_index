			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SURVIVOR OF ENNISKILLEN 1987 BLOOD BATH RELIVES NIGHTMARE THAT TOUCHED WORLD  </P> <P> Gordon Wilson touched hearts around the world with his grief-stricken words of  forgiveness for the IRA bombers who killed his daughter in the war memorial  massacre in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back," he said in a moving  interview that may have helped to stop another blood bath -- Protestant  extremist retaliation for one of the Irish Republican Army's biggest bomb  attacks.  </P> <P> Wilson received 10,000 letters of support after relating how he clutched the  hand of his daughter, Marie, as she lay fatally injured under the ruins of  Enniskillen's community center. Her last words: "Daddy, I love you very much."  </P> <P> Now, three years after the bombing that killed 11 people and injured 63 in the  picturesque border town on Nov. 8, 1987, Wilson has tried to exorcise his grief  with a poignantly told biography entitled "Marie."  </P> <P> "It literally ripped a hole in the heart of the community but miraculously that  heart beat continues and grows steadily stronger," writes Wilson, who was  showered with man-of-the-year and peace awards.  </P> <P> Queen Elizabeth II praised the depth of his forgiveness in her Christmas  message.  </P> <P> "Spirit of Enniskillen" scholarships enabled children from across Northern  Ireland's sectarian divide to go abroad. The town opened its own integrated  school.  </P> <P> About 300,000 people signed a book of condolence in the Dublin Lord Mayor's  residence.  </P> <P> Wilson won widespread praise for recently retelling the tragic story on Irish  television and the biography has become a bestseller.  </P> <P> Still, the carnage continues. Sixty-five people have died so far this year in  Northern Ireland's political and sectarian conflict, topping the figure for all  of 1989.  </P> <P> Enniskillen was not the catalyst, never the turning point that Wilson hoped it  would be.  </P> <P> After the agony of the loss of his daughter, Wilson felt that the story of the  20-year-old nurse had to be told. He recalled it all just hours after the  explosion in a hesitant voice that echoed round the world.  </P> <P> "The wall collapsed and we were thrown forward, rubble and stones all around us  and under us. I remember thinking: 'I'm not hurt but there is a pain in my  shoulder.' I shouted to Marie: 'Are you all right?'  </P> <P> "She said 'Yes.' She found my hand and said "Is that your hand, Dad?' I said: "  'Are you all right dear?' But we were under six feet of rubble. Three or four  times I asked her. Three or four times I asked her: 'Are you all right Marie?'  </P> <P> "I asked her the fifth time. She said: 'Daddy, I love you very much.'  </P> <P> "Those were the last words she spoke to me. I kept shouting 'Marie, are you all  right?' There was no reply.  </P> <P> "I have lost my daughter but I bear no ill will, no grudge. Dirty sort of talk  is not going to bring her back to life. I don't have an answer. But I know  there has to be a plan.  </P> <P> "If I didn't think that, I would commit suicide. It's part of a great plan and  God is good. And we shall meet again."  </P> <P> Doctors fought for five hours to save Marie's life.  </P> <P> In the book her mother, Joan, recalls: "My darling Marie was dying. I kissed  her and I shall always see her eyelids flickering to my dying day. Sister (a  nurse) whispered very gently: 'Mrs. Wilson, Marie's heart has stopped beating.'  "  </P> <P> Offering the best epitaph he can for his daughter, Gordon Wilson writes of the  IRA bombers: "It cannot be easy to look at yourself in the mirror in such a  situation.  </P> <P> "But I am not going to add to the hatreds by talking about bitterness or  revenge. I'll go on praying for all of them and leave the rest to God. That is  the only way I can handle it and still live with myself.  </P> <P> "In life and after death there is only one ultimate standard by which we are  judged. Marie showed that to us all as she lay under rubble at the cenotaph,  holding my hand with her life slipping away. The bottom line is love. There is  nothing more I can say."  </P></p>

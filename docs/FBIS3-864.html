The national radio pointed out that the "striking off"  measure against the general was taken through the implementation  of a presidential decree signed in 1985 by Mr. Kolingba himself,  who was then head of the Military Committee of National Redress.    Under this decree, "the officer struck off the Army ceases  to  be on the seniority list and thus is not promoted." The decree  adds that "any officer who is a candidate in any election or  holding any elective office shall be struck off the Army rank."  This decision comes a few days after the arrest of several  senior officials of the general's party, the Central African  Democratic Rally, RDC. These officials were accused of  "ordering acts of social tension" in Bangui.    After a meeting on 8 March with President Patasse, Gen.  Kolingba observed that by these arrests "he was being targeted"  and described these arrests as a "very dangerous derailment of  the young democracy" in Central African Republic. The general  added that he was not to be held responsible for any social  disturbances or unfortunate events that might come up in the  country."</p>

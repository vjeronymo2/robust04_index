			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Thailand proposes to establish exim bank THE Thai cabinet yesterday approved a draft bill to establish an export and import bank, according to Radio Thailand, AP reports. The measure, expected to be introduced in the next session of parliament in May, would set up the bank as an arm of the Finance Ministry, free from commercial banking rules. It would be capitalised at Bt2.5bn (Pounds 67m), which would be contributed by commercial banks and the Bank of Thailand, and drawn from foreign exchange profits confiscated from commercial banks for misconduct. The governor of the central bank would serve as the exim bank's director for the first three years to smooth the transfer of some functions.</p>

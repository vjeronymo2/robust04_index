			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Watchdog critical over Pounds 3m pay-offs to NHS staff Health authorities may have exceeded their powers by spending nearly Pounds 3m on termination payments for employees, it was revealed yesterday by Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general. He qualified his opinion on National Health Service accounts for 1992-93 in view of 'considerable doubt' over whether the health authorities were empowered to make all the payments concerned. The report brought renewed criticism of financial controls in the NHS from Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary. He said it provided 'yet more evidence' of how public money was used in an unaccountable health service. 'By packing health authorities with Tory supporters, the government has ensured that decisions about pay-offs and relocation payments are being made without public scrutiny,' he said. Sir John found that regional and district health authorities made employment termination settlements totalling Pounds 2,638,000 over four years which may not have been within their powers, while family health authorities paid another Pounds 348,000. Most of the settlements were compensation for loss of office following organisational change and, says the report, largely represented unexpired portions of contracts - the longest period being two years nine months. Senior NHS managers say they are considering what proportion of the payments was properly due, and will then discuss with the Treasury whether any remaining sums can be approved retrospectively on value for money grounds. Sir John says the Treasury has refused to approve a Pounds 78,000 termination settlement paid by Wessex regional health authority to a member of staff, but the authority believed that 'pursuing recovery of the payment would not be cost-effective'. The report finds two health authorities spent a further Pounds 465,000 on relocation pay for five members of staff, Pounds 202,000 of which was outside their powers. Severance payments are a sensitive issue in the NHS. MPs on the Commons public accounts committee investigating cases of mismanagement have criticised payments to staff who, they believe, should have been summarily dismissed. Sir John finds that 84 per cent of NHS trusts broke even in 1992-93, while 81 per cent stayed within their external financing limits set by the government. Mr Gerald Malone, health minister, said the government had issued guidance on severance payments and would be sending out advice on removal expenses shortly.</p>

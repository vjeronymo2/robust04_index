			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ferfin tumbles as investors lose confidence SHARES in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the diversified Italian holding company with borrowings of more than L31,000bn (Dollars 20bn), hit a new low in Milan yesterday in response to a further loss of investor confidence. Ferfin ordinary shares fell almost 9 per cent to L408.2, taking the cumulative fall to 61.6 per cent since the end of May, when the company announced a L1,519bn loss for 1992. This week, it revised its loss to L1,667bn after the disclosure of more losses at its Montedison industrial subsidiary. Yesterday's drop came in reaction to the announcement at Ferfin's shareholders' meeting on Wednesday of a meeting at the end of August to approve a write-down of the group's capital. The August assembly is likely to be followed by a big rights issue, which will cement creditor banks' control over the group. Last month, Ferfin and the controlling Ferruzzi family called on the group's five main creditor banks to work out a rescue package. Analysts said the share price drop was also influenced by continuing investigations by Milan magistrates monitoring the rescue package on behalf of minority shareholders. The magistrates this week questioned Mr Roberto Michetti, the ex-finance director of Montedison, who now works for Mr Raul Gardini, Ferfin's former guiding light who has now set up his own group. The investigations follow Monday's revelations of an additional L435bn write-off in Montedison's 1992 accounts owing to an 'irrecoverable' loan by an obscure Curacao-based subsidiary. Mr Michetti was also chairman of Montedison International Holding, the Swiss subsidiary which indirectly controlled the Curacao company. The inquiries came against a bizarre twist at Fondiaria, the big Florentine insurance company controlled jointly by Ferfin and the heirs of the late Mr Camillo De Benedetti. Shareholders at Fondiaria's AGM on Wednesday were astonished to be told it had received a letter from Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former Ferfin executive now being sought by magistrates, resigning from the board. Mr Garofano disappeared earlier this year Milan after magistrates issued a warrant against him regarding a L250m payment to the Christian Democrat party. Mr Garofano claimed the money was his own, and not funds from the Ferruzzi group. The letter, dated June 16 and written by hand on Mr Garofano's personal notepaper, was delivered without a stamp or postmark. It helps confirms the widespread view that Mr Garofano, a chemical engineer, is alive and in hiding.</p>

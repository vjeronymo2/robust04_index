			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW VENTURE FOR COMPANY;  </P> <P> KOLL TO START DEVELOPING, BUYING SHOPPING CENTERS  </P> <P> The Koll Co., a large Newport Beach developer, said Thursday it will soon begin  developing and buying shopping centers for the first time.  </P> <P> Until now, Koll has developed only offices, factories and warehouses.  </P> <P> David Mudgett, who had headed the Irvine Co.'s shopping center business, was  named to run Koll's new venture.  </P> <P> Mudgett, now a corporate senior vice president at Koll, won't be heading a  large staff. Koll said it will use its existing personnel to start the retail  business.  </P> <P> Koll said it will start small by developing small complexes of stores around  its office and industrial projects.  </P> <P> "Retail is becoming an important element in the mixed-use commercial complexes,  business parks and industrial parks we are developing throughout the western  United States," J. Harold Street, president of the company's Development  Services Group, said in a statement.  </P> <P> "Until now, we have been selling or leasing the retail components of the sites  to retail developers -- but now we will develop the retail ourselves."  </P> <P> The company will also look for land on which to develop neighborhood and  community shopping centers, and said it eventually plans to develop larger  retailing centers such as malls.  </P> <P> Koll, with a real estate portfolio of $4 billion, is one of the nation's  largest developers. Although it operates mostly in the West, it is also opening  a Texas office.  </P></p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Mercedes reports sales up 35% SALES of Mercedes cars in the UK since the April 9 general election have been running about 35 per cent higher than a year ago, indicating that recovery might be under way in the deeply depressed new-car market. Mr Hans Tauscher, managing director of Mercedes-Benz (UK), warned yesterday that recovery might be put at risk if two Brussels reports on new-car prices, due to be published tomorrow, generate fresh uncertainty among UK buyers about whether they are being charged excessively high prices compared with other European Community markets. Mercedes' increase in post-election sales contrasts sharply with the period between the start of April and the general election, when sales were 10 per cent below the already severely depressed levels of the same period a year ago. Mr Tauscher acknowledged that the extent of the upturn would have been exaggerated as a result of potential buyers holding back in early April until the result of the general election was known. Speaking to a meeting of the Fleet Street Motoring Group, Mr Tauscher said that the upturn was still 'a very positive sign'. He added: 'We all detect a change of mood.' Mr Tauscher said he was 'appalled' at the prospect of fresh dissension, likely to be caused by tomorrow's publication of the two Brussels reports. One, specifically on car prices, was produced for Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's competition commissioner. It shows substantial country-by-country price differentials of up to 40 per cent. The other, for Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, also deals in part with car prices but disagrees with the Brittan report on the causes. Mr Tauscher said he was dismayed that the EC competition report appeared to disagree with a previous one from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, 'which after 20 months of investigation concluded . . . that the industry had generally been pricing within EC parameters'. Under those guidelines, prices should not vary by more than 12 per cent between member states for long periods, and 18 per cent for shorter periods. In spite of the potential short-term market setbacks, Mr Tauscher said he believed that under a Conservative government the UK would enjoy sufficient economic growth for the 'quality' car market - cars of over 2 litres and costing more than Pounds 15,000 - to increase from sales of 190,000 this year to 270,000 by 1996.</p>

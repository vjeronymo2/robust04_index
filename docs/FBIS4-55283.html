			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "old" on interview with Privatization Minister </F> Wieslaw Kaczmarek in Warsaw; date not given: "Poland Trying To  Win Investment From Germany"]    [Text] Warsaw--"German companies are still very cautious  in Poland. We would like far more involvement." Wieslaw  Kaczmarek, the new minister for privatization in Polish Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet, considers the Polish market  of 38 million potential consumers an "enormous opportunity" for  foreign investors. Compared with the total direct investment of  some $3.5 billion, Germany, at some $280 million, ranks only  fourth behind the United States, Italy, and the Netherlands.    "The Czech market has long been depleted. Now it is Poland's  turn," the minister said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG. He was referring to a 4-percent growth last year, which  boosted Poland to the top of the East European states. This  year's growth is expected to reach at least that figure.    The leftist government does not feel committed to any  ideological concepts, Kaczmarek pointed out. "Privatization can  no longer be stopped. We are long past the crucial point.  Poland will stick to its market economy course," the minister  said. He himself is a member of the Social Democratic Party,  the party that is generally considered to be the successor to  the communist cadre organization. Today, young technocrats who  are committed to the market economy are in control.    Kaczmarek pointed out that he wants to step up the speed of  privatization. "We have to take more risks," the minister said.  Especially medium-sized companies that are still state-owned and  employ up to 500 people shall be sold "quickly and cheaply."  The German Trust Agency is to serve as a model. Kaczmarek:  "We may very well sell the companies at one-fifth of their  actual value. What is more important is that the investors  create new jobs."    The bold minister candidly admits that further privatization  meets with massive reservations by the population and the trade  unions. The fear of losing jobs is just one side of the coin.  At the same time, the fear of selling off Poland to foreign  combines is increasing. "We can only counteract this by  presenting good solutions for privatization," Kaczmarek  emphasized.    The government is taking a more cautious line with big  companies, such as the Ursus truck company, where there have  repeatedly been conflicts with the Solidarnosc trade union.  Ursus is to be restructured and reorganized. "Privatizing it  is impossible at the moment," the minister said.    Ten largely independent joint-stock companies are to operate  within a holding company in the future. There will be some  foreign capital involved, but the trade union insists on  employees holding at least 50 percent of the shares. Despite  efforts by the Ursus management to step up marketing activities,  capacity utilization is only 50 percent. The 9,500  employees--in 1989, the group still employed 15,000  people--produce everything themselves, starting from bolts and  going to diesel oil filters. This wide production range  prevents the urgently needed rise in productivity.    Privatization Minister Kaczmarek thinks that a total of  1,500  to 2,000 big companies still have a difficult restructuring  phase ahead of them. The first step is changing these firms  into joint-stock companies. The government is also hoping for  foreign financial and management aid. "The only realistic  solution is the long-term privatization of big companies, which  must, however, fetch a good price," the minister said.    The private sector already accounts for 50 percent of the  GNP. Together with the Czech Republic and Hungary, Poland holds  a top position in East Europe. Some 60 percent of all people in  gainful employment, including agriculture, work for private  enterprises. But there is still a long way to go until  privatization is completed. So far, some 2,300 of the 8,450  former state-owned companies have found a new owner. In a  so-called mass privatization, 470 firms are to be divided up  into 16 or 17 investment funds, of which the population can  obtain shares.    Kaczmarek wants to complete the reprivatization of companies  by the end of 1995. A law on returning possessions expropriated  under the communist government is being worked out. According  to Kaczmarek, 400,000 applications have been received--from a  water mill to a textile factory. Claims amount to 30 billion  German marks, Kaczmarek said.</p>

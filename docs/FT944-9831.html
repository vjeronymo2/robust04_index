			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts (Openings): Turin This month's French-language performances of Donizetti's 'La fille du regiment' at the Teatro Regio are unusual: opera houses in Italy have always preferred the Italian versions of works which 19th century composers like Donizetti and Verdi wrote for Paris. Bruno Campanella conducts a staging by Luca Ronconi, with a cast headed by Eva Mei and Giuseppe Sabbatini. Opening night is tomorrow.</p>

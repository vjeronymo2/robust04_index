He made the statement at the weekly press conference when  asked to comment on the assertion by the Foreign Relations  Authorization Act of the State Department of the United States  for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 that on the issue of U.S. arms  sales to Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act should supersede the  Sino-U.S. Joint Communique issued on August 17, 1982.    He noted that the essence of the Taiwan Relations Act is to  attempt to overrule the August 17 joint communique between China  and the United States and legalize U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,  stressing that this is what the Chinese Government and people  stand firmly opposed to.    The August 17 joint communique is an international agreement  reached between the two Governments of China and the United  States, which the U.S. Government is obligated to strictly abide  by in the principle that international laws prevail over  domestic laws and take necessary measures to prevent the U.S.  Congress from making any remarks and taking any actions which  are in violation of this principle with a view to the  maintenance of Sino-U.S. relations.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: SEC urged to widen rules on 'soft-dollar' disclosure Two prominent US legislators called on the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday to introduce new rules requiring investment managers to disclose more information about their so-called 'soft dollar' arrangements with securities brokers and dealers. In a letter to Mr Arthur Levitt, the SEC's chairman, Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives' telecommunications and finance subcommittee, and Mr Jack Fields, senior Republican on the subcommittee, urged the SEC to 'give high priority to enhancing disclosure' in the soft-dollar business. They claimed the business raised conflicts of interest questions about investment managers' activities, and potentially interfered with the execution of customer orders on financial markets. Soft dollars, known in the UK as 'soft commissions', is the term given to the practice of institutional investors channelling a portion of their securities trading business through particular brokers in return for services such as the provision of brokerage research or electronic data products, or for discounts on other transaction fees. The value of commissions with such strings attached is estimated to exceed Dollars 1bn a year in the US. Although the two legislators acknowledged in their letter that the SEC was about to introduce new rules requiring mutual funds to disclose soft-dollar relationships with broking firms, they asked Mr Levitt to broaden the requirements to include not just mutual funds but all kinds of investment advisers. The SEC is expected to issue its new rules for mutual funds today, but there was no indication yesterday that the agency would broaden the edict on soft dollars. The legislator's concerns, however, are likely to be met sympathetically at the SEC. Mr Levitt has expressed his dissatisfaction with the soft dollar business on several occasions.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Georgia set to consider rouble union President Boris Yeltsin yesterday announced that Georgia would explore the possibility of joining a controversial new rouble union under negotiation between Russia and Belarus. Visiting Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, for a one-day summit with Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the republic's leader, the Russian president also said that Russia would give war-ravaged Georgia an unspecified loan. Radical Russian reformers who have mostly left the government have warned that Russia's more conservative leaders and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, are planning to bail out even worse-off former Soviet republics at Russia's expense. Mr Yeltsin said Russia and Georgia had agreed to set up a working group to 'weigh the pros and cons' of Georgia's admission to the rouble zone. The Russian leader also signed a friendship treaty which is an attempt to patch up relations frayed by Russian support last year for a rebellion by Georgia's Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia. The treaty pledges that neither side will use the other's territory for aggressive acts. The Russian parliament, however, said that the unresolved conflict meant that it could not ratify the friendship treaty. Mr Yeltsin said he would only submit the treaty for ratification once the conflict was resolved. Russia last year was also unable to stop its own rebel territory of Chechnya from offering hospitality to Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the deposed president who fought a civil war against Mr Shevardnadze until he committed suicide late in December. Reuter adds: Georgian Defence Minister Georgy Karkarashvili was concussed by a booby-trap bomb yesterday shortly before Mr Yeltsin arrived in Tbilisi. The explosion came as the minister visited the wrecked flat of his deputy, Mr Nika Kekelidze, who had been killed by a bomb there hours earlier. A friend of Mr Kekelidze was also killed and the friend's wife badly wounded. A Defence Ministry spokesman said that when Mr Karkarashvili, accompanied by his aides, opened a door in the devastated apartment a grenade fixed to its handle exploded.</p>

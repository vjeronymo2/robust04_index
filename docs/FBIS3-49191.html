Citing  well-informed sources, the Zagreb daily blames the operation on  Delta, a five-member Muslim commando unit commanded by Ismet  Bajramovic.    According to VJESNIK, three Palestinians and members of a  pro-Syrian organization monitored Juka's movements for several  weeks. One of them introduced himself as an arms dealer and took  Juka to a parking lot near the Liege-Aachen road where he was  killed.    "The liquidation of Juka Prazina was financed by the son of  Alija Izetbegovic, Bakir, who left Sarajevo six months ago,"  VJESNIK says in its unsigned article.    According to the Zagreb daily, Bakir Izetbegovic "frequently  travels between Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Tehran, and  Ankara, using Pakistani and Iraqi passports." It is believed  that Bakir Izetbegovic was in Belgium at the time of the  assassination.    VJESNIK goes on to say that "Hasan Cengic, responsible for  army logistics in the Sarajevo government, was directly involved  in the assassination of Juka Prazina."    "Immediately after the assassination, those responsible left  for Cairo and Khartoum via Brussels and Paris and Hasan Cengic  left for Islamabad using a false Pakistani passport," VJESNIK  writes.</p>

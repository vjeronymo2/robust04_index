			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Orders fall 3% in west INDUSTRIAL orders in the west German economy dropped another 3 per cent in March, and seasonally adjusted unemployment rose in April, confirming that the economic recession is still deepening. The only hopeful indicator was that the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed slightly in the past month, but the headline figure for the country as a whole remains above 3.3m, with rates of 7.1 per cent in the west, and 14.7 in the east. Industrial orders for west Germany were hit by a 4.2 per cent drop in export orders in March, compared with February, against a fall of just 2.5 per cent in domestic orders. The 3 per cent month-on-month drop in March was the same as in February, after a surprising 5.5 per cent growth in orders in January. The actual unemployment figure in April was slightly down on the previous month, but the improvement was less than normal for the time of year. Seasonally adjusted, it shows an increase of 35,000 in west Germany. The unadjusted figures showed joblessness in the west down 0.1 per cent to 2.2m, and in the east down 0.3 per cent to 1.1m. The east German figures continue to understate the real problem of unemployment in the former Communist state, because tens of thousands are involved in job creation schemes.</p>

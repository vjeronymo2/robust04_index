			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Matinee idols - Jazz Philip Larkin loved to hate Archie Shepp, the US tenorist who shared a double bill earlier this week at Islington's Union Chapel with cornettist Nat Adderley. Larkin thought his sound was 'like Flight of the Bumble Bee scored for bagpipes and concrete mixer'. In those days, the mid-1960s, Shepp and his avant-gardists claimed they were trying to make order out of chaos. Twenty-odd years on, the old order has prevailed and the brutal stylist has given way to a populist blues-inflected post-bopper. Accompanied by his regular band of Horace Parlan (piano), Wayne Dockery (bass) and Steve McCraven (drums), Shepp began in a lugubrious mood but progressed through mellow compositions from his last album I didn't know about you, to a funk piece which involved James Brown style 'ow' exclamations. Surprisingly, given his doleful appearance, old Shepp has a fine singing voice which he uses enthusiastically - a deep blue baritone crooning on a ballad like his own 'Deja Vu' or shouting the blues, which he is also prone to. The tenor playing, while it retains much of the gruffness and rough edged familiarity with the melody, is growing more friendly with age and Shepp sounds more comfortable savouring a ballad than punching out tough phrases. Parlan, who shares the writing with the leader, is an empathetic accompanist and combines a Monk-ish right hand with a less percussive left for bittersweet chords. Cornettist Nat Adderley leads a similarly distinguished regular band which features elder statesman Jimmy Cobb in the traps and the promising young altoist Vincent Herring, alongside Walter Booker on bass. An altogether more zippy affair, Adderley's set is delivered with gags and patter while the numbers swing hard and fast. Younger brother to the late altoist, Cannonball Adderley, Nat is an agile horn player and alternates between the crisp, silvery tones of the muted instrument and fatter, unfettered blowing. Choice material, from Zawinul's 'Scotch &amp; Water' to his own big earner, 'The Worksong', is moved along briskly by Bargad who pecks away at the keyboard furiously and Cobb, a metronomic time keeper. Booker, a ragged improvisor, provides dark shading for Adderley (in 'Autumn Leaves' for example) and natters cheerfully throughout young Herring's fierce solo spot in Hank Mobley's 'This Idea Of You'. Islington's Union Chapel, incidentally, is an unusual and atmospheric addition to the London jazz circuit, though the reverberating sound may not be to everyone's taste. The octagonal floorplan and cavernous vaulted roofspace accommodated over 1000 worshippers for the Adderley/Shepp double-bill whose Sunday matinee performance commenced shortly after a handful of Congregationalists had left their pews]</p>

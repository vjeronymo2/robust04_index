			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Public agencies, including 11 government ministries  and agencies and 17 public corporations, which grant contracts  on public works projects, held a liaison meeting and agreed to  be more strict in excluding from the list of possible bidders  the names of construction companies which have been found to be  guilty of indulging in corrupt practices and bid-rigging. The  decision was made to prevent recurrences of scandals related to  contract bids for public works projects. Ministries and  agencies plan to impose penalties based on the new standards  after next month. In addition, they plan to call on local  governments to follow suit.</p>

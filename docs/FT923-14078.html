			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Leading Article: G7 poverty 'I DON'T know that there's enough money in the world to solve the problems of the Russian economy,' said Mr George Bush in Munich yesterday after the summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries. He was right: money is only a part of the solution to Russia's problems. Mr Bush was also right in a broader and unintended sense. The leaders of the Group of Seven did demonstrate poverty in Munich. But it is not resources they lacked. It was vision. The G7 failed to rekindle the flame of global macro-economic co-ordination; it failed to promise anything new for Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union; it failed to bring urgency to the task of rendering the nuclear plants of the former Soviet Union any safer; and, despite Mr John Major's creditable efforts, it failed to bring a resolution of the impasse in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations closer. The meeting may not have done much harm, but could it not have done some positive good? More macro-economic co-ordination might not be appropriate, given the legitimate divergences among the G7. But on trade and the closely connected issues of assistance to the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe more should and could have been offered. Are the G7 nations really too poor? Their combined gross domestic products were a little less than Dollars 14 trillion in 1990. Total G7 government outlays in that year were more than Dollars 5 trillion, while total spending on defence, largely against the former Soviet Union, was about Dollars 500bn. Even in the case of the US, aggregate GDP has risen fourfold since the late 1940s, when it contributed a far higher share of GDP to the Marshall Plan than anything contemplated today. The resources are there. What is missing is the sense of priorities. The same applies to trade. This time the commitment offered in London in 1991 and the year before in Houston is missing. The G7 simply expects that 'an agreement can be reached before the end of 1992'. Anyone might well expect such a thing. But the G7 could ensure it, which is what makes the continued failure so depressing. The G7 calls on the countries of the world - not least those of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - to move to a market economy. In all these cases, the required adjustments have been very large. By comparison, the adjustments that would be imposed on the G7 countries by trade liberalisation far greater than on offer in the Uruguay Round would be relatively modest. The countries of the G7 do have the resources and the capacity to meet the by no means overwhelming challenges of today. But the leaders have not shown the need-ed ability to lead. If they continue to fail, it would not be surprising if the peoples of some of the G7 countries were to start looking for another bunch of leaders.</p>

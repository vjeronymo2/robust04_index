			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: Right way to achieve settlement on Cyprus Sir, Your editorial, 'Cyprus choice' (February 4) contains in itself a train of thought which is not conducive to a political settlement on the island. The aim should be to help both sides to come to terms with each other's vital concerns and this should be achieved through freely conducted face-to-face negotiations. The ensuring settlement must be acceptable to both sides. The settlement should not aim, as is suggested by your leader, at cornering one side or the other. ovul Tezisler, president, Turkish Journalists Association in London, First Floor, Suite 5-6, 320 Regent Street, London W1R 5AB</p>

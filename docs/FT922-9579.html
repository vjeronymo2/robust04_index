			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Travelers set back in first quarter TRAVELERS, the US composite insurer, has reported first-quarter profits of Dollars 63.1m after tax, down from Dollars 93.1m in the same period last year. The profit figure is struck after realised investment losses of Dollars 1.6m, against a loss of Dollars 2.4m in the first quarter of 1991. Travelers has been badly hit by souring property-related investments, and said a further Dollars 23m was added to reserves to cover potential real estate losses during the first three months of 1992. However, the insurer noted that overall earnings from the property-casualty operations were improved, 'driven by the continued turnaround in personal lines'. Profits from the life and pensions businesses continued to suffer from the real estate difficulties, while lower interest rates reduced net investment income across the board. Travelers said that the property environment had remained much as expected, and the under-performing portfolio increased to Dollars 5.1bn, compared with Dollars 4.9bn at the end of 1991. The real estate valuation reserves at the end of the first quarter were Dollars 856m. Net profits from the property-casualty commercial lines increased to Dollars 51.7m, compared with Dollars 42.5m a year ago, while personal lines turned in Dollars 19.2m, against Dollars 1.9m. Life, health and annuities made a net loss of Dollars 4.1m, against a Dollars 16.7m deficit a year earlier, while managed care/employee benefits produced Dollars 19.3m, against Dollars 30.4m a year ago.</p>

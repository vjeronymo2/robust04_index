The meeting comprehensively analyzed the new  situation and new tasks of the region's agriculture and animal  husbandry and the rural and pastoral work; fully affirmed the  achievements in agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and  pastoral work; set forth the 1994 basic tasks and fighting  targets; arranged the agricultural, livestock, and rural and  pastoral work; and urged the whole party and all people of the  region to be mobilized and make concerted efforts to create new  agricultural and livestock production levels. Wang Qun,  secretary of the regional party committee; and Wu Liji, Qian  Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang Zhan, deputy secretaries of the  regional party committee, made important instructions at the  meeting.    Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, pointed  out: The cadres and the people across the region should define  the thinking of welcoming the key year and creating a new  situation; unswervingly implement the guidelines of the central  rural work conference, the third plenary session of the 14th  party Central Committee, and the eighth (enlarged) plenary  session of the fifth regional party committee; strengthen the  extent of reform; work out and also implement perfect measures;  and create a new situation in agriculture, animal husbandry, and  rural and pastoral work. We should make the rural and pastoral  work suit the requirements for setting up the socialist market  economic system; take the market as an orientation and economic  results as the key; and develop high-yield, good-quality, and  high-efficient agriculture and animal husbandry. We should  bring into full play the might of "the primary productive  forces" and create conditions for science professionals and  technicians to build agriculture-science-education integrated  bases in rural and pastoral areas. It is necessary to quicken  the development of the secondary and tertiary industries and  promote the pace of becoming fairly well-off. It is necessary  to continuously implement the measures for reducing peasants and  herdsmen's burden, safeguard their interests, and mobilize their  enthusiasm. It is necessary to further support the poor. We  should adopt special measures to support the peasants and  herdsmen in the especially poverty-stricken areas and to help  them eliminate their difficulties. The party committees and  governments at various levels should strengthen the leadership  over agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and pastoral  work. All trades and professions and all departments should  work out perfect measures to support the development of  agriculture and animal husbandry. All levels should organize  cadres and send them deep to the forefront of agricultural and  livestock production, to grasp typical cases, and to conduct  investigations and study. The leading cadres should adopt the  forms of handling affairs on the spot to help the grass roots  and the masses tide over difficulties. We should mobilize the  forces of the whole party and the whole society and make  concerted efforts to elevate agriculture, animal husbandry, and  rural and pastoral work to a new high.    In line with the principle of stabilizing agriculture and  animal husbandry and increasing the income of the peasants and  the herdsmen and the spirit of "trying every possible means to  be fast and do more," the meeting defined the 1994 fighting  targets as follows: We should ensure to turn out 20 billion jin  of grain and strive to reach 23 billion jin, ensure to produce  56.6 million head of animals and strive to reach 57 million  head, ensure to afforest on 5 million mu of land and strive to  afforest on 5.5 million mu of land, and ensure that the output  value of town and township enterprises should reach 28 billion  yuan and strive to have their output value surpass 30 billion  yuan. The per capita net income of the peasants and the  herdsmen should increase 100 yuan over 1993. To ensure the  realization of these targets, we should deepen reform, stabilize  policies, and strengthen the construction of grass-roots  organizations, and achieve success in strengthening the  construction of the agricultural and livestock infrastructural  facilities, readjusting the economic structures of rural and  pastoral areas, quickening the development of town and township  enterprises, and perfecting the socialized service system.</p>

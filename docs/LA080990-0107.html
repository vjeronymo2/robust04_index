			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO SEEK SUPPORT OF SYRIA, IRAN;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: BAKER COMMENDS TURKEY FOR CLOSING IRAQI PIPELINE AND FREEZING KUWAITI  ASSETS. HE HINTS HE WILL ASK ANKARA TO PLAY A GREATER ROLE.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, flying to enlist the Turkish government  in a growing drive against Iraq, announced Wednesday that the United States is  contacting Syria and Iran about the possibility of cooperating in the global  effort.  </P> <P> Speaking with reporters on his way to a refueling stop at this base in the  Azores, Baker said he will dispatch Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly to  Syria to explore with President Hafez Assad the possibility of U.S.-Syrian  action against Iraq, long a bitter rival of the government in Damascus.  </P> <P> Baker also said that the United States has contacted Iran through its regular  "third country" channel to discuss possible Iranian action. Iran and Iraq  fought an inconclusive eight-year war that ended in a cease-fire two years ago  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The possibility of coordinated action with Syria, a radical Arab state with  which Washington has long maintained the most chilly of relations, would be  remarkable. And U.S. relations with Iran have been frozen since the 1979  Islamic revolution, in which more than 50 Americans were seized and held  hostage.  </P> <P> For years, the U.S. government has included Syria on its list of nations that  support international terrorism. Iraq was removed from the list several years  ago.  </P> <P> "John Kelly is going to Damascus in order to explore these questions with  Syria," Baker said. "We're all aware of the history of Syrian-Iraqi relations."  </P> <P> Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival branches of the Arab Baath Party, and  relations between the regimes have been tense for years.  </P> <P> Baker, who stressed Turkey's strategic importance as the site of the most  sophisticated military bases bordering Iraq, is expected to assure Ankara today  of firm military and financial support if it goes along.  </P> <P> He said he is "very pleased" with Turkey's decision to stop the flow of Iraqi  oil through a Turkish pipeline. But he hinted that he will ask Turkey to do  even more when he meets with President Turgut Ozal and other leaders.  </P> <P> "We have been particularly pleased with the forthright position that Turkey has  taken," Baker said. "They have closed the Iraqi pipeline; they have frozen  Kuwaiti assets. I am going to Turkey to ensure the continued close coordination  between Turkey and the United States, to let the Turkish government know that  they will continue to have our strong support and the support of the NATO  alliance."  </P> <P> He said he planned to emphasize NATO's doctrine of "collective defense," in  which an attack on Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, would  be considered to be an attack on all 16 members of the alliance.  </P> <P> Although Baker declined to say if he would suggest the use of Turkish bases for  possible military action against Iraq, he repeatedly emphasized Turkey's  "strategic location" on the Iraqi border.  </P> <P> A ranking State Department official aboard Baker's aircraft said Turkey would  be compensated for giving up an estimated $5 million a day in revenue from  operation of the pipeline.  </P> <P> "I think a way can be found to assure that Turkey will not suffer out-of-pocket  financial losses as a result of what they might do," said the official, who  declined to be identified.  </P> <P> The official said the U.S. government would not "foot the bill" for the Turkish  aid, and he implied that most of it would come from billions of dollars in  blocked Kuwaiti assets in the United States, Turkey and other countries. He  said the action would "respond to the wishes of what we consider the legitimate  government of Kuwait," which was deposed by the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> Baker, who will go from Ankara to Brussels to brief NATO representatives  Friday, said the crisis created by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait marks the start  of the post-Cold War era, in which the alliance, formed 43 years ago to counter  the Soviet Union, must now face threats "from a different direction."  </P> <P> In the past, NATO members have been reluctant to project allied power beyond  Europe, although some member nations have joined in military action outside of  the normal NATO area.  </P> <P> Baker also said he has spoken by telephone to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze on a daily basis since the crisis erupted last week.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union has been very supportive of our condemnation of the Iraqi  aggression," Baker said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Baker said the arms and oil embargo on Iraq that was voted Monday by  the U.N. Security Council has obtained so much support from the world's  governments that it has become "somewhat self-enforcing." He said the level of  compliance may preclude the necessity of mounting a naval blockade of the  Persian Gulf to prevent Iraqi oil from getting through.  </P> <P> The ranking official predicted that, following some initial hesitation, a  substantial number of Arab states would join in the U.S.-led effort to isolate  Iraq. He said at least six Arab nations have agreed to participate in the  multinational force in Saudi Arabia.  </P></p>

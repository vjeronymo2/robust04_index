			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Bank of Italy deputy awaits his blessing Divisions within the government of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi are holding up the approval of Mr Vincenzo Desario as the new director of the Bank of Italy. In an unprecedented move by an Italian government, the right-wing coalition has refused to welcome the nomination on Monday by the bank's governing council of Mr Desario, currently the deputy-director, to take over the number two job. Instead the government has deliberately chosen to take its time. The matter was not discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting. Mr Gianni Letta, the head of the prime minister's office, said the matter would be discussed at the next cabinet meeting and insisted that the government was united in the view that an external candidate would have been preferred. Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League and a key member of the coalition, said when asked about the delay: 'It was a choice made autonomously by the Bank of Italy and which doesn't seem to please the government nor the perhaps the treasury, with whom the bank has to work.' Mr Desario was chosen on the advice of Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, to take up the position vacated by Mr Lamberto Dini, when he left in May to become treasury minister. Mr Fazio insisted on an internal candidate and after five months' wrangling appeared to have brokered a deal last weekend with the government via the good offices of Mr Guiseppe Tatarella, the deputy prime minister and leading member of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance in the coalition. The choice of Mr Desario has been openly backed by MSI/National Alliance and the Christian Democratic Centre, the smallest group in the coalition. The League has wavered and Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia have been silent. Mr Berlusconi and more particularly Mr Dini, are reportedly still reluctant to accept the bank's ability to choose the members of the four-man directorate. From the start, Mr Berlusconi has made it clear he regards this as a separate issue from the central bank's autonomy. The Desario appointment requires the endorsement of both President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the cabinet. The president is understood to support Mr Fazio. The government thus has three main courses of action: simply delay to display disapproval; delay and issue a statement of censure; reject the appointment. Political analysts doubted yesterday whether there was sufficient consensus in the government to refuse the appointment as this would exacerbate the conflict with the Bank of Italy and antagonise President Scalfaro. It would also unnerve the markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Husni Mubarak by Ursula Stenzel: </F> place and date not given -- recorded, Mubarak statements in  English with superimposed German translation]    [Text] [Stenzel] Your Excellency, Egypt has played an  eminent role in the Middle East process since the Camp David  accord. Particularly in the past few days you and your  government have been once more in the center of attention of  Middle East diplomacy. What are the reasons for the optimism  that Israel and the PLO will now achieve a breakthrough?    [Mubarak] First of all, I would like to point out that the  first courageous step that opened the door to an overall  solution was made by President Al-Sadat. Without his courageous  step we would not have achieved a solution and not even any  contact between the parties to the conflict to this day. As far  as the Gaza-Jericho agreement is concerned, a problem that has  existed for 45 years, it is not easy to implement it within a  week, or two or three months. The two sides are facing problems,  but I am optimistic that they will reach agreement, although the  problems will continue. Still, these problems will be overcome,  because there is no alternative to negotiations. That is a fact.    [Stenzel] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  has been delayed. Demilitarization had been put off before, now  the two sides have agreed on 13 April. Do you think that this  deadline can be kept?    [Mubarak] The negotiations will be concluded swiftly.  Whether it is the 13th or not is not a problem. The point is  to conclude an agreement and start implementing it. There are  differences of opinion between the Palestinians and the  Israelis. In the declaration of principles it was mentioned  that security remains in the hands of the Israelis -- at least  until a final agreement is reached. Now the Palestinians want  to carry out all checks on Palestinians coming to Gaza or  Jericho themselves. Yet, the Israelis say that anybody passing  through these checks could then go anywhere in Israel. Still, I  think that this problem will be solved.    [Stenzel] Mr. President, as there was no Camp David without  Egypt, there will not be a new agreement without the Syrians.  How close is Syria to being integrated in the peace process?  So far, one had the impression that Syria was more or less  hesitating.    [Mubarak] No, Syria is not hesitating. I had several talks  with President Al-Asad, with the Israelis but also with all  other countries. I think, and I hope that the negotiations that  are currently being held in Washington will yield a result in  the immediate future. Syria is anxious to solve the problem and  to sign a peace treaty, also with the inclusion of Jordan.    [Stenzel] Will there be a summit meeting between President  al-Asad and Prime Minister Rabin?    [Mubarak] I think that, initially, al-Asad will not agree to  such a meeting. Only after they achieve something will they  meet -- certainly sometime in the future. The point is that the  Syrians want an agreement.    [Stenzel] And at what price? The return of the entire Golan  Heights? Do you think that Israel will be prepared to agree to  that?    [Mubarak] Well, I cannot speak on behalf of Israel, but I  can say that in order to reach a settlement with Syria, Golan  must be returned. There may be certain conditions, such as a  demilitarized zone, some multinational troops. This will not be  the problem.    [Stenzel] Mr. President, what is the use of the best peace  agreement when fundamentalism destabilizes the entire region?    [Mubarak] Look, you in Europe and in the United States, who  live far away from this area, have your own assessment of the  situation that does not coincide with the realities of the area.  So many people claim that Egypt has a problem with  fundamentalism like Algeria. I do not want to talk about  Algeria, but you must not compare Egypt with another country.  Egypt has a 7,000-year-old civilization, Egypt has its roots  here, Egypt is a strong country. We are in control of all these  things. It happens, of course, sometimes that some  fundamentalists, some extremists who were in Afghanistan while  the Soviets were there and were trained there, and who were  financed by other countries, are trying to destabilize the  situation here. I think that this is very difficult. If you  talk about fundamentalism in the entire region and the danger  that emanates from it for the peace process, then I have to say  that I do not believe it. The further they advance, the less  room the fundamentalists will find for creating problems.    [Stenzel] Are you not under pressure of time? Is there not  a danger that radicalism will increase the longer people have to  wait for real peace in the Middle East and do not benefit from  it, economically and socially?    [Mubarak] The danger is that one has to deal with all these  criminals, thus neglecting the economic reform. Only then will  the situation become more complicated. We are not doing that.  We are pushing forward economic reform because only in that way  can we improve the people's standard of living. Only if we were  to freeze this economic development and concentrate exclusively  on fundamentalism would the economic situation deteriorate, and,  thus, encourage fundamentalism.    [Stenzel] There might be another danger to the peace process  by a possible change of government in Israel.    [Mubarak] Mr. Rabin and the Labor Party understand the  situation very well. Besides, we signed the peace agreement  with Menahim Begin. Once an agreement is signed between the  Palestinians and Israel, between Israel and Syria, I think that  even the Likud opposition, if it were to take over power, would  respect these agreements.    [Stenzel] Last but not least, what do you expect from the  visit to Egypt by Austrian President Klestil?    [Mubarak] We have had excellent relations with Austria since  the time of Bruno Kreisky. I had more than 10 meetings with him  in Vienna, and we received him in Cairo. We have traditional  relations with Austria. We will discuss bilateral issues with  the Austrian president, the support of the Middle East process  by Austria, because Austria used to play a very active role  regarding the Palestinian problem. We expect to discuss many  problems of the area, questions of cooperation, what could be  done for the peace process.    [Stenzel] Recently, Norway instead of Austria played an  important role as a promoter of dialogue between Israel and the  PLO. Could you imagine Austria resuming an important role in  this connection?    [Mubarak] Austria is capable of playing an eminent role. I  wonder why the strong, active role of the Kreisky era was not  continued. We had contacts with Austria, we will inform the  country of the peace process, and I think Austria could play a  very important role.    [Stenzel] A more active one.    [Mubarak] Yes, for sure.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: GM 'on track' for turnround General Motors, the US carmaker, 'remains on track' for a financial turnround, according to Mr John Smith, chief executive and president, agencies report. 'Although we were not satisfied with our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our fundamental turnround strategies are sound, and we are on track to achieve them,' he told a meeting of Canadian car suppliers that serve GM's operations. GM announced a net profit of Dollars 552m in the third quarter, a big improvement from the year-earlier loss of Dollars 113m. In North America, however, the company lost Dollars 328m in the period, surprising analysts who had expected a much smaller loss. Mr Smith attributed the loss to new-model start-ups, production losses related to strikes at two North American facilities, and higher engineering costs related to GM's 'aggressive product programmes'. However, he added that: 'We've restructured and consolidated operations, reduced the number of employees, and realigned our product programmes. We're redoubling our cost-cutting efforts and focusing on making fundamental improvements in our operating efficiency.' Highlighting some of the company's 'encouraging factors', Mr Smith noted that total GM vehicle sales in Canada and the US were up 7.9 per cent in the first 10 months, compared with a year ago. He also said that GM had increased market share in the third quarter of 1994 and for the 1994 model year, 'even with intense competition and the capacity constraints that limited production of some of our key models'. GM's consolidated net income improved in both the third quarter and the first nine months compared with the same periods last year, Mr Smith said, adding that net income at nine months had increased by Dollars 2bn from a year ago.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEST TORRANCE HIGH FOOTBALL FORTUNES SACKED FOR A BIG LOSS;  </P> <P> PREPS: ALL-OCEAN LEAGUE QUARTERBACK JOHN WALSH PLANS TO TRANSFER TO CARSON FOR  SENIOR SEASON.  </P> <P> The dejected look on John Black's face this week mirrored the mood of the West  Torrance High football team.  </P> <P> "We're in shock," said the West co-coach, shaking his head.  </P> <P> Black and his partner, Mark Knox, were still trying to come to grips with the  loss of John Walsh, the Warriors' All-Ocean League quarterback. The West  coaches learned Monday that Walsh, one of the South Bay's top players, plans to  transfer to Carson High for his senior season.  </P> <P> "I couldn't sleep (Monday) night," Black said. "Mark and I are just devastated  by this."  </P> <P> Walsh and his father, also named John, refused to comment on the report, saying  it was only a rumor. But the West coaches said they were informed by the  Walshes that the quarterback will transfer to Carson, where he hopes to improve  his chance of being recruited by a major college.  </P> <P> "(Walsh Sr.) feels that John will get more exposure at Carson and build up  better stats," Knox said. "I hope it works out for him. He's sacrificed quite a  bit. He's alienated all of his friends on the team."  </P> <P> The 6-3, 190-pound Walsh passed for 1,700 yards and 17 touchdowns last season,  helping West to a 10-2 record, the Ocean League title and the second round of  the Southern Section Division VII playoffs. During three seasons on the West  freshman, sophomore and varsity squads, his teams were 27-3.  </P> <P> The situation is similar to one in 1988, when All-L.A. City quarterback Perry  Klein transferred from Palisades High to Carson for his senior season and  helped the Colts to the 4-A Division title. Like Klein, Walsh receives  one-on-one coaching from Steve Clarkson, a former Carson assistant coach who  works with several of the Southland's premier quarterbacks, including Todd  Marinovich of USC.  </P> <P> "It's Perry Klein all over again," said a disgusted David Snakenborg, a senior  tight end and linebacker for West.  </P> <P> The West co-coaches said they believe Clarkson used his influence as a personal  coach to persuade Walsh to transfer. Clarkson, who was a member of the Carson  coaching staff for one season in 1988, denied the allegation.  </P> <P> "I don't make decisions for people," he said. "I'm sure they are hurt (at West)  and looking for someone to blame. But that's not my business. All I do is teach  technical skills.  </P> <P> "It's kind of ridiculous. People have been transferring in and out of Carson  for years, but the only time it seems to be an issue is when it's a  quarterback."  </P> <P> Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said he has not talked to the Walshes, but  confirmed that Walsh Sr. met with Carson Assistant Principal Dick Mattingly  last month about the possibility of his son's transferring to the school.  </P> <P> "He wanted to know the legality of his son transferring if he gets a separation  from his wife," said Vollnogle, who will retire after the 1990 season. "Dr.  Mattingly said he would not accept a separation, but he did say that if divorce  papers were filed and the father and son moved into the district, (Walsh) would  be eligible.  </P> <P> "The whole thing depends if the parents split up. They have to file the papers  and go through the courts to get it done. Once that's done, what can you do?  This kind of stuff goes on all the time."  </P> <P> Knox, however, said that West plans to launch an investigation.  </P> <P> "It might look like sour grapes when we start pointing fingers, but we're  definitely going to look into the Carson situation because I don't think they  are totally innocent," he said. "We're not out to get John, but we're going to  look into the actions of representatives of the Carson program."  </P> <P> The situation is stirring the same emotions as two years ago, when Klein  transferred to Carson after a record-breaking junior season at Palisades.  </P> <P> The Kleins, who live in Malibu, rented an apartment in Carson, presumably so  Danny Klein, Perry's father, could live closer to his surplus electronics  business in Gardena during the week. After the football season, though, the  family gave up the apartment and Klein transferred to Santa Monica High.  </P> <P> Klein, a redshirt freshman at UC Berkeley, answered the phone at Clarkson's  Laguna Hills home Tuesday. He said Walsh has a good chance of becoming Carson's  starting quarterback because the player being groomed for the job, Tarriel  Hopper, is better suited to play strong safety, the position he played last  season. The Colts were L.A. City 4-A runners-up in 1989.  </P> <P> "If I were (Walsh), I would like to be in his situation," Klein said. "He will  be the only guy. He'll be able to rack up a lot of statistics. I don't think  Hopper wants to play quarterback. I just think he's playing it because there's  no other quarterbacks at Carson.  </P> <P> "I've been working out at Carson and Tarriel is there sometimes. He's all  right. He's a good quarterback. But I don't think that's what he's going to  play in college."  </P> <P> Vollnogle and Clarkson, though, said they are pleased with the progress of  Hopper, a 6-3, 210-pound senior whose older brother, Darrel, was a standout at  Carson and USC. Hopper also receives personalized coaching from Clarkson.  </P> <P> The area where Walsh has a clear advantage over Hopper is experience.  </P> <P> "I've seen him throw the ball and he's very, very good," said Vollnogle, who  has watched Walsh play in passing-league games. "He has experience, too. He's  not someone brand new."  </P> <P> Asked if Walsh will become Carson's quarterback if he transfers, Vollnogle  said: "He could be."  </P> <P> While players have transferred to Carson for many years, the loss of a  high-profile player at West is regarded as a unique occurrence.  </P> <P> "We've lost kids who have legitimately moved, but this is definitely the first  time for this," Knox said. "We've had a lot of kids who tried to get into West  that we couldn't take. We've never had anybody leave like this."  </P> <P> Knox said West's players were angered by the news.  </P> <P> "They're very bitter," he said. "They're shocked like we were. They've been a  real close group for three years. A lot of them have played Pop Warner  together. It's not only a hard pill for the program, but it's probably put a  dent in a lot of friendships."  </P> <P> Walsh, who last played with West Sunday in the L.A. Games, had assumed the role  of team captain in spring football and was expected to be the leader of a  Warrior team considered a favorite for the 1990 Pioneer League title.  </P> <P> Walsh will be replaced at quarterback by Steve Sarkisian, a 6-0, 175-pound  junior who led the sophomore team to an 8-1 record last season.  </P> <P> "We're still going to be a winner," Knox said. "We're just starting way behind  because we thought John was going to be our quarterback. But we'll be OK. We'll  still give people headaches."  </P> <P> This week, though, West was feeling all the pain.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA USES DEFENSE TO DEFEAT USF, 113-95  </P> <P> West Coast Athletic Conference play opened Wednesday, and the University of San  Francisco tried to hold Loyola Marymount to a moderate pace.  </P> <P> So, the Lions introduced a new wrinkle: A tough defense to go with its vaunted  offense. The result was a 113-95 victory over the Dons before a crowd of 3,286  at Gersten Pavilion.  </P> <P> The Lions' pressure defense helped them overcome an early deficit and win their  16th consecutive regular-season conference game.  </P> <P> Loyola is 7-5 overall, USF 8-6.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers led Loyola with 36 points. Enoch Simmons scored 20 and Jeff Fryer  17, including 2 3-pointers late in the game that helped put it away.  </P> <P> Forward Joel DeBortoli led USF with 30 points, including 21 in the second half,  but star center Mark McCathrion had a subpar 6 points.  </P> <P> "I didn't like the pace of the game, especially the first 8 or 9 minutes,"  Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "We had to do it off our defense. Pressure  defense makes sure we get enough (offensive) runs. When you press, you  neutralize the star (McCathrion)."  </P> <P> USF was coming off an upset of Notre Dame in which it turned the ball over only  8 times. The Lions forced 25 turnovers, 15 after halftime. They outscored USF,  64-56, in the second half, a margin more to their liking.  </P> <P> "Their pressure bothered us, no question about it," Don Coach Jim Brovelli  said. "We made a little run, then they hit the 3-pointers that put it away.  They forced us to make the mistakes."  </P> <P> USF had control for much of the first half. Loyola lost a 20-13 lead as the  Dons went ahead, 25-24, on Scott McWhorter's 18-foot jumper. McWhorter's  rebound shot made it 27-24.  </P> <P> That seemed to stimulate the Lions, whose press began to force turnovers and  produce fast-break baskets.  </P> <P> Paced by Gathers and Simmons, the Lions went on a 17-6 run to gain a 43-33 lead  with 1:39 left in the half. Simmons had 10 points in the span.  </P> <P> The Lions maintained the double-figure lead at halftime, 49-39, a relatively  modest output for them. Gathers had 16 points and Simmons 13.  </P> <P> But the tempo picked up in the second half behind Loyola's defense. The Lions  opened the half with a 14-8 run and were ahead, 63-47, just 4 minutes into the  half.  </P> <P> The lead increased to 85-63 as Loyola began connecting on 3-point shots -- with  6 after halftime -- and the Dons continued to make turnovers. Loyola broke 100  points with 2:44 left.  </P> <P> "Not bad for an opener," Westhead said.  </P> <P> The Lions play host to Santa Clara at 7:30 tonight in a matchup of two  conference favorites.  </P></p>

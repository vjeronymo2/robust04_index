			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria, RSA, 21 Jun (AE) -- South African  President Nelson Mandela today received Workers Party [PT]  presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The black  leader received Lula with a broad smile as if he were an old  friend, and treated him as a president-elect. They praised each  other during brief statements to the media after the meeting.  Mandela expressed support for Lula and showed interest in his  election. Lula referred to the South African leader as "one of  the great personalities of this century." The meeting should  have had taken place on 20 June, but when Lula arrived in the  Union Hill Palace at the scheduled time, he was not received by  Mandela. An adviser informed him that Mandela could not receive  him because of a slight ailment.    This was the third meeting between Mandela and Lula. They  met in Tripoli and in Havana. After speaking about the  situation in South Africa Mandela wanted to know about Brazilian  politics and economy. He asked about the situation of the  Brazilian people before the elections. Lula told him about the  election campaign, the Real Plan, and the social reality in the  country. He criticized what he calls "social-economic  apartheid" in Brazil and promised to combat it if elected with  "measures in the field of education, labor, and housing." The  South African leader told Lula his plans to combat problems  similar to the Brazilian ones.    They also spoke about bilateral relations, especially trade.  Mandela discussed the subject as if Lula had already won the  elections. He said he wanted to visit Brazil as soon as Lula is  installed. He then offered to discuss any subject of bilateral  interest.    At the end of the meeting Mandela accompanied Lula and  Brazilian Ambassador to the RSA Antonio Amaral de Sampaio to  another room where CUT [Sole Workers Center] leader Vicente  Paulo da Silva, Deputy Benedita da Silva, and PT campaign  coordinator Professor Marco Aurelio Garcia were waiting. Soon  afterward they all went to the stairs of the Union Hill Palace  where Lula and Mandela made brief statements.    Following the meeting in Union Hill Palace, Lula, the  ambassador, and his delegation boarded a plane at noon to Cape  Town where Lula is scheduled to dine with other South African  government officials. The host is Minister Without Portfolio Jay  Naidoo, who is responsible for the Development and  Reconstruction Program (DRP). Through this program Mandela  intends to build 1 million houses over five years, create 2.5  million new jobs, and guarantee 10 years of basic and higher  education.    A constituent assembly will be formed on 22 June in Cape  Town. Late in the afternoon Lula and his delegation will return  to Johannesburg and board an plane that will take them to  Frankfurt, Germany, the second leg of his trip.</p>

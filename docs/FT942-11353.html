			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: France trims key interest rate The Bank of France yesterday took a further step in its policy of edging interest rates lower, trimming the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, by 10 basis points to 5.6 per cent. The move was the third in three weeks and is consistent with the central bank's policy of gradually lowering borrowing costs to support emerging economic recovery. Inflation, currently at an annualised rate of about 1.5 per cent, poses little constraint. The Bank of France has been tracking the downward trend in German interest rates and is targeting the Bundesbank's repo rate. Yesterday's cut brought the margin above the repo rate to just under 0.2 percentage points. The Paris stock market welcomed the move. The CAC-40 index of leading shares doubled its morning gains following the news, closing up 0.98 per cent at 2,162. The French franc took the rate cut in its stride, trading at about FFr3.428 to the D-Mark. John Ridding, Paris. The Polish finance minister, Mr Grzgorz Kolodko, said yesterday the country was on course for minimum growth in the economy of 4 per cent this year, and forecast that 4.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent could be achieved. Car deliveries in Italy fell by 2.8 per cent in April year-on-year against a 1.5 per cent rise in March, the carmakers' association, Anfia, said. Anfia said 169,945 cars were sold in Italy last month, against 174,758 in the same period last year. Spain's official currency reserves fell Dollars 126.1m to Dollars 44.73bn in April from March, according to provisional figures released by the Bank of Spain.</p>

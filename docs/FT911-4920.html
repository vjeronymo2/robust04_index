			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Square D 'ignoring will of investors' says Schneider SQUARE D, the Illinois electrical products maker, is counting on several important obstacles to thwart Schneider's bid to gain control of the company. Schneider of France announced this week it had been tendered 78.1 per cent of Square D's shares and extended its hostile tender offer of Dollars 78 per share, or Dollars 1.9bn, until May 3. Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, Schneider chairman, said Square D was neglecting its shareholders' will by refusing to remove barriers to the transaction. First, Square D's board would have to waive the company's obligation under the strict hostile takeover law of Delaware, where it is incorporated. Under that law, a hostile bidder for a company must acquire at least 85 per cent of the shares. The board would also have to lift a poison pill provision that makes a takeover prohibitively expensive. However, it refuses to remove these conditions, effectively preventing Schneider from purchasing the tendered shares. Schneider has launched a proxy fight to change the board at the company's annual meeting on May 24. The large amount of tendered shares would appear to enhance Schneider's proxy efforts, but the path is hardly clear even if it succeeds in obtaining the required simple majority of proxy votes. Schneider's first slate of nominees for the Square D board is the subject of a lawsuit in which Square D alleges the candidates would violate the interlocking directorates provision of US anti-trust statutes. A hearing in the US District Court of New York is due on May 13.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Leading Article: India needs faster reform WHEN Mr Manmohan Singh was appointed India's finance minister during a payments crisis in 1991, he said: 'We in this country have to wake up to the harsh realities of this new world.' His economic reforms have begun to dismantle isolationist barriers, as well as improving India's creditworthiness and easing the bureaucratic stranglehold on business. But as he prepares his third budget to be delivered on February 27, Mr Singh still faces enormous tasks. Though the economy is turning upwards and inflation is falling, exports and foreign investment are disappointing. Moreover, the budget will launch a session of parliament likely to be turbulent for the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao. The prime minister's uncertain handling of the Ayodhya temple dispute has left his government lacking direction. A January cabinet reshuffle carried no message, wasting an opportunity to restore leadership. Just as financial crisis provided initial justification for economic reform, so the political malaise provides a platform for Mr Singh's budget. He can recreate an identity for the government by decisive action to open the economy further. Among the steps he should take are sharp cuts in tariffs, including those on capital goods needed to develop infrastructure and export industries; a shift of tax revenues away from customs duties to new sources such as a value added tax; and reform of the financial system, including cuts in subsidised lending, more efficient management of state-owned banks, reorganisation of their balance sheets and injections of new capital. Mr Singh also needs to prove that he can make the public sector shrink, while giving those who run the administration and state corporations greater flexibility to manage their staff. Recent disturbances may mean the time is not right for full convertibility of the rupee, but this should be achieved as soon as possible. All these measures are politically charged. But all are necessary if Mr Singh is to proceed with reform. The international climate remains fair for India. The British business leaders who travelled with Mr John Major last week were given a convincing picture of the opportunities. The settlement of India's dispute with Russia on debt payments improves the prospects for the balance of payments and for export markets. India continues to receive substantial aid commitments. However, foreigners must question how much reform means when aid commitments for badly-needed infrastructure projects are not utilised because of a lack of Indian counterpart funds. Investment projects cleared by one ministry can be blocked by another. Foreign business people must pay more than Indians for hotel rooms and domestic airline tickets. Even a request for installation of a telephone line in reasonable time must go to the minister for communications. Mr Singh has the opportunity to erode significantly the mentality which creates such frustrations. As a technocrat rather than a career politician, he can be bolder than his colleagues might be. He could even, as the fruits of reform pass into the economy, prove to be his party's saviour.</p>

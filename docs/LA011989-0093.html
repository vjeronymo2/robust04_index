			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL SEGUNDO CITES HOTEL FOR 70 SAFETY VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> A lengthy investigation by fire officials has uncovered more than 70 fire and  safety code violations at the landmark Hacienda Hotel in El Segundo.  </P> <P> Managers of the 640-room hotel -- most of which was built between 30 and 35  years ago -- say they have already corrected many of the violations and have  been working to comply with the city codes.  </P> <P> The El Segundo Fire Department has ordered the hotel to respond to the findings  by Monday and provide a timetable for correcting the problems, Fire Chief  Robert Marsh said.  </P> <P> "I do not consider the hotel unsafe to occupy," Marsh said in an interview. "It  is just that we have had mounting concerns over a long period of time over some  areas we believe need to be updated."  </P> <P> Some of the violations are highly technical and will be corrected when the  hotel finishes installing sprinklers in all four of its buildings, Marsh said.  The south and west towers already have sprinklers, and hotel managers say they  expect to have sprinklers the other buildings by mid-1990.  </P> <P> Hacienda executives estimated that 30% of the 74 violations were corrected  before the hotel was informed of the Fire Department's findings last month.  They said the hotel is working on the remainder.  </P> <P> "It is a very confusing and frustrating situation for us because we don't  understand why there is such a big push from the city when they know we are  correcting all these concerns," said Frank Godoy, Hacienda's vice president and  manager.  </P> <P> Marsh said: "We want to have an organized plan to bring them into compliance.  That's what we are really after."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Violations  </P> <P> In addition to the 74 violations, the hotel was informed in November of about  50 violations that investigators thought could be resolved quickly, such as too  few fire extinguishers at some locations. Marsh said most of those violations  have been corrected.  </P> <P> Godoy said the city has known for some time that the hotel has been working to  bring its buildings up to code. He said the hotel has been waiting for the city  Planning Department to approve architectural plans aimed at correcting some of  the problems.  </P> <P> In addition, under a plan approved by city officials last year, the hotel has  finished installing sprinklers in its west tower. The south tower has had  sprinklers since it was built in 1979, and work will begin soon on the north  tower and the main building, Godoy said.  </P> <P> Hotel officials and Marsh agreed that some of the violations are the result of  hotel add-ons built over the years under different city codes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fair Amount of Problems'  </P> <P> "Any hotel that that is 30-plus years old is going to have a fair amount of  problems," Marsh said, "particularly if the hotel has been added onto and  revamped over the years."  </P> <P> Marsh said fire officials do not classify the code violations as minor. Some  will take significant structural work to correct, such as inadequate fire  walls, faulty insulation around electrical wiring and several exits that need  to be widened or relocated, he said.  </P> <P> Also, some guest rooms are not equipped with proper smoke ventilation systems  or fire-resistant doors, Marsh said.  </P> <P> Although violations were found in all four buildings at the Hacienda, more than  30 were in the main building where the hotel's two restaurants and ballrooms  are located, fire officials said.  </P></p>

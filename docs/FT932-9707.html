			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Money easy in quiet day A QUIET day on the UK money markets saw overnight money drift down to 4 per cent, and interbank rates slightly firmer. Dealers said there was little reaction to reports that the government's backbenchers were pushing for a cabinet reshuffle following the Conservative party's disastrous performance in local elections last week. There was also considerable scepticism that the chancellor would be replaced. 'Many of us wonder what the point of replacing him would be,' said one dealer. 'Things are a mess, but most of the mess was created so long ago that it is not really relevant to the present situation.' A statement from the prime minister that he had 'not even begun' to contemplate any changes to his cabinet made little difference to sentiment. With dealers not yet convinced about the strength of economic recovery, many expect the government to cut base rates again at some stage over the summer. They are not, however, pushing their case particularly strongly and the three-month interbank rate - a good guide to where the market thinks base rates will be in three months' time - remained fairly steady at about 6 per cent. One dealer commented that speculation of an early rate cut to boost the government's standing was premature. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn in the morning which was partially relieved in the early round after the Bank provided liquidity of Pounds 702m. The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.4bn. Further operations, in which the Bank purchased Pounds 700m of bills, removed the shortage in the afternoon. There was no late assistance. Overnight rates started the day at about 5 1/2 per cent, declining later to 5 1/4 per cent and ending at about 4 per cent. Further out, three-month money rates were slightly firmer at 6 per cent on the offered side and 5 7/8 per cent on the bid side. The June sterling futures contract hit a high of 94.06 before finishing the day at 94.05. Although the September contract dipped to a low of 94.10, it firmed over the day to end a net two basis points higher at 94.16. German call money was unchanged from the previous day's level of 7.75 per cent in quiet trade, with the market expecting another small cut in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase rates this week.</p>

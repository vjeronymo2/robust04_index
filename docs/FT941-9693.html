			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Eight groups hope to be a lucky winner: The companies bidding for the right to run the National Lottery One of the biggest sweepstakes in British history gets under way on Monday - the battle for the right to run the National Lottery, an enterprise that could become a Pounds 4bn-a-year business. So far eight runners have publicly declared themselves although at least two other potential bidders have sent letters of intent to the National Lottery Office. Mr Richard Branson is expected to deliver the bid from his non-profitmaking UK Lottery Foundation with the help of Desert Orchid, the racehorse. The National Lottery's director-general, Mr Peter Davis, who must make the choice, already feels lucky. 'I think we are going to have a number of really good applications which means that there is real competition and a good result for the good causes,' said Mr Davis. About 50 per cent of the National Lottery revenues are expected to go on prizes - including a top prize that could be more than Pounds 5m a week. Twelve per cent will go in tax and between 15 per cent and 17 per cent on total operating costs of which between 2 per cent and 3 per cent could be profit for the operator. The rest, which could approach Pounds 1bn when the lottery is mature, will be split equally between the arts, charities, national heritage, a fund to mark the millenium, and sport. Mr Davis's decision - once he is satisfied of each bidder's probity, security, taste and viability - could turn on fractions of percentage points of overall revenue going to the good causes. Ask the bidders themselves who they believe their main rivals are and the two names mentioned most frequently are Camelot and the Rank Organisation. Camelot, run by Mr Tim Holly, brings together five companies with relevant experience - Cadbury Schweppes, to find the retail outlets, De La Rue, the security printers, ICL, which will provide computer terminals, Racal, the network management company and G-Tech, the lottery equipment company. In contrast, Mr Michael Gifford at the Rank Organisation is running his bid in-house and pulling in his services - including Automated Wagering International of the US, the main G-Tech rival - by competitive tender. The single-company approach and Rank's casino interests may be controversial. Three other names are mentioned as threats by their rivals - The Great British Lottery Company, Games For Good Causes and the NM Rothschild/Tattersalls consortium. The approach of The Great British Lottery Company - Granada, Associated Newspapers, Hambros, Carlton Communications and Vodafone in partnership with AWI - is remarkably similar to that of Camelot. GBLC will probably have already spent Pounds 2m on its bid by Monday. Games for Good Causes - run by Mr Malcom Hughes, former managing director of Vernons Pools - brings together Ladbroke and MAI, the television and financial services group. One third of the equity will be provided by institutions. It is unclear whether the Ladbroke connection will help or hinder. Rothschilds and Tattersalls, for the moment a 50-50 joint venture, although a lot of institutional support is already in place, is a dark horse that could come through. With the backing of Rothschilds the business plan should add up and Tattersalls of Australia has a long record in lotteries. The orthodox businesspeople in the other consortia tend to underrate the threat posed by The Richard Branson-Lord Young UK Lottery Foundation, which plans to give all its profits to charity. They admire Mr Branson's flair for publicity and have had to shave a little extra off their profits and offer more to good causes - just in case. With IBM putting its name behind the foundation as technology partner the bid cannot be dismissed as hot air. It is particularly difficult to put any odds on the bid from The Tote, the pooled on-course betting organisation backed by Lord Weinstock and GEC and Thorn EMI. There is betting experience and industrial muscle, but rivals place it down the field. Rainbow, the consortium chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BTR, has in effect ruled itself out as contender for the main operating licence by announcing it was only interested in the off-line part of the lottery - scratch cards. The winner might like to talk to Rainbow about sub-contracting some of its scratch-card operations.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NATIONAL LOTTERY STAKES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FAVOURITES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Camelot                Widely fancied and broadly based consortium                        backed by Cadbury-Schweppes Rank                   Dark horse but chief executives Michael Gifford                        should not be underestimated.

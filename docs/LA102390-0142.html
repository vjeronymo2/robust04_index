			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER R&amp;D COSTS KEEP NET EARNINGS DOWN AT BECKMAN  </P> <P> Citing greater research and development expenditures, Beckman Instruments Inc.  said Monday that net earnings increased only 2.1% to $9.6 million in the third  quarter from $9.4 million for the same three-month period in 1989.  </P> <P> At the same time, Beckman, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic equipment, said  sales increased to $201 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 7.7% from  $186.7 million in the third quarter of last year.  </P> <P> Net earnings for the first three quarters of the year dropped to $26.2 million  from $31.5 million. Sales for the nine months were up slightly to $589.4  million from $586.2 million last year.  </P> <P> The company blamed slow sales this year on limited budgets at publicly funded  research laboratories, which are some of the Fullerton-based company's biggest  customers. There are fewer research grants available to those labs, the company  said, so they're not purchasing as much equipment.  </P> <P> Some labs, too, are leasing equipment from Beckman rather than purchasing it  outright, which "has had the effect of stretching out sales revenues" over  longer periods of time, said Beckman President Lou Rosso in a statement.  </P> <P> Net income for the first nine months of the year was down in part because the  company has increased its research and development budget to $59.7 million  during the first three quarters, a 17% increase from last year.  </P> <P> New products from this research should help Beckman expand its market share  "during a time of relatively weak demand" for diagnostic equipment, Rosso said.  </P> <P> The company's stock closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents in trading Monday on the  New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> BECKMAN'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> In the third quarter, Beckman Instruments reported a 7.7% increase in revenues  and a 2.1% increase in net earnings. Figures are in millions, except amounts  per share  </P> <P> Figures are in thousands except per share data.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3rd Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 3rd Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $201.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $186.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $589.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $586.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Per share (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.91  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Beckman Instruments Inc.  </P></p>

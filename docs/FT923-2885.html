			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ICI chief fears Asian competition SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday warned that the west must restructure its chemical industry to compete with the Asian Pacific producers. The warning follows indications last week that the European Commission merger authorities may oppose an assets swap between ICI and Du Pont, the US chemical giant. The swap, announced in April, involves ICI exchanging its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m cash. Sir Denys, speaking at the second world chemical congress at Newport, California, warned that Asian Pacific manufacturers would become net exporters by the end of the decade. He urged western governments to adopt the level of partnership between government and industry known in the Far East.</p>

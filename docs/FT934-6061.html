			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Oil in troubled waters The bind which ties Opec members is clearly beginning to hurt badly. On the one hand a shortage of revenue argues for a price increase, on the other Opec does not wish to be railroaded into ceding market share, only to risk prices remaining weak. That scent of blood in the water is all the excuse speculators need to push the crude price lower. Yet the lack of response of the oil majors' share prices may tell the more accurate story. The imbalance between supply and demand is not very great and Opec may be right to suppose the market will tighten over the next few weeks. If a cut is genuinely needed it is probably no more than the 2 per cent proposed at the meeting, and which could be agreed at an emergency session. In the slightly longer term the central expectation is that crude oil will move back into the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range. Temporary weakness in crude prices is in any case partly offset by a consequent gain in refining and marketing margins for companies with significant downstream interests. Perhaps more importantly, the market is concentrating on cost-cutting and the prospects for cyclical recovery. Retrenchment means Shell may well generate more cash this year with oil at Dollars 16 than it did two years ago when crude was Dollars 21 a barrel. BP's third-quarter figures show that much of the benefit of cost reductions is being retained by the company. The risk to the rosy view of increasingly efficient companies approaching the turn in the world economy is that oil prices go down and stay down. If that happens the oil majors will be suffering alongside Opec and the explorers.</p>

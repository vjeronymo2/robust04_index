			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> "CATHERINE CROZIER AT GRACE CATHEDRAL." Delos DE 3090 (compact disc). The  veteran organist makes characteristically controlled, conservatively  registered, musically persuasive cases for monuments of German Romanticism.  </P> <P> Mendelssohn's Sonata No. 6, in D minor, and two of Schumann's B-A-C-H fugues  benefit most from her deeply serious approach, while Liszt's Prelude and Fugue  on B-A-C-H and Reubke's "94th Psalm" Sonata need an injection of fantasy and  bravura dazzle as well as the astounding mechanical mastery. Delos captures the  sound of the Aeolian-Skinner/Casavant instrument in the reverberant San  Francisco cathedral with typical flair and fidelity. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

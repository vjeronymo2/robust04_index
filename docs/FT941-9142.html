			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Viacom/Paramount Viacom would hardly have paid such an absurd price for Paramount if it had been forced to pay the entire sum in cash. As it is, investors' willingness to accept non-voting B shares as part of the deal could see its grand epic turn into a horror movie. The terms are all the more dilutive in that B shares may need to be issued like confetti to compensate investors for Viacom's falling share price. That could upset the separate merger with Blockbuster Entertainment, which is an integral part of the overall strategy. The enlarged Viacom will have debts of Dollars 10bn, which should be easily serviced out of cash flow of around Dollars 2bn. But Blockbuster brings a disproportionate share of the cash flow and only Dollars 500m of the debt.</p>

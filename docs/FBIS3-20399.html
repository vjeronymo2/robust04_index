			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The information that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the  Russian Liberal Democrat leader, is to visit Finland has been  received without any upsurge of emotion. Zhirinovskiy will  arrive in Finland next week with a Russian parliamentary  delegation. Many European countries have closed their doors to  Zhirinovskiy, who expresses ultranationalistic views. President  Martti Ahtisaari does not see any problems in the visit of the  controversial politician.    [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Well, that was expected because  the invitation was sent, and in that sense there is no surprise  there, at least not in my case. It was open as to who would be  included in the delegation.    Everybody who can get a visa to Finland is welcome. [end  recording]    [Announcer] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto also takes a  relaxed view about Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. Haavisto  said that he heard about the visit at the Eduskunta.    [Begin Haavisto recording] He will mainly be a guest of the  Eduskunta and I have received the information from the Eduskunta  that he is coming. I do not think there will be any very  disorderly conduct because he is a representative of an official  delegation and of course, one should take things as they come.  [end recording]    [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy will take part in a seminar on  Tuesday and Wednesday [5-6 April] at the Eduskunta. The seminar  will discuss Russia joining the Council of Europe.</p>

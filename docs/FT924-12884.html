			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / US, EC confident on farm reform THE US and EC have expressed confidence that substantial progress will be made in a matter of days towards resolving the impasse on agricultural trade which is holding up the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC commissioner for external relations, warned after meeting trade ministers of the US, Japan and Canada at the weekend the breakthrough would not amount to a 'deal' on the remaining issues of farm subsidies and oilseeds output. But he said negotiators should have made sufficient progress for multilateral talks to be resumed in Geneva. The four ministers at the meeting, in a country inn 100km west of Toronto, reaffirmed their determination to conclude the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade by the end of this year. However, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said no meeting had been scheduled between Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: South Korean trade plans fail to impress SOUTH KOREA met a frosty reception from its fellow-Gatt members yesterday when it launched a programme to liberalise trade in a further 133 products, mostly agricultural, as part of a phased move to unwind curbs allowed to developing countries with balance-of-payments problems. Mr Lee Bong-suh, minister for agriculture, said that South Korea would give more priority to expanding world commerce than to protecting its farmers in revived global trade talks. South Korea was blamed as one of the culprits when the multilateral Gatt talks collapsed on the question of farm subsidies last December, but in renewed talks 'you will notice that Korea's position . . . even in the agriculture sector will have changed considerably,' Mr Lee said. Mr Young Woo Park, Seoul's deputy ambassador to Gatt, said his government faced opposition from farmers to the liberalisation. The US joined other countries including Canada, the EC and New Zealand in calling the offer disappointing. Mr Lee said he intended to pledge cooperation toward a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, in meetings with Ambassador Carla Hills, the US trade representative. Besides the Uruguay Round, they also discussed trade issues involving the sale of US cigarettes, current negotiations involving South Korean shipbuilding, and South Korea's recent austerity campaign, which has drawn US accusations of import exclusion. South Korea, which returned to current-account deficit last year for the first time since the mid-1980s, has resisted attempts to open its farm imports in the Round.</p>

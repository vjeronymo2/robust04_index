			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> An internal audit program performed every six months is in place on behalf of management to determine if all operations are complying with the requirements of the current quality systems, procedures, policy decisions, calibration programs, test procedures, and safety programs. This audit evaluates both the operational function and the quality assurance program at the same time, and is performed by the president or vice president of the laboratory. Personnel interviewed in the electrical and calibration areas were actively aware of the program. The corrective action reports and the corrective action logs showed no discrepancies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Variations and discrepancies are addressed via a Corrective Action Report (CAR). CARs not finalized in an appropriate time frame are discussed at the directors' and managers' meetings and monitored by the laboratory President. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela, Inc. is devoting additional resources in the quality assurance area and will review weekly all open corrective action reports of problems and root cause analysis. A corrective action system is in place to document audit findings and to implement corrective actions with specified time limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela performs follow-up inspections at various facilities for other ongoing programs. Written procedures are in place for the various programs. For example, the TPCP Manual, which is presently used in the Government Services Administration (GSA) Furniture Certification Program, identifies the various steps, policies and procedures that will be used in the NRTL Program. A separate manual is presently used in Entela's Certified Automotive Parts Association (CAPA) Program. The Nuclear Program is covered under the Quality Manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Entela, Inc. follow-up inspection procedure for the NRTL program requires quarterly inspections on an unannounced basis at the manufacturing facility. This program is designed to assure that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Entela, Inc. mark is applied only to certified products; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. That the terms of agreement are adhered to when the Entela Inc. mark is used; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Defects noted during previous inspections have been corrected; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Document control procedures and support staff training should provide the assurance that all facility assessment records are on file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRTL factory inspections will be performed at the rate of at least four inspections per factory per year. The frequency varies with product volumes, types of products, and the manufacturer's prior record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When products fail to meet the requirements, the Quality Services Division takes action to either have the manufacturers correct the defect immediately, quarantine stock until the product can be reworked or reevaluated by the Entela testing engineer, or remove the Entela, Inc. mark from the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela, Inc. has a standard follow-up inspection form that will be used to document the findings at the manufacturing site. The inspector or inspecting engineer will use this form along with the follow-up inspection file for that manufacturing site and product to evaluate the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela, Inc. has a pre-qualification checklist for the evaluation of a manufacturing facility that will be used prior to the factory labeling of any products in the NRTL Program, as well as a Follow-Up Service Inspection Report. The TPCP Manual identifies the procedures required for the selection of product samples to test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entela, Inc.'s Quality Services Division will monitor products in the field, when prompted by either factory anomalies of complaints, and investigate field complaints. Entela, Inc. reserves the right to utilize safety related public notification and mandatory recall procedures. All consumer complaints are forwarded to the Quality Services Director, Vice President, or President, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution of labels placed on products is controlled, requiring the manufacturer to obtain labels only from Entela. These labels are then cached in a locked storage room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An organizational chart identifies key laboratory personnel and shows the relationship between administration, operation, and quality control. There are approximately 65 personnel in the Entela organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A written position description for each job title of personnel involved with product testing and evaluation includes the necessary education, training, technical knowledge, and the experience required for the position. The position description specified the extent and limitation of responsibility for the position. New position descriptions and training programs are in place for the follow-up inspection areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written job descriptions are referenced in the Quality Control Manual for staff involved with product testing and evaluation. These job descriptions contain minimum requirements, education, technical knowledge and experience requirement for their respective position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The President and Vice President of Operation, who have overall responsibility for the technical operations of the laboratory, have technical degrees. Personnel assigned to the TPCP have the necessary education, training, technical knowledge, and experience specified by their position description. Training logs reviewed in the electrical and in the calibration areas were current. Calibration training records showed that the calibration supervisor qualified his staff on each piece of equipment prior to any technician being allowed to perform independent calibrations. The training records identify each staff member and the test methods, procedures, and evaluations he or she is qualified to perform. Continuing education and training programs are held to instruct personnel on the proper methods of testing and evaluation. This documented training program incorporates appropriate test methods, equipment and operational procedures, product evaluations, inspections, and technical/engineering course work, and is updated annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory has a progressive performance appraisal system that provides for self-evaluation, peer-evaluation and supervisory-evaluation. The evaluation factors are both quantitative and qualitative. The laboratory also includes a company evaluation as a part of the employee program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

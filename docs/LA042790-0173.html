			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MOTHER CRAWLS OUT IN CAR PLUNGE  </P> <P> An injured Palmdale woman crawled up a 300-foot embankment with her 4-month-old  son and flagged down help after her car had crashed off of the Antelope Valley  Freeway near Agua Dulce, the California Highway Patrol reported this morning.  </P> <P> After Maria Guadalupe Acevedo, 23, got assistance after the 10:30 p.m. accident  Thursday, firefighters descended the embankment to rescue her boyfriend who was  trapped in the car.  </P> <P> Acevedo and her boyfriend, Felipe Cueva, 26, suffered moderate injuries in the  accident. Their infant son, Felipe Antonia Cueva, had minor injuries. All three  were being treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia.  </P> <P> CHP Officer A. J. Torres said the accident occurred when Acevedo attempted to  get out of the way of a car rapidly approaching from behind. When the driver  behind flashed high beams, Acevedo moved from the center lane to the fast lane  but realized the rear car had done the same thing. When she switched back to  the second lane she realized she had just cut off another fast-moving car.  </P> <P> Torres said Acevedo swerved into the slow lane to avoid the second car but then  lost control. She crossed the exit lane at Escondido Canyon Road and went off  the roadway down the embankment.  </P> <P> Torres said neither of the other cars stopped. After Acevedo, who had deep cuts  in her legs and other bruises and cuts, managed to climb up the steep  embankment while holding her son, motorist Mike Watson of Acton, spotted her  and stopped.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Rise in fee income helps Royal Bank of Canada advance A SHARP rise in fee and investment banking income as well as lower loan loss provisions helped Royal Bank of Canada lift second-quarter earnings by almost 15 per cent. The bank, Canada's largest financial institution, posted earnings of CDollars 243m (USDollars 192m), or 64 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, up from CDollars 212m, or 59 cents, a year earlier. Return on equity climbed to 13.7 per cent from 11.6 per cent. Assets rose by 4 per cent to CDollars 143.4bn, giving a return on assets of 0.72 per cent, up from 0.64 per cent. RBC painted a mildly encouraging picture of the loan losses which have dogged Canadian banks for the past two years. The estimate of 1993 write-downs is being maintained at CDollars 820m, with the remaining CDollars 325m of a general reserve set up last year being allocated to specific accounts. Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said he was encouraged by the dip in non-performing loans to CDollars 3.57bn on April 30 from CDollars 3.84bn three months earlier. The bulk of the decline was due to the return to performing status of loans to Argentina. However, Mr Taylor noted non-performing loans to other borrowers edged down by CDollars 15m, against a CDollars 300m jump in the previous quarter. A further deterioration in the commercial property portfolio was offset by an improvement in other corporate loans and a stabilised retail portfolio. Interest income was little changed, but fee income climbed by 15 per cent to CDollars 512m. Earnings of 76 per cent-owned RBC Dominion Securities doubled to almost CDollars 30m. RBC also announced a private placement of CDollars 110m of subordinated debentures. The securities qualify as Tier 2 capital, and will boost the bank's total capital-to-assets ratio to 10.3 per cent from 9.5 per cent three months earlier. Under US regulatory guidelines, the bank's total capital ratio is now 10.2 per cent.</p>

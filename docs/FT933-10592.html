			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Company News: Murdoch bets on channels' star potential - The media investor's latest prize puts 3bn viewers within reach IT is undoubtedly a glittering prize. Mr Rupert Murdoch can potentially distribute his vast programming resources to half the world's population, and many of its fastest-growing economies, following his acquisition of Asian satellite broadcaster Star Television. Less clear, however, is whether the myriad of Asian government regulations will allow this giant consumer market to tune in; and whether the 3bn people in the satellite's giant footprint will actually want to watch, in the face of growing competition from other broadcasters. Mr Murdoch is faced with the governments of countries - China, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia - with a tradition of being suspicious of western media, and with an intimidating spectrum of languages and tastes to satisfy. In fact, as he relaxes on his yacht, basking in the satisfaction of his victory in a four-man bidding war for the company, Mr Murdoch is faced with few certainties from this achievement. He has unarguably proved a benefactor to Hong Kong investors, who had looked upon Star as a financial liability for owner Hutchison Whampoa. They have been delighted with a pay-back of six times the cost of their investment, representing an extraordinary profit of HKDollars 1.5bn (Dollars 194m). However, News Corporation's shareholders may have to wait a lot longer. It is estimated that Star may have accumulated losses of up to USDollars 200m by the end of 1995. Wishing upon this Star, however, could make shareholders' dreams come true. News Corp already owns a vast library of programmes to add to Star's existing five channels: Prime Sports, MTV Asia, BBC World Service Television, a Mandarin channel and Star Plus, a family entertainment channel. It also has the technical expertise to introduce digital compression and encryption to Star, enabling it to spawn 50 or more channels, avoiding piracy and ekeing greater yields from its Twentieth Century Fox and Fox Television libraries. In the short term, it is Star's existing markets of India and Taiwan which will sustain earnings. Taiwan is busy regulating a network of an estimated 400 illegal cable operators, which are bringing in fees of around TDollars 10bn (USDollars 378m). In India, Star has been nothing short of a media phenomenon, with presenters from its MTV channel receiving rock star receptions, and at least 3.3m households receiving its programmes. Mr Kirk Sweeney, research director at Lehman Brothers, argued: 'China may put a twinkle in his eye, but I don't think Rupert Murdoch is paying USDollars 525m for China today, or China tomorrow. He is paying for global distribution for his product.' However the hidden value in the Star equation is definitely China. Mr Murdoch has made no secret of his ambition to break into this market of 1.2bn consumers, with their decades of accumulated savings. Although direct satellite link-up is illegal for individuals, an estimated 500,000 dishes were sold in China last year, and there is no evidence of moves to enforce the law. As technology advances, and dishes get smaller, it is going to become increasingly difficult for governments to block Star's reach. Mr John Ure, research associate at the Centre for Asian Studies, said: 'I think China will try to follow the Singapore model of developing its own cable network, thereby enabling it to control what goes on the screens.' There are already more than 1,000 licensed cable television networks operating in China. Wharf Cable - the cable operating subsidiary of the former Sir Yue-Kong Pao's Wharf group - recently became the first foreign company to gain a licence to operate a Chinese cable network, in the city of Chengdu. According to Star's latest internal forecasts, it expects to reach 14m Chinese households by the end of this year, and 21m by the end of 1994. This compares with the current figure of 4.8m. However, the Chinese audience is going to want to watch Chinese programmes, and this is News Corp's one weak link. News Corp was blocked by Hong Kong regulators from purchasing 22 per cent of TVB, the Hong Kong terrestrial broadcaster which controls an estimated 60 per cent of all Chinese language programmes outside China. TVB has just announced the formation of a consortium including CNN International, ESPN Asia, Home Box Office Asia and government-owned Australian broadcaster ATVI, which is to lease 16 transponders on the APT satellite, due for launch in June 1994. TVB sees Taiwan and, eventually, China as the vital markets. Further competition is inevitable. Mr Fung Shong-kwong, general manager of TVB International, said: 'I don't need computer models to project how we will do because we have been selling our programming to China on video and to TV stations for 15 years, very profitably.' With a satellite transmission that will cover all of China and Taiwan, TVB can offer the same distribution, but more attractive programming. Mr Fung said it was unlikely TVB would sign a programming deal with its erstwhile ally. Some analysts, however, believe News Corp could sell 12 per cent of its stake in Star, thereby retaining 51 per cent control and reeling TVB's library through the offer of equity participation. As an alternative, or possible addition, Star is already negotiating to purchase the entire library of Hong Kong film-maker Golden Harvest, which has around 350 titles. More than just China is at stake. The overseas Chinese control the business wealth of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the bulk of the south-east Asian economies. If Mr Murdoch can attract their hearts, he will definitely have a prize worth winning.</p>

However, he stated:  Financial arrangements must uphold the principle of "keeping  expenditures within the limits of revenue."    He said: Financial arrangements should be given a long-term  consideration and are not something that can be accomplished in  a year. The Hong Kong Government must give consideration to its  operations for the next several years. Should anything  unexpected happen, it must have fully adequate financial  reserves to cope with the situation. Moreover, the Hong Kong  Government must also consider that, after the reversion of  sovereignty, there must be a basic convergence financially as  well as a sizable amount of reserves to enable the Hong Kong  economy to continue to expand.    Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: Yesterday afternoon, we received  the Hong Kong Government's financial budget proposal for the new  financial year. This is represents a change the previous  practice of giving the document to the agency only after the  financial budget proposal was made public. He stated: If the  Hong Kong Government has a financial surplus and is willing to  leave it to the SAR Government, we will suggest that the  government sign something to show its commitment. He said:  Every year the Hong Kong Government remarks that it is leaving  large quantities of reserves. He expressed the hope that the  Hong Kong Government could effectively implement its statements.    Moreover, he said: It is hoped that the Hong Kong Government  will leave 25 billion [no currency specified] in financial  reserves to the SAR Government in accordance with the Memorandum  of Understanding on the new airport.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "HK Weekly Sued Over Hope Fund Allegations"] </F>   [Text] A mainland education foundation is suing a Hong  Kong weekly over false reports of missing funds. The China  Youth Development Foundation (CYDF) yesterday filed a lawsuit in  the Hong Kong Supreme Court against the Next Weekly Publishing  Co. for its allegedly libelous charges.    "We are confident that we will win the case because our  foundation has a clean record," said CYDF Secretary-General Xu  Yongguang.    The lawsuit is crucial to the future of the Hope Project in  China, the huge charity programme inaugurated five years ago to  raise funds for improving the country's primary education,  especially in underdeveloped areas. The foundation sent a  written protest on June 16 to the magazine, after it had  reported that the foundation had misused the donations. The  report has caused some overseas Chinese to hesitate in donating  money for the project, according to the CYDF. The foundation  asked that the magazine indemnify it for losses due to the  alleged libel and publish an apology.    The foundation demanded the magazine reply within one week  and warned that it would take legal actions otherwise. The  magazine has not responded, according to the foundation.    On January 21, 1994, the weekly magazine carried a story,  saying "donations for the Hope Project had gone missing."    The article said that the funds had been intended for  repairing a dilapidated primary school in Xianghai Township of  Jilin Province. According to the CYDF, the school got the  donations of 180,000 yuan ($21,000) on July 29, 1993 and the  main building of the school had been put into use before the  article appeared.    "The report which was inconsistent with facts and used  insulting phrases has produced harmful effects both in China and  among overseas Chinese," said Xi Jieying, CYDF spokesman. Many  other facts in the report were also wrong, he added. He said  donated funds, from home or abroad, are carefully recorded in  the computer system of CYDF.</p>

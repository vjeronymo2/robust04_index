			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Half-year income halved at Petrofina PETROFINA, the Belgian oil company, yesterday announced that interim profits had halved to BFr4.2bn (Dollars 138m) as the fall in crude oil and gas prices and the weakness of the US dollar continued to take their toll. The group - which last year reported first-half net consolidated profits of BFr9.5bn - said it could see no immediate end to the economic recession which is blighting the industry. Overall turnover slipped to BFr265bn from BFr280bn. 'Nothing leads us to expect in the months to come any significant change in this situation, which severely affects the petroleum and petrochemical industry,' said the company, one of Belgium's largest industrial groups. Mr Francois Cornelis, chief executive, warned of a 'marked drop' in first-half profits in May, and said an improvement would depend on a rise in US gas prices and improved refining margins. Instead, the company reported that refining margins had continued to slide during the first half. Refining, marketing and transport operations turned in interim operating profits of BFr3.27bn against BFr7.89bn, and were hit in the US by unspecified 'technical problems' which caused 'considerable production losses'. Profits slipped at all of Petrofina's operations, except paints, which made BFr919m in the first half against BFr620m in last year's equivalent period. Chemicals profits dropped to BFr3.1bn from BFr4.99bn and exploration and production to BFr6.18bn from BFr6.31bn. The group said it was taking the gloomy outlook into account in its strategic planning. As part of its strategy, Petrofina is trying to reinforce its Antwerp refining capability and getting more choosy about the development of its petrochemical products. Last week, Fina, the group's US affiliate, reported net earnings of Dollars 67,000 for the six months ended June 30 against Dollars 12.5m last year. Second-quarter earnings were up to Dollars 5.53m from Dollars 4.24m. Negotiations are continuing with Arabian Petroleum to establish a joint venture in the refining sector.</p>

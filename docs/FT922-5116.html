			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (3): Positive business culture is a silver lining - The Economy THE GUSTO with which the people of Montreal celebrated the city's 350th birthday last month can be interpreted either as a sign of Quebec's eagerness for some distraction from the tough times of the past few years, or its confidence that the worst is behind it. Together with neighbouring Ontario, Quebec has borne the brunt of the downturn in the Canadian economy. Output shrank by about 2 per cent last year, after barely rising in 1990. Several of the province's biggest companies, including the construction group Lavalin and retailers Provigo and Steinberg, have experienced severe financial problems. Canadian Pacific, the venerable railway and resource conglomerate based in Montreal, lost CDollars 40m in the first three months of this year. Quebec's unemployment has climbed to 12 per cent and Montreal is reputed to have one of the highest rates in North America. Problems of high interest rates and a strong currency were exacerbated by Quebec's relatively heavy exposure to industries which were hit by the cyclical slump in demand and also suffered from more deep-rooted structural handicaps. The impact of the separatist campaign is unclear. But it has certainly not encouraged local businesses to invest, nor has it helped attract capital from elsewhere. Royal Bank of Canada said in a recent report that political uncertainty 'will constrain investment growth' in the province. The chief executive of a large insurance group in Montreal added that his company was unlikely to make any substantial new property commitments in the province until the political picture was clearer. If there is a silver lining to the political turmoil, it is the positive business culture which continues to make Quebec one of Canada's most hospitable provinces to both domestic and foreign companies. While captains of commerce and industry in Ontario are harshly critical of their province's fiscal and labour policies, premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government in Quebec has a comfortable relationship with the business community. Quebec was among the loudest cheerleaders in Canada for the 1989 free trade agreement with the US. Although recession and mounting competition from US suppliers have taken some of the shine off free trade, Quebec generally supports Ottawa's participation in the talks with Mexico to create a North American free trade area. Quebec is the first of Canada's 10 provinces to grasp the nettle of aligning its provincial sales tax with the new (but highly unpopular) federal Goods and Services Tax. Although the harmonisation has short-term political risks, it greatly simplifies tax-paying companies' paperwork. The macroeconomic picture has improved markedly in recent months. Canadian banks' prime lending rates are below 8 per cent compared to a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990. The Canadian dollar, whose level is closely watched by such export-dependent industries as forestry and mining, has tumbled by almost 10 per cent since last November. With the US buying almost three-quarters of Quebec's exports, the upturn south of the border will give an added lift to business. National Bank of Canada, whose head office is in Montreal, forecasts that Quebec's growth rate will accelerate from 1.5 per cent in real terms this year to 3.5 per cent in 1993. Household spending is expected to be a mainspring of the recovery, as consumers go shopping with the savings from lower mortgage payments. National Bank forecasts a 3.5 per cent rise in retail sales this year, accelerating to 5.5 per cent in 1993. Tourism should get help this year from Montreal's birthday celebrations. Like their counterparts in the rest of Canada, many Quebec business leaders are painfully aware that more favourable interest and exchange rates may not be sufficient to guarantee another burst of prosperity. The postponement of the CDollars 12bn Great Whale hydro-electric project means the construction and engineering sector will recover more slowly than hoped. Fixed investment as a whole is likely to stagnate for some time as work on new aluminium smelters is completed, and the government winds down construction of sewage treatment stations. In the longer term, the drive towards freer trade has exposed inefficiencies in such cornerstones of the Quebec economy as forestry, dairy farming and the textile industry. Canadian pulp and paper exporters have steadily lost market share in the US to lower-cost producers elsewhere. Likewise, unemployment in the textile and clothing sector, which is centred in Quebec, has soared as uncompetitive companies are forced to slim down or close down. Quebec's inefficient but politically powerful dairy farmers are threatened by growing pressure (mostly from Canada's international trading partners, but also from domestic food processors and consumers) on a raft of protective quotas and other non-tariff barriers. Although the cost in unemployment has been painfully high, the recession has forced workers in many industries to moderate their pay demands, while suppliers have come under pressure to hold down prices. Canada's annualised inflation rate has dropped below 2 per cent In addition, Quebec's trade unions have generally been more willing than their counterparts in other parts of the country to reopen labour contracts and accept management demands for more flexible work practices. The ability to build on recent productivity improvements is likely to distinguish the next generation of Quebec business winners from its has-beens.</p>

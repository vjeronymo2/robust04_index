			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Franchise bid was not too high - INBC The Independent National Broadcasting Company has attacked suggestions that its bid of just over Pounds 4m for the second national commercial channel was too high. Its bid for the pop music licence was more than double the Pounds 1.88m second highest offer put forward by TV-am, the breakfast television company, in a joint venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group. Mr Michael Mallett, chairman of INBC and a former chairman of Yorkshire Radio Network, said that as the station would be based in Sheffield its overheads would be much lower than London. INBC argued on Friday that it was bidding for a unique franchise - the only national commercial pop music channel - with a potential audience of up 40m. However, it still has to raise financing of around Pounds 12m and a prospectus is expected in the next couple of weeks.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Zenith Electronics plans public offer of shares ZENITH Electronics, the troubled US television maker, has unveiled a new financing plan that may help steady the company following several years of debilitating losses. Zenith has been hit by losses in consumer electronics and investments in new technologies, such as high definition television. The financing plan includes a public offering of 8m common shares, which will raise approximately Dollars 55m, and a new three-year Dollars 60m working capital loan from the Bank of New York. The new credit facility will replace its existing agreement, which expires at the end of the year. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zenith said of the 8m shares to be sold, 1.2m would be offered outside the US. The company has 29.3m shares outstanding. It also said the underwriters will have the option to issue up to 1.2m more shares on the same terms to cover over-allotments. Salomon Brothers and The First Boston Corporation were named as managers of the underwriting group.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers buys Merck unit Bristol-Myers Squibb said it had agreed to pay rival US pharmaceuticals group Merck Dollars 261.5m to acquire its Calgon Vestal Laboratories division, a maker of skin care and infection control products. The sale of the company, which employs 700 people and had revenues last year of Dollars 105m, is part of a previously announced move by Merck to shed businesses outside its core human and animal health divisions. Merck said yesterday it expected to pick a buyer for Kelco, a second division which is for sale, by the end of the year. Kelco is a maker of alginates and biogums, materials which are used as stabilisers in food and other products. In 1993, it had sales of Dollars 295m and 1,300 employees. Bristol-Myers said it would merge Calgon with its own ConvaTec division, which makes medical devices for colostomy patients, as well as materials for the care of wounds. Calgon's products would complement those of ConvaTec, Bristol-Myers said. The two companies' products would benefit from the wider distribution and sales networks the transaction would create. ConvaTec would bring Calgon stronger international distribution while Calgon would give ConvaTec greater access to the US nursing home and homecare markets.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Island hopping among the ghosts Film-goers who have seen The Piano will have left the cinema suddenly conscious that New Zealand's history of European settlement must have been more blood than butter. Sailing around the glorious archipelago known as the Bay of Islands, 160 miles north of Auckland, can have the same startling effect. Having dropped anchor in the lagoon of the small island of Motuaruhia after our first day's sailing, our party was determined to get ashore and take some exercise beyond rope-pulling. Our goal was the summit of a steep cliff overlooking the island's eastern shore. Once this was a Maori stronghold. With a 200ft drop into the sea on one side and a single track up through the forest on the other, the defending tribe could be virtually impregnable when enemies came visiting. The views through the outlying islands to the misty Pacific were evocative. It was a crew-member from another visiting yacht that caused the first shiver. She said she had not liked what she had read about the place. Her words damped our dinghy ride back to Island Girl, though a G&amp;T lifted the spirits. Rummaging through a guide to the area, I decided that it could scarcely have been Captain Cook's visit in 1769 that had caused our misgivings. Motuaruhia was Cook's first landfall in New Zealand, and despite a brief skirmish with some Maoris, there was no great trouble between natives and explorers. 'Abundant fresh celery,' noted Cook's botanist, Joseph Banks, although we saw none. Peering more closely at the bookshelf in the saloon brought forth a more detailed history. One of the first European settlers in the area was a Scottish farmer named John Roberton. He bought Motuaruhia from a Maori chief in 1839, built a cottage, brought his wife and two children from the mainland and began farming. Four months later he was drowned, sailing his boat to the mainland outpost of Russell. This small town was New Zealand's first capital and still has its feet in the sea. Despite having two small children to raise, Roberton's widow struggled on with the farm for two more years. She was aided by a young settler named Thomas Bull and a Maori chief called Maketu. Unfortunately for her, Maketu was mentally unstable and Bull a violent drunkard. By the time the Maori finally split Bull's head open with a logging axe, life on the island must have become a nightmare. Mrs Roberton told Maketu that he would be taken to Auckland and hanged for his crime - whereupon he carried her and the two children to the dizzy heights of the stronghold and hurled them into the sea. The widow's prediction came true. Maketu's trial was a colonial sensation that reached the London newspapers. This sense of violent and important history, just a few generations back, is one of the factors that makes the Bay of Islands such an intriguing place to sail. The sailing is as good as in the Whitsundays or Bahamas, the seas as sparkling. In addition there is a powerful sense of the recent past. At Opua, where the charter yachts are based, the steam train from the inland town of Kawakawa still visits the jetty where the famous kauri timber, said to make the finest masts in the world, was once loaded. Among UK companies that can organise yacht hirings in the Bay of Islands is The Moorings: 188 Northdown Road, Cliftonville, Kent CT9 2QN, tel: 0843-227140, fax: 0843-228784.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FUTURES dealers continued to adopt a pessimistic view of the short-term outlook for the UK market as the June contract traded in a narrow range for most of a quiet session, writes Christopher Price. Following a downward end to Monday's session and a weak overnight Wall Street, June opened down at 2,818, a key resistance level for the contract. From there, support was found and June was bought upwards. It rallied to a mid-morning high of 2,834, before starting to come off as buyers drifted away and a number of sellers were seen. The CBI survey added to the market's sullen mood, fuelling renewed fears of inflation and putting paid to any further interest rate cuts, a fact underlined by the latest IMF view of the UK economy. June's slow drift downwards continued with a weak opening on Wall Street, although a rally towards the end brought some relief. The contract closed at 2,826, up 8 points from the previous session and around a point below its estimated fair value premium of 6. Turnover came to 8,927 contracts, a slight improvement from Monday's level. BP was the most heavily traded stock option, reaching 3,999 contracts. This included a trade of 3,000 July 280 puts at 12p and 13p. Lonrho was busy again, with 2,240 lots transacted, followed by United Biscuits on 1,311 and British Aerospace on 1,206.</p>

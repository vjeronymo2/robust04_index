			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Axel Buyse: "Operation Turquoise"] </F>   [Text] Operation Turquoise, which the French are setting up  for intervention in Rwanda, continues to raise questions. The  Balladur government states that Paris is acting for purely  humanitarian reasons. And that France has an obligation to  intervene due to its traditional links with Africa, and because  nobody else looks to do anything.    The latter argument cannot be easily brushed aside. What has  happened in Rwanda over recent weeks is appalling. But no other  country, no other body, seems prepared to become involved in  this hornets' nest. Preparations to form a new force of blue  helmets drag on. It is indeed the case that it is France or  nobody at the present point in time.    But the doubt remains. A doubt which is broadly based on two  kinds of consideration. The first is pragmatic. Do the risks  Paris is taking weigh up against the possible benefits? The  second is political. Nobody believes that France is going to  Rwanda for purely humanitarian reasons. At another level,  considerations of a totally different nature are also playing a  role.    Quite unashamedly, France has long been pursuing power  politics in Africa. It is above all on the basis of this clear  presence in Africa that Paris is seeking to confirm its role as  a "power." The operation in Rwanda is quite clearly also  intended to defend and reinforce this role. The fact that  Rwanda is a former Belgian and not a French colony is beside the  point. Belgium set aside any colonial ambitions -- insofar as  it ever had any -- at the time of the first colonial troubles in  1960.    It is likely that France will take advantage of its  temporarily increased military presence in the region to finish  off a couple of odd jobs that it prefers not to see exposed to  broad daylight. The claim that France, or at least French  mercenaries, were involved in shooting down the plane carrying  the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi remains unproven at  present. But there are strong suspicions that the French still  have men on the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] side of the front  lines.    More important than any of this is the question as to  whether  the benefits of the French operation will outweigh the costs,  and not only in terms of soldiers' lives. France readily uses  its legendary Foreign Legion forces for operations of this kind,  and the life of an anonymous "legionnaire" is less politically  costly than that of a soldier in the regular forces.    One man who is certainly going to help spin the "turquoise"  web is Mobutu Sese Seko. The French right has recently been  buttering up the Zairian president. This has been made all the  easier due to the poor performance of the opposition in  Kinshasa. The fact that the French have to make use of their  treaties with Zaire in order to implement their humanitarian  operation can of course only further strengthen the president's  diplomatic hand.    RPF spokesmen rightly point out the possible consequences of  the French operation for stability in the [Zairian] Kivu  province and in Burundi in particular. The operation could  provoke both Hutu and Tutsi extremists in this neighboring  country to insane actions.    At the same time, there is something squalid and perverse in  the way the RPF is able to present itself as an African version  of the Salvation Army. Many media people -- out of revulsion at  the extent of the slaughter by Hutu extremists -- completely  ignore the disastrous role the RPF played in upsetting the  balance in Rwanda. In assessing the disaster that now afflicts  Rwanda, there is an inclination to pass all too lightly over the  fact that it was the RPF which, in October 1990, attacked a  country where a tentative start to democratization was already  under way. And that this aggression was only possible thanks to  the full support of neighboring Uganda.</p>

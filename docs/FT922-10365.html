			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Calpers votes to replace Sears board THE California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund investor in the US, said it had voted against all the directors standing for re-election at Sears, Roebuck, the retail and financial services group. Sears, which has been the subject of shareholder agitation for several years, is holding its annual general meeting on May 14. Three directors on its reduced nine-man board are up for re-election. Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive, said the fund's proxy guidelines normally required a supportive vote. 'In this case, Sears' continual poor performance, and the board's obvious reluctance to insist that Mr Brennan (Sears chairman and chief executive) make the changes necessary to save this company, compelled us to express our displeasure in some tangible way.' Calpers threw its weight behind four motions put forward by dissident shareholders at Sears, including one which requires a study of the possibilities of splitting the group's different interests into separate companies. Much of the dissatisfaction with Sears centres on its large retail operations. Some of its financial services interests, which include the Dean Witter brokerage and the Allstate insurance company, are seen as more attractive propositions. The other three proposals backed by Calpers include a suggestion that the jobs of chairman and chief executive be split between different people; a strengthening of confidentiality of the proxy vote; and the elimination of the staggered terms for board directors. Calpers owns 2m Sears shares. This represents about 0.6 per cent of its stock.</p>

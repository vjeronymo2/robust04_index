			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Maryukha: "It's Easy To Divide Ships on </F> Paper. It's Harder To Observe the Interests of the Sides"]    [Text] An abundance of the most acute problems--political,  economic, diplomatic, purely military, and even moral--have come  together in the Black Sea Fleet like a tight sailor's knot.  Unless we solve them, we could hardly hope to emerge from the  `Black Sea dead-end' and relieve the tension under which Black  Sea seamen are living and serving today," stated General of the  Army Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, at a Ministry  of Defense press conference. Therefore, even despite the  considerable concessions by the Russian delegation, and its  patience with the excessive demands of the Ukrainian side, which  sometimes went contrary to agreements reached previously, the  first round of talks on dividing the Black Sea Fleet was unable  to put an end to the protracted litigation: The military were  unable to draft and initial a treaty that the presidents have  already agreed upon. They weren't even able to sign a protocol  on nonagreement of the parties, which naturally follows in such  a case. Still, it cannot be said that the negotiations have  broken down, or have reached an insurmountable impasse.    The Russian Federation defense minister gave a large number  of examples leading to the conclusion that the position of the  Ukrainian side at the talks in Sevastopol was in diametric  opposition to statements and announcements of the Ukrainian  president. In particular, an item concerning joint basing of the  Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy in Sevastopol, an item  concerning "corridors" for the passage of Russian Black Sea  ships to their bases that is discriminatory from the standpoint  of international law of the sea, and a demand that the ships and  vessels of the fleet be "transferred to the sides" fully manned  (as if some third party is giving the Black Sea Fleet to Russia  and Ukraine) were introduced into the document drafted by the  Ukrainian side. Where all of this comes from, emphasized General  of the Army Pavel Grachev, is from the fact that first of all  the Ukrainian side does not wish to operate with universally  recognized legal terms, and secondly, local executors are trying  to interpret the Agreement on Stage-by-Stage Settlement of the  Problems of the Black Sea Fleet, signed on 15 April in Moscow,  to their own advantage.    The act of dividing the ships, regarding which the  negotiators did manage to reach agreement, having included all  watercraft on the lists with accuracy "down to the sloop," was  termed by Pavel Grachev as only the first stage of division.  Division of the Black Sea Fleet is a lengthy process that will  not fit within the framework of the current year, nor possibly  even the next, 1995.    But the main thing is this: We first need to resolve the  matter of separate basing of the Black Sea Fleet and the  Ukrainian Navy. "We did not demand removal ships of the  Ukrainian Navy from Crimea," Pavel Grachev stressed, "the ships  could be based together, including at the five bases that we  propose leaving for the Black Sea Fleet. But the headquarters  must be separated. Where the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy  are to be located is a matter for Ukraine to resolve, but  Sevastopol must remain the main base of the Black Sea Fleet."    The search for consensus on this most important item of the  15 April agreement went on until the very last minute,  emphasized special ambassador Yuriy Dubinin, who participated in  the press conference. And while the fact that it was not reached  is worthy of sympathy, it doesn't warrant a dramatic outburst.  The documents signed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine  were drafted in such a way that there is nothing in them left  for interpretation at the level of the executors. They need to  be fulfilled or not fulfilled. From all appearances, the  Ukrainian delegation took the path of nonfulfillment, which  predetermined the outcome of the meeting in Sevastopol.    There simply cannot be a third party to the process of  settling the Black Sea problems--this is a matter exclusively  for Russia and Ukraine. This was categorically stated by  participants of the press conference at the Russian Ministry of  Defense. There is a way out of the "Black Sea dead-end" even in  the absence of interference from without. We need to continue  the negotiation process. However, we need to begin the second  round not with debates but with an effort to agree on terms and  on the subject of discussion. In the words of Pavel Grachev, it  would be suitable to create state commissions under the  leadership of the prime ministers or their first deputies in  preparation for the next such meeting, and include  representatives of all interested ministries and departments in  their membership so as to determine exactly how much is owed to  whom. Otherwise, the discussion would simply continue "with  raised voices."    However, Yuriy Dubinin stated during the press conference  that there are grounds for believing that the problems of the  Black Sea Fleet will be resolved peacefully, and in the  interests of the peoples of Russia and Ukraine. As the special  ambassador explained, it was agreed that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin will make a visit to Ukraine, during which a major  treaty between the two states is to be signed. This could bring  the process of unraveling the Black Sea knot to its conclusion,  so long as the aides to President Leonid Kravchuk do not let  down their leader, as they have done before, in fulfilling  Ukraine's international obligations.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: London City Ballet Last Saturday, the London City Ballet pirouetted its last at the Theatre Royal Bath, victim of Arts Council intransigence over regular funding, Antony Thorncroft writes. Early in September in Stevenage, the London City Ballet will embark on its annual autumn tour. That at least was the guarded assurance provided by artistic director Harold King on Monday. He could sound optimistic because he was standing next to the money man from ADT, whose chairman Michael Ashcroft seems set to take over from John Hughes as the financial backer of the LCB. He has pledged Pounds 150,000 a year. The plight of the company precipitated a sudden donation from the widow of Nureyev's agent Sandor Gorlinsky. Texaco has promised Pounds 150,000 in the autumn. The dancers are now on holiday - unpaid - but a slightly smaller company should assemble in August to rehearse Coppelia.</p>

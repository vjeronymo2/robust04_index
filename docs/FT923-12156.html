			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowie counters Henlys' defence T COWIE, the motor trader bidding Pounds 26.3m for rival Henlys Group, said the target's management was 'bankrupt of ideas' and had 'insufficient resources to recover by itself'. It would shortly be writing to Henlys' shareholders responding to points made in the defence document published last Friday. Cowie countered Henlys' claim that it had a new management team saying that Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, had been managing director of the group since February 1990. Before that he had been chief executive of the original Henlys, which merged with Plaxton in 1989, since 1985. It was the former Plaxton bus and coach manufacturing side which had pushed Henlys into losses. Henlys forecast an interim loss of Pounds 900,000 in its defence document, after an exceptional charge estimated at Pounds 950,000, and a maintained dividend. Cowie said this demonstrated Henlys' financial weakness and questioned 'the validity of a strategy which is unable to deliver profits'. Cowie's shares closed at 139p, down 1p, making its 1-for-2 offer worth 69 1/2 p per share. Henlys closed at 70p, down 1p.</p>

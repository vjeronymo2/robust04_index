			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Management: Rockwell's Czech mate - The problems of establishing ventures in east Europe There is an unusual door into one of the four plants at Liberec, 80km north-east of Prague, where Rockwell International, the US multinational, is making its first foray into motor components manufacturing in eastern Europe. Flanked by high railings it is big enough to take a bus. Until the late 1980s it did. The political prisoners the bus disgorged daily assembled door and window mechanisms for the Skoda cars being made - now under Volkswagen's control - at nearby Mlada Boleslav. To minimise sabotage risks, production was reduced to many simple operations, each numbingly repetitive. Today paid employees have replaced the prisoners. But the tedious tasks remain. The facility illustrates practical hurdles western companies face in seeking to turn formerly Communist state-owned companies into competitive businesses with which they hope to exploit growth prospects in central and eastern Europe. Not least, it helps shed light on some of the wider frustrations VW claims to be experiencing over its commitment - as part of taking over control of Skoda - to help develop a competitive Czech motor components industry. In the past few days the German company seeking to improve Skoda's productivity and compensate for rising costs has raised Skoda prices and is threatening to import more components from the west. As a consequence, Jan Peer, the Czech-born executive appointed by Rockwell nearly two years ago to run the Liberec operation, is under more pressure to demonstrate the venture can work. Last month, during his first full meeting with the 462-strong workforce, Peer expounded Rockwell's ambitions for Liberec. His final slide concluded 'and let's have some fun'. There was a puzzled pause before nervous grins spread among the dour Czech ranks, speaking volumes about the working culture of plants carrying the legacy of 40 years of Communism. Nevertheless Peer, who moved to the US when he was 18, believes that Rockwell BCS-Liberec, the enterprise's new name (the BCS stands for Body Chassis Systems, one of Rockwell's global divisions), can be a 'world class' constituent of Rockwell's global vehicle components business in the next few years. Until privatisation, Liberec was purely a Skoda components arm. Skoda remains its only customer, supplied with the mechanisms which raise and lower windows, seat slides and sunroofs. But Liberec, which is to supply sunroofs for a high-volume, German-built small car to be launched in 1995, will soon start making sunvisors for another European producer, and is exploring other opportunities. From mid-1994 it will also benefit from increased production of an updated Skoda Favorit, the first step of a DM9bn (Pounds 3.6bn) investment programme at Skoda leading to new families of cars. The task ahead, however, is formidable. While Peer was seeing the work force, the bare, wooden floors were echoing to the clatter of a VW team arriving for the second quality audit since he took over. VW has made clear it expects Rockwell to match VW's quality blitz on the Skoda assembly lines. The challenge for Peer and his team of Czech managers is how best to motivate and organise employees into teams responsible for their own quality while continually looking for improvements - ingredients of total quality management systems becoming the western norm. Peer says that there are 60 per cent more indirect workers than production employees. 'That's two and a half times as bad as in western plants.' Given that Rockwell must make best efforts under the deal to maintain employment for three years, the obvious solution might be to retrain indirect workers for increased production. But Peer expects some to leave rather than accept perceived loss of status or shift requirements. By at least making the offer, Rockwell will not breach the employment guarantee. And such departures could ease the task of restructuring. 'Over 40 years a whole system has been built on total mistrust, with managers resistant to taking on any new tasks or being held in any way accountable - there is always a bunch of signatures on any document.' For Liberec to work, Peer says there must be accountability without fear. 'Total quality management is built on the principle of openness. So there has got to be a total lack of fear on behalf of the creator of a defect. But workers here were financially punished for creating a defect. What sort of attitudes does that create?' Uncertainty among Liberec managers has also not been helped by VW importing senior German managers to Skoda. Peer insists that Rockwell will not do the same and when he leaves, his successor will be Czech. But after some organisational and management changes he is detecting positive attitude shifts. The first work teams are being formed and quality improvement programmes are gaining momentum. Management training has started, with engineers being sent to other Rockwell centres to learn systems. But plant and equipment problems abound. Some is adequate and even modern - as with some presses - but occasionally it is downright bizarre. The worst horrors will fade from Liberec as part of Rockwell's Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.8m) investment commitment, which will also see the semi-automation of assembly processes. But given the employment guarantees modernisation cannot come with a rush. To facilitate it, work is accelerating on bringing in the computer-aided design and engineering systems integral to Rockwell plants in the west, and of which Liberec will form part of a global matrix. Peer says there are islands of good existing technology, even by western standards. With its low labour rates, it could become a cost-effective supplier of parts for the more complex component systems supplied by Rockwell in the west. Far from deterred by its Liberec experience to date, Rockwell sees the operations as a potential springboard for other ventures in eastern Europe. VW, for one, hopes fervently it is right.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Naymushin, chief of the Novosibirsk Oblast </F> Center for the Employment of the Population Department of Labor  Market Analysis and Employment Programs: "The Number of  Unemployed Is Growing (Analysis of 1991-1994 Data From the  Oblast Center for the Employment of the Population)"]    [Text] The number of unemployed people is growing in the  rayons of the oblast. In 1993, 13,500 unemployed were put on the  rolls there, and in the preceding year, 7,000.    Last year, 7,600 unemployed were put on the rolls, compared  to 9,300 in 1992.    For the January-February period of 1994, the number of  unemployed put on the rolls, compared to the corresponding  period of last year, came to 155.7 percent in the rayons of the  oblast, 122.0 percent in Novosibirsk, and 142.4 percent in the  oblast as a whole.    The competition among the unemployed for vacant jobs is  growing, especially in the rayons of the oblast. As of 1 March  1993, 21 unemployed claimed each vacant job in the oblast  rayons, compared to six; as of the corresponding date of last  year in the city of Novosibirsk, accordingly, one and three, and  in the oblast as a whole, three and four unemployed per vacant  job.    The proportion of unemployed residing in rural areas  increased in 1993 (from 12.7 percent as of 1 January to 21.7  percent on 31 December). Those who had previously worked in the  national economy accounted for 86 percent of the total number of  unemployed. On the whole, the following dynamics of the  qualitative composition of the unemployed people has been  registered:                                    1-1-93                  1-1-94   a) by reason for unemployment  (percentages):   --laid-off employees            62.8                    45.0   --quit of their own will        22.4                    39.3   --dismissed for violations of   0.7                     1.6  labor discipline   --college graduates             9.2                     11.3   b) by age:   --young people between 16 and   32.1                    34.5  29   --individuals close to          5.3                     6.7  retirement age   c) those who have had a break   12.5                    22.6  in work of more than one year  and those who have not  previously embarked on labor  activities   d) those without profession     7.2                     12.7  or occupation   e) by the duration of  unemployment   --eight months or longer        3.9                     31.6      Higher requirements by employers with regard to the level of  qualification of the employees and newly hired citizens have  hampered job placement activities on behalf of the groups of  population in particular need of social protection. It is  obvious that the number of parents rearing minor or congenitally  handicapped children, single parents, and parents of many  children increased in 1993 among the unemployed precisely in  conjunction with this.    Last year, the number of unemployed parents rearing minor  children, as well as congenitally handicapped children, in the  oblast increased from 4,300 to 5,500 people, and that of parents  of many children, from 312 to 524 persons, respectively. This  growth occurred only in the rayons (cities) of the oblast,  whereas the number of such persons in Novosibirsk virtually did  not change (2,400 people).    The proportion of parents who have minor children or  congenitally handicapped children, in the total number of  unemployed is greater in the rayons of the oblast than in  Novosibirsk, and comes to 42.4 percent and 41.6 percent,  respectively.  <H5>  Refugees and Forced Resettlers </H5>   In 1993, the employment service of the oblast registered a  total of 145 such citizens, including 103 women. Thirty-five  persons were placed in jobs, including 24 women.  <H5>  The Size of Unemployment Benefits </H5>   The average annual size of unemployment benefits in  Novosibirsk Oblast, with payments for all dependents (including  children), came to 2,385 rubles [R] in 1992, and R24,627 per  unemployed person in 1993. The allowance for each dependent  comes to 10 percent of the size of the benefit.  <H5>  The Results of the Implementation of the Main Provisions of </H5> Employment Programs for 1993    A certain relaxation of strains on the labor market of the  oblast in 1993 was the main result of carrying out the program  for facilitating the employment of the population. Last year,  the employment service operated on the labor market more  effectively than in the previous year. The number of nonworking  citizens placed in jobs by the service increased by 12.8  percent, the number of those referred for vocational  training--by 263 percent, and the number of those enlisted in  public works--by a factor of 30.

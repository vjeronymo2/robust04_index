			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin has called on Asia-Pacific countries to strengthen  contacts and learn from each other's strong points so that the  countries in the region can realize common prosperity.    Jiang made the call at a meeting today with the ASEAN  Interparliamentary Organization (AIPO) delegation headed by Jose  C. de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives of the  Philippines.    Much potential is yet to be tapped in expanding economic  cooperation between China and ASEAN countries, Jiang said,  adding that there is already a sound base for mutual beneficial  cooperation and the prospect for further cooperation is bright.    While extending a welcome to the AIPO delegation, Jiang said  the speaker and all the parliamentarians in the delegation are  old friends of the National People's Congress (NPC) and of the  Chinese people as well. The delegation members have for many  years done a lot of useful work in enhancing ASEAN-China  relations and promoting exchanges between AIPO and the NPC.    The friendly exchanges between China and the ASEAN countries  and the friendship between the peoples date back a long time,  Jiang said. At the moment, he noted, their friendly cooperation  is deepening continuously, with fruitful results in political,  economic and scientific and cultural fields.    Congratulating China for its magnificent achievements in  economic development over the past years, De Venecia said China  has become a "significant force" of stability and development in  the Asia-Pacific region. He hoped to expand contacts and  exchanges with the NPC so as to effect a better mutual  understanding.    Present at the meeting were Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of  the  NPC Standing Committee, and Shi Liang, chairman of the NPC  Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

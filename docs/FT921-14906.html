			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Auditors' subscription may rise ACCOUNTANTS in England and Wales may face substantial increases in subscriptions but gain greater access to the workings of their professional association under plans for long-term reform, it emerged yesterday. The council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales proposed a Pounds 15 rise in the annual subscription for 1993 to Pounds 100 for members in the European Community of at least five years' standing, and a further increase of 12.5 per cent above inflation for the next two years. The council voted in favour of greater openness in the institute's operation and the provision of a range of new services at its annual conference in Birmingham at the weekend. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive, said last night the council voted unanimously that it would recommend raising subscription levels at a special meeting for members on June 2 this year. He said the increase was essential to compensate for the effects of the recession on institute's commercial activities, such as publication sales. The institute had a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 633,000 for the year to December 31 1990. He said unaudited figures for 1991 showed a loss of Pounds 200,000, and the 1992 budget estimates a further Pounds 500,000 loss including a Pounds 300,000 contingency item. The council approved a report on openness that would involve far greater access to institute meetings, more representation and wider circulation of documents of public interest. It discussed long-term objectives that might include more lobbying and advisory services for members, with emphasis on maintaining and promoting the image of the chartered accountancy qualification.</p>

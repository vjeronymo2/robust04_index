			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Costain hit by heavy contract provisions COSTAIN Group's fall in operating profits from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 2.9m followed losses in engineering and construction and in residential and commercial property, offset by mining profits. Provisions of Pounds 8m for the Channel tunnel contract and of Pounds 10m for six other problem contracts pushed the engineering and construction division into a Pounds 5.3m loss, compared with a Pounds 24.6m profit. Sales slipped to Pounds 933m (Pounds 979.1m). In residential and commercial property losses were reduced from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 7.1m. A further write-down of Pounds 49.5m (Pounds 32.5m) in land values - part of the exceptional items - reduced the average price per plot to Pounds 11,000, 18 per cent of the selling price. The exceptional write-down on commercial property amounted to Pounds 30.5m, mostly related to Spitalfields. Mining made a reduced contribution of Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 33.6m) after a slip in Australia from 1991's record levels. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said the Australian coal mining business, which has been sold to Hanson, contributed Pounds 19m. US mining was again disappointing. Management changes had been made and modernisation embarked on in Kentucky. Assets were written down by Pounds 33.9m. Discontinued housing and mineral businesses in the US accounted for most of the Pounds 56m extraordinary charge. Losses per share were 68.2p (37.5p). The shares fell from 35p to 29p. COMMENT With debt so high and questions still remaining over the values attached to Spitalfields and US mining, Costain's preoccupation must be with its balance sheet rather than its earnings for shareholders. Sadly it still has to run to keep still on its debt level. In April 1991 a Pounds 77m rights issue relieved peak debt of about Pounds 370m, then Pounds 101m was raked in for the investment property portfolio and now the crown jewels in Australia have been sold. It desperately needs to rebuild profitability in US mining for which so much was paid in the late 1980s. UK housing has also proved an expensive trip, but at least the write-downs should enable profitable sales. The heart of the business remains engineering and construction. The company swears it is not taking on unprofitable work, but the outlook for margins remains weak. This year it might break even before any further provisions. Debt and annual interest payments of well over Pounds 20m remain an albatross and it is difficult to see when a dividend might be resumed. It is hard to make a case for holding the shares.</p>

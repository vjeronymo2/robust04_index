			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Germany Yesterday's German money supply figures appeared to offer some comfort to the diminishing band of economists hoping for one more official rate cut. But though the deceleration in M3 growth was eye-catching, it owed much to special factors like the outflow of funds abroad and the tendency among investors to move out along the yield curve. The underlying picture is very much what one would expect of an economy in recovery. Private sector borrowing continues to grow. That gives the Bundesbank no incentive at all to cut rates. Indeed nervousness in the bond markets mean the bank cannot afford to take risks. The authorities have already betrayed a degree of concern about the backlog of funding with their decision to borrow at floating rates this week. While the looming election adds to the uncertainty, it will be followed by a fresh wage round. Last year the unions were modest in their demands in the erroneous belief that the economy would remain in deep recession. This year they may be more aggressive, especially given the sharp improvement in corporate earnings. Stability is unlikely finally to return to the bond market until investors are convinced that policy is credible. The Bundesbank has even less room to overlook the growth in credit demand while inflation remains close to 3 per cent. Yesterday's money supply figures may have afforded some relief, but the relevant question remains how long the bank will wait before raising rates rather than whether it will allow one last cut.</p>

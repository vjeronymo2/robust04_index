			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Goodyear confident of record quarter GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber's second-quarter net income is expected to be at the high end of analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 1.40 per share, according to Mr Stanley Gault, the group's chief executive, Reuter reports from Ohio. Mr Gault added that the US group stood a good chance of posting record sales for the quarter and first half. 'We are going to be in that range, and hopefully we are going to be at the upper end of it,' he said in an interview. 'The people who have been in the lower range of the estimates will be surprised.' As for sales, he said: 'We're very hopeful we will be able to announce record sales for the quarter. And if that is true, and that looks positive, that would enable us to have recorded record sales for the first half of the year,' he said. The group's previous second-quarter sales record was Dollars 2.87bn in 1990. It also set a first-half sales record in that year of Dollars 5.56bn. In last year's second quarter, net income amounted Dollars 22.5m or Dollars 0.38 a share on sales of Dollars 2.79bn. Mr Gault said he expected the gains to continue. 'We are having an excellent year,' he added. Asset sales and improved sales of replacement tyres were the reasons for the strong quarter. He said consumers had begun buying replacement tyres after having delayed replacing tyres during the recession. 'We're seeing the release of this pent up demand,' Mr Gault maintained. Goodyear will announce its 1992 second-quarter results on July 26. Mr Gault also said Goodyear was holding most of a 2.5 to 5.0 per cent price increase it announced in May. 'We think a pretty good portion of that will stick,' he declared. He also said there was a good chance that Goodyear would seek another price hike.</p>

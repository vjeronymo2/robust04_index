			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Observer: Imported talent Exciting times at The Economist, the weekly magazine part-owned by the Financial Times, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year. Having just appointed another astonishingly young editor, Japanophile Bill Emmott, it has now gone and imported an ex-Savannah shrimp-boater as chief executive. Marjorie Scardino, the 46-year-old president of The Economist's important North American business, is a little shy about her time on the boats. It was just an interlude before she and her journalist husband, Albert Scardino, settled down to their first love - the newspaper business. Scardino worked by day as a lawyer in her husband's home town of Savannah while helping him produce his weekly Georgia Gazette by night. The paper made a name for itself by winning a Pulitzer prize for its investigative reporting - but partly because of this was not a great commercial success. After her husband moved to The New York Times, she joined The Economist where, by all accounts, she has flourished. During her seven years, North American circulation has nearly trebled to 230,000 and several new publishing ventures have either been set up or acquired. The secret of The Economist's great success in North America has been much debated, but Scardino tells me that running the business is not much different from running a weekly local newspaper. How refreshingly honest.</p>

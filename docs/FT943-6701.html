			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Passionate talk, little action: James Harding explains domestic forces shaping US policy on Cuba The last time Cuban and US leaders sat down together was to celebrate the triumph of co-operation over conflict. The achievement, however, was not theirs. Under Pretoria's blue sky, Cuban President Fidel Castro and US Vice-President Al Gore, among others, shared the wonder of Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first democratically-elected president. In a year of handshakes between old enemies, the failure of the US and Cuban governments to end their cold war bickering has been an exception. The flood of refugees leaving the island over the past two weeks and, the US commitment to shelter them indefinitely, has once again exposed the anachronism of US Cuba policy and the domestic forces which shape it. The Clinton administration last week came to terms with one consequence of a tough stance on Cuban immigration. It announced that in future Cubans were not going to be granted access to the US but would be detained at the country's naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nevertheless people kept coming in increasing numbers and the US is having to prepare for a small city of Cuban refugees to be maintained until they can be repatriated. When and under what circumstances that repatriation will take place is unclear. The last time US-Cuba relations approached anything like harmony was in 1934. Then the US agreed to drop its right to intervene in the country's affairs and, in return, had the lease on its Guantanamo military base reaffirmed. President Clinton backs the trade embargo imposed on Cuba since 1963, following Castro's nationalisation of US land on the island, and, during the 1992 presidential election, was more enthusiastic than George Bush in backing the Cuban Democracy Act of that year. The act tightened the embargo by prohibiting overseas subsidiaries of US companies from selling goods to Cuba - but to increase the scope for a propaganda drive against the country allowed telecommunication links with the US. Unlike other economic sanctions imposed by the US - against Iraq or former Yugoslavia for example - the strategic aim of the embargo on Cuba is unclear. Asked what Cuba must do to bring an end to the embargo, Mr Clinton said only: 'Mr Castro knows the conditions for changing that policy.' State Department officials were equally vague; they wanted 'demonstrated evidence of Castro's commitment to change'. One camp that does have a clear idea of what US Cuba policy should entail is led by Mr Robert Torricelli, Democratic Congressman from New Jersey and sponsor of the Cuban Democracy Act. He wants to force the collapse of the Cuban economy in the belief that, when conditions become intolerable, its population will rise up and overthrow their oppressor. But the prospect of a mass uprising in a neighbouring country causes concern in Washington. The Central Intelligence Agency last year warned the president that serious instability on the island would have 'an immediate impact' on the US, spilling as many as 80,000 refugees and embroiling him in demands for US military intervention. There are also reports of dissent in the National Security Council, which co-ordinates foreign and military policy for the president. On Capitol Hill, the embargo is also under attack. Senator Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, has criticised the inconsistency of negotiating nuclear issues with North Korea and granting China the commercial advantages of Most Favoured Nation status, but not talking to Cuba. He advocates exploring 'the possibility of reaching some rapprochement'. The White House, however, is aware of dangers of softening its policy on Cuba. Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, was deputy secretary at the same department duringthe Carter administration that developed informal links with Havana - only to discover Cuba was sending 100,000 troops to assist the civil war in Ethiopia and to have Castro allow a flood of 125,000 Cubans to leave the country for the US from the port of Mariel in 1980. The Mariel exodus was a contributory factor in Jimmy Carter's subsequent election defeat. Mr Clinton too has his own scars from Mariel. After a riot at a Cuban refugee camp in Arkansas in 1980, sentiment turned against the state governor who was blamed for playing host to the Cubans. Partly as a result, Governor Clinton lost his campaign for re-election in 1980. More recently, Mr Clinton has realised the benefits of talking tough on Havana. His support for the Cuban Democracy Act won funding and votes from the traditionally Republican Cuban American community in Miami. Florida is an important state for the Democrats: though Mr Clinton lost it narrowly in the 1992 presidential election (with 39.2 per cent of the vote to George Bush's 40.9 per cent) it will be a target in the 1996 contest. More immediately, Florida's Democrat governor Lawton Chiles faces a strong challenge from Mr Jeb Bush (son of the former president) in November's gubernatorial election - and Mr Chiles is keen to play the Cuban card for votes. Ten days ago he demanded federal action to help the state cope with the flood of Cuban immigrants, successfully pre-empting Mr Clinton's decision to slam the doors shut. Similar political considerations would explain why Mr Clinton and Mr Chiles have kept Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, the Cuban American community's most prominent politician and businessman, on board. Support from Mr Mas Canosa's Cuban American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby and strongest advocate of the embargo, will be an important consideration in November's congressional, as well as gubernatorial, elections. Mr Charles Rangel, Democratic Representative from New York, says breaking with conservatives in the Cuban American community and opening talks with Havana to stimulate a free market and political democracy in Cuba would be proof of Mr Clinton's statesmanship. Mr Clinton is unlikely to respond to such a challenge. Though the Caribbean is increasingly becoming Mr Clinton's equivalent to Ronald Reagan's central America, there still seems little political benefit from intervention. Among US voters, apathy is still more common than anti-communist derision when it comes to Cuba. In the short term, the administration may just hope that the bad weather holds out long enough to deter people from leaving Cuba. If large numbers continue to come, Mr Clinton will probably look to his allies in the Americas and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to share the Cuban burden. Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who has supported calls for a dialogue, said on Thursday he feared that isolating one of the world's last revolutionary Communist strongholds was 'a response to the national passion rather than the national interest'. Two months away from Congressional mid-terms and a string of gubernatorial elections, satisfying that national passion by talking tough and doing little may well be the administration's priority on Cuba.</p>

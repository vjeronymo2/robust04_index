			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Mohair down to Pounds 907,000 British Mohair Holdings reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 907,000 in the first half of 1993 and said it expected the full year figure to be similar to the previous Pounds 2.1m. Mr Charles Fenton, chairman, said activity in the group's textile companies remained subdued in the period, with a lower contribution from the hand-knitting sector. Non-textile operations showed a marginal improvement. At present, demand for textile products showed no appreciable change, while the specialised engineering activities were expected to continue to trade satisfactorily. First-half turnover edged ahead from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 19.78m, while earnings per share slipped to 4.48p (5.22p). The interim dividend has been maintained at 1.4p.</p>

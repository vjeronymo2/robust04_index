			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Lazard Brothers withdraws Brewers Investment Trust Lazard Brothers yesterday withdrew its Brewers Investment Trust, launched late last month to invest mainly in quoted regional brewers. The withdrawal calls time on a conditional sale to the trust by Whitbread, the brewing and leisure group, which was to have received Pounds 27m for its remaining shares in the regional companies. Mr Peter Rintoul, Lazard's director of investment trusts, blamed market conditions generally, but particularly the new issues market, which had proved 'very difficult'. The trust was aiming to raise at least Pounds 50m. Whitbread said the trust had potentially been a convenient route for disposing of its regional brewery portfolio. But the collapse of the Pounds 27m deal would be no more than 'an irritant'. The sale would have ended the 'Whitbread umbrella', a 40-year-old portfolio of stocks in regional brewers designed to protect them from takeover. Most of its shares were sold in March for Pounds 225m in a 'bought deal' with Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The remainder of the portfolio - including shares in HP Bulmer, the cider maker, and brewers WH Brakspear, Hardys and Hansons and Joseph Holt - had been deemed to be harder to sell. The price paid by the trust attracted some criticism. Analysts suggested that instead of buying the shares at a discount typical in such transactions, the trust had paid a very full price. Mr Rintoul denied this. 'The portfolio was worth more today than it was when we contracted to buy it.' He was convinced that the basis of the trust had been correct. 'We remain very positive on the regional brewers,' he said. The trust was to have been managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, investment manager of Whitbread Investment Company for five years.</p>

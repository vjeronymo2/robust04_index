			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Peace Return, Vultures Flock </F> Back"]    [Text] The businessmen in Singapore, Bangkok, Tokyo and  London who see the evening news on television and read their  morning papers, all share a common viewpoint -- there is a  terrible war going on in Cambodia and they feel compelled to  invest their money in other countries.    Why such a negative view of Cambodia when peace is a reality  and the Khmer Rouge are nothing more than bandits engaging in  skirmishes with the Royal Army?    The answer lies with the foreign media who are vultures  looking for carcasses. The foreign press are busy painting gory  scenes of Cambodia, because even before the echoes of the  resounding booms of artillery die down, more gunfire reports  pour in.    Newspapers throughout the world resonate with "news" of the  unfortunate war-ridden country, spewing out information, more  information and even more information. In the process of  tarnishing this country, foreign newsmen emerge as heroes to  their employers, to other pressmen and to their own countries.    Meanwhile, in a small country, fighting the skirmishes of  war  and making valiant attempts to recover from its 20-year history  of factional rivalry, Cambodia has also to contend with an enemy  from within, namely the Western press it plays host to.    News reports are rife around the world about the country  beset by war after war, although what Cambodia is currently  facing are isolated incidents of skirmishes between guerrillas  and the government of the day.    The Western defenders of rights and morality who constantly  pound their Eastern lesser neighbours to a pulp over issues of  rights, have no social conscience.    Why is it Westerners can lay claim to having an active  conscience when it cannot even help salvage a country from its  destituteness, but instead destroy it even more.    Why are pressmen who are usually so inhibited in their home  country, and now let loose in a foreign country, suddenly  indulging and even encouraging all hell to break loose.    Skirmishes are brought to a proportion larger than life when  newsmen stationed in far-flung countries sending news to their  headquarters, want to appear battle-fatigued in the eyes of  their headquarter editors. In every foreign correspondent lurks  a Rambo, waiting to shoot off his pen.    In addition to that, news correspondents have to battle  stories generated from countries which have more to boast about  than skirmishes -- real on-going, full scale wars in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, Afghanistan, just to name a few. So  competition amongst foreign correspondents to churn out the  goriest, most sensational, most destabilising stories is a real  fact of being `one-up' on the competitor.    Hence, the more gory, sensational and the more colourful a  scene is painted, enables the foreign correspondents to appear  even more heroic.    There is a time and a place for everything, and the time has  passed for self-inflicted heroics.    It is time to do something constructive for the country  instead of running it down. Perhaps the Western self-proclaimed  protectors of the masses may consider writing the truth instead,  if they cannot condescend to defending the masses of Cambodia  and develop the country's needs.</p>

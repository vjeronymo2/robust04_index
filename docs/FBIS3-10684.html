			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The National Front for Change and Democracy,  FNCD, has taken a stand against the parliamentary plan. The  FNCD says it stands by its 16 February proposal, which is a  realistic compromise that can get the country out of the  deadlock. Daly Valet had a talk with Senator Turneb Delpe and  filed this report:    [Begin recording] [Valet] The FNCD is experiencing a bad  moment, a moment when there is so much confusion that FNCD  grassroots organizations and deputies who were close to the  front want to distance themselves from the FNCD. This confusion  has prevailed within the FNCD since the National Congress of  Democratic Movements [Conacom] deputies and leader [Victor  Benoit, also an FNCD spokesman] decided to support a  parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis.    Sen. Delpe, an FNCD spokesman, broke silence to say that  they  [not further identified] will solve all the problems being faced  by the FNCD. As for the parliamentary plan, Delpe says it is  dangerous. He says it is bad tactics for the parliamentarians to  engage in the negotiations so directly as to propose a plan for  resolving the crisis.    [Delpe] I think that, after the Washington agreement and the  Villa d'Accueil agreement, the Haitian parliament should have  drawn conclusions, learned a lesson, from the experience and not  involved itself again in any direct negotiations. Besides, now  there is the Governors Island agreement, which has defined the  role the parliament must play in the crisis: that is, pass the  laws ensuing from the Governors Island agreement.    I believe it would be in the interest of the parliament to  set limits for itself so that it does not bear the brunt of this  crisis once again. If things are tangled, I believe the only  step the parliament should take now is to find a way to prompt  the two protagonists to shoulder their responsibilities to  disentangle the country. [passage omitted]    [Valet] Evans Paul and Turneb Delpe, two of the FNCD's  [three] spokesmen, have signed a press release asking the  parliament to take President Aristide's position into  consideration -- otherwise there will be no compromise, they  said.    As regards the position of Conacom, which has said it  supports the parliamentary plan, Sen. Delpe says Conacom is an  autonomous party within the FNCD and has the right to take its  own position in an autonomous way. According to FNCD spokesman  Delpe then, Conacom's position is not the FNCD's. [passage  omitted]    Thus, through two of its spokesmen, Evans Paul and Turneb  Delpe, the FNCD has reiterated its determination to see  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to Haiti.

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Russian oil output set to fall Oil output is expected to continue falling this year in Russia but more slowly than last year, while debts between state-owned enterprises will remain a problem for years, according to the economics ministry's forecast for the year ahead. It expects gross domestic product to fall just 5 per cent this year compared with 12 per cent in 1993, and industrial production to decline by 6 per cent compared to 16 per cent last year. Goods traffic is forecast to decline by only 6 per cent against 29 per cent last year. Oil and gas condensate production, an important source of hard currency for the country, would total 327m tonnes compared to 354m tonnes last year. The ministry is also predicting an increase in unemployment from its present level of around 1 per cent to 5 per cent of the population next year. The forecast, assuming roughly similar policies to those pursued last year, with a few improvements such as an end to free loans to other former Soviet republics, clings to the government's goal of driving inflation down to 5 per cent a month by the end of 1994. This compares to 15 per cent last month. The ministry expects the budget deficit will not exceed 6 per cent of gross domestic product next year - close to the 5 per cent target which the government has set itself ever since the launch of radical reforms in January 1992. However, the report, which does not explore the implications of the successes of ultra-nationalists and Communists in last month's parliamentary elections, also points out that achievement of the government's goals depends on its improved performance - including the more effective use of state funds for investment in industry, and improved tax collection.</p>

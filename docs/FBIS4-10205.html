			<p>BFN     [Text] There is already a shortage of oil products in the  southwest Dominican Republic. The people in the border cities of  the southwest of the Dominican Republic have been deprived of  fuel for several days due to the flourishing trafficking of oil  products with Haiti, according to what the correspondent for the  Haitian press agency in Santo Domingo has seen. This situation  has paralyzed the enterprises in several Dominican cities,  including Duverger, (Villard), Ragua, Neyba, Galvan, Tamayo, and  Vicente Noble. Besides, numerous Dominicans, who went to these  cities for Holy Week, have not been able to return to the cities  from which they came due to lack of transportation.    Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, whose regime is  accused  of violating the sanctions imposed on Haiti, stated on 2 April,  during an electoral tour of Romana city, that his government was  employing all necessary efforts to definitively control  smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border. The ban on smuggling  is part of a new strategy aimed at restoring democracy in Haiti,  said the Dominican head of state.    The announcement of these measures was made following the  visit to Santo Domingo last week of U.S. Senator Christopher  Dodd, who told President Balaguer about the the United States'  concern over the increasing violation of human rights in Haiti.</p>

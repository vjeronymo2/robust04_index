			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 ARRESTED, 1 SOUGHT IN VAN NUYS KIDNAPING  </P> <P> Police arrested one man and were looking for another in connection with the  kidnaping and pistol-whipping of a Van Nuys man after a drug deal apparently  went sour, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A Kern County sheriff's deputy found the victim, John McGuigan, 25, bound and  bleeding on the Tejon Ranch about 45 miles south of Bakersfield about 12:30  p.m. Monday, Senior Deputy Richard Dixon said.  </P> <P> McGuigan had been kidnaped Sunday night in Van Nuys, beaten with a handgun,  tied up and placed in the trunk of a car by two men, Dixon said. Los Angeles  police had been investigating McGuigan's disappearance based on information  from relatives who said they believed he might have been killed, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The Kern County sheriff's deputy found the victim lying in a field after he  went to investigate a car that was parked alongside I-5, Dixon said. Victor  Balanos-Cazares, 24, of Van Nuys, was arrested after he fled from the scene on  foot and tried to buy a shirt and some shoes from area residents, Dixon said.  The second man, identified as Jose Ledesma, 23, also of Van Nuys, was still at  large Tuesday.  </P> <P> Balanos-Cazares had been guarding McGuigan since about 8 a.m., when a tire on  the men's car went flat on their flight north, Dixon said. He threw a gun away  as he ran from authorities, police said.  </P> <P> "Apparently, it was a dope deal that went bad," Dixon said. He would not  elaborate.  </P> <P> McGuigan was treated and released at Kern County Medical Center in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Kern County sheriff's deputies have turned the investigation over to Los  Angeles police, who are searching for Ledesma, authorities said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH OIL TANKER ACCIDENTS IN COASTAL WATERS  </P> <P> How about kinder-gentler-safer oil spills that won't endanger any species  including man (maybe even women and children).  </P> <P> No matter how "fail safe" they make these monsters of the deep (and shallow)  they will continue to spill and there will always be logical explanations for  each and every one of them.  </P> <P> Unexpected explosions, sand bars, storms, etc.  </P> <P> The oil companies should use a fleet of smaller oil tankers with a standard  maximum of oil that can be carried that the ocean can easily accommodate to  prevent complete devastation when spills occur.  </P> <P> There will always be faulty tankers, crews, skippers and very slow inadequate  cleanups. If these big oil companies finally realize that oil spills cost a lot  in money and the lives of many species they might even heed an idea that isn't  their own.  </P> <P> PAT COIL  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Nigeria to face debt arrears pressure British government officials are expected to express concern about Nigeria's growing external debt arrears, in talks in London today with Mr Kalu Kalu, the country's finance minister. Arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) external debt exceed Dollars 6bn and are expected to reach Dollars 8.5bn by the end of this year. The military government's decision to revalue the naira in last January's budget and reintroduce an import licensing system has deepened the rift with the International Monetary Fund. Most creditors now rule out an early policy agreement with the Fund, on which debt rescheduling would be conditional. Mr Kalu, who arrived in London at the weekend, is on a 10-day visit to London, Washington and Paris in an attempt to restore confidence in General Sani Abacha's regime. Gen Abacha dropped plans for a handover to an elected civilian government, prompting western governments to introduce limited sanctions, including visa restrictions. During his meetings Mr Kalu will try to convince officials that Nigeria will keep its promise to remove the budget deficit, and that government controls on the economy will be relaxed by the middle of this year. He is also likely to point out that the decline in oil prices has wiped at least 30 per cent off Nigeria's export earnings in the past 12 months. Western creditors were dismayed when the 1994 budget pegged interest rates well below inflation, centralised the allocation of foreign exchange and fixed the exchange rate at twice its market value. Over half Nigeria's external debt and nearly all the arrears are owed to the Paris Club, which has linked debt relief to economic policies approved by the the IMF. Economists have raised doubts about the forecast balanced budget which makes no provision for servicing domestic debt, which officials estimate at N370bn (Pounds 11.5bn). Mr Kalu, who as finance minister in 1986 argued strongly for economic reforms based on a market-determined exchange rate, has put his reputation at stake since his appointment to the ministry by General Abacha. Most observers saw the budget as incompatible with the private views of Mr Kalu, who has worked for the World Bank. Many fear that control of policy making is in the hands of a clique of populist politicians who oppose Mr Kalu's prescription for economic deregulation.</p>

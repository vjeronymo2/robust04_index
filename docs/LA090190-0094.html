			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACKS BLAST HANDLING OF ATTACK ON GIRL;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: ACTIVISTS CLAIM AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO ASSAULT OF  CHEERLEADER. PROTESTS VOWED.  </P> <P> Outraged over the Aug. 6 attack on an Orange County cheerleader that they  believe was racially motivated, black activists Friday condemned the handling  of the case by local authorities.  </P> <P> Amber Jefferson, a 15-year-old Garden Grove freshman who should have been at  her first cheerleading performance Friday, instead sat silently, her jaw wired  shut and the side of her face stitched together, as black leaders promised  candlelight vigils, church meetings and a possible appeal for state  intervention on her case.  </P> <P> While no charges have been filed as a result of a brawl that left Jefferson  seriously injured, investigators and prosecutors said the case is among their  highest priorities and promised a full investigation of any and all racial  motives. But black leaders remained unconvinced.  </P> <P> "The (Orange County) sheriff's handling of this case is tantamount to  tolerating racial violence, which could very well lead to even worse  incidents," Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, declared at a press conference  here.  </P> <P> "Southern California does not need, nor should it invite, a situation that  would be branded nothing less than 'Bensonhurst West,' " Ridley-Thomas said,  flanked by top local and state officials from the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union  and other black activists.  </P> <P> Bensonhurst, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, became a symbol of racial violence  last year after a black teen-ager, visiting the area with two black friends to  look for a used car, was attacked and killed by a white mob.  </P> <P> In the Orange County case, the racial elements in the attack on Jefferson are  still in dispute, with no criminal charges filed.  </P> <P> What is known is that Jefferson was badly beaten and slashed during a midnight  brawl outside a Stanton apartment complex that involved more than a dozen  people. On one side there were mostly white teen-agers and a 42-year-old man,  and on the other, several black, white and Latino youths -- Amber's friends.  </P> <P> Some among the white group under investigation in the attack have maintained  that the fight was not about race, but about jealous girlfriends. Jefferson --  who by all accounts was not involved in the argument that triggered the fight  -- made the mistake of being caught in the middle of it, they have said.  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's Department initially said it was not investigating  the incident as a racial attack. But under intense criticism from local  activists, the department this week recommended the district attorney's office  consider using a state "hate crime" law, for racially motivated attacks,  against three of Jefferson's alleged attackers.  </P> <P> The department also recommended a host of other assault and criminal charges  against up to a dozen participants -- including some among Jefferson's group.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that (the activists) would prejudge this case," Orange County  Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi said Friday. "What happened to Amber is obviously  tragic, but it's our responsibility to deal with it in a professional manner,  not an emotional one, and this case has got our attention at our highest  levels."  </P></p>

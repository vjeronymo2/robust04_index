			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Anding (2621 1344 1353) and Ding Jianming </F> (0002 1017 6900)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- Liu Zhongli, minister  of finance and director of the State General Administration of  Taxation, answered Chinese and foreign reporters' questions  concerning China's financial and taxation reform this year at  the news center for the "two sessions" today.    In answering a question regarding the issuance of treasury  bonds this year, Liu Zhongli said: A total of 100 billion yuan  of treasury bonds are planned to be issued this year. Although  the total amount of bonds issued is much larger than that of  last year, the issue is expected to go smoothly because the  financial order this year is good, the bonds have a preferential  interest rate, and the method of issuance has greatly improved.  In particular, banking institutions have cooperated closely to  handle issuance work on this occasion. Bonds will be  underwritten by banks and other financial institutions, which  will be responsible for resale to investors who can make  purchases at any time. Because they are easy to purchase and  because of other favorable conditions, including the  inflation-proof interest rate, the work will be supported by the  people.    Speaking of China's foreign debts, Liu Zhongli said: China  has achieved great results in utilizing international funds in  recent years. The total amount of China's current foreign debts  is $80 billion, including funds provided by foreign investors of  Chinese-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and  wholly foreign-owned enterprises, as well as loans obtained by  enterprises and the government. At present, the ratio of  China's total foreign debts to its annual export value is 90  percent and its debt service ratio is 7.6 percent, which are far  lower than the internationally recognized warning levels, which  are 100 percent in debt ratio and 15 percent in debt service  ratio. China has enjoyed a good international credit rating.  As of last February, China's foreign exchange reserve had  increased to $27.2 billion from $21.2 billion recorded at the  end of last year.    Speaking of ways to reduce this year's deficit, Liu Zhongli  said: We will no longer use bank overdrafts to cover our  deficit. Instead, we hope to reduce the deficit first by  effectively controlling the scale of capital construction; and  second, by reducing the loss of tax revenues through  implementation of the new taxation system.    In response to a reporter's question on whether the  introduction of the tax-revenue-sharing system will affect state  revenue, Liu Zhongli answered: Judging from developments in the  first two months after introduction of this system, the overall  situation is good. The state's revenue reported a relatively  large increase over the previous year, growing 31.2 percent.  The increase in expenditures, however, is also not small.  Therefore, it is necessary for us to keep a sober mind. We  should promptly take measures to solve problems cropping up  during the course of carrying out the tax-revenue-sharing system  to gradually perfect it.    In response to a reporter's question on whether  implementation of the revenue-sharing system implies that the  central government is withdrawing the delegated authority and  China's policy allowing some regions to become prosperous ahead  of others has changed, Liu Zhongli said: Revenue-sharing is a  commonly practiced system throughout the world. The  revenue-sharing tax system we are implementing has borrowed the  experience of developed countries while taking into  consideration China's national conditions. In implementing the  system, the central government has not withdrawn the delegated  authority. It is true that more tax revenues will be collected  by the central government, but they will be returned to  localities through a refund system. The refund will use 1993's  actual revenue receipts as the base, and the refunded amount  will be available to localities to use in prescribed ways.  Naturally, the central government will appropriately collect  more revenues from the increased portions of tax receipts, which  is necessary. Besides, the central government will also return  a fixed proportion of the increased revenues to localities.    In response to a reporter's question on whether the  implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system will affect  economic growth in coastal and other developed provinces and  municipalities, Liu Zhongli said: Implementation of the  revenue- sharing tax system will not and should not affect local  economic growth. Economic growth in the first two months  following implementation of the system has made this clear.  Under the revenue-sharing tax system, the central and local  governments will share added-value taxes from a growing economy.  This benefits both the central and local governments.    A reporter asked: Comrades in the central and western  regions are worried that with implementation of the  revenue-sharing tax system, the central government will abolish  some of the preferential policies granted to central and western  regions; how should this question be approached? Vice Finance  Minister Xian Huaicheng said: There is no need to worry about  that. Implementation of the system will not change the existing  interest distribution pattern, and the subsidies given by the  central government to central and western regions, and poor  provinces and autonomous regions in the past will continue.  Some of the original preferential policies will be retained if  they accord with regulations. Besides, a payment shift [zhuan  yi zhi fu 6567 4448 2388 0102] system will be established  following implementation of the revenue-sharing tax system,  which will benefit central and western regions, and poor  provinces and autonomous regions most.    Jin Xin, deputy director of the State General Administration  of Taxation, attended the news conference.</p>

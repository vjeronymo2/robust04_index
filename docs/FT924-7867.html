			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (1): Evidence of growing goodwill - Ian Rodger highlights efforts towards political and economic co-operation between Tokyo and Brussels A FEW months ago, a Japanese tourist, one of thousands who each year ride the famous cog railway to the Jungfraujoch high in the Bernese alps, was horrified to discover a frenzy of Japanese graffiti scrawled on the rocky peak. Looking closely, he even discovered the signature of the deputy mayor of his native town of Kurobe, and when he got home he complained. The deputy mayor admitted his crime and offered to pay for the clean up. Responding in kind, the Bernese said they were touched by the offer, but they welcomed Japanese visitors and did not mind having to clean off the graffiti every few years themselves. It was a small incident, but it would be nice to think that it is representative of a growing goodwill between Japanese and European peoples. Goodwill was massively present during the memorable Japan Festival in Britain last autumn, and other European countries are now trying to set up similar festivals. It also seems to be reflected in efforts in the past few years to deepen and strengthen political and institutional relations between Tokyo and Brussels. Japan and Europe certainly have many good reasons to get to know each other better. They are both emerging global powers, struggling to find roles in the post cold war world order, and sharing the frustrations of operating in the shadow of the US. They also share anxiety about the future of their giant but crippled mutual neighbour, Russia. Thanks to a large and growing volume of industrial investment in each other's territory, they both have a big interest in each other's economic health. And Japanese industrialists have been prominent among those monitoring closely the drama over the Maastricht treaty (see pages 2 and 4). While bilateral cultural links have not been as strong as those that each has with the US, there is nevertheless a deeply rooted base. A legacy of European influence on Japan's entry into the modern world in the second half of the 19th century is still widely present in Japanese language and customs. An X-ray in Japanese is a rentogen (from Rontgen, its German inventor), a ski slope is a gelande. The transliteration of English sounds into Japanese characters is based on British pronunciation, not American. Nevertheless, the relationship has remained superficial, dogged by misunderstandings and mistrust at the official level and plagued by stereotyping at the popular level. A recent study of British newspapers' treatment of Japan found that the popular papers still concentrate on war atrocity and 'funny Jap' stories. In France, senior politicians could, until recently, score popular points by making insulting remarks about Japanese. Similarly, many Japanese still hold simplistic and patronising views of Europeans as self-satisfied and lazy custodians of art galleries and baroque palaces. Until the late 1980s, official contacts between Japan and European countries were, as with almost all of Japan's external relationships, essentially one dimensional, concerned only with trade and economic relations. The conditions for change were set in the aftermath of the Plaza revaluation of the yen in 1985 when Japan's economic superpower status came to be recognised for what it was. Japanese leaders gradually began to accept - and in rare cases, to covet - a greater role in world affairs. In a landmark speech at the Mansion House in London in May, 1988, Mr Noboru Takeshita, the then Japanese prime minister, declared that the era of US domination of the West was over and that a structure of joint leadership by the 'trilateral partners,' as he called the US, western Europe and Japan, was emerging. 'There is an imperative need for effective and balanced co-operation, both politically and economically, between the trilateral partners,' he said. 'It cannot be denied, however, that the relations between Japan and Europe, which form one side of the triangle, have not been close enough, compared with the other two sides.' Today, few would dispute that progress in building closer relations between Japan and Europe has been disappointly modest. It has often seemed that the EC was dragging its feet, but Mr Peter Ludlow of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels puts most of the blame on the Japanese - 'the number of common issues Japan is willing to talk about is rather limited,' he says. IN November, 1990, following the signing of a comprehensive bilateral accord between the US and the EC, Tokyo proposed that a similar treaty be negotiated between the EC and Japan. Brussels agreed, but negotiations were tortuous. Tokyo tried to take the high road, seeing the treaty as a way to set up frameworks for regular contacts on political and strategic matters and for cultural and scientific exchanges. But the EC wanted to insert clauses requiring Japan to open its markets and to agree that both sides would seek 'a balance of benefits' from the relationship. In the wake of the signing of the Joint Declaration in July, 1991, the EC has certainly not restrained its tendency to pursue trade issues. Last year, Japanese exporters were the subject of six definitive anti-dumping decisions, compared with only three in 1990. Also, after years of testy negotiations, the EC won agreement to restrict Japanese car imports until 1999. On the political front, however, little has been achieved, and with each side more and more preoccupied with problems in its own region, there is little prospect of further progress at the moment. As Mr Tomohiko Kobayashi, Japan's ambassador to the EC, acknowledged in an interview for this survey. 'At this point, we cannot do very spectacular things.' It would be wrong to be too disappointed about this state of affairs. The triangle, which has become an oft quoted symbol of the need for building up the EC-Japan relationship, is probably too ambitious a representation of the possibilities. Neither side is yet willing or perhaps able to threaten its relationship with the US to strengthen their bilateral ties. And each has security and foreign policy priorities elsewhere - the EC in eastern Europe, Japan in east Asia - that for the foreseeable future are likely to rank ahead of their bilateral relationship. Meanwhile, however, contacts at the individual, corporate and institutional levels are multiplying and deepening. For example, more than 200 Japanese owned companies now carry out research and development activities in the EC. Exchanges of managers, professionals, teachers and students, not to mention tourists, have mushroomed in the past decade. All of which should, like the gesture of the deputy mayor of Kurobe, help to build the goodwill upon which a stronger political relationship can eventually be established.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (AFP)--The main exporter of Chinese  arms charged Friday [27 May] that US President Bill Clinton's  decision to bar imports of Chinese firearms and ammunition was  "discriminatory." A spokesman for the North Industrial Co  (NORINCO) said, "Our arms exports to the United States have  always been made in conformity with US law."    "The US side unilaterally decided to ban arms imports from  China only. This measure is clearly discriminatory, and we  would like to express our extreme displeasure," he said. The  spokesman denied information published in the United States that  NORINCO was owned by the Chinese military. "These reports are  completely without foundation," he said.    Clinton announced Thursday the renewal for one year of most-  favored-nation status for China, but at the same time slapped an  embargo on about 200 million dollars in Chinese arms and  ammunition imported annually into the United States. China is  the United States' primary foreign supplier of rifles and  handguns. Over the last three years, companies such as NORINCO,  Polytechnology and Jinganco have sold about two million handguns  to the US market, western experts said.    According to foreign experts, NORINCO has mainly exported  hunting rifles, pistols and ammunition for non-military use to  the US market. The Chinese are, in addition, suspected by some  US circles of copying famous brands of guns and selling them  overseas at prices that undercut the originals, one arms expert  said. The defense sector, to which NORINCO belongs, has been  forced in recent years to devote most of its activities to  producing civilian items such as buses, mopeds and washing  machines. About 70 percent of such companies' production is now  for civilian purposes.</p>

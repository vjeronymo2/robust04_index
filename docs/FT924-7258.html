			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (21): Unladylike practices - Gillian Upton on problems faced by businesswomen 'IT'S RARE to find a friendly receptionist who isn't patronising and who doesn't tell everyone in the reception area what your room number is.' 'Stewardesses pay little attention to women travellers, they are far too busy 'fawning over' male business travellers.' 'Restaurants seem embarrassed to have women eating alone and put them in a corner and frequently forget them.' These quotes illustrate some of the problems encountered by the growing band of female travelling executives. The comments have been taken from various surveys of women travellers undertaken by The Businesswoman's Travel Club (BWTC) since setting up in the UK in the late Eighties to persuade the travel industry - principally airlines, hotels and restaurants - to change its attitudes towards women and to take account of their practical and security needs. The travel industry has been slow to wake up to the needs of female business travellers. It was so easy when the majority of business travel was undertaken by men; facilities and services were developed to meet their needs expressly. But two things have changed. The global recession has forced the travel industry to go after any business, particularly those smaller market segments they could afford to ignore in the good days. Second, the growth, albeit from a small base, in the number of travelling women executives has been significant over the past couple of years. American Express believes that the number of women travellers in the UK alone has jumped from 11 per cent in 1989 to 17 per cent last year. Hotels generally have to be credited with attempting to improve in-room facilities over the period although this improvement is not industry-wide. Hotels aware of the problems have installed skirt hangers, hair dryers, better lighting, better-positioned mirrors and bathrobes. But there is still a problem getting irons in rooms. Other items that women travellers have lobbied for fall into the security area so are pertinent to both sexes. Most good hotels now have in-door spy holes and door chains. Product enhancements in hotels (and some in airlines, male or female overnight toiletry kits, for example) and female images in industry advertisements have silenced some of the critics, but staff attitudes have not changed. Far Eastern airlines, in particular, still fawn over the men. At check-in, airlines often ignore women, presuming them to be travelling with the man in front and also presume women have a greater tolerance of crying babies by sitting them next to mothers with children. Stewardesses still assume the man sitting next to a woman is her husband. Hotels and restaurants general adopt the same attitude, assuming that women are not there on business. Even though a woman has made it clear she is the host, the waiter will still give the wine to the man to sample and also present him with the bill. It is common to hear of restaurant staff sitting lone women at the worst table - by the kitchen door, toilets, or behind a pillar. It is no wonder that so many women choose not to patronise hotel bars and restaurants and opt for an in-room video and room service. Some hotels attempt to circumvent this problem by reserving a table in their restaurant for individual women to meet and eat together. One London hotel which runs this is the Langham Hilton. 'Our biggest complaint from women was having to sit in their room on their own,' explained general manager Rudi Jagersbacher. 'We have two or three people using it each evening.' However, the most vociferous lobbyists would prefer that the problem be tackled at source by changing attitudes, which are ingrained, particularly in older staff. 'One of the toughest things is to re-educate the staff,' admits Ramon Pajares, general manager of Four Seasons Inn on the Park in London. His comments also reflect the pan-European situation as he is also general manager and regional vice-president Europe for EHMA (European Hotel Managers' Association). 'Younger staff can handle it so much better; they only need guidelines from management,' says Mr Pajares. 'It's a problem in older staff, they need repeated training. You can't give them a lecture once and forget about it, you have to monitor it. You must tell them not to place women in a corner, to talk freely to them as they would any man on his own, and so on. 'More than anything else staff don't know how to handle the situation. They either over-react and alienate the women or ignore them.' The BWTC culls the opinions and comments from its 200-strong UK members to offer a database of hotels recommended for their positive attitude and pertinent facilities for female travellers. In the French capital Le Crillon makes the list, in New York the Penta, Plaza and Lowell, in Hamburg the Hotel Europaischer Hof and Hanseatic, in London the Basil Street Hotel and at Gatwick the Stanhill Court hotel. 'You can put locks on the doors but if the front office staff still show the room key number or shout it out it's still no good,' explains Ros Martin, general manager of the BWTC. 'Attitudes are improving but there's still a long way to go,' says Mr Martin. 'Individually-run hotels do it better than chains - with the exception of the Lady Crest rooms at Forte Crest - and we do find that those hotels managed by women are more aware of the problem.' In London, for example, only four of the big chain hotels are run by women general managers: The Sheraton Belgravia, Athenaeum, Conrad Chelsea Harbour and the May Fair Inter-Continental. Some 20 per cent of the clientele of the May Fair is female. General manager Dagmar Woodward believes the higher ratio of female receptionists now standard to most hotels has helped ease the attitude problem. 'I think what is important is not getting special or different service but the same service, with the exception of security. Well-lit corridors are important and we put female guests as close as we can to the lifts, on the main corridor,' she says. 'What's important in a restaurant is not being put in a corner, or next to a single man or four rowdy men. Women also have more self-assurance now, and that helps too.'</p>

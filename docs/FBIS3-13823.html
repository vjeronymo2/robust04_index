			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: </F> "Jewish Chutzpah"]    [Text] Among the congressmen who signed the petition to  President Clinton on the issue of Jerusalem were several  politicians regarded by Jewish and Israeli lobbyists as lost  cases, almost anti-Semites. On the face of it, collecting the  signatures of 82 congressmen for the sake of Jerusalem would  seem to be a heart-warming achievement for Israel and its  friends in America. In fact, it was a cheeky action on the part  of Jewish functionaries, an unprecedented deed in relations  between the sovereign State of Israel and the Jewry of the  diaspora, perhaps even between any sovereign state and an ethnic  minority that bears no responsibility for the consequences of  its deeds and misdeeds.    Only a short distance separated their action from a veto of  the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution, which might have  turned into a veto of the peace process. This event should  shake the Israeli Government out of its complacency regarding  the compromises waiting down the road. As long as the argument  is over Israel's security -- and the subsequent debate about the  contribution of the settlements -- the mainstream of the U.S.  Jewish community avoids wars to the last drop of Israeli blood.  Only a marginal minority challenged the Oslo agreement and  spoke against concessions on the Golan Heights in exchange for  peace with Syria.    Israel's legal government shoved the handshake with the  unshaven and kaffiyeh-clad Arab down their throat. It was  Yitzhaq Rabin, the Six-Day War general, and not the left-wing  Yosi Beilin who presented them with the fait accompli that the  dimensions of Greater Israel will not be so great when peace  comes. Barukh Goldstein, the doctor from Brooklyn, embarrassed  them and set the ground under the settlements on fire. The  battle over Jerusalem on the eve of the UNSC resolution put the  color back in their cheeks.    Never before has a group of Jews so insolently exploited its  political clout to thwart a diplomatic compromise reached by  Israeli and U.S. Government leaders. They played the role of a  distinct opposition to Israel's legal government by manipulating  a political system that has absolutely nothing to do with  Israel's political or security interests. Most of the  congressmen who signed the petitions took the name of Jerusalem  in vain, just to please their Jewish constituents and tycoons.  Others added their signature yesterday to be able to ask Connie  Mack or Alfonse D'Amato tomorrow to endorse the initiative  against a tobacco tax which threatens to ruin the livelihood of  cigarette manufacturers in their constituencies.    As long as the argument was conducted in coordination with  the Israeli Government, the latter felt at peace with the fact  that the Jews and the U.S. Congress presented clear limits to  the administration with regard to Jerusalem. It could do no  harm to show the Americans that when it comes to concessions on  Jerusalem, Israel demands a special price. However, the Jewish  warriors did not make do with an explicit commitment from the  U.S. President, the vice president, and the secretary of state  that the refusal to veto the UNSC resolution does not attest to  an erosion in the administration's position vis-a-vis Jerusalem.  The worst of the lot, led by Washingtonian pressure groups that  did not digest the recognition of the PLO, seized on the issue  of Jerusalem. They took advantage of a Jewish apparatus which  had been founded by and for Israel to undermine a policy they  opposed.    As far as they were concerned, the chance of a veto that  would thwart the efforts to heal the wounds of the Hebron  massacre was an opportunity to save Israel from continuing to  make concessions to the Arabs. According to them, Jerusalem is  not just the capital of Israel but "the capital of the Jewish  people." In a few days, as they do on Passover every year, they  will declaim "Next Year in Jerusalem" and proceed to check how  the construction of their villas in Beverly Hills and on Long  Island is getting along.    Seeing that this is not the first and probably not the last  time that Jerusalem becomes a topic on the agenda of the peace  process and gets the adrenalin of American Jews racing, we would  seem to have no other choice but tell them in no uncertain  terms: Jerusalem is the spiritual and religious capital of the  Jewish people. Jerusalem is the political capital of the  citizens of the State of Israel, just like Tel Aviv is their  financial capital and Washington is the sole capital of the  citizens of the United States, including the Jews. As long as  the Israeli Government does not propose to hand over the Western  Wall to the Muslim Waqf and to ban Jews from visiting the tombs  of their ancestors on the Mount of Olives, the right of Jews to  meddle in Israel's affairs is identical to their right to  interfere in the negotiations about the size of the Palestinian  police force in Gaza.    A capital is first and foremost the manifestation of a  state's sovereignty. There is no clearer sign of weakness than  to permit the citizens of a foreign country -- be they Jews,  Christians, or Muslims -- to dictate to an elected government a  policy concerning its capital. It is a pity that in his  appearance at the AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs  Committee] convention, the prime minister chose to voice the  same old tunes they so much like to hear about his struggle for  a united eternal city instead of telling them that Jerusalem is  far too important to be a pawn in the hands of wheeler-dealers  in the diaspora. The Jews of America usually begin fund-raising  banquets by singing the U.S. and Israeli anthems. For those  who make do with donating money to Israel, the words "being a  free people in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem" are  nothing more than lip service.</p>

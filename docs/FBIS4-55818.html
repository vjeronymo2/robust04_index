			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [HINA report: "The Home Guard as a Basis"] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo -- "The Joint Command of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is  organizing a contemporary type of defense based on the examples  set forth by the military organization of West European  countries with the ultimate aim of joining organizations such as  the `Partnership for Peace'. As a federal army, we could be  among the first to be accepted into this organization," General  Ante Roso, HVO representative in the Joint Command of the  Federation that has recently become operational in Sarajevo,  told Sarajevo OSLOBODJENJE on Thursday [19 May].    According to General Roso, the Croatian side has proposed  that the home guard be the basis of the Federation's future  defense. "In this way, neither would the Croats disarm the  Bosniaks, nor would the Bosniaks disarm the Croats." The other  component of the defense system would be the regular army, in  which 18 to 25 year olds -- male and female -- would serve a 10  to 12 month term, said General Roso, and added that, for  example, a student could serve his or her term in some  institute, because "carrying arms is not the only way to serve  in the army...."    The third component of the Federation's defense would be  professional brigades for interventions and border units. The  Joint Command of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in  Sarajevo is for the time being not making any decisions on  combat activities, and it does not have the authority to  directly command the forces. The Command creates conditions for  maintaining the current cease-fire, the safety of  communications, and the restoration of trust between people,  said General Roso.</p>

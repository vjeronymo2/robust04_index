			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The labor/management group suggested replacing the reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``motorist'' with ``highway user'' inasmuch as highway traffic is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to motorists. FRA agrees, and has changed the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group also recommended that the phrase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``at a minimum'' be eliminated from this section and &sect;234.107. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group believed that the phrase is unnecessary and that it could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be misinterpreted as implying that additional action could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary in response to a report of a malfunction. As stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discussion of &sect;234.1, FRA intends that the rule issued today  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies the minimum actions a railroad must take in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. Section 234.1 has been revised to make clear that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part does not restrict a railroad from adopting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcing additional or more stringent requirements not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with this part. Thus, given the revision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;234.1, references in &sect;234.105 and 234.107 to minimum actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be taken by a railroad have been deleted as unnecessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The labor/management group also noted that manual operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of defective warning devices was not addressed in the NPRM and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that such operation should be considered to be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alternative means'' of giving warning, with the result that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train could proceed through the crossing at normal speed. FRA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that if a warning system is manually activated, a train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can proceed through the crossing at normal speed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;234.105(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA received a number of comments pertaining to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of &sect;234.105(b) that ``the highway traffic control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority having jurisdiction over the crossing'' be notified of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the crossing system malfunction. The Southern Pacific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation Company and related railroads recommended deletion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this requirement because it ``would be very difficult for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroads to determine who to call, and to maintain such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database.'' The railroad further stated that ``it is not likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that highway traffic authority will respond due to their own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shortages of staff, and even if they do respond, they may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to properly staff the crossing *&blank;*&blank;* .'' West Virginia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Transportation (WVDOT) commented that notifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway traffic authority would only be appropriate during normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business hours. WVDOT suggested that it would be better to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the appropriate law enforcement agency. We fully agree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA always intended that notification be given to the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency charged with traffic enforcement on the road, whether that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the local police, sheriff's department or state police.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA's use of the term ``highway traffic authority'' was misleading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and FRA is therefore replacing that term with ``law enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency.'' The LIRR, which presently uses its own railroad police  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extensively in situations of grade crossing warning malfunctions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifies the local police only when its own uniformed police are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to respond or due to high volume of traffic flow at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crossing. FRA considers notification of railroad police who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of responding and controlling vehicular traffic to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to notification of the appropriate ``law enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency.'' The final rule is being modified accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;234.105(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to a commenter's suggestion, this subsection is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rearranged to be consistent with the arrangement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;234.107(c). Both subsections begin with the flagging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements which permit train operations at normal speed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsections then address those situations which are progressively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more restrictive on train operations. References in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following discussion are to the subsection numbers as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised section number as it appears in the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows in parentheses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, subsection 105(c) requires that upon receipt of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a credible report of malfunction, a railroad must provide or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrange for alternative means of actively warning motorists of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaching trains, consistent with requirements detailed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (1) through (4). FRA is deleting the phrase ``or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrange for'' in the first sentence of this subsection. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad may provide for alternative means of warning highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users by providing its own flaggers, or it may contract with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another entity to provide that warning. FRA is deleting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above phrase to avoid the impression that merely arranging for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such activities is an adequate response. A railroad's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities under this provision are fulfilled only when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative means of warning highway users is actually provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 105(c)(1) (final rule_105(c)(3)) generated many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. As proposed, it requires a train to stop before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entering a crossing until an appropriately equipped flagger or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law enforcement officer was stationed at the crossing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal further requires that once the train was stopped, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crewmember must dismount to flag highway traffic to a stop. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safe to do so, the locomotive would proceed through the crossing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the crewmember then reboarding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The LIRR noted that the proposed regulation does not cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the situation of trains being operated by one person. The LIRR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated ``it would not be in the best interest of our customers if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the engine could not be moved until an appropriately equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person arrived.'' The labor/management group also commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in unusual situations there may be occasions where a train has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only the engineer available to flag traffic: ``In those cases, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that under &sect;234.105, the train would be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceed through the crossing after the train was stopped and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was determined that it was safe to do so.'' That interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is incorrect. FRA notes that nothing in the proposed language of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;234.105(c)(1) permits a locomotive to proceed through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crossing without being flagged through that crossing by someone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the ground, nor does the labor/management group provide any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for their contrary conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

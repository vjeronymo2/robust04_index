			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a report to the effect that  the Rwandese Government says its forces have pushed back rebel  RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces, who launched an attack on  the town of Gitarama yesterday, after overrunning the nearby  town of Kabgayi. Gitarama is reported to be heavily fortified,  and observers say any assault on it will not be an easy task.</p>

The party leaders went to the cathedral of San Cristobal de  las Casas and talked for 30 minutes with the EZLN members led by  Subcommander Marcos to express their support for the agreements  to be reached during these peace talks.    PCM Secretary General Jorge Amador Amador spoke about the  dialogue they held with Subcommander Marcos and the rest of the  EZLN delegation:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Did the party  representatives make any specific proposal to the EZLN delegates?    [Amador] I think that the most important aspect of this is  the fact that these political organizations are willing --  according to its strength and convictions -- to support the  agreements to be reached during the peace and reconciliation  meetings. I believe all of the organizations present here  emphasized their support. The EZLN representatives repeatedly  demanded this support, which they need. We left open the  possibility that we might hold bilateral meetings and that as  the talks advance, we will be kept informed of the results, we  will be consulted, and naturally we will be able to give our  points of view, if requested.    [Reporter] With whom did you meet?    [Amador] We met with the entire delegation of the EZLN led  by  Subcommander Marcos.    [Reporter] What was his message?    [Amador] He requested that we understand and value their  struggle, that we express our solidarity, and that we help them  get ahead. [end recording]    Also present at this meeting, among others, were: PDM  President Marcelo (Gargiola); Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the  Green Ecology Party; Everto Castillo and Mario Saucedo, for the  PRD; and PRI party member Alfredo Rojas Diaz Duran, on a  personal basis.</p>

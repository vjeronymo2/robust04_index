			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has reemphasized that he  accepts the principles of the package of confidence-building  measures proposed by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  and is ready to begin talks on ways to implement the measures as  soon as the Turkish Cypriot side states the same clear and  unconditional acceptance. Since the Turkish side has not  accepted the package and seven months have been lost, the  president proposes that the secretary general have the two sides  return to a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue,  beginning with their concerns about security issues, until the  Turkish side decides on the confidence-building measures.  Kliridhis' positions are outlined in his letter to the  secretary general the text of which was made public today in  Nicosia.    In his seven-page letter, the president reiterates his  position that he accepts the package of confidence-building  measures as proposed by Butrus-Ghali, that is, the whole  fenced-off area of Famagusta coming under UN administration and  the Nicosia International Airport reopening under United  Nations' control. The president stresses that Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas has not replied in a straightforward way on  whether he accepts the agreement proposed by Butrus-Ghali.  After wasting seven months since June, when the talks were  suspended because of his stance, the Turkish Cypriot leader's  own letter to the secretary general raises several issues  outside the framework of the principles set out by the UN  secretary general.    Kliridhis writes various notes on particular issues raised  by  Denktas and submits three questions, stressing that he expects  clear answers to these questions: First, whether Denktas  accepts, irrespective of his so-called concerns about security  issues, that the whole fenced-off area of Famagusta be turned  over to the United Nations to administer and police and that the  Greek Cypriot residents will return to their homes and  properties. Second, whether Denktas abandons any notion of the  Greek Cypriot side recognizing, either directly or indirectly,  through any practical measures, legal status for the occupied  ports and the airport in the north. Third, whether Denktas  accepts that any confidence-building measures agreed upon must  be implemented without waiting to see if they are in line with  an overall and complete Cyprus solution.    The president continues: On Denktas' concerns about security  issues raised in his letter to Your Excellency, both regarding  the final solution and the confidence-building measures, I wish  to highlight that the Greek Cypriot side also has serious  concerns about security issues. Since both sides, the president  adds in his letter, admit that they have serious concerns about  security, obviously, we must discuss and resolve this issue  before any other, instead of finding it in front of us every  time we reach a step toward progress. If Denktas is ready to  discuss both sides' concerns about security, I am ready to  participate, the president concludes.</p>

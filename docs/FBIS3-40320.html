			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Damir Dukic: "The Serbian Scrap-Iron Navy Is </F> Moving From Kumbor"]    [Text] The Navy of "Yugoslavia's" armed forces intends to  create yet another refuge for its rusty fleet 7 km north of  Ulcinj, almost at the southernmost end of the Montenegrin coast.  We are talking about Valdanos Bay, the only inlet in that part  of the coast which has natural features for building a naval  base. This is the only way in which the leading Serbian  "navigators" intend to remedy the numerous complexes acquired  with disintegration of the once respectable Yugonavy, now that  it has been driven from most of the Adriatic.    For quite a long time now, the vessels of the Serbian Navy  have been floating in close quarters in the ports of Kumbor and  Tivat in Kotor Bay. The narrow entrance to the "bride of the  Adriatic" is no problem to spot from outside, so that the  "floating scrap pile," as Italian Admiral Acquille Zanonni  recently called the Yugoslav Navy, is in a fearful  claustrophobic panic. It thus needs a way out, deliberation from  its phobia, but also from the loser's syndrome which has greatly  affected the souls of the officers there. But there are other  reasons for building a naval base at Valdanos as well. One is  certainly to change the composition of the population in the  Ulcinj part of the coast, which is unfavorable for the Serbs.  When that area is militarized and the families of Serbian  officers move there, the high share of Montenegrins and  Albanians in the ethnic composition of the population there will  be offset to some extent.    Another reason for building a naval base in that bay lies in  the constant fear of an external enemy. Serbian strategists,  that is, have estimated that it is only in that region that the  international forces conducting the naval blockade off the coast  of Montenegro could land marines. That is why they set up a  radar station even earlier in the hills above what previously  was the military vacation resort at Valdanos, but also numerous  fortifications and gun emplacements.  <H5>  Defect--The Proximity of Albania </H5>   All of this in fact confirms certain earlier tendencies  shown  by the Serbian top government leadership. That is, there were  signs even in the past that that top leadership was moving more  and more toward industrial nourishment of the warmaking spirit,  little by little transforming their economy and industrial  potential toward military production, the only industry in "FR  Yugoslavia" which is still somehow getting by. Within that  context, there is a possibility of military industrial plants  being moved or established in the Montenegrin hills, especially  when we bear in mind that sizable ground forces are already  concentrated above Valdanos Bay, but nothing close to what is  just now being planned.    The naval base at Valdanos, that is, has one important  defect--it is close to the Albanian border. Should there be a  real military conflict with its southern neighbor, "FR  Yugoslavia" must secure the hinterland of the Navy stationed at  the future base, although that will not help it much because  Valdanos is within range of Albanian artillery, which is not a  comfortable realization for Serbian officers. What is more,  Valdanos does not have the necessary depth (the bay is only some  15 meters deep), and it is barely broad enough to allow two  large vessels to maneuver at the same time.  <H5>  Outmoded Missiles </H5>   Nevertheless, in spite of all these deficiencies, the  project  of a naval base at Valdanos is nevertheless moving toward  realization. Aside from the reasons already given, among which  we should emphasize once again that this is the only bay on the  Montenegrin coast which has the natural features for something  of this kind, achievement of this plan for a naval base would  certainly have a large psychological impact on the unnecessary  and outmoded vessels which at the moment are only discharging  oil into Kotor Bay and serving as potential targets. In terms of  the number of vessels, of course, this is still an impressive  fleet, but the level of its maintenance is indicated by the  "incident" that occurred a year ago during the visit to the Navy  by Milan Panic and Zivota Panic, who at that time were the  Yugoslav prime minister and chief of the General Staff,  respectively. Just as those two left a warship, it began to sink  for no apparent reason.    Even if the Yugonavy were not so neglected and rotten, it  would not be able to accept engagement on the open sea. In  addition to the chronic shortage of trained personnel, it is  also troubled by the fact that it is no longer suitable for the  altered circumstances of a potential naval war. That is, the  number of warships, which still seems frightening at first, was  adapted in its structure to defending the coast of Croatia,  exploiting the natural advantages of the numerous Croatian  islands and bays. Lora, near Split, was to be the main point of  support, and Vis and Lastovo were strong detached fortresses.  That is why the ships were mainly fast and light, able to jump  out at an enemy from behind a peninsula or island and to hide  still more quickly in the next cove.    However, the Montenegrin coast is not very indented, and  coastal artillery located on the hills there can be used  effectively for its defense. But domination beyond territorial  waters (12 nautical miles from the coast) can be achieved only  with the help of large ships, cruisers, for example. But the  Serbian Navy lacks them. Perhaps it would welcome the  "surface-to-surface" missiles which the Yugonavy was purchasing  in sizable quantities from Sweden, but they have mainly been  taken as war booty by the Croatian Navy. Those missiles they  still possess are outmoded and of poor quality. Nor can they  boast of strong coastal artillery, because they were compelled  to install ordinary "field" guns for that purpose. Here again  they were "crippled" by the Croats, who captured numerous  coastal batteries.  <H5>  River Submarine </H5>   In spite of all that, Dojcilo Isakovic, commander of the  Serbian Navy, a Chetnik from Lora well-known to the people of  Split who at one time made a "reputation" with the published  secret plans to build a new Serbian weapon--a river  submarine--which was supposed to strike horror into enemies and  be the envy of the world, but actually was an unprecedented  stupidity, has been persistently repeating the story to the  effect that the fleet was successfully evacuated from Croatia,  mostly thanks to none other than himself. Dojcilo says that the  Croats have only what the Serbs intentionally left them, and  that amounts to three vessels that were under repair. In this  way, Rear Adm. Isakovic is laying the groundwork for his glory  in the war, now that he has already managed to prove himself to  be a "Serb from head to toe." But his stories can at the very  least be regarded as lies and arrogant boasting, because he  "gave" to the Croatian Navy more than 30 vessels, among them the  most modern--the missile-carrying fast attack craft which now  bears the name of King Petar Kresimir IV. When we look at the  "gifts," Dojcilo and Milan Zec, his chief of staff, did not  deserve to be decorated and promoted, but to be tried for  treason.    All that we have said obviously serves to promote still  further the dream of "martial glory" which is supposed to take  up full-fledged positions in the "Serbian sea" as well.  Something like that is the purpose of the plan to which we have  referred to build an expensive naval base at Valdanos intended  for the "scrap pile," pointing out at the same time that the top  Serbian leadership has not the slightest intention of developing  the tourist potential and collecting foreign exchange from  foreign visitors, but intends to improve military industrial  plants, pursue general militarization, and make money from the  sale of arms. No question of good-neighborly relations; they are  a permanent threat to the peace.</p>

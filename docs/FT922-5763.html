			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): The Square Mile stays out in front / Discussing London's role as a leading financial centre THE CITY of London has long been proud, if not cocksure, of its reputation as a leading foreign exchange trading centre. Brochures published by the Corporation of London boast that London's Square Mile can still claim to be the world's leading international financial centre. But political and financial developments in Europe alongside Britain's general antipathy towards monetary union have led some to suggest that London's continuing dominance in foreign exchange trading is in question. The main concerns over London losing its competitive edge are that the European Central Bank will be located in another European city and that the British government will continue to be hostile towards monetary union. On closer examination, both concerns appear overblown. The Bank of England, anyway not yet resigned to the ECB going elsewhere, brushes off suggestions that London's dominant role in global foreign exchange trading would be weakened if another city were chosen to house the ECB. The Bank says London's underlying advantages will continue to give the City an edge over other European centres. After all, where the bank is located is less important than where it operates. In the US, the Federal Reserve is based in Washington, but operates mainly through the largest, most developed and highly securitised market - New York. The same would surely be true of Europe. According to the most recent survey of foreign exchange market activity carried out by the Bank of International Settlements in 1989, the City is only just behind Tokyo in total international banking business. In foreign exchange trading, the UK ranked first, with total daily foreign exchange transactions amounting to Dollars 187bn. This compared with turnovers of Dollars 129bn in New York and Dollars 115bn in Tokyo. In Europe, leaving aside London, only Zurich recorded a turnover of more than Dollars 50bn. On this basis, the Corporation of London says it is 'hardly surprising' that 'foreign banks have flocked to London, providing the essential cement to the international flavour of the City'. There are more than 500 foreign bank branches, incorporations or representative offices based in London's square mile. Perhaps the most prestigious of all is the latest international recruit, the headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with shareholders from more than 40 countries. Although the Bank of England believes the City would weather the location of Europe's central bank outside the UK, it continues to argue strongly that it should come to London. In a speech earlier this year, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said it would be in the interests of the European Community to have its central bank placed in London. 'A single European currency would be one of the world's three major currencies, and would obviously be actively traded in centres around the world . . . London is one of the three major world financial centres, perhaps the only truly international centre and certainly the pre-eminent international centre in Europe, with a depth, variety and liquidity in its money and capital markets - which very much now embrace and are developing the Ecu - that will be vital to an effective single monetary policy,' he said. If the ECB does go to one of the so-called 'compromise' candidates, the 'Domesday' scenario is that much of London's foreign exchange trade will go with it. 'Much depends on what the European Central Bank actually does,' says Ruth Lea chief economist at Mitsubishi bank in London. 'Will it be just for committee meetings, or will it be a major operating unit?' Whatever its role, she dismisses the worst-case scenario; 'I think London will remain the biggest centre in Europe but it will inevitably lose an edge if the ECB goes elsewhere.' Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, says the Japanese bank is similarly unflustered at the prospect of London's future. 'There are enough reasons to be positive about London's role - liquidity is the key factor and London already has that plus a lot of expertise in foreign exchange. Its infrastructure as an international financial centre has already been proven,' says Mr Lyons. However, he cautions that even with these in-built advantages, the location of the ECB is still important and could yet affect London's position. 'If the ECB is based in a city which clearly doesn't have the potential to become the European financial centre, like Amsterdam for example, then there will be no threat to London, but if it goes to Frankfurt, which does have the potential, then that could pose some sort of problem.' As for Britain's antipathy towards monetary union, few in the City feel that London's position in foreign exchange trading would be put in jeopardy if Britain were to opt out of Emu. 'An awful lot of London's business is offshore business,' said a spokesman from the Bank of England. 'Because it is an offshore centre, there is every reason to believe it will continue to be one even if we were not in Emu.' There is also growing scepticism over the timetable for Emu set out in the Maastricht treaty. Many in the City view it as unrealistic, and are confident that no big financial houses would even consider making a move elsewhere in Europe while the future of monetary union looks so uncertain. In fact, worries over the attitude of the British government towards Europe are likely, at least for the time being, to be outweighed by the more comforting prospect of five years of political stability following the decisive victory of the Conservative party in the April general election, especially when compared with the relatively turbulent political outlook elsewhere in Europe. Other reasons tying financial houses to London are the exceedingly high costs now sunk into London. It would take some good reasons indeed for a company to undertake the enormous cost of relocating its European base.</p>

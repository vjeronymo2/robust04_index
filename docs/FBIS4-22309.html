			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasiliy Kiselev, first deputy head of the </F> Novosibirsk Oblast administration, by V. Maltseva, under the  rubric "Express-Interview"; place and date not given: "Vasiliy  Kiselev: `Oblast Administration's Responsibility Must Be  Financed'"]    [Text] At a press conference Vasiliy Kiselev, first deputy  head of the Novosibirsk Oblast administration, mentioned that  beginning 1 April the territories will gain relative freedom in  disposing of money received from the federal budget. The editors  asked V. Kiselev to demonstrate with a socially significant  example some opportunities for maneuver under the new conditions:    "Since responsibility for creating food reserves now rests  entirely with the local bodies of authority, this responsibility  must be financed. The edict on liberalization of the grain  market prescribes that we form grain reserves with our own  resources as well. The oblast needs 590,000 tonnes of  grain--according to the most meager measure. The normal level,  which takes into account the needs of specialized animal  husbandry farms, is 850,000 tonnes. Even if we project that a  tonne of grain will cost 100,000 rubles [R] (and realistically  this figure should be doubled), we need R100 billion to pay for  this 'purchase.'    "To protect grain suppliers from inflationary costs and  guarantee these deliveries into the reserve fund, we have to pay  an advance of at least 25-30 percent of the cost of grain  procurement.    "After taking credits year after year and then paying them  back, we came to the conclusion that a different system was  needed--we need to put this process on a compensated-delivery  basis. In this connection we are looking into the question of  setting up a grain customer service--the oblast administration's  committee on the economy will be that customer. This will change  the relations with the existing Russian Grain Products agency's  system on our territory.    "Why are we bringing up the question of changing the terms  of  cooperation?    "Last year, for instance, the oblast took out a loan from  the  budget and gave it to the Novosibirsk Grain Products agency. For  the most part, of course, the money was used as intended, but at  the same time some money was "skimmed off" for other  payments--for instance, this organization's debts for prior  deliveries.    "Why is this paid for with our money? Most likely because it  is state money, our common money, and one does not count it. But  in reality it is already different money.    "Therefore we need a mechanism that would guarantee that if  we spent R40 billion on grain procurement, this grain would be  ours. Other partners simply provide for us services in getting  the grain into proper condition and processing it, but at the  same time the oblast does not lose the right of ownership of the  grain. And, correspondingly, proceeds from sales will also  belong completely to the oblast. We can start giving the money  generated to producers, to finance the 1995 harvest.    "This new ideology of market relations will allow us to save  money, and this money we now be `circulating' only within the  boundaries of the oblast financial system."</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Rothschild in Czech move N. M. Rothschild of the UK has established an investment banking associate company in Prague to reinforce its presence in eastern Europe. Rothschild is taking a 40 per cent stake in Consilium, a joint venture with Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech foreign trade bank. The collaboration with Obchodni gives Rothschild an advantage in seeking the mandate to advise on the Czech bank's privatisation. Its management is to make a recommendation to Obchodni's board on an adviser later this month and an international equity issue is planned for late 1995 or early 1996. Rothschild's new Czech offshoot broadens a presence which already includes a 30 per cent stake in Access, a joint venture in Warsaw, and a fully-fledged office in Moscow. It has translated privatisation experience gained in the UK into a strong franchise in eastern Europe, where it regularly figures among the winners of privatisation mandates. With a physical presence in the Czech Republic, Rothschild intends to shift its emphasis from privatisations to domestic mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and equity offerings.</p>

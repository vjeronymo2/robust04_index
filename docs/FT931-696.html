			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Trade apostle with his eye on the ball: Mickey Kantor talks to Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne about his daunting agenda in pursuit of open markets Pride may come before a fall, but there is no denying that there is a certain cockiness to the Clinton administration these days. Congress has been tamed, the press charmed, Yeltsin is still there and visiting foreign dignitaries impressed - all if only for the moment. More than that, a certain style has been established. It combines collegial, activist, legalistic, inquiring and practical elements. It takes its lead, indisputably, from President Bill Clinton himself but it is equally evident in other key members of his administration. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, will get a heightened sense of it this morning when he sits down with Mickey Kantor, the US trade repesentative, to work on a daunting agenda, of which EC procurement policy and temporarily suspended US sanctions against it is merely the most pressing. He will find on the opposite side of the table a man more assured and more comfortable with his brief than when they first met last month. Mr Kantor, 53, born in Tennessee, where his family fought racial discrimination, but enamoured of his adopted California ('the closest we've got to a meritocracy'), a poverty and corporate lawyer who ran Mr Clinton's professional campaign last year, gets up early, wears braces, and has a subtle sense of humour. Though it may come as no help to Sir Leon, Mr Kantor is, like most sensible Americans, a baseball freak. Last week's breakfast bagel was forgotten in discussing the revived fortunes of Fernando Valenzuela, the pitcher who relies on guile not force, but the trade analogies are not. 'Velocity in pitching, like philosophy in trade,' Mickey Kantor declares, 'is vastly overrated. It's all about location and staying ahead of the batters, that's how you'll be successful. Its not complicated, just like trade is not complicated. There are simple principles to adhere to.' (On his desk was a clipping from a Japanese newspaper showing Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade minister whom Mr Kantor was to meet later, playing baseball.) Yet when pressed if he cares more about ends than means, the lawyer demurs. 'Once you sign an agreement it seems to me almost counter-intuitive, even dysfunctional not to live up to it.' Nations have anti-dumping laws which, far from being necessarily skewed in favour of the plaintiff, exist 'because there is a lot of dumping around'. However, laws, even in trade, are not, he goes on, set in concrete. 'Change is the immutable law of politics and life. Change can be your friend.' In perhaps a veiled invitation to the EC to come back to the table for a multilateral steel agreement, 'if your trading partner comes to you and says he can't live up to the terms of an agreement, you can talk'. Intensified negotiation, he argues, is what should have been done last year, possibly avoiding the US finding that European steel imports had been dumped in the US. 'I'm always looking for the dog that doesn't bark.' If the rules of the game fascinate him, trade theology does not. 'I'm not going to be caught in a theological debate that does not lead to practical and pragmatic results. It does not matter what you are called or how you are labelled, it matters what we get done. The idea is not to engage in endless debate about whether someone is a free trader, a protectionist, a managed trader or results oriented.' He makes just one dogmatic exception. The US 'is the largest open market in the world, and it is not going to change and everyone knows that. The rhetoric thrown around is only for effect, lets be mature and grown up about that.' He is inclined, naturally, to be more tolerant of US rhetoric for domestic consumption ('the political factor'), such as his own president has used when discoursing about European Airbus subsidies or the presumed iniquity of low US tariffs on Japanese mini-vans. He contrasts that, perhaps ingenuously, certainly defensively, with 'when the EC talks about protectionism and unilateralism, whatever the heck that means, that is somehow supposed to embarrass us and persuade us to take action that is in the interest of the EC or the Japanese or whoever is making the charges'. But, he goes on, it would be 'audacious' to try to make a country like Japan be just like the US, which was arguably a motive in the Structural Impediments Initiative approach to market-opening practised by the Bush administration. 'It is not my business to tell them how to organise society. You take the keiretsu (the Japanese system of interlocking corporate networks) as a given and try to make it effective. It is my business to ensure that markets become more open.' Those caveats aside, Mr Kantor can be critical of Japan. For starters: 'Japan can no longer stand aside and not engage in discussion on the Uruguay Round; this is not 45 years ago.' For main course: 'They don't need any protection from us or anybody else.' For semiconductor dessert: 'I think their lack of comfort (with the US insistence on quantitative targets) could be more concerned with other criteria, including politics.' For good reason, he is concerned that the 20 per cent market-opening 'goal' of the semiconductor agreement will not be met this year. The EC gets a generally similar ride, with lots of compliments for its historic leadership. But 'I don't understand why market access should be such a difficut problem. They should jump at the opportunities. The Germans, the English, the Dutch have been traders for centuries.' 'Barriers,' he goes on, 'are not in anybody's interests. Agricultural variable levies, internal supports, the CAP, are not in anybody's interest. I'm not telling them how to handle it - that's not my business - but I do have the right and obligation to tell them what is in the interest of the US.' On the discrimination of EC procurement policies, he says, more colloquially, 'if I'm punching you, punching less does not matter'. Critics of the emerging US trade policy contend that too many officials punch too often and in inconsistent flurries, unlike the good old days when it was neatly compartmentalised between a handful of administration 'experts' who believed, whatever they actually did, that trade should be free, and a Democratic-controlled Congress which played the protectionist foil. Mr Kantor is an apostle of the horizontal approach to policy-making. Corporations and governments have found, he says, that it improves co-ordination. 'Now, Treasury, State, Commerce, the National Economic Council, the National Security Council, USTR are constantly talking. There's a Tuesday morning meeting every week, horizontal discussions all the time. It takes a lot of discipline . . . but we talk so that we are all singing from the same hymn book.' (This is a phrase in vogue in Washington: even Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was caught mouthing it here last week.) It works, he contends, because the president himself is 'completely engaged,' reading memoranda all the time and knowing his brief as well as any of his officials. His respect for his boss, whom he first met in 1979 through Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, knows no bounds. But if he takes his lead from Mr Clinton, he can argue his own way. 'What appears from my studies and intuition is that the sum is greater than the parts. Exponential growth takes place from interaction between economies.' But the benefits, in improved standards of living, must be widely spread at home and abroad. He talks of extending the North American Free Trade Area southwards and then into co-operation with the Pacific basin, all with a view to creating 'middle classes in the world'. In this respect, his early career as a poverty lawyer, representing the lowest of the low, migrant farm labour in Florida and then California, was influential. Referring to Cesar Chavez, the charismatic leader of farm labour in the 1960s and 1970s: 'He profoundly affected my view of what needed to be done, how important it was to throw yourself into public issues and, now, how important Nafta is in harmonising upwards workers' standards'. But he has his own ideal of where those standards are most perfectly found. A modest traveller ('I didn't make much as a legal services lawyer') he has been to Europe 'a few times' and to Israel. In his present job: 'I'd love to hold every meeting in Florence.'</p>

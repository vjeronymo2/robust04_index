The petition proposed that the food additive regulations be amended in &sect;177.2600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Rubber articles intended for repeated use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (21 CFR 177.2600) to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers in repeated use food-contact articles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safety of the additive and the chemical impurities that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of unreacted acrylonitrile, a carcinogenic reactant used in the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as acrylonitrile, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  I. Determination of Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A), the so-called ``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The anticancer or Delaney clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to the impurities in the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scott <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  II. Safety of Petitioned Use of the Additive <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive, hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer, will result in exposure to the additive of no greater than 7 parts per trillion (ppt) in the daily diet (Ref. 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However, the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported in these studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by acrylonitrile, a carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation of acrylonitrile has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  A. Acrylonitrile <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has estimated the worst-case exposure to acrylonitrile from the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of repeated use food-contact articles to be 0.02 ppt of the daily diet (3 kilograms) or 0.06 nanogram (ng) per person per day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from two carcinogenicity studies on acrylonitrile monomer fed to rats to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers and the level of acrylonitrile that may be present in the additive (Ref. 3). The results of the bioassays on acrylonitrile monomer demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats under the conditions of the studies. The test material caused significantly increased incidences of carcinogenic tumors at many tissue sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Based on the estimated worst-case exposure of 0.06 ng per person per day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from the use of the hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers is 8 x 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> &hyph;11  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or 8 in 100 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate, the actual lifetime averaged individual daily exposure to acrylonitrile is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limit of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm from exposure to acrylonitrile would result from the proposed use of hydrogenated butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Conclusion on Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive in repeated use food-contact articles is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical effect. Therefore, &sect;177.2600 should be amended as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  C. Need for Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of acrylonitrile impurity in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because of the low level at which acrylonitrile may be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive, the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2) the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even under worst-case assumptions, is very low, less than 8 in 100 billion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  III. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  IV.

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities wanted Utilities were in demand on yield considerations. Water stocks received an additional boost as broker SG Warburg moved from 'neutral' to 'overweight'. Warburg cited several reasons for the move including, the sector's 'safe premium yields as base rates remain on a downward trend.' The broker also liked the defensive earnings appeal of the sector and the possible boost to dividend growth and non-consumer stocks in next month's budget should the chancellor increase taxes on consumer goods. Among the strong performances across the sector, Severn Trent gained 11 to 542p and Southern 17 to 569p. Both are tipped by Warburg. Elsewhere, Welsh put on 16 to 620p and South West 15 to 575p. However, the market appears divided over the appeal of the sector. With an eye on next month's Ofwat report, NatWest Securities on Friday moved three water stocks to an 'underperform' recommendation, arguing that 'regulatory worries will pre-dominate' over the next 10 months.</p>

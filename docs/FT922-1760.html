			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds 3% in thin trade SHARE prices rallied on short-covering ahead of the weekend and on bargain hunting, and the Nikkei average gained for the first time this week, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index recovered 474.31, or 3 per cent, to 16,519.87, after setting new lows for the year on Wednesday and Thursday. The Nikkei has lost 5 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 16,088.52 and reached the day's high of 16,544.66 just before the close. Volume fell from 340m shares to 230m. Advances led declines by 759 to 200 with 142 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 21.63 to 1,267.27 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.59 to 991.69. Life insurance companies placed buy orders at low prices, and investment trusts were seen index-linked buying. Market participants, who believed the Nikkei was oversold relative to the Topix, also bought back shares. Electrical blue chips, banks and brokers firmed on short-covering ahead of the weekend. Sentiment was helped by government announcements of possible economic support measures prior to the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations next month. Reports that the government was considering a supplementary budget of Y8,000bn also helped confidence. Lower interest rates raised hopes of an early credit easing. Short-term money market rates and bond yields fell on speculation that the weak stock market would prompt the Bank of Japan to lower the official discount rate. The improvement in sentiment encouraged professional interest in theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y50 to Y1,030, while Morinaga Milk advanced Y13 to Y891. Financials recovered from heavy selling earlier in the week. Nomura Securities advanced Y40 to Y1,270 and Mitsubishi Bank rose Y40 to Y1,510. But Daikyo, the condominium builder, fell another Y36 to an all-time low of Y745. Although Daikyo officials have denied rumours of financial problems, investors have remained pessimistic about the company's business prospects because of poor conditions in the real estate market. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 132.85 to 19,276.21 in volume of 16.7m shares. Roundup Some markets in the region improved in line with Tokyo. HONG KONG recovered most of its early losses as the Hang Seng index closed down 8.50 at 5,787.60 for a fall of 0.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 3.04bn. Utilities and commercial and industrial issues fell but property stocks and banks bucked the trend. Hongkong Electric lost 30 cents to HKDollars 18.30 while Hong Kong Telecom slipped 5 cents to HKDollars 8.50. SEOUL strengthened as many securities shares rose to their upper limits. The composite index gained 7.17 to 571.02, up 0.85 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won223.2bn. KUALA LUMPUR was little changed in light trading. The composite index ended 0.08 higher at 596.58, a 1 per cent gain on the week. TAIWAN continued its downward trend, the weighted index shedding 40.93 to 4,587.85, a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was little changed at TDollars 28.7bn. MANILA's composite index lost 5.86 to 1,493.92, for a fall of 5.5 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to 293m pesos from 184m pesos. PLDT was affected by the overnight loss in the US and slid 45 pesos to 1,000 pesos. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index rose 9.0 to 1,633.9, but was 1 per cent lower on the week. Stocks that had fallen this week on downward revisions of forecasts recovered slightly. Pacific Dunlop added 9 cents to ADollars 5.16.</p>

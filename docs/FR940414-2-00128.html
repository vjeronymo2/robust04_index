The initial determination of the Differential Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Trust to meet the Differential Expenses shall provide to the Trustees, and the Board shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the Trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the 1940 Act and otherwise, will monitor each Series for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares. The Trustees, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor at their own costs will remedy the conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of one class of shares will be used to support any distribution or servicing fee charged to shareholders of that class of shares. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a specific class of shares will not be presented to the Trustees to justify any fees charged to that class of shares. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Dividends paid by a Series with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that each particular class will bear exclusively its own Differential Expenses and costs and distribution fees associated with any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan relating to a particular class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the various classes have been reviewed by an expert, the Independent Examiner. The Independent Examiner has rendered a report to the Applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon this review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the 1940 Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to these reports, following request by the Trust, which the Trust agrees to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission's staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Independent Examiner is a ``Report on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``Special Purpose'' reports on the ``Reports on Policies and Procedures Placed in Operation and Tests of Operating Effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Department of Interior and Local Government  [DILG] will transform the mineral-rich Kalayaan [Freedom] chain  of islands [part of Spratly Islands claimed by the Philippines]  into one of the country's viable local government unit. The  Kalayaan Islands is considered to be the next flash point among  the Asian claimant nations. DILG Acting Secretary Alexander  Aguirre said the transformation will be in line with earlier  plans of the Cabinet Cluster "E" to attract settlers in the  area. Aside from the Philippines, the other claimant nations  which have already established military units in the areas  include Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and China.</p>

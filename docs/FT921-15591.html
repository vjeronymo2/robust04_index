			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Federal forces slip further off political leash: Kadiejevic's resignation could undermine peace efforts THE resignation last night of General Veljko Kadiejevic, the Yugoslav defence minister, could undermine efforts by the United Nations and European Community diplomats to seek a lasting ceasefire in Croatia. Moreover, western diplomats believe that any attempt to bring the federal army under political control following the shooting down of an EC monitoring helicopter has been made more difficult. General Kadiejevic was a career officer, half Croat and half Serb, who was wedded until recently to the idea of maintaining the Yugoslav federation. 'He was a Titoist, and a Yugoslav, which is why he opposed the independence moves by the republics of Croatia and Slovenia last June,' a western diplomat said. In recent weeks, however, he adopted a more pragmatic stance, and ended up supporting UN plans to implement not only a ceasefire in Croatia, but to deploy peace-keeping troops. It was a gamble not only for Gen Kadiejevic, but also for Serbia's nationalist president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. For the former, the presence of UN troops would formally and finally end any pretence that the army could maintain the territorial integrity of the Yugoslav federation. For Mr Milosevic, it was a risk because, under the UN agreement, the federal army would withdraw completely from Croatia, thus depriving Serb nationalists in the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina, in southern Croatia, of vital support. It would have the effect of turning Serb militants in Croatia against Mr Milosevic, who promoted them in the first place. The UN agreement enraged Mr Milan Babic, head of the Krajina republic, and other Serb nationalists, who smelt betrayal of their cause - an independent Serb republic in Croatia - by both the army and Serbia. It probably led nationalist forces in the army to shoot down the helicopter. That tragedy yesterday prompted diplomats in Belgrade to attempt to place the army under political control. But it may be too late. Factions now at the helm of the military include hardline Serb nationalists led by General Blagoje Adzic, the new defence minister and former chief of staff. His outlook is conditioned by history - his family was killed by the Nazi-backed Croat Ustashas during the second world war. As a Serb nationalist determined to seek redress for historical grievances, Gen Adzic has forged close links with the Serb nationalists in Krajina, eastern Slavonia, in eastern Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia-Hercegovina. This tacit alliance not only opposes the deploying UN peace-keeping forces by Gen Kadiejevic and Mr Milosevic; it had also widened the rift among the army's top officer corps and Serbia's leadership. Yesterday, Mr Babic, who was catapulted into power by Mr Milosevic, with the backing of the federal army, blamed Gen Kadiejevic for the attack on the helicopter. He implied that the general's acceptance of the UN ceasefire terms did not have the consent of the entire army, nor of Serb nationalists in Croatia who feel the army is no longer protecting them. Behind the scenes lurk other factions. These include Mr Branko Mamula, the former federal defence minister, and now head of the revamped Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Ideologically committed to Yugoslavia, Mr Mamula has extensive networks throughout the army and is visited regularly by Mr Milosevic. But his colleagues say he is acutely aware that the federal army needs a home, some financial assurances for the future, and a post-Yugoslavia role. General Marko Negovanovic, the former federal head of counter-intelligence, and now defence minister of Serbia, continues to play a pivotal role. Once opposed to the break-up of he federation, he is now trying to salvage a smaller Serb-dominated rump Yugoslavia in which the arm could play a prominent role.</p>

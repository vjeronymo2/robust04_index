			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Perez refuses to resign over Venezuela revolt PRESIDENT Carlos Andres Perez said in a televised speech yesterday that he would not resign as a result of the failed attempt to topple his government, saying such a move would only 'precipitate chaos and tragedy in Venezuela'. Officials stressed that state and local elections would take place as scheduled on December 6, and that registered candidates and political parties could hold public rallies. All other public meetings are still banned under the government's emergency powers. The government has arrested about 500 officers and 800 soldiers from different branches of the armed forces for participating in Friday's failed coup. An estimated 170 people died during the unsuccessful rebellion, according to Gen Ivan Dario Jimenez, the minister of defence. Of these, 140 were civilians and included some 45 prisoners who died during a break-out from Caracas jail. Yesterday, according to some reports, a further 60 inmates at the overcrowded jail were killed in a fresh riot. The Justice Ministry said 900 prisoners had now been moved. Gen Jimenez indicated that while the attempted coup was led by elements of the Venezuelan Air Force, members of the navy, national guard and army (the latter to a very small extent) also participated. The authorities have not yet identified civilians who played a leading role in the uprising, except to say that they are 'subversives from the left'. The government of President Perez, which faced a coup attempt nine months ago in which an estimated 40 people died, is to use special provisions under the Military Justice Code to bring those charged with military rebellion to swift judgment, perhaps within a fortnight. Army officers who led the February 4 rebellion have used delaying tactics to stretch out their military trial, which is still receiving testimony from witnesses and the accused. While some of the coup leaders were captured by military units loyal to the government, 93 officers and cadets escaped to Iquitos, Peru, in a Venezuelan air force Hercules C-130 just before pro-government forces took control of the country's main air force base in Maracay late on Friday. Venezuela's minister of foreign affairs, retired general Fernando Ochoa Antich, said the government would be seeking to extradite the officers and recover the aircraft and weapons they carried with them. Venezuela's capital was quiet yesterday, except for the detonation of faulty bombs, dropped on La Carlota airport by rebel aircraft last Friday. On Saturday, the day after the coup attempt, residents of the capital formed long queues at food shops, but were frightened off the streets after an unidentified helicopter strafed the presidential office complex in the centre of Caracas. Shooting also broke out between snipers, police and security forces near the president's office, but this had ended by Saturday afternoon. The Perez government has already begun to ease some of the emergency measures introduced on Friday. The 6pm to 6am curfew has been reduced to 10pm to 5am, Maiquetia international airport outside Caracas has been re-opened, and the Caracas Metro has begun operating a limited schedule. However, the Ministry of Education announced that classes in state and private schools would be cancelled until the day after the elections. Meanwhile, Venezuelan journalists protested at the government's decision to terminate normal news broadcasts by Radio Rumbos, the largest national radio network. The station continues to be on the air, but is broadcasting only music.</p>

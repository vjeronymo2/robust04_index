			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS IN MACARTHUR PARK  </P> <P> Despite a massive police crackdown on drug dealing in MacArthur Park, you  reported that on one recent afternoon "young men brazenly peddled bags of  marijuana," and others openly offered crack cocaine for sale (Metro, June 25).  </P> <P> Park problems are complicated by "scores of homeless people, runaways and other  street people who are themselves either drug addicts or merely destitute."  </P> <P> Later in the article you note that the area around the park is "the most  densely populated in the city" and is "the entry point for poor immigrants from  Central America," and that "60% of the drug arrests at or around the park are  of Central Americans."  </P> <P> Each of these statements is painfully true.  </P> <P> Like the great majority of Los Angelenos I oppose drug use and drug sales. And  I applaud every thoughtful effort to get rid of this scourge.  </P> <P> But MacArthur Park is more than a story. The park is a major human tragedy. Our  most pressing unsolved community problems surface in its 32 acres. Homeless  people, many of whom are only teen-agers, frequent the park because there are  few other places they can go. Despite the Immigration Reform Act and the INS,  poor immigrants from Central America crowd the area in increasing numbers,  seeking the same freedom from tyranny for which we so readily applaud brave  Chinese students.  </P> <P> While laws must be enforced, human tragedies cannot be solved by laws. The  people of the park need compassion and understanding. Most are not hardened  criminals. I have come to know many of the park's teen-agers. Together with a  handful of volunteers, three days a week the Missionary Brothers of Charity are  able to feed an average of 65 of the areas homeless youth, provide a place for  them to shower, and then, painfully, we have to send them back out into the  hopelessness they are forced to call home. Some walk an hour and a half to  sleep at La Placita, the Old Plaza Church across from Olvera Street. Others  risk sleeping in abandoned buildings or the park.  </P> <P> I understand community efforts to "take MacArthur Park back." I can only plead  that there be a compassionate heart to those efforts. Surely the creative  spirit of this community can find some way to bring a measure of hope to those  who have so little.  </P> <P> BROTHER JOSEPH  </P> <P> Nuestro Hogar (Our Home)  </P> <P> The Missionary Brothers of Charity  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

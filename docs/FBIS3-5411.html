Noting that the Cuban people united closely around Comrade  Fidel Castro are steadfastly defending the sovereignty and  dignity of the country under the banner of socialism, while  smashing the moves of the imperialists at every turn, the paper  says in a by-lined article:    The righteous struggle of the Cuban people enjoys unanimous  support from the world progressive people.    The progressive people across the world are urging the  United  States to promptly lift the economic and diplomatic blockade  against Cuba.    The struggle for supporting the just cause of the Cuban  people and frustrating the anti-Cuba moves of the imperialists  are being waged in different forms in many countries.    The Korean and Cuban peoples have defended the cause of  socialism, supporting and cooperating with each other. Their  militant friendship and solidarity have been further  consolidated and developed in the course of struggling for the  common cause, overcoming difficulties together.    The Korean people will as ever fully support the just cause  of the fraternal Cuban people.    The socialist cause of the Cuban people will vigorously  advance, encouraged by international support and solidarity.</p>

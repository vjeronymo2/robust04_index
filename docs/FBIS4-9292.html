			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- After over nine hours  of uninterrupted talks between Serb President Slobodan  Milosevic; Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special  envoy; and Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of  Srpska, with aides, a complete agreement was reached on three  key points that had been proposed by the host, Slobodan  Milosevic.    Milosevic made the following statement for journalists:    "A complete agreement was reached on the total normalization  of relations between the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the  republic of Srpska as a prerequisite for normal cooperation in  the interest of the peace process. This means that both sides  are expected to fulfill the obligations they have taken upon  themselves."    According to the the Serbian president, the second point  took  longest to discuss. It concerned an agreement on the solution  to the crisis hotbed in Gorazde. "We discussed a possibility  for reaching a general agreement on the cessation of hostilities  in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Milosevic, and  added: "Full agreement was reached on this and support was given  to the proposal that Mr. Akashi put forward to the Serb Republic  representatives."    "It was all about three major issues, and agreement was  reached on all of them. This is a very big step in the  direction of peace, and I hope it will be very successful," the  Serbian president said.    The UN secretary general's envoy, Yasushi Akashi, expressed  satisfaction with today's talks and described them as positive,  recalling Slobodan Milosevic's statement on full accord  regarding three key issues. Yasushi Akashi put a particular  stress on the importance of the agreement on Gorazde. "We  agreed on the principles of an immediate and complete  cease-fire, and Mr. Karadzic agreed with it. The cease-fire  will come into effect tomorrow at 1000 gmt."    "We will try to deploy UN protection forces in Gorazde as  soon as possible, and soon thereafter we will try to withdraw  heavy artillery to a distance from which the town will not be  threatened." Akashi went on to say that an agreement had been  reached on the full freedom of movement for UN protection  forces, the evacuation of the wounded, and the free work of  humanitarian organizations. "I would like to express  satisfaction with the agreement on the complete normalization of  relations between UNPROFOR and the Serb side in Bosnia. Today  we exchanged opinions on the future of the peace process when  this crisis is over, as well as about efforts that will lead  towards a global cease-fire, aiming at reaching an overall  political solution later," Akashi said. He told journalists the  talks would resume tomorrow morning.    Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska,  reminded the journalists of the beginning of the mission of UN  secretary general's special envoy, drawing attention to "very  successful meetings with him and very significant achievements  in the Sarajevo zone."    "Unfortunate events around Gorazde, especially the bombing  of  Serb positions, have to a certain extent slowed down the  previously positive process," said Karadzic and added, "Since  1000 GMT today we have regained our mutual trust and cooperation  with the UNPROFOR, which is promising."    "In our opinion the results of today's meeting are very  similar to those we had achieved on 6 February regarding the  Sarajevo crisis. We hope the series of our successful meetings  and achievements will continue. We positively responded to the  initiative on the general cessation of hostilities," said  Karadzic. "If we draw a lesson from the Gorazde crisis, as we  have done from the Sarajevo crisis, and if Muslim forces do not  continue with their offensive from the direction of Tuzla or  some other areas, we can expect all sides in the conflict and  the international community to work on what was agreed here  today -- the general cessation of hostilities in the entire  former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Radovan Karadzic in  conclusion.</p>

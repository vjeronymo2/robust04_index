For coating operations, panel-type dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths are used to control these emissions. For blast depainting operations, panel-type dry particulate filters are also used, as well as baghouses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dry filters and baghouses capture particulates by trapping them as they try to pass through the small passages in the filter media. The efficiency of the filter media is a function of the particle size, size of the passages in the filter media, air flow through and pressure drop across the filter media, and physical characteristics of the particle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waterwash spray booths capture particles by forcing the air stream to pass through a spray or curtain of water. The particles are trapped by the water and eventually collect as a sludge in the sump of the spray booth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Rationale for the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulatory Development Process for NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During development of a NESHAP, the EPA collects information about the industry, including information on emission source characteristics, control technologies, data from HAP emission tests at well-controlled facilities, and information on the cost, energy, and other environmental impacts of emission control techniques. The EPA uses this information in the development of possible regulatory approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the source category contains major sources, then a MACT standard is required. Section 112(d)(3) of the Act defines the minimum stringency requirements of the MACT standard for new and existing sources. This level of control is referred to as the MACT ``floor,'' which needs to be determined as a starting point for developing the regulatory alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the floor has been determined for new and existing sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator must set MACT standards that are no less stringent than the floor level. Such standards must then be met by all sources within the category or subcategory. However, in establishing standards, the Administrator may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory (section 112(d)(1) of the Act). Thus, for example, the Administrator could establish two classes of sources within a category or subcategory based on size and establish a different emission standard for each class as long as each standard is at least as stringent as the floor. The Act also contains provisions for regulating area sources. However, except for certain recordkeeping requirements contained in the General Provisions, these are not relevant to the proposed standards for aerospace sources, which apply only to major sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next step in establishing a MACT standard is the development and analysis of regulatory alternatives. First, information about the industry is analyzed to develop model plant populations for projecting national impacts, including HAP emission reduction levels, costs, and energy and secondary environmental impacts. Several regulatory alternatives (which may be different levels of emission control, different applicability criteria, or both, and one of which is the MACT floor) are then evaluated to determine the most appropriate regulatory alternative to reflect the MACT level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches are sometimes necessary. Section 112(h) of the Act provides that if it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard, then a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard may be established. For example, in some cases source testing may be impossible or at least not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the EPA's decision-making process, the regulatory alternatives considered for new versus existing sources may be different and each alternative must be technically achievable. In selecting a regulatory alternative to represent MACT, the EPA considers the achievable reduction in HAP emissions (and possibly other pollutants that are co-controlled), the cost of control, and economic, energy, and other nonair quality health and environmental impacts. The overall objective is the achievement of the maximum degree of emission reduction without unreasonable economic or other impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The selected regulatory alternative is then translated into a proposed regulation. The regulation implementing the MACT decision typically includes sections addressing applicability, standards, test methods and compliance demonstration, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The preamble to the proposed regulation, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , provides an explanation of the rationale for the decision. The public is invited to comment on the proposed regulation during the public comment period. Following an evaluation of these comments, the EPA reaches a decision and promulgates the final standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Determining Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) ``Floors''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once the EPA has identified the specific major source categories or subcategories that it intends to regulate under section 112, MACT standards are set at a level at least as stringent as the ``floor.'' Congress has provided directives to guide the EPA in the process of determining the regulatory floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Exercising India's  right to reply to the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. Benazir  Bhutto's, statement on Kashmir, Dr. Abdullah reminded Islamabad  of the plight of the Ahmediyas, the Shi'ites and other minority  communities in Pakistan. Addressing the opening session of the  Human Rights Commission in Geneva, he observed that India always  stood by its pledge and commitment of giving equal rights to all  citizens. Dr. Abdullah asserted that Kashmir was and will  remain a part of India.    In a BBC interview later, he accused Pakistan of fomenting  insurgency in Kashmir. He said India wants peace, but Pakistan  is not responding to the offer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. It is more cost effective to utilize the services of ASPN since the clinicians and the laboratories in this program are already members of an organized network. To obtain a listing of clinicians and establish a new network would require additional time (years) and funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. ASPN has established methods for routinely collecting and reporting data from its membership. The systems, staff, and other resources are in place, available to be used for this proposed project. Patient records are accessible to ASPN for follow-up and investigative purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. ASPN clinicians have participated in a replication of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey which allows for comparisons of ASPN practices with a national sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The majority of in-office laboratory testing takes place in a primary care setting. ASPN is the only national, primary care, practice-based research network operating in the United States at the present time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Although other smaller primary care, practice-based research networks have been established in the United States, ASPN has the most diverse geographic distribution which enhances the generalizability of the data collected in this study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The composition of the ASPN network members includes a significant number of rural practices, a feature not present in other practice-based research networks operating in the United States at the present time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The ASPN network services approximately 350,000 active patients. As laboratory errors are considered to be statistically rare events, the large number of patients seen in the network greatly augments the power of the studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. ASPN has an established reporting rate of 93&hyph;98 percent. This is markedly higher than what one would expect to be able to achieve outside of a practice-based research network. The high reporting rate is due to monitoring and follow-up protocols used by the research support staff with ASPN. The high reporting rate makes the data collection more efficient and complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The ASPN network contains a small number of practices in Canada. This small subset of the network can be used as an internal control to assess changes in the practice of laboratory medicine in the United States compared to Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. All ASPN network physicians are required to endorse and support the participation of their practices by recording and reporting accurate data about patients collaboratively with other ASPN practices. Accurate and current data are paramount in this project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. There is no other known provider which can provide this type of investigative project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Executive Order 12372 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Health System Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number (CFDA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 93.283.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects that involve the collection of information from 10 or more individuals and funded by the cooperative agreement will be subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Where To Obtain Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding this project, please refer to Announcement Number 416 and contact Carole J.

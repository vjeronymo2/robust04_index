			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> TAX CONSULTANT HIRED TO FIND MORE INCOME  </P> <P> The city of Newport Beach has hired a tax consulting firm to make sure the city  is receiving all the sales tax it is entitled to, officials have announced.  </P> <P> The Westlake Village-based firm, Municipal Resource Consultants, plans to  generate additional income for the city by identifying point-of-sale taxpayer  errors that often go unnoticed.  </P> <P> Sales tax produces $12 million annually for Newport Beach, roughly a quarter of  the city's general fund. City officials did not know how much more income to  expect due to the service.  </P> <P> City Finance Director George Pappas() said MRC has conducted similar surveys  for other Orange County cities including Irvine, Fullerton and Santa Ana. The  firm's services will be self-funding; MRC will keep 25% of the income it finds  for the city.  </P></p>

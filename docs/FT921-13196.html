			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking and stock rotation dominate trade Wall Street PROFIT-TAKING and switching between sectors continued to exact a toll on US stock markets yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.64 off at 3,223.39 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 3.72 to 412.64. Over-the-counter stocks also succumbed to profit-taking, the Nasdaq composite index falling 14.51 to 604.87. New York SE turnover was 219m shares and declines led rises by 1,186 to 569. There has been no discernible shift in underlying market sentiment in recent days, and the dominant trends of the past week - profit-taking and rotational trading - were still in place yesterday. The two trends are linked; investors take profits in sectors which look overbought, and switch into sectors which look cheap and offer potential for bigger gains. Although the headline numbers show a decline, little money actually leaves the market. Among individual stocks, fourth-quarter figures proved the biggest influence on price movements. Wells Fargo dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 65 on announcing a quarterly loss of Dollars 231m after making Dollars 700m of loan-loss provisions, made primarily to cover real estate losses. The two other big California-based banks, BankAmerica and Security Pacific (which also reported a final quarter loss) slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 and Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 respectively. United Technologies dipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 after unveiling big fourth-quarter losses, taken after a Dollars 1.275bn restructuring charge and a Dollars 256m charge for increases in environmental reserves, both of which were higher than expectations. The group announced plans to shed 13,900 jobs and close down or consolidate 100 facilities. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottling company for the big soft drinks group, receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 14 3/8 after the company said it would make a Dollars 152m restructuring charge and a Dollars 15m addition to its insurance reserve during the fourth quarter. The charge, and revised 1991 earnings, mean that Coca-Cola Enterprises will announce a full-year loss of about 79 cents a share when it unveils its results next month. Revived rumours of possible bid interest from Jacuzzi, a Hanson subsidiary, lifted Eljer Industries Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 . The stock was also buoyed by speculation that the company may be close to negotiating more favourable loan covenant settlements with its banks. Leading over-the-counter stocks suffered at the hands of the profit-takers. Apple retreated Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 , Microsoft gave up Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 119 3/8 , Amgen slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 66 1/4 and Borland International, which reported a 10 per cent gain in fiscal third-quarter net income, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 70 1/2 . Canada TORONTO stocks suffered a setback and ended at the day's worst on profit-taking and nervousness over Ontario Premier Bob Rae's speech scheduled for last night. Banks fell sharply on fears that Mr Rae would somehow raise taxes for financial institutions. The composite index surrendered 35.2 at 3,620.4. Declines led advances by 356 to 274 after volume of 31.7m shares (30.5m). Alcan fell CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 24 1/4 . Traders said Kidder Peabody downgraded the company's shares to a hold from a buy. On Monday Alcan reported a 1991 loss of 25 cents per share.</p>

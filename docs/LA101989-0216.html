			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LESSONS OF SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> Earthquakes happen when you least expect them. In the San Francisco Bay Area  Tuesday evening, the world went topsy-turvy. Without warning, and in just 15  seconds, a region of 4.5 million people was shaken violently and then left  stunned and bewildered. Even for veteran Californians, there is no terror quite  like it.  </P> <P> But the Earth has been through several billions of years of grinding and  scraping and is not about to rest for anything, much less a baseball game.  Southern Californians grieve for the deaths, injuries and damage suffered by  our Northern California neighbors. There are ways that we can help (see below).  We also can use the event to advantage, to do everything we can to prepare for  such a disaster of our own.  </P> <P> No one knows when the next one will come in Southern California, but it will.  And when the quake comes, it could well be the feared big one, a shaker of  about 8.0 magnitude, or 10 times as bad as Tuesday evening's Bay Area rocker.  Imagine: 10 times as bad, or 100 times as severe as the Whittier quake of two  years ago. Picture the pancaked freeway and the squashed buildings of the  Marina District and multiply by 10. Imagine freeway bridges collapsed  throughout Southern California. Thousands dead. Fires raging. Electric power  and natural gas out for several days or more. Hundreds of thousands separated  from loved ones. Life at a shocked standstill. It could happen today or  tomorrow.  </P> <P> Generally, state and local agencies were well-prepared for the San Francisco  quake. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who was in charge as acting governor, said the  response was betterthan in previous disasters, improved to a great degree by  preparation and training instituted after the Sylmar quake, centered in the  upper San Fernando Valley, in 1971. There are always glitches and unexpected  happenings, of course. McCarthy wondered who would have imagined that the  sturdy old Bay Bridge would be the one to suffer such damage? The Nimitz  Freeway, scene of the majority of deaths, was built before earthquake standards  were adopted in the wake of the Sylmar quake. Highway authorities said  conventional methods of reinforcement undertaken in the 1970s could not be  readily adapted to the Nimitz to prevent its collapse. An investigation is in  order to find out why not, or what could have been done.  </P> <P> Officials remarked on the public-spirited reaction of the people of the Bay  Area. After the first seconds of shock and the immediate tendency to panic,  they pitched in to help one another, reponded to authorities' requests and, on  occasion, performed heroics. There is enormous human confusion in such a  disaster, McCarthy said, but he added, "Some very marvelous things were done by  individual citizens that were not in response to any emergency plans."  Motorists helped direct traffic in the absence of traffic signals. Others  joined firemen in carrying hoses. Some participated in rescues, heedless of  their own safety.  </P> <P> Once again, another area's adversity offers Southern California an opportunity  to examine its own ability to deal with an earthquake disaster. Southern  Californians must keep practicing and improving both individual and collective  disaster plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Human Element  </P> <P> The human element in an earthquake disaster is critical. There may be no more  helpless a feeling than experiencing violent ground movement, but Southern  Californians need not feel defenseless even in the event of a giant quake. The  one certainty is that individuals and families will be largely on their own for  hours or days, until transportation, communications and utilities can be  restored. Every family should have an emergency earthquake kit on hand at home,  at the office and in the car.  </P> <P> The primary home kit should contain several days' supplies of food and water, a  portable radio with spare batteries, flashlights and batteries, matches, a  source of heat such as acamp stove, extra clothing and an emergency supply of  cash, since banking facilities probably will be interrupted. There should be a  first-aid kit that includes spare medical prescriptions and eyeglasses or  contact lenses. Paper plates and plastic utensils help conserve water. A wrench  is necessary for shutting off natural gas supplies, but residents first have to  know where the cutoff valve is, and how to turn it. The California Highway  Patrol says emergency kits should be carried in auto trunks since motorists  could be stranded on freeways for hours. Prepackaged kits are available in many  surplus outlets and other stores ranging in price from $30 to $210.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Preparation  </P> <P> Generally, Southern California authorities believe the region now is  well-prepared to deal with an earthquake disaster. Still, the city and state  have failed to get substandard buildings up to earthquake codes, often because  it is difficult or impossible to get financing, but also because some landlords  simply refuse to do it. State legislation to provide assistance was vetoed this  year. In Los Angeles, City Councilman Hal Bernson has proposed a special tax  assessment and a revenue bond issue to provide reconstruction assistance for  the 4,000 buildings in Los Angeles, housing more than 100,000 people, that do  not meet standards.  </P> <P> Since the Whittier quake, about 2,800 volunteers in the city of Los Angeles  have beentrained to provide assistance in neighborhoods during an earthquake  disaster, much like air raid wardens of World War II. This forward-thinking and  economical program should be expanded throughout the region and rehearsed over  and over again.  </P> <P> Some local officials are disturbed, however, about the problem of regional  coordination of services after the initial emergency period of 72 hours or so  has ended. The Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project has  discussed a regional joint-powers agreement that would establish such an  authority, but no such plan has been developed yet. This should be a priority  for local and county governments, with state assistance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transportation  </P> <P> Regional transportation leaders claim that the freeway system could sustain a  quake like the San Francisco one without a Nimitz Freeway-style disaster. But  the network is not built to withstand a giant earthquake. Both Caltrans and the  California Highway Patrol say that motorists can expect most of the freeways to  be shut down in such an event. Those ramps and bridges that do not collapse  will be inspected as soon as possible for structural damage.  </P> <P> Only now is the Los Angeles area moving to double-decked freeways like the  Nimitz, with work starting on a deck over part of the Harbor Freeway and  proposals for double-decking theVentura Freeway. Caltrans officials say modern  freeway structures, such as those being built on the Century route, "are the  strongest things we have." There would be no comparison between these modern  structures and the aged Nimitz, but double-decking now is going to be a  political issue. Caltrans will have to demonstrate the security of such a  system.  </P> <P> Airports are critical in such disasters and local and federal aviation  authorities claim they are well prepared. Los Angeles International Airport  conducted a drill simulating an 8.0 earthquake in 1987. Plans provide for LAX  not only to serve as a transit point, but also as a focus for emergency medical  treatment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Utilities  </P> <P> The Sylmar quake also has been the benchmark for utilities improvements in  recent years, but one company executive says there is no way to guard against  major damage when vital facilities are located near the epicenter of a giant  quake. For telephone companies, a major problem, even when service is  available, is lines jammed by people trying to call in to friends and  relatives. In San Francisco, incoming calls were blocked to give priority to  those trying to call out from the damaged area. Pacific Bell conducts routine  earthquake drills.  </P> <P> The major water systems serving Southern California are designed to withstand a  major quake, but even if the California Aqueduct were ruptured, the region  should have a six-months' supply on hand, provided there is strict  conservation. The major problem would be small distribution systems. In 1971,  the disabled San Fernando system was tied into that of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Electric power systems are probably the most difficult to cushion against  earthquake shock, but there also have been improvements since 1971. Natural gas  lines also are less likely to break than in the past with the use of modern,  more pliable materials. But, as with electricity, gas service could be out  days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Help Northern California  </P> <P> While now is the time to renew preparations for a possible Southern California  disaster, it is also appropriate to consider the hardship that Northern  Californians will suffer for weeks and months to come. Many families have lost  their homes and possessions. State and federal disaster assistance will be  forthcoming, but slowly. The Red Cross is seeking contributions of both money  and blood. In this disaster there is only one California. Blood donors can  contact local Red Cross chapters and those who want to make monetary  contributions can call the Red Cross at 1-800-453-9000.  </P></p>

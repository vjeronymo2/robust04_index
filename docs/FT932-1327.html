			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union boss attacks Smith's critics A VIGOROUS attack on the union leaders opposing Mr John Smith's proposed reforms to the links between the Labour party and the unions was launched yesterday by Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians' sections of the AEEU union. He said support for Mr Smith's proposal to end direct union influence in the selection of parliamentary candidates was not tantamount to 'breaking' the links. Those union leaders who argued that it was, were 'stabbing him in the back'. He said at the electricians' conference in Blackpoool: 'It is time that some union leaders decided what it is they want. Do they want influence in the party of government or do they want power in a party of permanent opposition?' The electricians are likely soon to return to the Trades Union Congress after being expelled in 1988. The union has long backed Mr Smith's reform proposals, but Mr Gallagher's strong support will boost the Smith camp, which has been under attack from many union leaders. Also speaking at the conference, Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, underlined the ties between the party and the union movement. She attacked the government for trying to weaken those links, for example by requiring ballots to be held on unions' political funds.</p>

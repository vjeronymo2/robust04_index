			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Presidency pact in Venezuela THE leaders of Venezuela's two dominant political parties have chosen Senator Ramon J. Velasquez, a respected writer, historian and politician, as their candidate to become the provisional president. This decision by the ruling Democratic Action party (AD) and the opposition Christian democratic Copei may solve the national leadership crisis, which arose when President Carlos Andres Perez was suspended from office on May 21 to face corruption charges. Mr Octavio Lepage, chairman of the Senate, was sworn in as acting-president immediately after the suspension but the opposition parties have been calling for his removal ever since. Both chambers of Congress must meet to consider the candidacy and vote in secret on the new provisional president. This is expected by the end of the week. A majority vote is required, which should be secured for the candidate because the two main political parties dominate Congress. AD and Copei leaders are using all their political influence to secure Mr Velasquez's election, despite complaints from small opposition parties. A full presidential election is due in December. While agreeing to stand for the interim presidency, Mr Velasquez has asked the two main parties to give him special powers so he can enact by decree a series of reforms that have been languishing in Congress for months. These measures are expected to include new taxes to help cover the govenrment's fiscal deficit, tax cuts, levies on the national oil company, a reform of the privatisation law, and a bill authorising central government borrowing this year. Mr Velasquez, a moderate voice and conciliator in Venezuelan politics, is a senator for his home state of Tachira. Although he was elected to the Senate on the AD slate, he is seen as a political independent and has held high positions in both AD and Copei administrations. Last year, Mr Perez named him to chair a special commission that recommended widespread government reforms.</p>

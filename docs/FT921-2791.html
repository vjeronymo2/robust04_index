			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Trying to claw back Lib Dem voters THERE WERE no babies to hand as Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, posed for the cameras in Crail, the picturesque Scottish harbour. He had to make do with a lobster and an elderly fisherman. The lobster's claws were taped together, making it perhaps a safer prop than most babies. Lord Sanderson was on the road to launch the Scottish Conservative attack on the Liberal Democrats - it believes it has a better chance of winning votes from them than from the other parties. Crail, a fishing village popular with tourists and weekending professionals from Edinburgh, is in a former Liberal stronghold - Herbert Asquith's old constituency of Fife North-East. It turned Tory for a while, but was re-captured by Mr Menzies Campbell for the Liberal Democrats in 1987. Mr Campbell's majority is 1,447, so the seat is a key target for the Conservatives. Lord Sanderson later warned the party faithful, gathered in the British Legion hall, about the dangers of voting Liberal Democrat. A vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for Neil Kinnock, he said, pointing to the Liberal Democrat record of voting with Labour against Conservative bills. He reserved his greatest venom for something close to the grey-haired audience's hearts. 'Did you know that they have opposed Conservative plans to exempt thousands of family firms, including farms, from inheritance tax?' he asked. The audience did, and did not approve; the constituency is largely agricultural. One ray of hope for the Tories is the prospect - reported in the local press, but not yet confirmed - that a Liberal Unionist candidate, Mr David Senior, might stand against Mr Campbell on an anti-devolution platform. Local Conservatives described Mr Senior approvingly as 'an old-fashioned Liberal Unionist', recalling the party which was known for being more Tory than the Tories. One member of the audience helpfully raised the possibility of a split Liberal Democrat vote. 'One would hope so - right down the middle,' agreed the Conservative candidate, spotting an improved chance of a seat at Westminster. But some Tories privately admitted that a Liberal Unionist could take votes from the Conservatives as well.</p>

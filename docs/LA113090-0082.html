			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KANSAS CAN'T SEE WHY UNLV WAS TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY NCAA  </P> <P> While UNLV celebrates, Kansas seethes.  </P> <P> "I sure wish they'd given us a multiple-choice penalty," said Roy Williams, the  Jayhawks' basketball coach.  </P> <P> "I can't believe what the NCAA did," said Jeff Gueldner, a guard on Kansas'  national championship team of 1988 that was barred from the 1989 tournament.  "It looks to me like the rules are not applied uniformly."  </P> <P> Kansas followers were angered Thursday when the NCAA gave UNLV a choice it did  not give the Jayhawks. After barring UNLV from defending its 1989 title because  of violations stemming from a 1977 infractions case, the NCAA on Thursday  changed its mind and offered the Rebels two alternatives. UNLV chose the second  alternative, and will be able to defend its title this year after all.  </P> <P> Thus, Kansas will remain the only NCAA basketball champion barred from  defending its NCAA championship.  </P> <P> Del Brinkman, a vice president at Kansas and the school's longtime faculty  representative, issued a one-sentence statement: "I didn't think it was  possible to negotiate with the NCAA."  </P></p>

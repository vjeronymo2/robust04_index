			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sha'ul Peretz] </F>   [Excerpts] A group of 20 senior reserve officers who  formerly served in elite units and the Shin Bet have been hired  to train soldiers of the Congo-Brazzaville Army.    This is part of a giant arms and military equipment sale,  worth tens of millions of dollars, by Israel Military Industries  and other defense manufacturers. An agreement to this effect  was recently been signed between private Israeli entrepreneurs  and the Congo Government. In an appendix to the agreement, the  Israeli company pledged to provide the Congolese Army with  guidance and training.    The "Congo deal" has recently been approved by the Defense  Ministry's Defense Sales Department. At the same time, the deal  also met some opposition due to the fact that Congolese loyal to  the president have been fighting the supporters of the prime  minister. It is important to note that the deal was made with  Congo-Brazzaville in West Africa, and not with its neighbor  Zaire, also known as Congo-Kinshasa.    The company behind the deal is Lavdan, a subsidiary of the  public corporation Qardan Investments [company names as  published]. The names of the persons who are actually behind  the deal are not yet known, but the man named in charge of  executing the training project is Brigadier General Ze'ev  Zakharin (Reserves), who is considered an expert in training  foreign armies.    Zakharin (45), served as the commander of the liaison unit  to  Lebanon and won praise for his work in training the South  Lebanese Army. [passage omitted]    Reacting to the report, the Lavdan company issued the  following statement: "The deal mentioned includes the supply of  equipment and guidance which the Israeli companies will provide  to the African country. Beyond this activity, there is no  network of persons or elements on behalf of our company in that  country."    The Defense Ministry spokesman reacted: "The Defense  Ministry is not in the habit of addressing itself to  publications concerning defense exports."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Blow Below the Belt"] </F>   [Text] President Michal Kovac departed yesterday for  neighboring Poland, for what is his first state visit abroad  this year. As is well known, he had met his host, President  Lech Walesa, at the recent summit of the Visegrad Four heads of  state with the U.S. President, where the two presidents agreed  that the present visit should become a landmark in relations  between the two countries.    I will not betray any state secret when I say there is an  outright deficit in the two countries' knowledge of one another  and, in particular, in the development of economic and  commercial contacts, which have registered a rapid decrease in  recent years. Therefore, it was to be expected that precisely  these topics would figure uppermost on the agenda of the talks  in Warsaw.    But, wonder of wonders, neither the minister of economy nor  the minister of foreign affairs is in the delegation  accompanying the Slovak president. The minister of the  environment is the only government member who was given the  green light [to accompany the president]. I am not suggesting  that cooperation in this unquestionably important area need not  be discussed. The crux of the matter seems to lie in something  else, however. Somebody is doing everything he can for the head  of state not to grow taller than he is and for the head of state  not to be able to ascribe to himself the credit for something  that, in the view of the latter, somehow does not belong to him.    This already open hostility endangers the vital interests of  our state because it can be expected that such behavior will not  go unnoticed by the other side and will boomerang against us  and, apparently, will be repaid with interest.    Because the chiefs of government departments who could give  an impetus to Slovak-Polish relations were not allowed to go to  Warsaw, it must be assumed that the government had far more  important problems to deal with at its meeting yesterday.</p>

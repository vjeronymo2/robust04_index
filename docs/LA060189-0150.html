			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'PALESTINIAN NETWORK': A FULL REPORT?  </P> <P> Anatomy of a highly questionable news story. . . .  </P> <P> It was the lead segment on Saturday's installment of "West 57th," the low-rated  but usually respectable CBS News magazine series.  </P> <P> The reporter was Karen Burnes, an experienced, award-winning correspondent with  an impressive record in investigative journalism. The producer was Kathy  McManus.  </P> <P> The segment's title was "The Palestinians: Dirty Business."  </P> <P> The premise was that a "network" of Palestinians -- most of whose leaders are  related and come from the same area in the Israeli-occupied West Bank -- is  committing crimes in the United States to fund political action and terror in  the Middle East.  </P> <P> "It (the report) was well documented," Burnes said later from New York.  </P> <P> "I worked on the story for more than a year," McManus said from New York. "I'm  absolutely convinced what we said is correct. I wouldn't change a word of it."  </P> <P> "I think they did an excellent job," executive producer Andrew Lack said from  New York.  </P> <P> Here's a different opinion:  </P> <P> The point is not whether "West 57th" may have been right about the alleged  network, but how it went about trying to show it. The segment was less a story  than largely unsupported or loosely attributed allegations reported in a  confusing and misleading time warp.  </P> <P> The tiny West Bank community of Deir Dibwan was identified by Burnes as the  source of the alleged network. "U.S. and Canadian law enforcement officials  consider this town at the center of radical political activity and organized  crime" that is "carried on by a network of Palestinians who travel a circuit  from the West Bank to the United States," she said.  </P> <P> Burnes cited Palestinians engaging in such scams as insurance and other frauds  to fund "what the FBI calls political and terrorist activities."  </P> <P> No FBI representative appeared on the program to corroborate that. The FBI  "wouldn't be interviewed" on camera, Burnes said afterward by phone.  </P> <P> However, FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz -- whom McManus suggested I call for  elaboration -- said that "West 57th" never requested an on-camera interview.  </P> <P> "I think they were in a hurry," Steinmetz said from Washington, D.C. "They (he  said McManus was the only representative from the show he spoke to) called here  just a few days before that (the segment) aired."  </P> <P> What's more, Steinmetz said that he told McManus only that "a number of scams  were going on throughout the United States, and that money was being funneled  back to several of the Palestinian organizations. Where it goes from there, we  don't know."  </P> <P> Hence, Steinmetz said, Burnes was "stretching it" in reporting the FBI as  saying "terrorist activities" are financed from Palestinian-run scams.  </P> <P> "I didn't talk to anybody about terrorist groups," he said. "They ('West 57th')  would like to think it was terrorists. I could see where the story was going."  </P> <P> (After our initial phone interview, Lack called back Wednesday morning to say  that McManus had since spoken to Steinmetz and that Steinmetz "confirms  absolutely everything we said in the broadcast." Lack added that Steinmetz told  McManus that "he stands behind us completely, that indeed everything we said  was accurate and appropriate."  </P> <P> (Steinmetz refuted Lack's account when I read it to him on the phone. How could  he be "standing behind" the report when he hadn't even seen it, he asked.  </P> <P> (I read him my quotes from our previous conversation, and he did not dispute  them. However, Steinmetz, who said the information he gave "West 57th" came  from Bob Ricks, deputy assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative  division, said now that he did not want me to use the quotes he earlier had  given me. However, no arrangement had been made that that earlier interview  would be off the record.)  </P> <P> The alleged link to terrorist activities was never adequately substantiated in  the program.  </P> <P> Burnes sought to establish the link in an interview with Florida police  detective Don Cannon, whom she said had headed a task force probing a "pattern  of Palestinian criminal activity in Florida."  </P> <P> Burnes asked Cannon if the Palestinians in question were "an organized network  of people motivated by political purpose, or are they just common crooks?"  </P> <P> Cannon: "We see the money leaving, but we don't see that much coming back in. .  . . So it's going to fund something else." In "the Middle East?" Burnes asked.  Yes, replied Cannon, attributing his information to "raw intelligence."  </P> <P> Burnes: "So does that leave you believing they might be funding terrorist  activities?"  </P> <P> Again citing "raw intelligence," Cannon said that money is "being sent back to  fund the PLO or the PFLP (the terrorist popular front for the liberation of  Palestine) or the intifida (the Arabic word for the Palestinian uprising on the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip)."  </P> <P> Burnes did not ask Cannon to define "raw intelligence." Reached in Sunrise,  Fla., where he is on the police force, Cannon said that "raw intelligence" is  information "we may have gotten from several sources, but we consider it raw  until we can verify it from several more sources and get more etched-in-stone  information."  </P> <P> As for the "network," cut to Washington state, where Burnes said that a "group  of Palestinians doing bustouts (opening stores and quickly vanishing with  merchandise bought on credit) bilked their creditors out of nearly $3.5 million  before vanishing."  </P> <P> Burnes ticked off other illegal activities that she said authorities attributed  to Palestinians and said one of the Palestinians "left a forwarding address,  Deir Dibwan."  </P> <P> Cut to Burnes with a group of "elders" in Deir Dibwan. "Each of these men lived  in the United States and most of them ran stores under investigation by the FBI  and by local police in at least 15 states," Burnes said.  </P> <P> Elderly man in Arab headdress: "I have liquor store in San Francisco five  years."  </P> <P> It was a classic case of implied guilt by association. Stores were said to be  under investigation. This man had a store. Thus he was suspect.  </P> <P> Now cut to Burnes back in the United States with a woman she identified as  Veronica Heath, who is "related by marriage" to Palestinian brothers. Heath:  "They contributed to the PLO."  </P> <P> Burnes said that "investigators consider some of the family key players in  illegal and possibly radical activity." Heath said that she attended meetings  at which "everyone was posing in front of the Palestinian flag and . . .  holding up guns."  </P> <P> Onward now to "small stores in Miami" that Burnes said "have now become part of  an investigation." They have huge profits, she said. "Much of the money is  smuggled out of the country, in one case by a Palestinian grandmother carrying  the bills in her clothing."  </P> <P> Who? Where? When? .  </P> <P> Burnes confronted a Palestinian grocery store owner: "Authorities say these  Palestinians are linked by family, by friendship, by location. They all come  from the same place on the West Bank." Still, all we had was her word for that.  </P> <P> Cut to Burnes back in Deir Dibwan with the mayor, who seemed to be able to  understand but not speak English. "How many people . . . in this community have  some form of contact with America?" Burnes asked.  </P> <P> "There are about 2,000," the mayor replied through an interpreter.  </P> <P> Burnes: "So about half of the people in this town are in America sometime or  another?" But wait a minute. Her original question was about "contact" with  America, not being "in" America. Did the mayor understand the subtle difference  in her second question when, through the interpreter, he responded "about  half," seeming to agree with Burnes that 50% of the town had been in the United  States?  </P> <P> Cut to Burnes back in the United States, saying: "Just last week, the FBI  confirmed that some small Palestinian businesses across America use the money  they generate to support the PLO."  </P> <P> The next voice we heard was that of Gordon Park: "What they would do is throw a  brick through their front window and say, 'Oh, gosh, I got burglarized.' " Park  was identified as an attorney for a California insurance company "taken in by  Palestinians from the same network." The "network" whose existance had not been  proved.  </P> <P> The editing was misleading. Eight years separated the "they" Park referred to  and the "small Palestinian businesses" that Burnes referred to, for as Park  later noted in passing, his case was "back in '81."  </P> <P> Onward. "Affidavits filed in Memphis describe a Palestinian leaving for the  Middle East with 20 stacks of $50 and $100 bills, each a foot high. Undercover  authorities also made contact with two Palestinians who were seeking to buy  firearms to ship to Jordan," Burnes said. "The purpose: to kill Jews."  </P> <P> There was no indication who filed the affidavits or when these events were  supposed to have happened. Perhaps a few observant viewers were able to read  the "1986" on one of the affidavits as it quickly scrolled by, which showed  only when the document was filed, not when the described events occurred.  </P> <P> Onward. "Documents obtained by 'West 57th' reveal an even more sinister side to  the Palestinian network," Burnes said. Again, that's the "network" whose  existance she had not substantiated.  </P> <P> She told of Albuquerque police finding "photos of Al Fatah fighters living in  the United States, and bomb plans drawn on Al Fatah's letterhead. Al Fatah has  been linked to terrorist activities against Americans."  </P> <P> I learned later only from asking McManus that this discovery was made in 1980.  "I don't think dates are important," she said on the phone. "This is a story  about the pattern of criminal activity. We showed things from 10 years ago and  things from today." Without telling viewers which was which.  </P> <P> Burnes asked Heath about the brothers: "Veronica, how dedicated do you think  these people are to the Palestinian cause?" And Heath replied: "Some of them  would lay their life on the line." But that proved nothing, because many  people, including Americans, would lay their lives on the line for a cause they  believed in.  </P> <P> "West 57th." Sometimes the news business is a dirty business.  </P></p>

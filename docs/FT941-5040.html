			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (7): Collect it by phone - Training is a good investment Credit managers often complain of limited resources allocated to them for training. They feel like poor relations as they see sales colleagues sent off on course after course. However, there are signs that the situation is improving. 'People are starting to realise that it is worth investing in training,' says Ms Jill Weymouth, a Bristol-based freelance trainer. But progress is not fast enough for some. 'It's changing very, very slowly,' says Mr Denis Trought, director of Credit Management Training Ltd, looking back over 16 years in the industry. At least the recession and its aftermath have increased momentum. Mr Trought has seen steady demand for his courses over the past few years. 'There wasn't any slackening off,' he says. At the Institute of Credit Management (ICM), training manager Ms Lesley Haigh has seen a strong rise in underlying demand over the long term. In the recession she saw bookings drop, but thinks that this was because of large numbers of new trainers entering the market. 'There are a lot more players in the field than there were three or four years ago.' Newcomers include sizeable organisations such as Infocheck, as well as redundant credit managers who have set up as trainers. Shaws Linton Business Training Ltd provides over 250 courses right across the business spectrum. The six in the credit management field are much in demand. 'They are our strongest performers,' says Ms Amanda Kemp, the marketing manager. Most trainers report that the most popular courses are in telephone collection techniques. Ms Weymouth sees this area as fundamental. 'The telephone is the most practical and effective way of collecting cash,' she says. 'Telephone collection techniques do tend to point people in the right direction,' agrees Mr Paul Stevenson, credit manager for BASF. '95 per cent are not doing it right,' says Mr Trought, of staff that he has observed before training. Coaching can help employees to prepare properly before making calls and to be polite but assertive. Asking the right mixture of 'closed' questions (answerable with a yes or no) and 'open' questions (which require more explanation) is important. 'You can probe and question and gain a commitment,' says Ms Weymouth. When dealing with consumers, debt counselling - as opposed to debt recovery - is increasingly needed. Training is being refocused accordingly. Mr Stevenson accepts that some staff have natural gifts in this area, but he is sure that training does make a difference. His confidence stems from the fact that, if collection is monitored, the results of a course are easy to quantify: 'You get a virtually instant indication of how well it's gone by the effect on cash flow.' The benefits of other kinds of collection courses are similarly easy to evaluate. As well as collection techniques, risk assessment courses are in demand. Interpretation of financial statements is central here. Mainland Europe is a growing area of interest to companies and bookings for relevant courses are growing. Dun &amp; Bradstreet has recently launched a new course to help staff analyse the accounts of European businesses. There is growing enthusiasm among trainers and companies for in-house courses. Experts train company staff on-site. 'In-company training has distinct advantages,' explains BASF's Paul Stevenson. 'It's a method of operation tailored to a company. If you go to an outside course it might not be adapted to your needs.' Mr Stevenson says that it becomes viable where the credit management function has more than half a dozen staff. Mr David Ancliffe, credit manager at Scottish &amp; Newcastle Sales, which supplies beverages to supermarkets and other retail outlets, brings in an external trainer once a year to run a one-day seminar for his 16-member department. This costs about Pounds 40 per employee. He says that travel and accommodation costs for external courses would be about Pounds 200 a head, with course fees on top. There are other advantages. Trainers can come into the company in pre-course consultancy to see how employees go about their work, in order to focus later training sessions properly. 'We can look at systems, talk to staff confidentially and look at a company's customers,' says Denis Trought of Credit Management Training. 'We can make the whole thing very personal.' He says that external courses with participants from a range of industries can be problematic: 'A couple of people, because of the peculiarities of their business, will have difficulty relating.' Simply sending staff on a course is not the end of the story. Credit managers stress the importance of structured training tailored to employees' individual requirements. 'Each person has different needs and proceeds at different speeds,' says Ms Ann Stanislawski, credit manager at Hitachi Europe. Her five staff all have personal training programmes. Two of Ms Stanislawski's team are studying for the ICM professional exams and receive support from the company. She thinks this is important because their present roles are limited and the ICM syllabus will give them wider exposure. 'They learn about areas other than trade credit and get a broader education,' she says. Ms Jill Weymouth points to the importance of regular training update courses. In some areas, such as dealing with county courts, rules change quickly. With practical skills such as collection techniques, booster courses can pay dividends. Employees in companies which are particularly budget conscious might find distance learning a solution. Infocheck launched a correspondence course for a diploma in credit management last year. 'We were surprised by the immediate interest,' says Mr Ian Sanderson, director of Infocheck's training services. More than 150 students have already enrolled. Mr Sanderson thinks the course material might be particularly useful for staff in small credit departments who may not have other reference material. Dun &amp; Bradstreet has run a distance learning programme in credit and financial analysis for some time. 'Ours has done very well,' says Judith de Jong, manager of business education services. Successful completion exempts students from part of the ICM's intermediate syllabus.</p>

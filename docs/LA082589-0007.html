			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFINING RAPE AND RAPISTS  </P> <P> King and McCaughey stated that "getting your date drunk to get sex from her" is  rape. But how can a man possibly get his date drunk? Does he put a funnel in  the woman's mouth and pour alcohol into it? Does he inject alcohol into her  bloodstream intravenously? Does he force her to drink at gunpoint? I don't  think so.  </P> <P> If a woman voluntarily goes out with a man, voluntarily drinks alcoholic  beverages until she is drunk, and then (while still conscious) fails to resist  her date's sexual advances (or fails to otherwise indicate that she does not  consent to his advances), then her date has the right to assume that she has  consented to his sexual advances, and the resulting sex at is not rape. This is  true even if she later regrets having had sex with him and even if she would  not have had sex with him if her inhibitions had not been lowered by the  alcohol.  </P> <P> DAN ARKOFF  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

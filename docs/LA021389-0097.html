			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> MAKING A DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL BLACKS  </P> <P> When Dr. Gloria Powell, a black child psychiatrist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric  Institute, speaks about the troubling disparity between the quality of white  and black lives, she often uses a word that whites seldom hear and often have  trouble swallowing: Negrophobia, the social science theory that explains  discrimination as the result of an innate discomfort whites feel toward blacks.  Powell, who specializes in the psychological and social development of minority  children, has been a resident of Los Angeles since 1965. She lives in Pacific  Palisades. These are excerpts of an interview with Times staff writer Bob  Baker.  </P> <P>  If you look in the literature about Afro-Americans and the effects of slavery,  the view that comes through most resoundingly is the word Negrophobia. In "The  American Dilemma," Gunnar Myrdal talks about the conflict between the  Negrophobia that is deeply ridden in American society and the goal of achieving  total equality and says the handling of the Negro and where to put him has  always been a difficult task.  </P> <P> I am struck when I look at the changes since the Watts riots, that we have so  many more (public health) buildings, but we don't have the programs or the  money for the programs to provide the comprehensive services that the children  in that area really need. We have not by and large changed the health picture,  the education picture, the social lives.  </P> <P> The contrast for California in terms of the wealth and how it is spent and used  and who gets services and who doesn't is very striking to someone like me, who  comes from Boston. I grew up on a street called Elbert Street, a little  dead-end street in the middle of Roxbury, in a tenement house. My father died  when I was 3. We were one of first families to receive funding under a new  program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. The resources that were  available to us were extensive: Freedom House, a social services agency,  produced a whole host of black youngsters who went on to college. The South End  Music School had people from the Boston Symphony Orchestra who would volunteer  their time to teach needy youngsters. I think we paid 25 cent a lesson. Every  single summer from the time my brother was 7 until he was 17 he was away from  Roxbury at a YMCA camp. I belonged to a marvelous Girl Scout troop which  allowed us to see all the museums in Boston, all the surrounding communities,  plays. It was an expansive experience.  </P> <P> As I sit at a desk in the Kaiser Watts counseling center or the Hawkins Mental  Health Center and make my diagnosis, so many times I have wanted to say:  "Freedom House, three times a week." Or, "Enroll this kid in a Boys Club and  let him learn how to swim." Or, "Send this kid to a class at Boston Teachers  College for children who stammer." Or, "Send this kid to South End Music School  and let him have some music to develop his self-concept." Besides Kaiser Watt's  tutorial center, where are the other tutorial programs we can send this child?  Because he's already in third grade and reading at pre-kindergarten level and  his report cards have been saying A all the time and the teachers are reporting  he's doing work at grade level, and then when he takes the national test, he's  in the 22nd percentile. Sit in one of the elementary schools. Go where I go,  sit where I sit and you'll see it.  </P> <P> When you look at the way people vote and set their priorities, it's Negrophobia  in some respects. Those who have an awful lot and those who don't have exist in  larger numbers than we would like to recognize. Those who have don't want to  give up anything that they have because you know how they think about it. The  fearfulness that if we give "them" too much it would be a mistake.  </P> <P> As a black there's no way you can escape it. If you are Hispanic and learn  English very, very well, you can become more amalgamated into society. But for  blacks the amalgamation process is much more difficult. It's a constant  reminder.  </P> <P> The way the media covers gangs perpetuates this in Los Angeles. Too often they  show all the problems of blacks without looking at the ecological factors. Less  than 5% of all black kids in L.A. are part of gangs. What happens to the other  95%? Every teacher everywhere the children go will think of them like those  black kids they saw on TV. Because in California people are so far from the  black community, the only way they know anything about blacks is what they see  on TV. So it makes a difference for me with my son. I've had to teach him  differently than other people would. I had to say things like, "I know you're  driving with so-and-so and so-and-so, but if you get caught by the police,  don't make a remark." I didn't like having to expose that part of society to  him.  </P> <P> I had an incident in a market once in which the checker wanted my driver's  license, which I thought was reasonable, but then he wanted my Social Security  number, then the telephone number of my office, and then he wanted to call my  boss to verify I worked there. I was furious. I said to my children: "Children,  you are observing racism at this very moment. What is happening to Mommy is  racist. Watch how I deal with it." I called the manager. He came over and  apologized, then took me aside and said, "Dr. Powell, it's kind of rough around  here. You would do yourself a favor to put M.D. on your check." I said, "I  don't want to advertise I'm a doctor." But eventually I did. I decided I could  not fight the battle. And if that saved me that inner psychic energy I needed  to challenge somewhere else, then it was worth it.  </P></p>

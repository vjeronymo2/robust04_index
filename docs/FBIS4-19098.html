			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] Allied leaders have thrown down the gauntlet to  Bosnian Serb forces besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde with  a warning to pull back or face more air strikes.    Unsubstantiated radio reports from United Nations officials  in Gorazde described continued shelling of the town despite a  second air strike against Serb positions. The Bosnian Serbs  have said they will consider themselves at war with the UN if  air strikes go on.    Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg issued a stern warning  to the Serbs: "They need to keep in mind that force will be used  to support UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units in the way that  has just happened in Gorazde."    And NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner strongly advised  the Serbs not to retaliate as such a move would provoke a tough  response.    "We would not sit there," he said. "We have so far used only  two aircraft. There are far more than 100 aircraft down there,  so I would warn anybody against the idea of retaliation."    Government sources in London made plain that Serb forces  should be under no illusion that there is a reluctance to use  air power.    "If shelling continues and UNPROFOR feels threatened, then  the same is likely to happen again," said one official. "The  writing is on the wall -- the message is there and we can see it  being hammered home until they finally get the message."    But Britain's support for strikes against the Serbs is  believed to have been behind an abortive attempt by  ultra-nationalist Greek terrorists to hit the carrier Ark Royal  with antitank rockets. The November 17 guerrilla group said it  had tried to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88mm rockets as  it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens.    A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is  ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The  connection is not too difficult to make."    Ark Royal with its six Sea Harrier jump-jets and its sister  ship Invincible have been alternating on six-month tours since  January last year as part of NATO's operations to enforce the  no-fly zone over Bosnia. It is now steaming back into the  Adriatic from Greece. It was unlikely that RAF [Royal Air  Force] or Royal Navy warplanes would be used in strikes at  present, British sources said last night.    For the second day running an elite seven-strong squad of  SAS  [Special Air Service] soldiers in Gorazde played a key role in  the attack on Serb positions.    Acting as forward air controllers, they successfully  directed  an American F/A-18 bomber on to its targets of Serb armoured  vehicles.    Several patrol groups from the Hereford-based regiment were  ordered into a number of Muslim enclaves following a specific  request from UN commander, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose,  himself a former SAS commander.    Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military assistant to  General Rose, gave an update on the situation on the ground in  Bosnia overnight.    He said: "There has been no shelling of Gorazde town. There  has been some sporadic fighting in the hills to the north and to  the east, which we are investigating, but of the town itself and  of the UN personnel and troops in the area -- they have not been  engaged and the area is described as calm."    Replying to Bosnian Serb criticisms that General Rose had  treated Bosnia like a British colony he said: "This is a highly  complex operation and over the last few days General Rose has  made a series of very fine judgments over which way to go.    ``But he has maintained two clear tracks. One track is his  obligation to the safe area and the safety of the troops, and  that is in Gorazde. His other track is maintaining the  ceasefire process and the cessation of hostilities throughout  Bosnia.''    Lt Col Shadbolt told BBC Radio 4 that UN commanders would be  drawing up a plan for Gorazde and considering further aid and a  helicopter evacuation of the seriously injured.</p>

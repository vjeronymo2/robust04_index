			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mikelic in Trieste?"] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana, Trieste -- The speculations of the  Italian right wing with Istria and Dalmatia are limitless, the  Trieste correspondent of Ljubljana DELO writes. He proves this  with an invitation to visit Trieste that the neofascist party's  councilor Sergio Giacomelli has extended to the Petrinja  usurper, Boris Mikelic [prime minister of the republic fo  Serbian Krajina, RSK]. The Italian Foreign Ministry rules out  any possibility of Mikelic holding talks with the  representatives of the Italian Government. The Italian  neofascists are of the opinion that Knin has the right to  self-determination and that the recognition of independence of  the so-called Knin Krajina would open possibilities for the  autonomy of Istria, DELO writes.</p>

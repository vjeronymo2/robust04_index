At a special congress in Giyani on Saturday [5 March] the  party gave the thumbs up to Chief Samuel Nxumalo as its  president and resolved to have the party's registration for the  elections canceled in court.    Secretary-General Ed Ngobeni and Treasurer A D Mahatlani,  who  are part of the group which registered the party, were replaced  with Chris Fankomo and L M Nkuna respectively.    The position of vice-president, held by Edward Mhinga, who  is  also with the rival group, was done way with by the conference  which was attended by about 200 people.    The conference decided the opposition group, which voted at  a  conference in Phalaborwa last week to remove Chief Nxumalo as  president, be stopped from using the Ximoko Progressive Party  name.    At a joint rally held at Giyani Stadium with the ANC, Chief  Nxumalo told a crowd of more than 10,000 to vote for the ANC.</p>

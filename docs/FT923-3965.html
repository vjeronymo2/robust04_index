			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy ready to open new domestic bond exchange ITALY'S domestic bond futures market is finally ready to open on Friday, after several delays caused by technical problems. The new exchange - the Mercato Italiano Futures (MIF) - will have to compete with the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange's successful BTP futures contract, which records an average daily volume of more than 16,000 contracts. Liffe has already seen off competition from a rival contract on the Matif, the Paris-based exchange. The timing of the launch - a week ahead of the French referendum on Maastricht - has caused some raised eyebrows among traders. The Italian bond market has been one of the worst victims of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June. Last Friday, the Bank of Italy hiked the discount rate to 15 per cent and fears of a currency devaluation continue to undermine the bond market. But the high level of volatility in the Italian government bond market could attract some market participants. In practice, the new market will have to count on attracting domestic participants, many of which have not been active in the Liffe contract - or any other futures contracts. However, such a base could take some time to build. MIF has been added to Italy's existing Telematico system, a screen-based government bond trading system.</p>

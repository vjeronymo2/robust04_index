			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / A president sidling towards staying on: A look at Menem's chances of asecond term in Argentina ONE OF the strangest things about Mr Carlos Menem's presidency of Argentina is that, against all expectations, he has usually taken the right decisions. But Argentina is wondering whether he is now on a wrong path by trying to keep himself in office. Today, he reaches the midpoint of his six-year term, apparently committed to change the country's constitution, which does not let a president succeed himself. The current president is not the first to attempt this. All but one of Argentina's post-war civilian presidents tried to amend the constitution and succeed themselves. All failed, except the late Juan Peron, who was toppled in 1955 before the end of his second term. Mr Menem and his courtiers, though, are convinced they can succeed. They must act quickly for, during the next three years, the government would have to convince two-thirds of Congress to call a constituent assembly, would have to fight an election campaign for that assembly, rewrite the constitution and then fight a presidential campaign. The president has chosen an ambiguous strategy. He feigns disinterest by promising to return in 1995 to his home town of Anillaco to practise law. Meanwhile, his cronies campaign for his re-election. The effort may be futile, however. There is little chance of convincing enough opposition Radicals and disaffected Peronists in Congress to form the two-thirds majority to convene a constituent assembly. There are also signs that public opinion is turning against the government. The stock market, which quintupled in value last year, has fallen from its peaks. The business establishment - until now Mr Menem's most trustworthy ally - is making warning noises. Mr Roberto Alemann, a former economy minister and an establishment stalwart, warns that Mr Menem's need to buy political support would destroy economic stability. He likens the re-election movement to 'burning a city to light a cigar.' Mr Menem is vulnerable to shifts in the nation's mood. He has never won unequivocal backing from any group, not even from the Peronists. His greatest political assets are a feel for public opinion and free-market policies that have reduced inflation to single figures and set off a consumer boom. But, if his personal authority is damaged, financial markets and the wider economy might lose confidence. Business confidence is vital after 60 years of upheaval. Mr Menem may yet take another course, by unambiguously rejecting a second consecutive mandate, and using the second half of his term to concentrate on deepening his reforms. This is what Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and a possible presidential candidate, wants. He says: 'If we carry out good government, I have no doubt that the people will want President Menem to continue.' Much remains to be done. The president needs to continue deregulating the economy, press ahead with privatisations and attract investment. To do that, he must foreswear reforming the constitution, stamp out cronyism and corruption, and reinforce discredited national institutions. He must also deal with growing demands for social justice. Voters already take low inflation for granted and now want jobs, higher wages and better social services. But living standards are falling sharply, wealth is becoming more concentrated, and the economy is slowing. Data suggest investment is far from the levels needed to achieve the 6 per cent annual growth Mr Cavallo has promised. The next three years are already full of challenges and dangers even without a bruising bid to remain in office. If Mr Menem contented himself with a single term and followed Mr Cavallo's advice, he would go down in history as the man who broke Argentina's 60-year tradition of economic upheaval and political unrest.

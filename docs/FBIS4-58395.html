			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Two Statements to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> Juppe: We Will Not Hand 'Awn Over; 'Awn: I Respect the  Restraint Decision"]    [Text] Paris, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The issue of opening  Lebanese security and political files has reached France because  most Lebanese opposition leaders are in Paris.    The most complicated issue is that related to the presence  of  [former Lebanese Prime Minister] General Michel 'Awn whose  position there is extraordinary because he is neither a  political refugee nor an ordinary foreigner residing in France.    In the agreement under which 'Awn left Lebanon for  Marseilles  and then La Hutte Maison, the French authorities promised to  receive the Lebanese guest and provide protection for him  provided he fulfilled a number of conditions. According to a  high-ranking French source, the most important condition was  that 'Awn should exercise restraint and not carry out any  political activity on French soil.    It seems that 'Awn has begun to seriously annoy the Lebanese  Government since he announced preparations for a national  conference which he invited the opposition to attend in the  French capital in June.    Lebanese official sources have hinted that 'Awn's financial  file might be reopened and that there is a possibility that a  request could be made for his extradition.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  if his government had received any such official request. Juppe  replied "we have heard some echos about this matter but there is  no official Lebanese request. At any rate, handing 'Awn over is  out of the question but we will impress upon him the need to  exercise the utmost restraint."    Juppe seized the opportunity to call for a new Lebanese law  for radio and television media "as soon as possible to enable  everyone to express himself freely," in fulfillment of the  promises made by the Lebanese Government to the French  authorities. The French official also said that he wished that  "judicial procedures in Lebanon would be carried out legally and  legitimately, upholding the right of defense." He was referring  to the file of the recent assassinations and explosions.    Meanwhile, in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Gen. 'Awn  said that he "intends to honor the restraint commitment" and  would, therefore, refrain from holding any press conferences or  organizing political demonstrations. He added that he would  only answer the numerous telephone calls he gets from Lebanon  and various parts of the world.    On the claims that the Lebanese state was trying to open a  dialogue with him, 'Awn said: "That kind of talk remains a kind  of informational maneuvering. If there is anything serious,  those concerned in Lebanon and outside it (Syria) should state  their position in advance on a number of fundamental  non-negotiable issues, namely the restoration of full  sovereignty and freedom and independence of Lebanese  decisionmaking."    'Awn added: "Everything else is negotiable. I am one of  those who advocate respect for the vital interests of Lebanon's  neighbors and for realistic dialogue with them, free from any  complexes."    'Awn said that the "attempts of the current authorities in  Lebanon are part of the policy of intimidation and temptation."  He revealed that attempts were made in the past to hold a  dialogue with him but they failed because "the government could  not provide answers to the questions I asked."</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Norcor debut valued at Pounds 32m Norcor, a corrugated board maker, priced its flotation yesterday at 120p a share, valuing the Norwich-based company at Pounds 32.3m. A total of 14.2m shares, or 52.6 per cent of the enlarged equity, have been placed with institutional investors, raising a net Pounds 16.1m for the company. Norcor, which had Pounds 35m of debt before the flotation, will use the money to pay off Pounds 12m of bank debt and Pounds 3.5m of loan notes. Some of the existing shareholders are converting the rest of the loan notes into shares to make the company effectively debt free. Its plans, however, to spend between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m rebuilding one of its four machines will require some debt finance. No existing investors are selling shares but as a result of the placing, the stake of Phildrew Ventures, the venture capital arm of UBS and Norcor's main backer, will be halved to about 20 per cent. The shares are on a pro-forma p/e of 12.5 times fully taxed 1993 earnings of 9.6p. A notional 1993 net dividend of 4.56p, covered 2.5 times, gives a gross yield of 4.75 per cent. The group recently announced price increases to cover higher paper costs, but it gave no forecast for this year's results. Last year it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.09m on turnover of Pounds 38.7m. Dealings in the shares start on May 26, The placing was underwritten by UBS.</p>

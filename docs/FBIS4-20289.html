			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ismet G. Imset] </F>   [Text] Ankara--A division has struck the Turkish media on  how to treat the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and whether to  allow its supporters to freely express their views on television  and in the press.    Many journalists and commentators who claim to be  secularists  have launched a campaign to suppress reporting on the RP and to  block Islamic activists from expressing their opinions in their  newspapers and on their programs.    Those who argue that the RP, as a political party, has the  right to express itself and that it is the duty of journalists  to insure impartial reporting are rapidly becoming a minority in  Turkey's confused, state-subsidized yet bankrupt and ignorant  press world.    Meanwhile, fear is growing among the more responsible and  objective newsmen that the concerted reaction against the RP  could strengthen the radical Islamists within this party and  weaken the stance of the currently-dominant reformists and  moderates.    Concern has increased over the past week that attempts at  pulling the Welfare into the system and make it part of the  establishment rather than being against it may fail in the view  of a systematic attack on this party.    Reports from within the RP are that the media's reaction to  this party which is influencing mainly urban-based masses is  leading increasingly to a frustration which radical groups are  skillfully exploiting.    The first disagreements on this issue have surfaced since  Tuesday [26 April] with SABAH columnist Mehmet Ali Birand on  Monday night interviewing the Welfare Party's (RP) acting group  chairman, Sevket Kazan, on television.    Kazan, who lashed out at the media for blasting at his  party,  disclosed during Birand's popular 32nd Day program that certain  circles identifying themselves as "secularists" were sending  threatening letters both to his party and to other individuals.  The politician also showed some of the letters bearing pictures  of modern and secular Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and  promising on behalf of the "secularists" to "fight to the last  drop of our blood."    "They are the ones who have declared war on us," Kazan  complained, referring to criticism of RP Chairman Necmettin  Erbakan's earlier remarks that the Welfare would come to power  and "60 million will decide on whether this transition will be a  peaceful one or a bloody one."    This remark, scissored out of a lengthy speech Erbakan made  to his party's Parliament group, was a reference to threats  targeting the party, Kazan explained.    As Birand rightfully expressed on Wednesday, the Welfare  Party phenomena has become a test for democracy in Turkey both  for this party and the country altogether.    But for allowing Kazan to speak in his program and for  letting an Islamic activist woman argue her views, Birand has  fallen under attack, like several other of his colleagues in the  Turkish press, for giving the Welfare the opportunity to  propagate.    In clear defiance of the Press Code of Professional Ethics  which has been approved of by all major newspapers, Birand has  been blasted by his own colleagues over the past two days. On  Tuesday, respected and widely popular columnist Hincal Uluc, who  writes on the same page as Birand, lashed out at the latter for  allowing "Shariah (Islamic order) supporters" to appear on  television one after another and stressed that "Shariah and  democracy are two separate things which cannot go together."    "Now tell me Mehmet Ali," he asked. "Why should such an easy  propaganda opportunity be given on the country's most widely  watched television channel to people who can freely establish  their own radios, television, newspapers and magazines?"  Birand's staunch rival Emin Colasan of HURRIYET, a journalist  who often expresses the views of Turkey's hard-liners in his  column and who recently boasted of being a "Mehmetchik (soldier)  journalist," joined in the criticism the following day. Quoting  Uluc in his own column titled something like "make a good profit  Mehmet Ali" and using idioms to belittle Birand's program staff,  Colasan said this journalist had done wrong by allowing Muslim  politicians to appear on the television and for failing to give  Kazan a hard time.    Earlier, Colasan had referred to Birand as among the  "ignorant, sold out" circles with bad intentions. "They are  spoiling and pumping up the Refah and Shariah supporters," he  said in a similar accusative commentary on Friday.    It is evident by now that a concerted campaign is underway  to  tackle with the Refah victory and everyone who gives them the  opportunity to express their views, including objective  journalists, are being accused of anything short of treason.  "What kind of democratic mentality is this?" asked one  columnist during the week. "You will allow a party you like to  be elected, but when a party you dislike is elected, you say  this cannot be."    Reaction to Welfare throughout Turkey's larger cities  appears  also to be serving the government and other power circles in  this secular country. Secular reaction, gradually taking the  form of an anti-Islamic trend, is clearly boosting public  support to the military in a time Turkey is advancing towards a  new economic and political crisis.    On Wednesday, HURRIYET reported that the Office of the Chief  of Staff had ordered all officers and petty officers to wear  badges of Ataturk symbolizing their belief in his principals.  Last week, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller reportedly told U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Washington that if her economic  package or government failed, the Welfare would be coming to  Turkey.    The concerted effort turning the spotlights on the Welfare  Party is clearly serving both government and military circles in  Turkey for now. But the threat is that it is increasingly  forcing the Welfare to move out of the system, isolating its  reformist and moderate elements and increasing the weight of  radical activists within the party.    Some observers believe the policy adopted towards Refah is  now similar to that launched against the pro-Kurdish Democracy  Party (DEP) earlier this year, aimed perhaps at pushing this  party out of the system as well and forcing it into a  radicalization.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Investors sought for city Plans for a Pounds 3m local investment fund to finance community enterprises in deprived inner-city areas have been announced by Business in the Community (BiTC), which co-ordinates business support activities. The Department of the Environment has promised Pounds 1m if corporate investors can be found to provide Pounds 2m. If the money can be raised the fund hopes to back about a dozen community projects in the north-west of England. Community enterprises are businesses with a social purpose such as the North Kensington Amenity Trust, which has developed wasteland beneath a raised motorway in west London, and Cruddas Park Community Trust, which has helped revitalise a housing estate in Newcastle upon Tyne. The projects must be in Urban Priority Areas. 'We want to show investors that they can reap a profit from investments which most people don't see as paying back,' said Graham Bann, director of the investment fund. Models for the idea are ventures such as the South Shore Bank, which has revitalised a run-down area of Chicago, and Triodos Bank, an ethical investment bank in the Netherlands. Different banking laws have meant that the project has been set up as a fund in the UK. South Shore Bank made a loss provision of 0.8 per cent of the loan portfolio in 1991, while Triodos made a provision of 1.6 per cent, so properly monitored investments can be an acceptable lending risk, BiTC said. If the first Pounds 3m 'pilot' fund is successful BiTC plans to raise a larger second-stage fund. Minimum investment in the pilot fund will be Pounds 50,000 so it will appeal mainly to corporate investors. The second fund, if it goes ahead, is expected to call upon deposit-taking institutions, companies and wealthy private individuals. * BiTC, 8 Stratton Street, London W1X 5FD. Tel. 071 629 1600.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Ambassador to China said on Tuesday that relations between North  Korea and China, which had deteriorated shortly after the  establishment of diplomatic ties between South Korea and China,  seem to have recovered.    Hwang Pyong-tae, here to attend the annual conference of  Korean ambassadors and envoys, said at a bull session with  journalists that the recent visit to Beijing by Hwang Chang-yop,  secretary of the North Korean Workers' Party, had helped to  improve the two nations' relations.    North Korea had criticized China for being "revisionist" and  even "a traitor" since Seoul formed diplomatic ties with Beijing  in August 1992.    "North Korea recently sent many people to the Chinese cities  of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to make them learn  directly the Chinese way of reform and opening. North Korea  seems to be changing now," he said.    Meanwhile, China's position on the North Korean nuclear  issue  is that if South Korea and the United States keep talking with  North Korea, the problem will be solved, he said.    "Especially, China thinks that North Korea will push ahead  with policies of reform and opening once its nuclear problem is  solved."    Acknowledging the seriousness of the nuclear problem,  Beijing  is trying to persuade Pyongyang to settle the matter before Feb.  21, when the Board of Governors' meeting of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is scheduled, he added.    On reports of a possible visit by Kim Il-song to Beijing, he  said, "North Korean President Kim Il-song, who had visited China  as many as 39 times, has not visited Beijing since 1992. I  think it's about time for him to visit there, as relations  between Pyongyang and Beijing have recovered."    Meanwhile, he expected that before President Kim Yong-sam's  visit to China in late March, Seoul and Beijing will be able to  conclude aviation, cultural cooperation, and double taxation  avoidance agreements.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Heineken profits rise 15% at six months Heineken yesterday said it lifted net profit before extraordinary items by 15.6 per cent in the first half, in spite of a stagnation in the volume of beer sold. The Dutch brewer attributed the rise to a stronger performance by its premium brands, such as Heineken, Amstel and Buckler, which command higher prices and generate higher profit margins than the standard beers in its international portfolio of brands. Net profit before extraordinaries rose to Fl 254.5m (Dollars 144.6m) from Fl 220.1m a year earlier. Turnover was up 3.9 per cent at Fl 4.69bn compared with Fl 4.52bn in the same period of 1993. Total net profit was lifted to Fl 313.1m by an extraordinary gain of Fl 58.6m from the sale of a stake in Bols Benelux, the spirits joint venture. Heineken said profit from normal business operations would rise at roughly the same rate in the second half as in the first six months. The company gave no figure for volume sales by hectolitre, but said this was unchanged from a year earlier, excluding the consolidation of new companies in Switzerland and New Zealand. The flatness of sales was due mainly to stagnant conditions in Europe, where demand was constrained by economic recession and inclement spring weather. Beer consumption fell in the Netherlands, Italy and France, but was higher in Spain and Greece. Heineken reported strong exports to long-established markets such as the US, where turnover rose by 9 per cent, as well as to relatively newer markets such as China, where exports surged by 50 per cent. The company is planning to step up its investment in Asia Pacific to benefit from the rapid expansion of the region's beer market. 'We have several irons in the fire and we expect to be able to provide more information before the end of the year,' Mr Karel Vuursteen, chairman, said.</p>

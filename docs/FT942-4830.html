			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Lloyd's will quiz former Gooda chief Mr Derek Walker, former chairman of Gooda Walker, the insurance managing agents, has been formally charged by the disciplinary committee of Lloyd's of London over his conduct while in charge of the company. The move was disclosed yesterday by lawyers for Mr Walker in an attempt to limit cross-examination of the former underwriter during the High Court legal action brought against the agency by more than 3,000 Names. Mr Walker will face the Lloyd's regulators charged with providing the Gooda Walker auditors with false and misleading information and with discreditable conduct. The charges relate to his handling of 'time-and-distance' policies - reinsurance policies allowing syndicates to manage reserves against claims several years after the start of policies. The time-and-distance policies agreed by Mr Walker were at the centre of a Serious Fraud Office investigation of the Gooda Walker agency. The SFO decided in April not to bring criminal charges against anyone connected with Lloyd's. Miss Claire Montgomery, for Mr Walker, told the court yesterday he should not be questioned about the time-and-distance policies because there was a danger he might incriminate himself in advance of the disciplinary hearing. The SFO had reserved the right to reopen its investigation and this might place Mr Walker at risk. She said the use of the policies raised questions of criminal liability over the possible creation of a false or misleading picture of Gooda Walker's profitability and possible false-accounting offences. Solicitors for the Names had agreed that Mr Walker should not be forced to incriminate himself while the SFO investigation was in progress, she said. The judge, Mr Justice Phillips, said this assurance no longer prevented Mr Walker answering questions. Giving evidence, Mr Walker denied the Names' claim that he had bought inadequate reinsurance in the late 1980s for the risks underwritten by syndicate 290, which he headed. Mr Walker said the market for buying reinsurance had been difficult in the late 1980s. He would have bought more if it had been available on the right terms, but was 'reasonably happy' with the level of reinsurance he had provided. He refused to accept blame for the collapse of syndicate 290, and denied his underwriting was in any way responsible. The winding-up of the syndicate had been caused by the collapse of the excess loss market at Lloyd's and bad decision-making by other Gooda Walker directors, he said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bohdan Horyn: "We Fear a Russia Armed with a UN </F> Mandate"]    [Text] On 21-23 February, a NATO-sponsored seminar  titled "Theory and Practice of Peacekeeping" was held in London.  A member of the Russian delegation Aleksandr Piskunov delivered  a paper "On Russia's Peacekeeping Activity on the Territory of  the Former Soviet Union." The head of the Ukrainian delegation,  Ukraine people's deputy and deputy chairman of the Ukraine  Supreme Council Commission on Foreign Affairs Bohdan Horyn took  part in the discussion and, upon his return to Kiev, provided  for the UKRAYINSKA HAZETA an analysis of this complex issue.    Russia's position on its right to conduct peacekeeping  operations on the territory of independent states which emerged  after the breakup of the Soviet Union is an international  problem meriting an especially close attention of the  international community. The idea that Russia should be given a  UN mandate for peacekeeping missions in Moldova, Georgia,  Tajikistan and other CIS states is not only actively discussed  in the Russian press but is increasingly voiced by Russian  Federation (RF) Foreign Minister A.Kozyrev as well as  representatives of its new legislative corps.    This is why peacekeeping activities that take place far  beyond RF borders require broad and comprehensive discussion and  analysis from the point of view of their compliance to  international legal norms. First of all, the meaning that Russia  attaches to terms "peacekeeping forces" and "peacekeeping  activities" should be scrutinized, to see to what extent it  confirms to the interpretation and experience developed in this  area by the UN.    It should be kept in mind that at the time of the Soviet  empire, to which Russia considers itself a successor, a practice  existed whereby a completely different meaning and substance  were attached to commonly used words, concepts and terms, as a  result of which, although widely known the world over, they  acquired their own peculiar connotations and even became their  exact opposites.    As is well-known, the former Soviet Union did not need to  import champagne from France but produced instead its own  version of the famous beverage, under the absurd label of Soviet  Champagne. The fact that for three centuries the Champagne  region of France has been the place of origin of champagne, or  that it is made from special types of grapes that grow only in  that region, did not matter Soviet specialists in either  semantics or wine making.    Nor did the Soviet Union consider it necessary to hold to  the  meaning which the international community, based on many  centuries of experience, attaches into the concept of democracy,  as a result of which under the Soviet regime the term "Soviet  democracy" came into being, meaning in practice the exact  opposite of democracy, i.e., an anti-democratic, totalitarian  regime.    Today Russia, considering itself the successor of the Soviet  empire, has borrowed much of that negative experience in its  theory and practice. Its current domestic and foreign policy  also gives cause for concern, especially if we were to decipher  such peculiar terms as "Russian democracy" and "Russia's  peacekeeping mission in CIS states." Let me briefly analyze some  of the actions of Russian troops outside RF borders.    Proof of Russia's peculiar interpretation of its  peacekeeping  role comes from events in Tajikistan, where Russian troops took  part in a civil war, protecting a regime that was faithful to  Russia. Recently, Russia has been calling the border between  Tajikistan and Afghanistan its own border. According to  statements from influential politicians in Russia, the basis for  this bold claim is the fact that Russian troops are protecting  ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. Statistics show that due to the  unstable situation in the region there are fewer and fewer  ethnic Russians there, but this does not mean that Russia will  stop calling the Tajik border its own. Most likely, another  version will be invented: the need for protection against Muslim  fundamentalism or something similar--to justify the occupational  regime and Russian presence in that country.    After the publication of many documents, it is no longer a  secret that the puppet Dniestr Republic was created with the  direct participation of Russian troops. The commander of the  so-called peacekeeping 14th Army, Russian citizen General Lebed,  despite being on the pay of Russia, ran for and won a seat in  the Supreme Soviet of the Dniestr Republic. It is an  unprecedented event in world experience.    A similar mission by Russian troops in Georgia ended,  according to Georgia's leader E.Shevardnadze, with the  occupation of Abkhazia. "Georgia suffered a defeat in a war  against an unequal foe, in a war which, according to a minister  of one superpower, had been started to safeguard strategic  interests of that country in Georgia," said Eduard Shevardnadze  at a press conference for Georgian and foreign journalists,  meaning strategic interests of Russia.    The above-mentioned facts make us wary of Russia's  peacekeeping missions. An analysis of the actions by Russian  forces beyond RF borders makes it clear that Russian leaders  attach a meaning to the concept of "Russia's peacekeeping  mission in CIS states" that has nothing in common with the  peacekeeping activity of troops under the aegis of the UN. It is  very important that this reality of Russia's foreign policy  attract the attention of the world opinion, especially now, when  Russia is actively seeking a UN mandate to carry out  peacekeeping operations in countries which emerged after the  breakup of the USSR.    Information appearing in newspapers that in July of this  year  the first-ever joint tactical training exercises by peacekeeping  forces of the US and Russia will take place in Orenburg oblast  give cause for alarm. The goal of providing security for  independent states would be much better served if two or three  independent groups of experts were formed under the aegis of the  UN, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and  NATO to study and report on the aims and consequences of  Russia's so-called peacekeeping activity on the territory of  independent states. The collected material and expert  conclusions could become a weighty rebuttal to attempts by  Russia to get for some of its military units the mandate of UN  peacekeeping forces, which, as seen from daily experience, would  be used for conducting dubious operations.    We believe that putting an end to activities that contravene  international norms can be done only with the help of an  independent international fact finding mission, by discussing  its conclusions in the UN Security Council. Russia's neighbors  need mutually beneficial economic cooperation and not  contingents of "peace-loving Russian troops." Those peace-loving  troops should be based on their own, Russian territory. Other  nations will decide for themselves whom to call and with whom to  be friends on an equal footing. So far, in early March, Russia  refused to supply gas to Ukraine. This is an example of its  peace-loving policy.</p>

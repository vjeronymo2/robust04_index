Since then, influenced by the "4 June" effect, the HKDL has  made a remarkable showing in all direct elections at all levels.  While the HKDL at the time had only about 530 party members,  including 80 who took part in the district parliamentary  reelections, its success rate turned out to reach 70 percent.  By the time of the first Legislative Council [LEGCO] direct  elections, except for their defeat in the New Territories East  election district, all other HKDL candidates won easily.    But since the HKDL's victory in 1991, while it has been able  to retain its position in most public opinion polls as the  best-received political party, its real score is in a declining  trend. Independent Congressman Liu Hui-ch'ing [0491 1979 0615]  has outdone Li Chu-ming [2621 2691 6900] to become Hong Kong's  best-received directly-elected congressman.    Meanwhile, the Cooperative Resource Center [CRC], composed  of  17 LEGCO members, has changed into the Liberal Party [LP]. As to  number of party members alone, the LP has about 2,000 members,  having replaced the HKDL as the political party with the largest  membership.    During the Sino-British controversy, the LP visited Beijing,  proposing that the two countries might first resolve their  dispute over the 1994 district parliamentary elections, only on  which cooperative basis they could then deal with the more  thorny "direct-service problem" of the makeup of LEGCO. Once  they had obtained Chinese consent, they met with Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten to promote their "first easy, then hard"  negotiating plan. Such a mediation role was one that the HKDL  was unable to play.    But the HKDL has never seen the LP as its major election  foe,  as the major threat that it feels has come mainly from Hong  Kong's left-faction forces.    In the 1991 LEGCO elections, while the congressmen with  close  ties to Beijing all lost on the district front, a few such  candidates, such as Ch'en Wan-hsien [7115 1238 8300] and Ch'eng  Chieh-nan [4453 0094 0589], did remarkably well.    Having assimilated the 1991 experience, the camp with close  ties to Beijing officially established the Democratic Alliance  for the Betterment of Hong Kong [DABHK] on 10 July 1992. While  the DABHK had only 57 founding members, there was no lack of  figures with election potential. While they had lost to the  HKDL in the earlier Executive Council [EXCO] by-election in the  Southwest District, the very first time they raised the DABHK  flag in an election, they showed their full organizational might  in that district.    In October 1993, not long after the independent "Commission  on Elections and Election-District Boundaries" appointed by the  Hong Kong Government had announced its division of the  directly-elected seats in the 338-member 1994 district  parliament, the DABHK's district members criticized it very  quickly. Their officers indicated to the press that they were  making active plans for the next year's district parliamentary  elections.    The differences between China and Britain on election plans  for Hong Kong prior to 1995 remain very deep. The news released  repeatedly by both sides on "plans to each go their own way" has  led to much speculation. Some surmize that the DABHK might be  forced to follow Beijing's line, by renouncing or even  boycotting elections not approved by Beijing, to avoid being  blamed for supporting Britain's conspiracy of "three  violations." But as the DABHK had indicated as far back as at  the time of its founding that it would take an active part in  elections, its not taking part in elections arranged  unilaterally by the British Hong Kong Government prior to 1997  would be a great blow to its future development. Moreover, the  indications of recent DABHK words and deeds are that even if  there is a final fallout between the Chinese and British, it  will still launch a full-scale offensive in the coming  three-levels of parliamentry elections.    In fact, some directly-elected HKDL LEGCO members have also  recently expressed privately that they are highly likely to use  "one-on-one" tactics to counter the DABHK's "four great stars."    These so-called "four great stars" are the DABHK's Ts'eng  Yu-ch'eng [2582 6877 2052], T'an Yao-tsung [6223 5069 1350],  Ch'eng Chieh-nan, and Ch'en Wan-hsien.    Ts'eng Yu-ch'eng is one of the few DABHK's leaders who are  fluent in English. Since elected party chief, he has become  the unofficial international spokesman for the whole camp in  Hong Kong with close ties to Beijing. While he received less  votes than most current legislators, he has at least passed the  first test of widespread name recognition.    As to T'an Yao-tsung, he is currently DABHK's only voice in  LEGCO. Since the 1991 direct elections, many analysts have all  agreed that if the left faction at the time had even a litle  daring, by having T'an Yao-tsung take part in the  Kowloon-Central District election, and raising labor circles to  give Ch'en Wan-hsien its functional-constituency seat, it was  highly likely that they would both be elected at the same time.  And while Ch'en Wan-hsien and Ch'eng Chieh-nan both lost in the  1991 elections, they still won more votes than DABHK candidates  in other election districts.    So it is quite understandable that the HKDL would regard  these four as its strongest foes. The DABHK was also very  conspicuous in various public opinion polls, with a  political-party questionnaire by Hong Kong U's Social Science  Studies Center showing the DABHK for the first time at the end  of November 1992 jumping to the fifth best-received political  party in Hong Kong, replacing right from the start the former  ranking of the "Liberal Democratic Coalition" [LDC] to place  fifth.    In the year-plus since then, the DABHK's showing has  fluctuated at around 43-46 percent, with no breakthroughs,  generally tailing the HKDL, the "Democractic Livelihood  Progressive Association" [DLPA], the Huitien [Collection Point]  [CP], and the LP. But meanwhile, HKDL support is down from its  61 percent in early December 1991 to 55-56 percent recently.    Certain key HKDL figures hold that it is a normal  pheonomenon  for a political party's public support to slide after a  general-election victory, which is also often the case abroad.  But HKDL's difficulties may be far more severe than it  imagines.    While the HKDL has always presented its image as the  "forerunner of democracy," it has made absolutely no prgresss in  the 1994 and 1995 election arrangements due to the Sino-British  dispute. In other words, in the next election, it is going to  be hard for the democracy faction not to lose the trust that it  has built up over a long period of time in its platform of  striving to speed up the pace of democracy. In addition,  public studies are finding that as 1997 nears, Hong Kong  residents seem increasingly able to accept the mainland Chinese  regime. All of these factors might cause a loss of votes for the  HKDL.    The changes in the election system will also carry minuses  for the democracy faction. After the change to a "system of  one vote per seat" in 1995, certain current directly-elected  members with less might will no longer be able to rely on the  so-called "coattails effect," or be able to depend on the  name-recognition of others to get elected. In fact, once the  "one seat system" goes into effect, it is going to be hard for  the HKDL to continue to coordinate its candidate list with other  friendly organizations, such as CP and DLPA, with difficulty at  the time avoiding a situation in which a third party profits  from the struggle. This is particularly likely to occur in  districts, such as Youchienwang, Tapu, and Shat'ien.    Since the 1991 elections, the concern of the two large  insider factions, the HKDL and the LP, has often been limited  only to responding to immediate public events, leaving one with  a sense that they lack long-range planning. At many times,  individual members seem to be all-involved in daily  parliamentary matters, leaving them unable to act freely. With  1994 here, congressmen of all political parties are starting to  face reelection pressures, some of whom have talked about  lacking time and energy, as their affairs in both parliament and  their election districts are heavier than they had thought. On  the other hand, the DABHK has only one LEGCO member, T'an  Yao-tsung, leaving its other leaders without legislative  pressures, so with much more time to do as they please in  playing an opposition role outside of parliament.    But while all political parties have been focusing on the  elections in these two years, they have all been neglecting for  several years a basic development direction.    The "Hong Kong Youth Society" commissioned the Hong Kong U  Social Science Studies Center to conduct in May 1993 a study of  "young people's views on political organizations." They polled  558 young people between the ages of 15 and 29. While the  results have not been widely noted by the media, the relevant  data is certainly very enlightening about Hong Kong's future  political developments.    The poll showed that over 90 percent of those polled had not  taken part in any activities sponsored by political  organizations in the past year. And even when the political  organizations that young people evaluate most highly issued them  invitations, 70 percent said that they still could not accept.  In addition, 60 percent of respondents stated that they would  neither support political organizations with money or convey  their views to them.    While young people expressed much reservation about taking  part in the body politic, nearly 60 percent of respondents over  17 years of age still said that they would vote in the coming  elections.    If the proposal to lower the voting age to 18 is finally  approved, to include the group of young people who were just too  young to vote in the 1991 LEGCO election, it is projected that  those eligible to vote for the first time in the 1995 LEGCO  election will make up about one-fifth of the whole electorate.  And while their direction will be enough to impact the overall  situation, not one political party in the last 3 years has  worked hard for their support.</p>

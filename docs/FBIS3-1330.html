At a news conference in Pretoria, Mr Botha warned of an  "ominous possibility of bloodshed and conflict" in  Natal/kwaZulu. He said he did not know to what extent kwaZulu  chief minister and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi was prepared to allow the Independent Electoral  Commission to do its work to ensure free and fair elections.    The fact was that the African National Congress [ANC] and  the  IFP were at war with each other, he said, suggesting that  20-strong delegations of the ANC and the IFP under the  chairmanship of an international figure or the chief justice  meet to sort out their differences. "With so much intimidation  in so many places there can hardly be a free and fair election."    Mr Botha warned of the danger that South Africa could be  "forgotten" after the election and inauguration of the new  president if the violence and intolerance did not come to an end.    He appealed to the ANC and the IFP to put South Africa  first,  rather than party political interests.</p>

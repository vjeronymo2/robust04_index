			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time when international tensions are mounting  over the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  weapons, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the  opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] plan to send  their respective delegations to North Korea in June. They plan  to send their delegations with the aim of "opening the way for a  dialogue between Japan and North Korea through parliamentary  diplomacy" since no governmental contacts between the two  countries have been made since the Japan-North Korea  normalization talks were broken off. While some officials in the  government and some members in the two parties are concerned  about sending the delegations to North Korea, saying, "Their  visits to North Korea would be exploited by North Korean  propaganda, thereby incurring a backlash from the United  States," others are pessimistic about their visits to North  Korea, saying, "Since it is a delicate time, North Koreans will  guard against the delegations."    The LDP will send Taku Yamasaki, former director general of  the Defense Agency, and Yoichi Tani, former director general of  the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency, on 14 June to  Pyongyang.    They hope to hold talks with North Korean Premier Kang  Song-san, but their itinerary has yet to be decided. Yamasaki  says, "If the talks are held, we would tell the premier that  North Korea needs to clear up suspicions over North Korea's  development of nuclear arms through consultations with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."    North Korea has accepted Yamasaki's visit to North Korea.  Commenting on North Korea's acceptance of this visit, a senior  LDP member sees the acceptance as "North Korea's signal that it  hopes to improve relations with Japan." Another senior LDP  member, however, says: "There is a question of whether their  visit to North Korea is timely or not. They may merely listen to  what North Koreans advocate without advocating anything to them."    The SDPJ will send Hajime Fukada, director general of the  Organization Bureau, and others to Pyongyang on 11 June and they  will stay there until 14 June. The SDPJ delegation is likely to  be composed of three peorsons. The SDPJ views their visit to  North Korea as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a visit  by a party delegation led by chairman or secretary general to  North Korea. The SDPJ delegation intends to avoid making any  proposal to break the deadlock over the nuclear issue.</p>

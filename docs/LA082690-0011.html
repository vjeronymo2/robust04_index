			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ** "THINGS THAT GO PUMP IN THE NIGHT" AEROSMITH, GEFFEN VIDEOCASSETTE ($16.98):  ITEMS IN THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES AND LASER  DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> See Aerosmith cavort with nude girls, semi-nude girls, suggestively clad girls  and inflatable love dolls.  </P> <P> See what singer Steven Tyler's really like backstage -- apparently the same  leering goof he is on stage -- and wonder why guitarist Joe Perry's lips never  move when he talks. See three recent video clips you've seen a couple hundred  times apiece on MTV, see how key scenes were filmed, then see the band  applauding images of itself after each clip ends. This is pretty thin product.  Still, it's hard to dislike Tyler's bouncy exuberance, no matter where that  exuberance is directed. (The laser-disc version, including a bonus track, is  due in stores Thursday and retails for $24.95.) JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

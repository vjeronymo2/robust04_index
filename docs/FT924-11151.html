			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (5): Religious and political roots - Separatist war THE Sri Lankan civil war, which erupted in 1983 from the long-smouldering volcano of Sinhalese-Tamil ethnic tensions, shows few signs of abating. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) continue their guerrilla war in pursuit of an independent Tamil state in the north and east. The government remains firm in denying them that goal. Talks with the Tigers have broken down. Fourteen months of relative peace, during which the LTTE held negotiations with the newly-elected administration of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, ended abruptly in June 1990 when the Tigers attacked several police stations. The army retaliated fiercely, setting in motion a further period of bloodletting during which as many as 10,000 people have died. Years of conflict have produced a refugee crisis in which as many as 1.5m people have been 'uprooted, displaced or exiled', according to the British Council for Refugees. It is a war which, says Mr Neelan Tiruchelvam, director of the Colombo-based independent Centre for Ethnic Studies, has seen the 'progressive brutalisation of all areas of society'. Neither the army nor the LTTE, he says, have shown regard for human rights. In the latest incident, earlier this month, Tigers were reported to have killed about 190 people, largely Moslem civilians, in raids on four villages in the northern Polonnaruwa district. Civil strife has also stifled economic growth. Military expenditure soaks up about 12 per cent of the budget and foreign investors are wary of committing themselves to a country at war. The outbreak of fighting in 1990 marked the third stage of the conflict, which first flared up in 1983 after LTTE terrorist attacks provoked a wave of anti-Tamil riots. The war entered its second phase in 1987 following the signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan accord which drew up the framework for a long-term solution to the Tamil question. The accord, however, rapidly broke down as Indian peacekeeping troops became embroiled in battle with the LTTE. Mr Premadasa, after his election as president in December 1988, negotiated the withdrawal of Indian troops and began discussions with the Tigers. The collapse of talks in June 1990 led directly to the third phase of the conflict from which the country shows few signs of emerging. Since then security forces have prosecuted the war with venom and in recent months have turned their attention to Jaffna peninsula, the Tigers' principal stronghold. Government troops have started to capture rebel-held towns within the peninsula, although officials deny there is any imminent intention to take the regional capital, Jaffna. The army has been emboldened by India's decision in May to ban the Tigers, held responsible for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. India's move has deprived the separatists of their main ally and has helped to stem the flow of weaponry that is smuggled across the Palk Straits which separates Sri Lanka from India. The LTTE may be down, but it is not out. The army admits to having lost nearly 900 men this year. In August the Tigers scored what was publicly acknowledged as a 'devastating blow' when a landmine killed many senior army officers, including Maj-Gen Denzil Kobbekaduwa, military commander of the north. He was widely regarded as a peacemaker, seeking long-term solutions to the crisis. With the net closing upon them in the north, the Tigers have turned their attention to the east, which represents the biggest obstacle to peace. Moslem Tamils, whom the Tigers feel have betrayed the Tamil cause, have become a particular target. Tamils constitute only 40 per cent of the eastern province, but the Tigers claim it as part of their ethnic constituency. The LTTE says successive governments have pursued a policy of 'colonisation', peopling the east with Sinhalese in order to water down Tamil influence. The tangled roots of Sri Lanka's civil strife are both religious and political. Sinhalese Buddhists, described by one commentator as a 'majority with a minority complex', make up 75 per cent of the population but fear the assertion of Tamil statehood as a threat to Buddhist culture. The Buddhist clergy in particular, says Mr Tiruchelvam, 'believes that its sacred duty is to protect Buddhism in the ocean of Hinduism that is India'. The southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, home to 60m Tamils, is only 20 miles from Sri Lanka. Tamils, in turn, feel discriminated against, largely in the areas of language and employment. When the British withdrew from the island in 1948, English-speaking Tamils dominated the civil service. However, they soon found themselves subject to pro-Sinhalese laws rendering Sinhala the official language, and introducing a quota system to improve Sinhalese job prospects. Education became largely segregated. The Sinhalese felt such policies were a means of redressing historical inequities. To the Tamils they were the start of a Sinhalese assault. Much of this legislation has since been toned down. Tamil is now 'an' official language (although Sinhala remains 'the' official language) - and a system of provincial councils, aimed at devolving power, has been established. A referendum in the eastern province on potential merger with the north has never gone ahead because of continued fighting. Caught in this ideological crossfire is President Premadasa who has shown himself willing - at least publicly - to negotiate with the Tigers. His room to manoeuvre is limited. Cede too much and he will antagonise the powerful Buddhist hierarchy. Cede nothing, and he faces the prospect of interminable war. According to Mr Tiruchelvam, Mr Premadasa - who has effectively already begun his re-election campaign - has little to gain from a swift settlement. 'There are no short-term benefits in forging a political solution, as whatever initiatives he made would produce some sort of backlash in the south.' Yielding too much to the Tigers would render him almost unelectable, according to Mr Tiruchelvam. Recent peace proposals put forward by a senior cabinet minister were quickly dropped when it became clear that Sinhalese stalwarts were not prepared to stomach a deal. There is, says Mr Tiruchelvam, one chink of light. Last August, 'for the first time in our history', an all-party parliamentary select committee was set up to put forward peace proposals. The committee provides a forum for talks with moderate Tamil groups, such as the Eelam People's Democratic party and the Tamil United Liberation Front. Any lasting solution must be forged on an all-party basis. Too often in the past, political parties have whipped up chauvinist fervour for purely short-term electoral gain. The fact that President Premadasa has not followed India's lead in banning the Tigers leaves open the possibility of future negotiations. The president has set several preconditions for direct talks with the LTTE, including the demand that they lay down their arms. Prospects of this happening remain slim and so, in the meantime, the fighting continues.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> A BIG SHIFT;  </P> <P> RETAILERS FINALLY RECOGNIZE THAT LARGER-SIZE WOMEN ALSO HAVE STYLISH CONCERNS  </P> <P> Ask America's First Lady, Barbara Bush. Ask TV's first lady, Roseanne Barr.  They're just two of the 33 million women in the United States who wear clothes  larger than a Size 14 -- women who know the frustration of trying to find  fashionable clothes that fit. These consumers have the dollars and desire to  buy clothes. They just haven't had much choice.  </P> <P> But stores are finally getting the idea. Based on the popularity of its  large-size catalogue, For You, Spiegel opened a For You specialty shop in  suburban Chicago 18 months ago, and last year combined retail/mail-order sales  were $75 million.  </P> <P> After success with an avant-garde large-size department in its Costa Mesa  store, Bullock's opened Bullock's Woman, a stand-alone store in the Woodland  Hills Promenade, featuring better-priced merchandise and prestigious labels.  </P> <P> Carson Pirie Scott in Chicago did the same. I. Magnin has created upscale  large-size departments and followed up with mail-order catalogues devoted to  larger sizes. At Nordstrom stores in Southern California, large sizes are not  confined to a special department. Instead, wherever they're available, they  hang with the regular merchandise or can be ordered.  </P> <P> All of this means that large-size women now have many of the same fashion  choices available to them as do their "standard" size sisters. Pinafore  jumpers; summery, full skirts with fitted jackets; Chanel-inspired looks, even  shorts with gathered, "paper bag" waistlines once considered appropriate for  only the trimmest figures, are available.  </P> <P> If she wants to wear bright colors such as marigold, purple or orange, they're  available to her now. And there are large-size clothes in floral-print  patterns, many of them the same patterns used for Sizes 4 to 14 collections.  </P> <P> Retailers now treat large-size customers like style-conscious consumers,  instead of fat people in need of camouflage and extra yardage. The New  York-based Forgotten Woman, the 20-store large- size boutique with a branch in  Beverly Hills, was the first to recognize the need 10 years ago and began to  special-order high- quality, better-priced goods. But it took almost a decade  for department and specialty stores to follow the lead.  </P> <P> After giving only lip service and unappealing clothes to large women, retailers  have recognized that fashion can no longer be limited to Sizes 2 to 14, the  sizes most often offered by manufacturers. Because the average American woman,  at 5 feet, 3 inches and 138 pounds, wears a Size 12, store merchandisers have  realized that there are big dollars to be made in double-digit sizes.  </P> <P> As a result, more retailers are demanding big clothes from firms known for  their contemporary style.  </P> <P> This month, New York designer Adrienne Vittadini ships her first collection for  ample silhouettes. In September, Liz Claiborne launches Elizabeth, dresses  styled to fit big women. Designers such as Givenchy, Kay Unger for St. Gillian,  Adrien Papell, Nancy Heller, Gene Ewing for Bis, and Eletra Casadei have all  found ways to dress the woman sized 14 to 24.  </P> <P> The bottom line itself is convincing. Wardrobing large-size customers in the  United States is an $8-billion business, says Christina Gruber, editor of Plus  Sizes magazine, a retailers' trade journal. "That includes everything from  sportswear and evening clothes to underwear and panty hose," she explains.  Today, even jewelry manufacturers have scaled their designs to fit the fuller  figure.  </P> <P> "Until very recently the perception was that all large-size customers were the  same -- that they all want the same look," explains Jeannie Slusher, who  devoted her master's thesis at San Francisco State University to the problems  and opportunities of dressing big women. While the stereotype has always been  that the large customer is older, doesn't spend money on clothes and doesn't  want to be noticed, "my research shows that the average customer is 25 to 34  years old, she feels sexy, accepts her body the way it is and has as much money  to spend on clothes as other women her age," says Slusher, who studied a group  of 140 Northern California women who shop in stores that specialize in large  sizes.  </P> <P> In response, firms such as Melrose, Cherokee and Wild Rose have begun producing  clothes that are very similar to the styles they produce for the Size 4 to 14  customer. Both Speer and Cherokee president Jay Kester report that growth in  large-size sales is far ahead of their regular divisions. "Cherokee women's  division is 40% ahead of any other and is outselling the petite division by  60%," Kester says.  </P> <P> He adds that one of the best-selling items in the summer collection is a pair  of all-cotton shorts. "Large women aren't afraid to wear shorts and short  sleeves anymore. They are starving for fashion. That's why the business is on  fire."  </P> <P> Role models such as Mrs. Bush, Barr and Oprah Winfrey, before her 67-pound  weight loss, have helped well-endowed women make some demands on retailers.  </P> <P> "Seeing other large-size women as successes has given large women a new  attitude," says Hara Marano, an editor and publisher who specializes in  large-size fashion. "Roseanne is a character, for instance, for whom fashion  isnot a priority, but she's likable, she's a mom, she works, she's sexy. She  handles things. She shows us that a large woman can be happy."  </P> <P> Marano encourages women who aren't finding clothes in their sizes to complain  to store managers.  </P> <P> "When something doesn't fit, she crawls out of the fitting room feeling  depressed. But it's not her fault. There should be clothes sized to fit the  majority of American women," Marano says.  </P> <P> Slusher is encouraged by the increase in attention to large-size women by  manufacturers and retailers. And, she says, it can only get better. "By the  year 2000, one in eight people will be over 60. If we accept that aging also  means getting heavier, a lot of women who now are Size 12 or 14 will jump into  larger sizes."  </P> <P> And that means the major growth of the large-size industry as a fashion  business is only in its formative stages. When designers known for their  close-to-the-body fit, such as Yves Saint Laurent, Donna Karan and Azzedine  Alaia, get the big idea, the battle of fashion versus the bulge will be over.  </P></p>

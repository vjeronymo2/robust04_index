			<p>BFN     [Text] The Office for Refugees of the Republic of Croatia  has decided to strip all the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina who  fled to Croatia from the Mostar area of their refugee status,  B-H Press [Bosnia-Herzegovina state agency] reports.    Taking into account the fact that the roads are still closed  and that parts of the Mostar region are still under occupation,  a number of refugees from Mostar will have to go to a third  country now instead of returning to their homes.</p>

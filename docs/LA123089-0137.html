			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW GIRLS' SOCCER TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO LOSES SHOOTOUT IN FINAL  </P> <P> Mission Viejo High School, making its fifth consecutive appearance in the Ocean  View girls' soccer tournament final, lost to Simi Valley, 4-3, in an overtime  shootout Friday.  </P> <P> The Diablos, who had won the tournament title the past four years, showed the  strain of playing five games in three days, allowing Simi Valley a goal in the  first half on a defensive error.  </P> <P> Fullback Jennifer Ward, swamped by Simi Valley players, passed back to goalie  Tamar de Fries, but Simi Valley forward Korina Kozub overtook them both and  deftly tapped the ball into the left corner of the goal.  </P> <P> In the second half, Diablo left wing Nikki Charette took the ball, crossed to  the left of the goal and went out of bounds but was pushed by Simi Valley's  Tammy Coffman, which gave Charette a penalty kick.  </P> <P> Charette booted it into the right corner of the net.  </P> <P> The score was tied at the end of regulation, 1-1, and neither team scored in  the two five-minute periods.  </P> <P> In the shootout, Charette, Kelly Hampton and Maggie Doherty made their penalty  kicks, but Simi Valley goalie Jennifer Hollman lunged and deflected Dori Lee's  kick. The victory was clinched when Mission Viejo's Jenny Delp's kick missed  the goal entirely. "When we needed to, we just didn't finish," Mission Viejo  Coach Jim Dutton said. "We just stood there and let the ball roll by.  </P> <P> "They were coming real hard," he said of Simi Valley. "But it's not like we've  never seen it before; we've seen it 100 times. You have to get into the flow of  the game. If it's physical, you have to play physical, or you're going to get  your ears bent back."  </P></p>

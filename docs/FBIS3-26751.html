			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, February 13 (XINHUA) -- Henan, which  ordinarily is known as an important agricultural province in  China, has risen to become the ninth most important industrial  province in China.    The latest authoritative statistics show that the industrial  output value of Henan, whose area accounts for merely 1.8  percent of the country's total, reached 230 billion yuan in  1993, making up four percent of the national total, ranking  ninth among all 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous  regions of the Chinese mainland.    Although the agricultural output value of the province in  1993 increased by 9.8 percent over the previous year's to reach  61.5 billion yuan, the proportion of agricultural output value  to the total industrial and agricultural output value dropped to  only a little more than 20 percent.    Experts noted that by adopting the reform and opening  policy,  Henan Province has managed a substantial boost to its  agricultural production. With a great surplus in farm produce  and rural laborers, the province began a quick development of  its industry, particularly rural industrial enterprises, at the  end of the sixth state five-year planning period (1981-85).    The province managed to increase its industrial output value  to 230 billion yuan in 1993 from 30 billion yuan in 1984.  During the period from 1991 to 1993, its industrial output  value rose at an average rate of more than 20 percent a year.  The province now ranks at least ninth in the output of 12 out  of the 17 most important industrial products listed by the  central government. It has become a major supplier of coal and  electricity to a dozen provinces and municipalities in east and  central China.    In particular, the output value of the province's rural  industrial enterprises rose to over 100 billion yuan in 1993  from only several billion yuan in 1984. Many villages and  enterprises in the province now claim annual output values  surpassing 100 million yuan each. An enterprise engaging in the  production of diamond grinding materials has become the biggest  of its kind in Asia. Some other enterprises are now the biggest  of their kind within the country.    Industrial development has also promoted the development of  agriculture. Last year, the province's grain output amounted to  35 billion kilograms, 10 percent more than in the previous year,  setting an all-time high.</p>

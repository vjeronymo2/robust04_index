			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, 13 Jun (XINHUA) -- During his recent  inspection of Fujian Province, Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the  National People's Congress Standing Committee, pointed out: It  is necessary to stabilize and develop agriculture by every  possible means, vigorously develop village and town enterprises,  and make efforts to maintain the good momentum of the  development of the three kinds of partially or wholly  foreign-owned enterprises.    Tian Jiyun stressed: While making vigorous efforts to  stabilize and expand grain production, we must actively engage  ourselves in diverse economic undertakings, develop a type of  farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum  efficiency, and increase peasants' income. He said: Integrated  management of trade, industry, and agriculture must not be  merely an integration in form without an integration between the  interests of the three sectors. When their interests are  integrated, peasants would increase production as well as their  income and, thus, we would be able to further arouse peasants'  enthusiasm for production and to guide them to the market. We  must pay attention to exploration in this respect when we deepen  reform in rural areas in the future.    Tian Jiyun stressed: It is necessary to develop village and  town enterprises by every possible means and vigorously  encourage the development of enterprises run by individuals and  privately run enterprises. We should look upon the development  of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises and village and town enterprises as a driving force  for state enterprises. They rely on, supplement, and promote  each other. Various economic sectors must coexist, and more  than one wheel is needed to expedite the drive to establish a  socialist market economy.    When Tian Jiyun heard that foreign businessmen are most  worried about whether social stability can be maintained and  whether policies can remain stable, he said: The overall  situation of China's reform and opening up will remain  unchanged. Reform and opening up accord with the trend of the  times and the desire of the people. In more than 10 years, the  state formulated a series of policies encouraging foreign  businessmen to invest in China. These basic policies will  remain unchanged. China enjoys social stability, adopts  policies that give preferential treatment to foreign  businessmen, and hopes they will commit investment without any  worry and boldly go ahead with their investment projects, so as  to maintain the good momentum of the development of the three  kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises.    Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian  Provincial CPC Committee, and Yuan Qitong, vice chairman of the  Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial People's Congress,  Tian Jiyun inspected Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou  between 7-13 June. He held discussion meetings with foreign  businessmen, peasant entrepreneurs, and cadres at the  grass-roots level.</p>

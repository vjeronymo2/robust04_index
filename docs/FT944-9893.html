			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Thai steel monopoly to end Thailand is set to breach a steel monopoly by allowing new entrants into the market. A previous administration had promised 10-year protection to Sahaviriya Steel Industry in 1989. But with demand continuing to outstrip supply, the government has persuaded Sahaviriya to co-operate in allowing more steel factories to be built. The move will almost certainly see two powerful local groups move into steelmaking: Siam Cement, in a joint venture with Mitsui and Nippon Steel of Japan, expects to build a cold-rolled steel plant, and NTS Steel Group has applied to construct a hot-rolled steel centre. Sahaviriya started hot-rolled steel production early this year at a Dollars 650m plant and is scheduled to begin cold-rolled steel production early next year.</p>

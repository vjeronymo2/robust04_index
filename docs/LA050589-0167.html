			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOBLESS RATE LEAPS TO 5.3%, SIGNALS COOLING ECONOMY;  </P> <P> DOW RALLIES ON NEWS BUT FIZZLES  </P> <P> Unemployment, rising at the fastest clip in more then three years, jumped to  5.3% last month, the strongest evidence yet of an economic slowdown, the  government said today in a report greeted with mixed reactions in financial  markets.  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks initially staged a powerful rally, than sank abruptly in the  final hour on futures-related trading and uncertainty over the unemployment  figures.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.94 points at 2,381.96,after being  up by as much as 25 points. Rises led falls by about 4-3 on moderate New York  Stock Exchange volume of 180.812 million shares.  </P> <P> Propelling the 0.3 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was the smallest  rise in new jobs since June, 1986, the Labor Department said.  </P> <P> The unemployment increase was the biggest one-month gain since February, 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Reaction  </P> <P> Economists and financial markets, concerned for months that the persistently  heady economy was moving into a period of spiraling price hikes, initially  found mostly good news in the report.  </P> <P> But some analysts wondered whether the dramatic increase in joblessness was  signaling that the danger now is one not of inflation but of recession.  </P> <P> Roger Brinner of DRI-McGraw-Hill said the data was "about perfect" for  prospects of generating a soft landing for the soaring economy -- slowing  growth just enough to rein in inflation without triggering a recession.  </P> <P> "There's no question the economy is weakening," said Washington economist  Michael Evans. "But there's nothing in this report to suggest we are heading  into a recession."  </P> <P> Allen Sinai of Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. was more cautious.  </P> <P> He predicted a mild recession later this year and said the economy was  "downshifting to slower growth. This is part and parcel of the bloom being off  the rose of what has been a booming economy."  </P> <P> Economists concurred that today's surprising jump in the unemployment rate will  likely be enough to keep the Federal Reserve Board from further tightening  credit when it next reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White House Optimistic  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played down the significance of the  first rise in unemployment of George Bush's brief tenure as President, noting  that the percentage of working-age Americans with jobs "remains at al all-time  high of 63.3%."  </P> <P> April's rise in the jobless rate was felt most heavily by men. The unemployment  rate among white men rose from 3.6% to 4.0%; for Hispanic men, from 6.5% to  8.3%; for black men, from 9.8% to 10.0%.  </P> <P> Joblessness among white women rose from 3.8% to 4.1%, but dropped for black  women from 9.1% to 8.8%.  </P> <P> As for job growth last month, a separate department survey of businesses found  that only 117,000 non-farm payroll jobs were created.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Labor Department revised payroll growth for March  downward from 180,000 to 171,000. Over the 12-month period that ended in  February, an average of 300,000 jobs had been created each month.  </P></p>

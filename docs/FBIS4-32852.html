			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Mulino has said that it would  be a serious mistake to renegotiate the presence of the United  States in Panama after the year 2000 because the infrastructures  now used in the Canal area must be put to work for the good of  the country.    The Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 state that the  U.S. presence in Panama must end by 31 December 1999.    Mulino recalled that President Guillermo Endara's  administration "has always said that there is no possibility of  renegotiating the presence of U.S. bases in Panama after the  year 2000." However, some groups in the country are suggesting  the renegotiation of these treaties to avoid the negative impact  that this withdrawal will have on the country's economy.    "As a Panamanian I have seen and studied in depth what the  return of these infrastructures will represent for our country,  socially as well as economically, and I believe it would be a  mistake to suggest they remain here," Mulino said.    The Panamanian diplomat added that "we have to start  working,  as of yesterday, to efficiently and actively incorporate all  those assets that the reverted areas represent to our national  development."    Mulino said he believes Panama will benefit more from  developing those areas in an organized way than by having them  inhabited by foreign soldiers.    The areas along the banks of the Panama Canal are worth  approximately $30 billion, and, according to economists, they  must be used to create jobs through foreign investment.    Mulino said that "as a citizen, this is the view that I must  support."    However, Mulino added that it will be up to President-elect  Ernesto Perez Balladares and Foreign Minister-elect Gabriel  Lewis Galindo to deal with this matter.    Mulino added that since this is a matter that is of interest  to all, it must be handled as established in the Constitution.</p>

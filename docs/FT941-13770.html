			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Observer: Beering up Philanthropy is not yet dead it seems, particularly when it's good for the corporate image. Miller Brewing, the Philip Morris subsidiary, last week helped those struck by the recent natural calamities in the US. First it steamed into the LA earthquake by donating two production lines at its Irwindale, California, brewery, to produce 3m bottles of water instead of beer. Then it ceased beer production for two days at its flagship plant in Milwaukee, America's beer capital. It said it was worried for its workers' safety when temperatures in the upper mid-west fell as low as 30 degrees below.</p>

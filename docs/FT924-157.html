			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK seeks opt-out from employment rule THE UK is to seek an opt-out from the requirements of a European directive which has caused uncertainty about public services contracted out to the private sector. The directive can prevent companies cutting pay and conditions of staff they take on after mergers and acquisitions. When an 'undertaking' is 'transferred', staff who transfer may retain their existing pay and conditions, except for pensions. Companies and government officials are unsure whether the directive applies to compulsory competitive tendering and so-called 'market-testing' in local and central government. Contractors and employers' organisations have called for clarification. Conflicting legal opinions have been given in the absence of a firm ruling. The government, which is extending contracting out to Whitehall services, has dismissed the debate over the regulations as a 'red herring' which will have, at worst, a limited effect. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, will seek an opt-out from the directive under the year-long subsidiarity review of the proper responsibilities of national and European authorities agreed at the Edinburgh summit. The government has consistently rejected an extension of EC influence over employment matters. The employment department said: 'Mr Forsyth will seek to have the directive withdrawn on the grounds of subsidiarity.' But it is not clear that an opt-out would be possible; an annex to the Edinburgh agreement gives conflicting signals on the Commission's view on the application of subsidiarity to social policy. Some legislation is excluded from the review. The Trades Union Congress said the government was unlikely to win another opt-out. A TUC official said: 'The government can scarcely take comfort in the Edinburgh summit which agreed to supplement European social legislation with additional measures and to implement all the provisions of the social chapter. It also limited UK demands that 71 European measures be withdrawn to 21.' Expensive undertaking, Page 4</p>

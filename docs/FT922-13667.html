			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Cash from across the sea / The US as a source of long-term funding A casual observer of the corporate finance scene may think UK companies have gone into hibernation. The spree of rights issues seen last year has dried up, public bond issues are increasingly rare and the syndicated loans market is moribund. But a stream of UK companies are crossing the Atlantic to find the type of long-term funding not available at home. This week Pilkington, Tate &amp; Lyle and Senior Engineering are in the market. Last week, deals closed for Lucas Industries and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield. Over the last two years the list of UK companies which have tapped the US private placement market included big names: Trafalgar House, Allied Lyons, Rank Organisation, NFC, Cookson and Bowater. The reason is simple: the US private placement market is one of the few remaining sources of long-term committed debt finance. Banks are increasingly unwilling to make unsecured loans of more than five years, and will only do so at a punitive cost. The public Eurobond market remains open to large companies but investors are also wary of buying bonds of more than 10-years maturity. US institutional investors are still prepared to buy corporate bonds of up to 20-years maturity. It is also doubtful whether a company the size of Dawson Group, the commercial vehicles company, or Ransomes, the engineering and property development group, could launch a public Eurobond issue. Yet both have raised debt finance from private placements in the US. Private placements can often be structured to match the borrowers' requirements: for example, a Dollars 260m (Pounds 149m) placement for Trafalgar House in 1990 comprised securities of between seven years and 17 years maturities. The pattern of maturities was designed to match depreciation charges on Trafalgar's fleet of ships. Many UK companies are using the proceeds of US debt placements to repay less reliable sources of funding. Lucas Industries used the proceeds of its Dollars 100m 12-year placement to repay most of its US commercial paper borrowings. The company's short-term credit rating is under review for possible downgrade by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the big US credit rating agencies. Normally Lucas would see its cost of funds increase, but all but Dollars 30m of the commercial paper has been repaid. Similarly, Rank Organisation used the proceeds of a Dollars 200m debt placement last year to repay auction-market preferred shares (AMPS) when a downgrading threatened to increase its cost of funds. Buyers of private placements are also concerned with credit quality. In fact, US institutions buying long-term, largely illiquid, debt securities are highly sensitive to credit risk. Some UK companies have found that funding was simply not available on acceptable terms. For example, Dixons, the electrical retailer, withdrew plans for a US debt placement last year because investors were demanding a higher return than it was prepared to offer. According to Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director responsible for private placements with Wertheim Schroder in New York, the quality of debt analysis by US institutions is generally higher than in the more equity-oriented UK market. Investment regulations which have forced US institutions to buy bonds rather than equities have bred an investment culture receptive to long-term debt securities. UK accounting standards are at least adjacent to the US but for UK companies, the accounting and disclosure requirements of US securities regulators can be a headache. For this reason most placements by UK companies have not been made under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a, which gives overseas companies greater access to the US capital markets. Bonds placed under rule 144a can be traded, but only between qualified investment institutions. In return, borrowers are exempt from many of reporting requirements applied to issuers of public securities. The small number of US institutions willing to buy private placements means that liquidity is very limited even under rule 144a. Any slight saving for the borrower in cost of funds is outweighed by additional financial disclosure requirements. One drawback is that covenants demanded by US institutions can be restrictive. As with most bank lending agreements, interest cover and core borrowing limits are normal. But US institutions also demand 'event risk' put options, which give them the right to retrieve their cash in case of a takeover bid. The biggest limitation to the future growth of the market could be the small number of US institutions willing to buy cross-border placements. Around 3,000 US institutions are qualified to buy private placements under SEC regulations, but only 300 have done so. Just 50 of these will buy bonds placed by overseas corporations. However, last year the US private placement market amounted to Dollars 160bn with overseas companies accounting for around 10 per cent of the total raised, compared with 2 per cent in the late 1980s.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGEST US DEBT PLACEMENTS BY UK COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year         Company                 Amount       Maturity                                   (Dollarsm)       (years)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1988         Rank Organisation        150             10 1989         Cookson Group            200          15-20 1990         Trafalgar House          260           7-17 1990         Rank Organisation        300           5-16 1991         Allied Lyons             425          10-15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Wertheim Schroder  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

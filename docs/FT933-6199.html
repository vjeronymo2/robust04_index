			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Nigeria's oil workers set to strike: Challenge to legitimacy of new government NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened yesterday as oil workers prepared to strike and the winner of the annulled presidential election promised to form a rival government. Oil workers are challenging the legitimacy of the country's military-installed government with an indefinite strike starting today that could seriously disrupt the vital petroleum industry, which accounts for more than 90 per cent of export earnings. Nupeng, the oil workers' union, called the strike to demand a democratically elected government based on the June 12 presidential election, annulled by Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the military leader who quit office on Thursday. The unofficial winner of the election, Chief Moshood Abiola, yesterday dismissed the appointment of an interim government headed by Mr Ernest Shonekan as 'a non-event', and said the new council 'represents nobody but Ibrahim Babangida and a small clique'. 'By the end of next week I will be in Lagos,' he said in London. 'It will be a real government I will form.' Mr Clement Akpamgbo, justice minister in the interim council installed on Thursday, said such a move would be treated as 'insurrection'. However,the pressing concern in Lagos yesterday was the impending strike. Oil executives said it could close refineries and disrupt distribution to petrol stations. But they said essential services, including the production of crude and loading tankers, could be maintained by supervisors. The strike was expected to exacerbate the severe fuel shortage that has brought Lagos and southern Nigeria, the country's economic heartland, to a virtual standstill. Lagos was deserted yesterday on the third day of a stay-at-home protest organised by pro-democracy activists. But in the north, Nigerians seemed more inclined to accept the new administration. Secrecy still surrounds the mandate of the new government, which was hastily put together by Gen Babangida when a bid to extend his strongman rule was blocked by fellow officers. Nigerians have not yet been told how long this 'interim national government' will remain in office. In a country propelled by rumours, speculation is that Chief Shonekan will call fresh elections within nine months. Gen Babangida appears to have overlooked the naming of a new head of state - a post he was presumably keeping for himself. The post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces is also vacant following Gen Babangida's forced retirement on Thursday. Chief Shonekan's 32-member cabinet, which included representatives from each of Nigeria's 30 states, was sworn in yesterday. Nigerians in the Moslem north, which has traditionally held the reins of political power, appeared satisfied with the new regime. In Lagos, however, several businessmen were scathing about the calibre of Chief Shonekan's team and doubted his ability to reverse Nigeria's economic decline.</p>

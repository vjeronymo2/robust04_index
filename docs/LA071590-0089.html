			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JOHN LYNCH;  </P> <P> NEW COACHING JOB HELPS CARSON BOUNCE BACK FROM HEARTBREAK AT HART  </P> <P> The coincidence was not lost on Dave Carson. As the former coach at Hart and  Burbank highs busily prepared for a new life in Spokane, Wash., he took note of  where his career stood one year ago.  </P> <P> Carson accepted his new job as a track and assistant football coach at Rogers  High almost exactly a year after he was forced to resign as the Hart football  coach. Principal Laurence Strauss claimed Carson ran a negative program and the  coach's resignation July 20, 1989 ended a turbulent tour of duty with one of  the area's top programs.  </P> <P> The Indians were 6-5 under Carson and failed to win the Foothill League title  for the first time in five years.  </P> <P> Carson, 42, had built a reputation as a talented coach in his five years at  Burbank, fielding respectable if not especially talented teams. His 27-25  record included six forfeit losses.  </P> <P> But one season after he replaced Rick Scott at Hart, Carson was stunned by his  ouster, which caused him to sink into self-doubt and depression. He remained at  Hart as a physical education teacher, but without a coaching job he felt like  an outcast.  </P> <P> "I was as low as you can get," he said Friday. "The people at Burbank respected  me but the people at Hart never really got to know me. When you're treated as a  nonentity, that's a tough pill to swallow.  </P> <P> "I doubted myself and asked myself a lot of questions. I questioned what I did  and who I was. I was always able to teach kids, but I didn't teach the Hart  kids very much."  </P> <P> Taking an assistant coaching position at Muir High in Pasadena helped restore  Carson's confidence. He was hired in May as a defensive coordinator and enjoyed  his brief ride with the Mustangs.  </P> <P> "The Muir kids took to me like a duck to water. I worked with quality kids  there and was having fun," he said.  </P> <P> Carson took the job in Spokane because of his friendship with football Coach  Jeff Reyburn. The two worked together on Dave Currey's staff at Cal State Long  Beach in 1977-78. A visit to the area last month clinched the deal for Carson,  who will move north by the end of the month.  </P> <P> "It's a great place to raise a family and we're all excited about leaving," he  said. "If you told me a year ago that I'd be packing for a job in Washington  that I was really excited about, I wouldn't have believed it."  </P> <P> Reclamation project: Perhaps the biggest boon to the young career of Canoga  Park point guard Lindsey Dunbar came last winter with one week left in the  regular season. The Hunters had shown tremendous improvement in Jeff Davis'  first season as coach, but the prospect of a losing season irked Dunbar. Canoga  Park finished with a 10-13 record and Dunbar finished in the Davis doghouse.  </P> <P> Davis kicked Dunbar off the team after they clashed during practice. Dunbar, a  5-foot-7 junior point guard, was the team's leading playmaker with an average  of 6.3 assists a game and was second in scoring with a 12.2-point average. But  he had lessons to learn that went beyond the playbook, a fact he now readily  admits.  </P> <P> "I used to be selfish and just wanted to score," Dunbar said. "(Davis) changed  everything. I have a team attitude now and like to play with the team. Now I'm  glad he kicked me off. He made me a better ballplayer and a person. I learned  discipline from him."  </P> <P> Davis claims that the change will make Dunbar one of the top players in the  area next season. Dunbar has averaged 20 points in summer league games.  </P> <P> "He's real tough to guard and now he understands the game better," Davis said.  "He's learned to listen better. He understands the necessary communication  between a coach and a point guard during the game. He looks over to the bench  and he didn't do that before."  </P> <P> Dunbar claims his case is instructive. Davis has brought a winning attitude to  a program that had seemed ready for the trash heap. In the season before Davis  arrived, the Hunters lost a Northwest Valley Conference game to Cleveland by 97  points.  </P> <P> "There's a winning attitude now and it's been fun," Dunbar said. "He has  everything to do with it. He's a good coach and good motivator."  </P> <P> Add Canoga Park: Davis has kept the Hunters busy this summer, taking them to  out-of-town tournaments two weekends in a row. After a trip to Santa Barbara  for a tournament at Westmont College, the team played in the 32-team event at  Skyline College in the Bay Area last weekend.  </P> <P> The Hunters dropped two of three games in the Bay Area and had to sleep on a  high school gym floor their first night on the road.  </P> <P> "They wouldn't let us stay at the college but it turned out to be a good  thing," David said. "We stayed up real late, just sitting around talking. It  was like a campfire thing.  </P> <P> "We had another long talk the next night and I could feel the team getting real  close. That's why these trips are so beneficial."  </P></p>

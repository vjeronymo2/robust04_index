			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Navy to complete delayed vessel THE ROYAL NAVY is to take responsibility for finishing work on an armed support ship constructed by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The move to take the ship, Fort Victoria, out of the contractor's hands follows a series of problems and delays - the ship is 2 1/2 years overdue. Defence officials said yesterday that six months of the delay were not attributable to the contractor but to changes in navy requirements. In an attempt to resolve the remaining technical difficulties, Harland sent the ship to the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. The yard is a subsidiary of VSEL, the Cumbria-based shipyard group. But the navy will now try to rectify the defects at its own Fleet Maintenance and Repair Organisation in Portsmouth. The Ministry of Defence said that Harland had 'completed the vessel to a standard that we are willing to accept'. The ship, designed to supply stores and fuel, was ordered in April 1986, at an inflation-adjustable price of Pounds 127m. No details were available on the financial settlement reached with Harland over the defect rectification work. A sister vessel, Fort George, was ordered from Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside in December 1987 and is virtually complete. The prospect of an order for a navy helicopter carrier that could save Swan Hunter was kept alive yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. The Pounds 170m carrier is on a list of projects that the MoD has considered abandoning to meet reduced spending targets. However, Mr Rifkind said yesterday: 'It may well remain in the programme.' But he added that a review of spending priorities was not yet complete. VSEL is also bidding for the order in partnership with the Clydeside yard Kvaerner Govan.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> PARCEL TAX STILL UNDECIDED  </P> <P> With 387 more ballots counted since Election Day but an unknown number of  absentee ballots uncounted, the fate of a tax that would benefit the Beverly  Hills Unified School District remains up in the air, elections officials said  this week.  </P> <P> The parcel tax measure, Proposition B on the June 5 municipal ballot, had 6,115  yes votes, or 66.46% of the total so far, said Marcia Ventura, spokeswoman for  the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's office.  </P> <P> To take effect, the measure needs approval by two-thirds of the voters.  </P> <P> Votes against the tax numbered 3,086, or 33.53%, Ventura said.  </P> <P> There are 75,000 ballots countywide yet to be counted, and it is unknown how  many of those are from Beverly Hills, she said. More information on the results  should be available today, she said.  </P></p>

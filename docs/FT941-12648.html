			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Placing trust in the directors - The portfolio, having disposed of two of its holdings since the last Review, buys units in a fund that monitors who is buying shares in their own company. It also responds to a reader's suggestion It is 10.45 am, and the post has still not arrived. I do not live in a remote village, but less than two miles from the local delivery office. What explanation is there for such a late service in January? I am informed that the delay is due to 'all the junk mail. . . I wish they would stagger their deliveries'. Always on the lookout for investment opportunities, I contemplate searching out and investing in companies that benefit from the ever-increasing amount of unsolicited mail. I mention that, in 'normal times', the post is always considerably later than that for a neighbouring road, and that the delivery route seems unnecessarily circuitous. Could he kindly look at the routings again? The spokesman says he doesn't have the money or the manpower to do this, and that the Royal Mail suffers from 'government restraints'. Various excuses for an appalling service have also been given since I started complaining in March 1987, when the Royal Mail said 'the slippage of delivery times' was due to 'the unprecedented increase in mail over the past 12 months'; while in 1989 it was because of 'difficulties in retention and recruitment of staff due to a general shrinkage in the labour market in the south of England'. However, this year's complaint seems to have achieved immediate results. Within a week, the post arrived much earlier - but how long will it last? What has any of this to do with the portfolio? It demonstrates the importance of management action in securing the future of companies having to operate in a competitive environment, and the need to take into account the effects of government actions. These considerations have all been borne in mind in producing this portfolio. I am particularly interested in companies with strong management and the capability of responding quickly to changing conditions and customers' needs. Allied Colloids (speciality chemicals) and EIS (engineering) have demonstrated their ability to compete worldwide in the face of tough competition. However, the portfolio will maintain its earlier stop-loss levels of 205-210p and 365-370p respectively for these companies. Stop-loss levels are useful for locking in profits and/or preventing large losses. Unfortunately, when Norcros slipped to its stop-loss level of 170p, soon after the publication of the last Review, this did not generate the maximum profit for the portfolio, as the shares subsequently rebounded to higher levels. The 170p stop-loss level had been chosen, because I thought Norcros' share price had been buoyed by takeover hopes, and these had now faded. Expecting a general market downturn, I feared that any fall in the share price could be quite steep. But the portfolio did make a modest profit as it had bought the shares for 158p each. Burlington Group fell to its stop-loss level of 20p in late November. The shares had originally been acquired for 11.5p each in October, 1992, but half the portfolio's holding had been sold for 27p a share in March last year. This shows the volatility of shares in certain small companies. At 20p a share, Burlington's market capitalisation is only Pounds 2.96m. It would make an ideal 'shell' into which an entrepreneur could inject further activities and rapidly expand the company. My personal pension scheme has been buying and selling Burlington shares since 1989, in the hope of a takeover bid, and still retains a modest holding. If Burlington's shares fell to 16-17p, the portfolio would consider using its surplus cash to reinvest in the company. Thus, since the last Review, the portfolio has disposed of two of its holdings. I had intended the proceeds to be used to buy shares in Renishaw (a manufacturer of precision metrology and inspection equipment), OIS International Inspection, or Meggitt, an engineering company. Sadly, the share prices of these strongly-managed companies did not fall to my expected buying levels, and so the portfolio was stuck with cash during a period of low interest rates. I still like all three companies, and, if the portfolio ever had any spare cash, would consider buying shares in them if they fell as a result of a general market downturn to 220-230p for Renishaw, around 80p for Meggitt and 60-65p for OIS. Perhaps one of the best ways of making sure that a company performs is for its management to have a large share stake. Although I have recently cooled towards Pentland Group, its executive chairman, Stephen Rubin, has a massive shareholding in the company. Its recent acquisition of a 90 per cent interest in Ellesse, an upmarket sportswear company, should fit in well with Pentland's other brands, such as Speedo swimwear and Pony shoes. The portfolio will maintain its stop-loss level for Pentland at 80-85p. My personal pension scheme has a holding in Pentland and in another of the portfolio's holdings: William Ransom. I still believe Ransom is attractive, it has sound management and its chairman has a large shareholding. The portfolio stop-loss will be changed to 45-47p. The importance of directors' shareholdings in companies is emphasised by Pointon York's BRI Director Dealings unit trust. Launched at 100p per unit in October last year, the trust aims to monitor closely share transactions by directors in their own companies. The trust emphasises that it does not blindly follow directors, but applies 'fundamental research techniques' to try to ensure that any investment by the trust is as a result of following directors who buy shares because they believe their company has significant potential rather than the director buying mainly in an attempt to help prop up the share price. The portfolio will 'buy' 2,500 units in this trust. A reader of my column in the Weekend FT wrote to me in October, pointing out that Alvis was a company that appeared to him to have been overlooked by the market and was well worth mentioning: it not only had excellent products, but takeover attractions, as Brierley Investments had a 29 per cent share stake. The value of Alvis's shareholding in Avimo of Singapore was perhaps worth as much as Alvis's own market capitalisation. I did some further research and liked what I saw, so my personal pension fund took a very modest stake in the company on Christmas Eve. The portfolio will acquire 6,250 shares in Alvis at 40p per share. A stop-loss level of 30-32p will be set, as I feel this could be more of a speculation than some of the other holdings in the portfolio. The shares have traded in the 17-48p range since January last year. Despite defence cuts, there seems to be no end to terrorist activities and civil wars in various countries, and so Alvis's light armoured fighting vehicles and robotic bomb disposal equipment still ought to find markets. Through Avimo, Alvis has considerable interests in non-defence activities, including providing chemical treatment processes for metal components used in computer disk drives. As can be seen from the chart, the portfolio has so far managed to outperform the FT All-Share Index. But past performance is no guarantee of future success, and I feel the market could be due for at least a minor shake-out in the not too distant future. At least setting stop-loss levels limits the downside. The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative. The opinions expressed are his own.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE POUNDS 10,000 PORTFOLIO STANDS AFTER NINE QUARTERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Number    Purchase     Cost        Jan 6    Jan 6 Company          of shares    price (p)  (Pounds)   price (p)   value                                                               (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids      1,000       215       2,150       234      2,340 EIS                    750       375       2,813       408      3,060 Pentland             3,500        99       3,465       107      3,745 William Ransom       3,000        52       1,560        55      1,650  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Shares/units bought: Pointon York BRI  Director Dealings  UT                  2,500    109.11       2,728    109.11      2,728 Alvis                6,250        40       2,500        40      2,500 Cash*                                                           1,202  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                          17,225  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: 1. *Cash figure allows for interest and dividends. 2.

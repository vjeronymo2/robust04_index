			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Observer: Cutting remarks Should the world's news agencies be judged on the speed of their reporting or on the viciousness - or obscurity - of their ads? Last week, in the FT, Reuters was boasting how it had tipped off the world that the Bundesbank was going to cut interest rates 33 minutes before the central bank's own official announcement of the February 4 policy change. VWD, the German economic news agency, in which Reuters had a one-third interest until 1980, blasted back yesterday - in German except for the citation of the Reuters copy and with no explanation for the Brits as to who or what VWD might be - that this was not true. It was there with the news a whole 28 minutes earlier, it claimed. Reuters says VWD's was an unsourced report; VWD, in turn, says the Reuters' piece was 'just as much speculation as ours, but our report was harder'. (Eh?) VWD thinks Reuters is trying to sabotage its English language service - though why it should then couch its rejoinder in German is a bit of a puzzle. Reuters, almost a century older than VWD and able to trace its German roots back to Baron de Reuter no less, just thinks the competition is unnerved by missing out on the odd scoop recently. As usual in the more delicious Anglo-German rows, the Bundesbank has the last word. 'They can write what they like, but it is a little bit strange that they should be arguing about who was the first to start a rumour.' Back to your terminals, boys.</p>

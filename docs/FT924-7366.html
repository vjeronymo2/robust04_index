			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Inflexibly invisible Sir, I am just off to Russia on business for some weeks. I am taking Pounds 2,500-worth of personal computer equipment, and I needed it to be insured against theft etc. I asked my insurance company and travel agents, which all declined because it was for business purposes. A leading Lloyd's broker could do no better. No one would move from the inflexibility of the standard form of medical and travel insurance. British? Yes; Service? No; Invisible - Absolute] A Kennaway, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College of Science and Technology, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2BX</p>

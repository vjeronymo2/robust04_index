			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Regional savings - A UK airline's initiative British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled airline, is offering business travellers flying from UK regional airports to Europe average savings of 16 per cent on full club class fares. It has negotiated a marketing deal with three European airlines: Alitalia, Austrian Airlines and Iberia of Spain. The new initiative, which in some cases offers savings of up to 22 per cent, allows passengers to buy special 'through fares' to 15 European destinations  -including Alicante, Barcelona, Bilbao, Bologna, Madrid, Malaga, Milan, Palma, Pisa, Rome, Seville, Turin, Valencia, Venice and Vienna - from five UK regional airports. These are Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Leeds/Bradford and Teesside. The only restriction on the new 'through fares' is that journeys must be completed within three days of departure. Normally, a journey from a regional UK airport connecting in London with a flight on another airline to a destination in Europe would have two separate fares for the different legs of the journey. These three-day executive return fares were introduced on British Midland's London Heathrow services to Europe last year, when the airline launched its Euroclass, offering a flexible range of business class fares. They have now been extended to British Midland UK regional services in conjunction with the three European airlines. British Midland recently formed a ticket code-sharing alliance with Austrian Airlines, and is expected to forge similar code-sharing agreements with Alitalia and Iberia.</p>

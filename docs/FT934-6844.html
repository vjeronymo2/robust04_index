			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute Sir, As a member of the European Parliament's energy committee and rapporteur on two reports on Sellafield and Safeguards (1988) and Sellafield Reprocessing and Nuclear Transport (1993) for the parliament, I would like to comment on the full page advertisement you printed (November 16) from the chairmen of 10 Japanese electricity utilities with contracts for reprocessing of their irradiated nuclear fuel at the Thorp plant at Sellafield. There is insufficient space to correct all of their misrepresentations on nuclear waste management, plutonium demand and the safety standards for nuclear transport adopted by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). I do think, though, that it is important specifically to address the myopic assertion that 'all nuclear material from Thorp, including plutonium, would be strictly controlled by the British government, Euratom and the International Atomic Energy Agency in the United Kingdom and by the Japanese Government and IAEA in Japan'. In my 1988 report on nuclear safeguards at Sellafield it was demonstrated that the UK had deliberately excluded safeguards inspectors from Sellafield's most sensitive areas for 13 years from 1973. It has since been claimed that the safeguards regime is now more transparent at Sellafield. In BNFL's own submission to the second consultation period on Thorp over the summer, it claims that 'Euratom safeguards inspectors have been given access to verify all aspects of the Thorp design'. This claim is purportedly based on a paper prepared by three BNFL and five Euratom experts. I have asked BNFL for a copy of this paper on at least three occasions over the summer and it has yet to send it. In the European Parliament's call for the 1994 Euratom safeguards budget to be increased by Ecu 12,980m to cover large-scale plutonium processing plants, it explains that 'plutonium stocks in the Community have almost doubled from 151 tonnes in the four years since 1988'. Further separation of at least 50 tonnes of plutonium in Thorp over its first 10 years of operation, much of which is destined to be returned to overseas customers, will further exacerbate the problem. The recent concerns expressed by members of the US Congress, Japanese Diet, the European Parliament and the Rand Corporation study released on 17 November, about plutonium proliferation, present a powerful protest against Thorp.

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Clarke warned of revolt over aid for fuel tax MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, was yesterday warned that he could face a backbench rebellion over his plan to limit to less than Pounds 500m the package to help the less well-off pay for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Mr Clarke last night met three senior officers of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, and was told of 'deep concern' among Tory MPs. Some Tories yesterday said plans to limit compensation would be 'politically disastrous'. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman, and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith and Dame Jill Knight, the vice-chairmen of the 1922 Committee, met Mr Clarke. Dame Jill said: 'The elderly and those who need heat but cannot afford it must be compensated.' One senior Tory backbench MP said the three 'implored the chancellor to rethink his compensation package', adding that they remained doubtful if they had any effect. Many Conservative MPs want a package which will help pensioners who are not on income support - the 'nearly poor', who typically have modest incomes and savings and many of whom are supporters of the government. But the chancellor has decided to restrict the compensation package to less than Pounds 500m, in effect excluding this group. Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, said the government had 'a death wish' if it was thinking of restricting the package. 'If the government is determined to lose the next election then it will impose VAT on domestic fuel,' he said. 'It is becoming an albatross around its neck. It should at least rethink its compensation package.' Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for pensioners, said: 'The key group are the nearly poor, the 2.5m pensioners who have only a small income over the income support level. They must be helped. If the government do not come forward with positive proposals, there will be serious trouble on the government back benches.' Another Conservative backbencher said the chancellor should consider different options to help the nearly poor, such as taxing them less. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the government could defuse the row by scrapping the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and instead raise revenue by ending tax abuses and loopholes which he estimates are costing billions of pounds. He proposed measures to save up to Pounds 10bn over two years, including reform of inheritance tax, closing down tax relief on executive share options, abolishing the business expansion scheme and ending tax relief on private medical insurance. He also called for a shake-up of corporation tax, including an end to allowances for sales of companies with excess management expenses. Mr Brown said he also favoured ending Britain's position as a tax haven. He stopped short of recommending the end of sovereign immunity, but said Labour would deal with the abuses which allowed companies to trade under the umbrella of national governments. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told BBC radio: 'We are willing, where necessary, to close loopholes and take action against tax avoidance.'</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Dollar rally halted The spectacular rise of the dollar on the foreign exchange markets last week came to an abrupt halt on Friday afternoon in London, as a wave selling cut 3 pfennigs from the value of the US currency, writes Simon London. This was followed in New York by some well-timed intervention by the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve, selling dollar against the yen. The US currency fell to just above Y124 from Y127.45 at the close in London This sudden decline underlined that the rally of the dollar so far this year has been a fragile affair, driven by technical factors rather than a reappraisal of economic fundamentals. After all, the only optimistic news to come out of the US inthis period was better than expected non-farm payroll data, a notoriously volatile indicator. Other than this, the economic data has been as gloomy as that which put the dollar in the doldrums at the end of last year. Trade figures for November and the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey, both of which were released on Friday, underlined the gloomy tone. The first showed a substantial 5.5 per cent fall in imports during November as consumer spending slumped. The latter reported a further dive in consumer confidence in early January, undermining hopes of a change in sentiment. In addition, co-ordinated intervention by monetary authorities highlights the fact that a strong and rising dollar is at odds with the US governments over-riding policy goal - to get the domestic economy moving. This leaves participants in the currency markets asking whether the events of Friday presage a period of more widespread interventionism by central banks.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> WOMEN IN FILM FESTIVAL DRAWS INNOVATIVE EUROPEAN ENTRIES  </P> <P> It's never easy to tell the overall impact of a film festival when only a  handful of entries are around at press-screening time. But, from the relatively  small sampling available of the 1989 Women in Film Festival, the differences in  vision between European and American film makers have never seemed as clear-cut  as they are here.  </P> <P> Somehow, European film makers have found ways to get non-mainstream visions  onto their screens, intact. Allowed the room to experiment, they play with  magic, with the surreal, with personal "crazy" visions, and their cinema is  richer for it.  </P> <P> Not all of these notions work; one of the most magic-filled, poetic works in  the program, the beautiful looking Hungarian film "My 20th Century," is also  one of its most boggy and impenetrable. Yet, in contrast, almost all the  American films previewed seem to be strapped into the formula straitjacket,  overwrought melodramas that yearn for homes on television the way lemmings seek  the sea.  </P> <P> Certainly, the festival's most inventive work is the personal vision  personified; it's "Joan of Arc of Mongolia," a wickedly delightful look at the  headlong collision of two cultures by writer-director-producer Ulrike Ottinger  of West Germany. Using the worldly-wonderful Delphine Seyrig as her compleat  voyager, widely traveled in every civilized sense of the word, Ottinger  imagines a mixed group of passengers on the present-day trans-Siberian railway  who are kidnaped by a young and commanding Mongol princess. Every sort of  tension exists, sexual, cultural, generational and stylistic. Three of the  kidnapees are members of the splendid Kalinka Sisters band, a '50s-style  singing group (fiddle, piano, ukulele/guitar) whose musicianship is as  formidable as their costuming. Another is the blue-jeaned Giovanna, a beautiful  young student, who becomes something of a prize between the princess and  Seyrig. Who could have believed that life in a yurt could hold this many  temptations?  </P> <P> Sophisticated, mysterious and deliriously beautiful, "Joan of Arc," at 165  minutes, may be one of those orchids that blooms only at festivals and for far  too small an audience. If so, this is the time to take a chance on its utter  unpredictability. If you happen to be especially attuned to costumes or  jewelry, you could go for those alone, for the princess's attendants in  scarlet, acid green, pink and turquoise satin, riding camel-back or trotting on  those short-legged, short-tempered ponies. (One warning: Among these Mongolian  ceremonial events there is a prolonged ritual sheep-killing that is really  unbearable to watch. Get a stainless-steel someone to tell you when it's safe  to look again.)  </P> <P> Best to see veteran Czech film maker Vera Chytilova's "Snowball Reaction"  without consulting the program notes. Although she seems happy to reveal her  film's tragic element in advance, no one really should. This crucial story peg  doesn't emerge until the film's fourth act, but if you expect it, you almost  want to fast-forward the rest of the film to that moment, thus missing the  texture of this "La Ronde"-like series of interlocking love affairs by a group  of playful Czech careerists.  </P> <P> A lot of "Snowball Reaction" depends on the improvisational skill of its young  ensemble; they are, fortunately, first-rate, but you may (or may not) feel that  the subject deserves even greater depth.  </P> <P> From Austria comes "Scorpion Woman" by writer-director Susanne Zanke, as  interesting for the inner workings of the Austrian judicial system as for its  story, in which a trial being conducted before a striking 44-year-old judge  (Angelica Domrose) becomes a parallel for her tumultuous personal life. As a  playfully begun love affair with her 23-year-old law clerk takes a deeper turn,  the judge begins to empathize with the prisoner, a working-class woman accused  of partially blinding her young lover. "Scorpion Woman's" conclusion heightens  its melodrama, making it too neat by far, but it's intriguingly acted  melodrama.  </P> <P> Lena Wertmuller returns with a story by novelist Giovanni Guareschi, "To Save  Nine," about a widowed peasant woman with nine children 11 and younger who  hides their very existence when she rents a garret flat in Bologna from elegant  landowner Dominique Sanda. Whether this one flies will depend entirely upon the  character of the indomitable mama who, as played by Piera Degli Esposti, makes  Giuletta Masina's waif in "La Strada" seem cheerless and cynical. You may  disbelieve and wish to throttle Esposti, or you may dissolve in tears. In  either case, Sanda's last seconds are surprisingly affecting.  </P> <P> Next come productions so measured, so numbing in their pacing that nothing the  well-meaning actors do can save them. Into that category you must put  "Romelia's Secret," a feature from Mexico by Busi Cortes, which also seems  badly served by its subtitles, and two American entries, "The Kill-Off,"  adapted from a Jim Thompson story by director-writer Maggie Greenwald, and  "Face of the Enemy," by director Hassan Ildari, about an ex-Iran hostage who  stumbles onto and then kidnaps his torturer.  </P> <P> Greenwald's skill would definitely seem to be with actors, not dialogue; her  twisted noir-style plot comes apart at its seams and sags when it should cut  like dry ice. There's a kernel of an idea to Ildari's contrived plot: how  governments use and then abandon their point men and women, but he goes about  telling it with a leaden hand, a horrific use of flashbacks and the most  irritating musical score within recent memory.  </P> <P> There is also Lucy Phillips' "Stealing America," a woolly-minded exercise in  attitude and chic, without heart, point, wit or substance. Somehow, possibly  because it's in black and white and has three young visiting Europeans as its  central characters, its brash charmlessness has been compared to the control  and the rigorous point of view of Jim Jarmusch. Big mistake.  </P> <P> Can these be the best that American feature films touched by women have to  offer? That's simply not possible. Perhaps good things lurk unpreviewed. Let us  hope so, or either the selection process or the guidelines for submissions need  drastic overhauling.  </P> <P> The festival will open Thursday night with a tribute to Lee Grant and with her  dramatic feature "Staying Together," in which she gets a glowing central  performance from Melinda Dillon and a preciseness of observation about the real  stuff within families that seems much too rare on the large screen today.  </P></p>

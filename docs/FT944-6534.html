			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: QMH's debt plan in time for AGM Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group, plans to publish proposals for its Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring in the next three weeks. The group said it hoped to announce the principal terms of the restructuring before the annual meeting, now set for December 21. The announce-ment is likely to come days, rather than weeks, before the AGM because of continuing objections by just one of the more than 70 debt holders. This is thought to be Trust Company of the West, a US debt trader which bought its stake in the secondary market. Any restructuring deal needs the approval of all lenders. Meanwhile, a group of rebel QMH shareholders is proposing a rescue rights issue instead of the restructuring plan which is expected to dilute substantially existing stakes. In a letter, Mr Dennis Woodhams of the QMH Shareholders' Action Group, urges fellow investors to consider his draft proposals and projections to be presented at a meeting soon. A rights issue would be 'fairer to shareholders' and satisfy bankers, says Mr Woodhams.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] Secretary  General Mitchel Doens has denied reports that his party is  receiving support from the Cuban Government, as claimed by  Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] legislator  Leo Gonzalez. Doens said PRD members had previous knowledge  about the document Gonzalez presented, which Doens described as  a political gambit, and he announced that he will file slander  complaints against the Molirena legislator in the Peace and  Justice Commission and in the Electoral Tribunal.    [Begin Doens recording] The only thing I can say is that Mr.  Gonzalez is a mouse who got caught in his own trap. A few weeks  ago, we had this document in our possession because a friend in  the government gave it to us. We immediately wrote a letter to  the Justice and Peace Commission and delivered it to commission  member Ms. Irene Perurena with the document Mr. Gonzalez  yesterday brought to the Foreign Ministry.    Earlier, we talked with a top Cuban Embassy official to have  him explain that document to us. We found the document to be  completely false, considering it contains seven mistakes,  including forged signatures of the officials who are allegedly  in charge of directions at the Cuban Embassy and in Cuba.    Later, Cuban Charge d'Affaires Miguel Martinez delivered  this  document to the Foreign Ministry, before Mr. Gonzalez did,  precisely because of the implications this could have on his  diplomatic mission in the country. We can categorically say  this is a political gambit that is part of the dirty propaganda  tactics being used against our party. [end recording]</p>

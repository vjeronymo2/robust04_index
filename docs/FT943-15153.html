			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Fund managers feel optimistic over gilts UK fund managers are becoming increasingly optimistic about UK gilts and equities and Japanese equities. They also view the recent weakness in bonds and equities as a good buying opportunity, rather than the portent of worse things to come, according to a survey of leading UK investment funds carried out by Gallup for Smith New Court. A balance of 42 per cent of respondents intend to run down their cash balances, the highest figure for around a year. Optimism about the UK and Japanese markets does not extend to other markets, however, with a balance of 13 per cent saying they plan to reduce their exposure in the US and 14 per cent looking to cut their European holdings. The balance of respondents intending to increase their holdings in UK equities rose to 20 per cent from 8 per cent last month and that for gilts to 19 per cent from 16 per cent. Some 69 per cent of fund managers expect the UK economy to 'get a little better' over the next 12 months. UK company earnings per share growth is forecast to rise 16.4 per cent this year. Expectations for dividend growth have been revised upwards with respondents looking for dividend growth of 8.6 per cent in 1994, up from last month's figure of 8.2 per cent. A quarterly inquiry into sectoral preferences reveals definite bias towards cyclical manufacturing sectors. General engineering, building materials and pharmaceuticals are the most popular sectors. The three least popular sectors are food manufacturing, textiles and electricity stocks.</p>

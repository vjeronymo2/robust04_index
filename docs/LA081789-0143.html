			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> PERMIT YANKED, CLUB FOLDS  </P> <P> b.c., regarded as the trendiest nightspot in Los Angeles after it opened in  February, has closed its doors for the last time.  </P> <P> "It's time to do something else," co-owner Eric Goode said after last week's  unanimous decision by the Los Angeles Board of Zoning Administration to revoke  the club's conditional-use permit.  </P> <P> The nightspot, which attracted a stream of celebrities as a disco, closed May  30. Residents complained that unruly patrons had turned their quiet,  residential neighborhood into a "combat zone."  </P> <P> During its last weeks, the owners tried to operate b.c., 7561 Sunset Blvd., as  an exclusive supper club, but were handicapped by lack of a liquor license.  </P> <P> The owners had hoped to obtain a liquor license and reopen, but the loss of the  conditional-use permit erased any chance of that happening, Goode said.  </P> <P> The zoning board agreed with neighbors that the club's owners had violated the  terms of the conditional-use permit by allowing dancing without a permit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAMP PENDLETON ON EPA LIST FOR WASTE DUMPING;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ARE DISCOVERED AT SIX SITES. HOWEVER, THE  MILITARY SAYS THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER TO BASE RESIDENTS OR WILDLIFE.  </P> <P> The discovery of hazardous wastes dumped at Camp Pendleton has put the Marine  Corps base on a list of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's top  priorities, but there is no immediate danger to base residents or wildlife,  military officials announced Friday.  </P> <P> After a 1988 Defense Department study found that pesticides, paint, solvents  and fuel had contaminated the soil in six separate areas of Camp Pendleton, the  EPA proposed that the base be added to its National Priorities List, said Lt.  Patrick Gibbons, a spokesman. This week, it was among seven military bases to  be added to the list, which requires further study and possible cleanup of the  sites.  </P> <P> "Camp Pendleton has been here since 1942, before people became environmentally  aware," Gibbons said. "For many years, we disposed of things in ways that we  now know were unsafe."  </P> <P> But Gibbons said the contamination does not pose a danger to people who live on  or near the base. He said the camp's self-sufficient water supply, which is  stored in an underground aquifer, has passed quality tests, which are conducted  routinely.  </P> <P> The areas requiring remedial investigation are:  </P> <P> * An area near Vandegrift Boulevard at the bottom of Rattlesnake Canyon Road  where pest-control trucks, used to spray insecticides, were washed out.  </P> <P> * A drainage ditch near the Marine Corps Air Station, where solvents and paint  were routinely dumped.  </P> <P> * A firefighter drill field at the air station. Gasoline, jet fuel and diesel  saturated the soil, as well as the chemical foams used to put out the fires.  </P> <P> * The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office scrap yard, where some metal  and old automobile batteries were buried.  </P> <P> * The Stuart Mesa Stabilization Pond, a clay-lined lake used to filter sewage,  site of some unauthorized dumping of oil and solvents.  </P> <P> * The Las Pulgas landfill, where construction materials and a variety of toxic  compounds were placed.  </P></p>

The Federal Government also wants to support the  European Union [EU] efforts to help Ukraine. Kinkel spoke in  favor of an early partnership agreement between the European  Union and Ukraine.    Kinkel met in Bonn with members of a Ukrainian delegation,  including Foreign Minister Zlenko, Economics Minister Shpek,  Foreign Trade Minister Slyepichev, and Health Minister  Spizhenko. For Minister Slyepichev, Bonn is one of the most  important supporters of economic reforms in Ukraine.  "Integration in the world market is decisive for our reforms,"  he stated in an interview with HANDELSBLATT. Since Chancellor  Kohl visited President Kravchuk in Kiev last year, the exchange  of views and information has become decisively faster and better.    For Kiev, it is important to intensify the dialogue with  institutions like GATT, the World Bank, the IMF, and the  European Union to ensure that "we can participate in the  international division of labor without any restrictions." He  sees a considerable market potential for Ukraine's independent  space industry (including missile technology, radar plants, and  satellites) and, above all, in the agricultural industry.    Slyepichev strongly rejected the often-voiced criticism by  Western observers that there is not sufficient readiness for  reform in Ukraine, that reforms are even being delayed. Ukraine  even adopted more far-reaching reform laws in some areas than  other reform states. No other country has so few restrictions  for foreign investors who want to buy land within the framework  of joint ventures or who want to establish enterprises.    A list of 30,000 state-owned enterprises which are to be  privatized in the course of this year will shortly be published.  In fact, large and commercial enterprises are involved, but  small and medium-sized enterprises represent the majority. A  modification of rules designed to promote joint ventures more  effectively is also expected for this year.    One of the reasons for Ukraine's poor image is probably  "that  some media view Ukraine through special glasses." When  assessing the country, one must not forget -- "which usually  happens" -- that it was not possible for Ukraine to develop  economic structures of its own in the past decades. "We were  always part of the Soviet economic system."    Slyepichev rules out Ukrainian membership in the ruble zone.  "If we wanted to join the ruble zone, we would not negotiate  loans or a stabilization fund with the IMF." Generally, it is  important to stabilize the currencies. He does not foresee any  negative consequences, such as losses in foreign exchange  holdings.    Slyepichev also sees positive aspects for his country  resulting the agreement on the ruble zone between Belarus and  the Russian Federation. Trade with the neighboring country  Belarus, for example, can be carried out and cleared much more  smoothly. Kiev is now negotiating a credit worth $700 million  -- an IMF delegation is currently visiting Kiev -- but,  according to Slyepichev, an additional fund should be discussed  to stabilize the Ukrainian currency. "It takes much too long  until the IMF actually provides the money, but our currency must  be stabilized in the near future."    Slyepichev sees a clear link between Western credits and  President Kravchuk's promise to disarm the nuclear weapons  inherited from the former USSR. Health Minister Yuriy Spizhenko  also believes that Ukraine's readiness to eliminate the nuclear  weapons arsenal has a certain "market value." "In fact, we are  the only state in the world that wants to eliminate its nuclear  weapons completely. One reason is Chernobyl." Thus, Ukraine  hopes for humanitarian aid so that the enormous problems  concerning medical care can be settled.    The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster are not even in  the foreground: "We have much more severe problems in the  treatment of diabetes or in the sphere of anesthesia." The  establishment of insulin factories is urgently required. The  plans exist, and thus Ukraine is waiting for foreign aid to  realize them according to the motto: We exchange weapons for  health.</p>

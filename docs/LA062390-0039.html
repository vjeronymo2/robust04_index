			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DONALDS . . . OOPS, MAKE THAT DODGERS, JUST ASKING FOR A FALL  </P> <P> I have a suggestion for Fred Claire, which would be a $3-million-a-year gamble.  </P> <P> At this time, Kansas City would probably love nothing more than to get rid of  their multimillionaire bust, Mark Davis, who is booed every time he goes on the  mound. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are desperate for relief pitching. Maybe Davis  can regain his Cy Young form by returning to the National League.  </P> <P> FRANK PEARLSTEIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

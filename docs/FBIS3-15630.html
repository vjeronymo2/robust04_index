The embassy said that in January, 1993, French authorities  presented Lithuanian Army a great amount of military technique  [as received] and paid all its shipping expenses. The gifts  included one complete field hospital similar to those now used  by the French Army in former Yugoslavia as well as  communications equipment, not the most modern but still used in  some French gendarmerie units and possible to use in a case of a  possible mobilization.    The embassy also said 30 jeeps used for four years and  technically in order with spare parts had been presented. Last  November, a delegation of French technicians had visited  Lithuania seeking to arrange one more package of spare parts.</p>

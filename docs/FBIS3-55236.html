Do you  agree with this?    [Dobrovolskiy] After my recent trip to Poland, I  unexpectedly  realized that not only is our people's life much worse, they  also think in a different way. For example, they wouldn't move  a finger to make their life any better. Poles, by contrast,  seek to achieve Western living standards.    The effects of economic reforms in Poland are easily seen --  storeshelves are always full, and even low-paid workers can lead  a decent life there. Our Republic found itself in a bind not  only because of the ineptness of its government, but also  because of people's apathy. In a society undergoing economic  reforms, ordinary workers participate in changes. There will be  no more tranquility -- one will have to work better to earn a  good salary or simply to retain his workplace.    [Malakhovskaya] So we should adopt an American style of  living. Is that correct?    [Dobrovolskiy] Mired in an old habit, we are waiting for  someone to pass some good law and settle our problems. We must  take the initiative and change our society, so that the  government and parliament consist of reform-minded  professionals. A famous saying has been borne out: People have  leaders that they deserve. To change something in life, one  should change himself in the first place.    [Malakhovskaya] What should we expect from the new year  then?    [Dobrovolskiy] First of all, a shift in public sentiments.  Life itself will force us to be more active. Our neighbors --  perhaps with the exception of Ukraine -- have left us far  behind. If no resolute measures are undertaken, we will end up  in limbo. The economic situation will worsen. God help us avert  a collapse. We have long proposed creating a free banking zone  in Belarus. This would allow us to finance Belarusian, Russian,  and other enterprises. We should also try to ram our  refrigerators, automobiles, tractors, and television sets into  foreign markets.</p>

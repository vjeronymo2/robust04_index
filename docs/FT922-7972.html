			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: LVMH climbs to FFr4.53bn LVMH, the French luxury goods group, saw first-quarter group consolidated revenues rise 1.8 per cent to FFr4.53bn (Dollars 810m) from FFr4.44bn in the same period in 1991, AP-DJ reports from Paris. The company also said a drop to FFr1.86bn from FFr2.33bn in wine and spirits sales 'has no significance for the first quarter of 1992' as 1991 figures were boosted by buying before price increases.</p>

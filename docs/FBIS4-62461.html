			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Raul Tukhvatullin] </F>   [Text] Ufa May 14 TASS -- "I have not seen a presidential  decree on my dismissal, so I cannot comment on reports about my  dismissal," Russian Vice-prime Minister Sergey Shakhray said.    The announcement followed mass media reports about  Shakhray's  dismissal from the post of nationalities minister. In an  interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Shakhray said that even if  these reports turn out to be true, he will continue as  vice-prime minister.    Shakhray is in Ufa to attend a conference of the regional  section of his party of Russian Unity and Accord.    Shakhray met with Bashkir President Murtaza Rakhimov today  to  discuss economic problems and ways to resolve the economic  crisis in Bashkiria, a Russian republic in the Volga region.</p>

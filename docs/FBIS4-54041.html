			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japan did not face any U.S.  demands for new macroeconomic measures at informal bilateral  trade talks just concluded in Washington, a senior Finance  Ministry official said Tuesday [24 May].    During the talks, Japan explained the macroeconomic measures  included in its March market-opening package aimed at boosting  domestic demand, the official said, requesting anonymity.    The U.S. side "well recognized" Japan's efforts, he added,  stressing that macroeconomic issues were not under negotiation  at the informal talks.    The marathon four-day session focused on the three priority  areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance business, and  government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment, the official noted.    As for the insurance field, for which the Finance Ministry  holds responsibility, the official said his ministry wants to  resume talks as soon as possible although the schedule is still  undecided.    Insurance negotiations will cover market problems in both  Japan and the United States, and "qualitative and quantitative"  goals instead of numerical targets to measure the progress of  sectoral market access as agreed at the informal talks, he said.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Doubts about Wang's future prompt share fall SHARES in Wang Laboratories, the ailing US office computer company, plunged another Dollars  7/8 to just Dollars  3/4 yesterday as speculation over the company's future grew. Rumours that the company could be poised to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code have been rumbling for days, following Wang's early payment of its workforce last week and the company's decision to delay announcing its fourth-quarter results. The company's board was understood to be meeting yesterday, but officials were unavailable for comment. Wang has been seeking new finance for some months. Last year it agreed a deal with International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, to distribute IBM's equipment in addition to its own in exchange for funding. IBM declined to comment on reports that it had decided against investing a further Dollars 75m on top of Dollars 25m put in last year. Shares in Wang, which has posted after-tax losses totalling more than Dollars 1.1bn over the past two years, rallied briefly to Dollars 7 1/2 in February but have since declined steadily. Losses in the first nine months of the current year totalled Dollars 22.9m. Wang cut its payroll by almost a quarter a year ago and this May it axed more than 1,000 of the remaining 13,532 jobs - a move expected to result in a Dollars 30m fourth-quarter charge. Wang's debt totalled almost Dollars 540m at the end of March - more than 10 times the company's 1991 net worth. If the Boston-based manufacturer opts for Chapter 11, it will be the most dramatic victim of the malaise in the global computer industry. Less than a decade ago, Wang was a force to be reckoned with; tipped to succeed Digital Equipment as the world's second-largest computer maker. Its expertise in office systems, especially word processing, and the quality of its products were universally acknowledged. In spite of its record as an innovator it failed to move quickly enough to exploit either personal computers or industry standard (open) systems. It was further handicapped by management weaknesses and the death two years ago of founder Dr An Wang.</p>

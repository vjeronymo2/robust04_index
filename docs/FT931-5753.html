			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Xenova plumps for ease of US offering WHEN XENOVA, a UK bio-techonology company, was seeking to raise its next stage of financing last year, it became the obvious solution to tap the US market rather than seek more cash in the UK. Mr Phillip Price, finance director, said: 'There is much more understanding of bio-tech companies in the US. It is a lot easier to make an offering in the US than the UK.' The alternative would have been a private placing with UK institutional investors. But with only one bio-tech company listed on the Stock Exchange there are not many analysts covering the industry. Xenova did not feel it could act as a pioneer, educating investors. Xenova completed a Dollars 30.3m (Pounds 21.3m) private placement of equity at the turn of the year. Mr Price said that part of the attraction of the offering was that it was made under Regulation D of the Securities Act in the US. This allows exemptions from the Securities and Exchange Commission if the placement is targeted at high net worth individuals. There is not a similar system in the UK. Xenova's next aim is to go public, and this is also expected to be in the US, at least in the first instance, if only because the group now has many US shareholders. Until the latest offer, Xenova had been financed largely by venture capital. The company was established in 1987 and, including the latest financing, has raised a total of Pounds 35.9m in equity and has not resorted to debt finance. The money has funded research into new drugs. Xenova has yet to start clinical trials on any of its drugs and so a return for investors in terms of profits or dividends is still some way off. However, according to Mr Price, Xenova had outgrown the venture capital market. 'We were past the stage where venture capitalists could meet our needs.' The previous round of funding, in December 1990, had raised Pounds 7m, when some UK institutions came in, such as Standard Life and Norwich Union. But the US offer would have been too large for the venture capital market. Mr Price said the group had had a good experience of dealing with venture capitalists. Their backers had made an effort to 'understand what we are doing.' One problem can be that venture capital funds have fixed lives and must look for an exit when the funds have to be wound up. This has already happened to Xenova with one early investor having to sell its shares to the others. The same problem faces another backer, although the flotation should come in time to provide a way out.</p>

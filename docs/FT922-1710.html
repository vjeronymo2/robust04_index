			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: A poet of passion - The 60th birthday of Geoffrey Hill THIS WEEK it is the 60th birthday of the poet Geoffrey Hill, one of England's great, flawed, stuttering intelligences, a man much admired but less read. He was born in the village of Fairfield in the West Midlands, the only son of a policeman. From Keble College, Oxford, he went on to academic posts in the English departments of Leeds, Cambridge and - since the late 1980s - Boston university, although his decision to teach in the US should not be read as an act of wilful self-exile in the Auden mode. His achievements as a poet and scholar are incontestable (some have called him the greatest English poet since the second world war) but a wide readership has eluded him. Perhaps one reason is that he always has been difficult to get to grips with; his prose can be maddeningly gnomic and olympian. Critics have tended either to circle around him warily, as if he were not so much a poet as some kind of intellectual explosive device, or to genuflect and over-praise him. His most recent book, The Enemy's Country (1991) - which is substantially the text of the Clark lectures delivered at Cambridge in 1986, and an important work of cultural and literary criticism - was virtually ignored by the national press when it was published last year. And his poetry appears only intermittently; his last book, a long poem entitled The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Peguy, was written 10 years ago. Since then, there have been only a handful of poems. Yet, Hill's poetry has been disturbing the consensus since the end of the 1950s when it seemed to mark a sharp break with both the traditions of the recent past and the habits of the poets who were fashionable at the time. Much of the poetry of the 1940s is marked by a kind of verbal and visionary extravagance, a steep dive into the innermost recesses of the self, as if the terrors of actuality - war and its immediate aftermath  - had been altogether too much for poets to contemplate. In the 1950s came the denial of all that, with Kingsley Amis and others proclaiming the need for a more modest, humdrum art altogether, a poetry that would have something to do with everyday life: love affairs, motor cars and kitchen utensils. And then, along came Hill, all formal music and blustering rhetoric. For the Unfallen (1959) is a body of poems that was as turbulent and bloody as any Jacobean tragedy, with 'death' the first, third and fifth word in his vocabulary. Although having no fixed religion, he was writing poems of passion and an almost stifling fervour - gloomy closet dramas full of lurid cameos from the history of England and elsewhere, complete with grunts, cries and ejaculations. Out of key with the times? Hill seemed to care not one jot. Ten years later, King Log was published, equally impassioned but, this time, even more uncomfortable in its subject matter. There were poems about the atrocities of the Third Reich and a bloody return (in sonnet form) to the Wars of the Roses. Perhaps most memorably, there was a poem called 'History as Poetry' which, in one brief phrase - 'the tongue's atrocities' - raised a question which has been of paramount importance in Hill's work: can the poet write about the terrible immoralities of our time without being guilty of the luxuries of the bystander? A second great theme is the poet's difficult relation to language itself: how he must wrestle with this recalcitrant medium if anything of enduring value is to be yielded up; and how language itself must be made clean if it is to become a tool for clear and exacting expression. The guiding spirit of The Enemy's Country is John Dryden, in Hill's eyes a poet 'ingenuous and at bay.' Dryden, a Catholic whose fierce loyalty to James II caused him to be deprived of his public offices after the abdication, was doomed to be a scribbler all his life by what he once memorably described as The Vocation of Poverty. His tyrannical publisher, Tonson, held him accountable for every last line that he wrote and Dryden himself was driven by hatred of, and contempt for, his patrons - who included the Earl of Rochester, a considerable poet in his own right, of course. Yet Dryden toiled on, cheerful, optimistic in spite of all odds, picking his difficult way through the Enemy's Country, outwitting the 'treachery of words,' bringing public utterance and private feeling into harmony and writing, in his many prefaces and postscripts to his plays and translations, with a great, plain eloquence. Geoffrey Hill, on his birthday, might choose to learn something from Dryden  -for example, a lesson in plainness and good manners which might stop him in future from writing such a sentence as: 'It is, of course, a matter of common observation that the actual mechanics of quotidian life  .. are inevitably a matter of ambivalent regard.' Such lofty abstractions, handed down from such a great height, do not sit well with his considerable talents. Hill's birthday is celebrated in a special double issue of Agenda magazine. It costs Pounds 8 and can be obtained from 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, London SW11 4PE.</p>

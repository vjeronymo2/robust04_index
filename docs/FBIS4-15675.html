			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The current Latvian foreign  policy promotes the strengthening of Russia's influence in  Latvia, Saeima (parliament) Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins said  Thursday [8 April] at a conference in the Academy of Science.    The initialed agreements on troop withdrawal is only one of  the examples of the tendency, Krastins said.    The world community is unlikely to help Latvia substantially  if Russia uses military force against it and this will be a  result of the present Latvian foreign policy, Krastins noted.  To prevent this, Latvia should distance itself from Russia both  economically and politically because "Russia is our sole  potential enemy," Krastins said. Unfortunately, Krastins said,  many Latvian politicians fail to understand this truth partly  because of inertia and party because of exaggerated liberalism.    Krastins described the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements  as intentions of the ruling coalition to attribute all merits  for Russian troop withdrawal to itself.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to build military  bases in the CIS and Latvia and the following excuses with "a  technical error" stand "just another ordinary sample" of  Russia's foreign policy, Krastins said.    On the other hand, the incident convinced part of the  Latvian  community that Latvia needs the troop withdrawal agreement with  Russia to avert the setup of Russian bases here, Krastins said.    The Skrunda radar station, however, is and will remain a  military base though there are attempts to call it differently,  Krastins added.    Krastins summed up his address saying that Latvia vitally  needs to integrate into Europe.    Krastins is one of the leaders in the oppositionary Latvian  National Independence Movement.    The meeting was organized by the Baltic Center for Strategic  Studies and the Academy of Sciences.</p>

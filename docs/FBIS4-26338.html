			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478), chief economic </F> manager of the State Statistical Bureau, by Chen Zengjun (7115  1073 6511); place and date not given: "The Overall Economy Is  Developing in a Favorable Direction, Enterprise Operations Need  To Accord With Market Changes--Interviewing Qiu Xiaohua, Chief  Economic Manager of the State Statistical Bureau"]    [Text] [JINGJI RIBAO] Since the beginning of the year,  the state has successively implemented a series of major reform  measures. The smooth implementation of these measures requires  a stable economic environment as a guarantee. Compared to the  previous stage, economic operations since the beginning of the  year have seen a very great qualitative improvement. Can you  provide an overall assessment of this in terms of the current  economic situation?    [Qiu] Seen from the macroeconomic level, the economy has  already passed through a difficult period and is now moving in a  positive direction. The most difficult time was the period  before the central macroeconomic regulatory and control measures  were put in place in the second half of last year, when economic  operations saw overheating in some areas, the fiscal and banking  situations were quite serious, and price increases were rather  swift. After the macroeconomic regulatory and control measures  were implemented, these situations saw a turnaround. With a  turn for the better in the fiscal and banking order, inflation,  which had been quite serious for a time, is controlled. It  should be said that the current economic situation is developing  in a good direction.    [JINGJI RIBAO] Could you please be more specific about the  signals showing that development is proceeding in a positive  direction?    [Qiu] I think that this is reflected in the following areas:    First, the state economy has seen a change from a situation  of excessively fast growth to appropriate growth. In the first  quarter of this year, GDP was 862 billion yuan, growth of 12.7  percent compared with the same period in the previous year. If  we take into account the seasonal influence, whereby the  agricultural proportion was quite low (8 percent) and the  industrial proportion was quite high, growth over the year will  convert to about 10 percent. This shows that the current speed  of economic growth is being kept within the anticipated  macroeconomically controlled range of 9 to 10 percent.    Second, seen from the industrial situation, the development  trend is positive. From January to April this year, growth in  industrial added value was maintained at between 16 and 18  percent, and the major fluctuations experienced at the beginning  of last year did not occur. This speed of development is ideal  if we are to maintain a 9-10 percent rate of growth in the  overall economy.    Seen from the structure of industrial growth since the  beginning of this year, there have been some positive changes.  This has been reflected in the product mix, with sustained and  stable growth being seen in the production of energy, major raw  and semi-finished materials, and materials for agricultural use.  The production of consumer products which have ready markets,  such as electrical appliances and foodstuffs, has seen quite  swift growth. The growth in production of investment goods has  been controlled. In terms of the regional structure, high-speed  growth has been maintained in the southeastern coastal areas and  the Chang Jiang Delta area, while growth has accelerated each  month in the western regions. In terms of the ownership  structure, at the same time as speedy growth has been maintained  in the nonstate-owned economy, production by state-owned  enterprises has also seen monthly growth. Calculated on a  comparable basis, over the period from January to April,  production by state-owned enterprises was 4.7 percent up  compared with the same period last year, and in April growth was  5 percent. It is predicted that May's growth will be even  higher.    At the same time, the performance of industrial enterprises,  and, in particular, state-owned enterprises, has improved each  month. In the first quarter of the year, the sales revenue of  state-owned enterprises was up 7.8 percent compared with the  same period last year. In April, growth was 8.3 percent. The  production-sales ratios over the four months from January to  April were 89 percent, 91 percent, 94 percent, and 94 percent,  respectively.    Profits of state-owned enterprises also saw a gradual turn  for the better. The performance of many state-owned  enterprises, based on comparable figures, saw an improvement  compared to the same period of the previous year, and, even when  assessed using the new method of calculation adopted this year,  there has also been a continued turn for the better. For  example, in accordance with the new method of calculation, in  the first quarter of this year, profits and taxes realized by  state-owned enterprises grew 16.3 percent compared with the same  period last year. In April, growth was 37.7 percent. In this  figure, profits in the first quarter fell 42.4 percent compared  with the same period last year. However, in April there was a  profits growth of 7.7 percent compared to the same period last  year. At the same time, the proportion of enterprise losses as  compared to enterprise profits also saw a clear decline compared  with the same period last year.    Third, the trend toward excessively swift growth in  investment has been controlled and there has been an obvious  drop in the rate of growth. The supply-demand relationship in  the domestic market has seen marked improvement.    Fourth, agricultural production has seen a warming.    Fifth, the financial situation has seen a change from the  quite grim circumstances in the first quarter to basic normality  this year [sentence as published]. The wild collection of  funds, the arbitrary establishment of banking organs, the dip in  residents' savings, and the payment difficulties situation seen  in many banks has been greatly improved. Since the last half of  last year, residents' savings have grown stably again, there has  been a marked improvement in the banking order, and the payments  capacity of the banks has been strengthened. This has  guaranteed the needs of current economic development and reform  and opening up.    Sixth, the fiscal situation has seen a turn for the  better, fiscal revenue has grown steadily, and revenue and  expenditures are basically balanced.    Seventh, the international balance of payments situation has  seen a turn for the better, exports have seen quite swift  growth, and in April, export growth exceeded import growth for  the first time since September 1992. Foreign exchange reserves  have grown, and in April foreign exchange reserves were $8  billion up on the figure at the beginning of the year.    Eighth, the people's standard of living has been improved  and  the income of many people has grown. In the last four months,  the growth in the livelihood income of urban residents has been  higher than the 10 percent rise in prices. Incomes of rural  residents have also grown markedly. In the first quarter, if we  exclude price increase factors, they grew 14 percent compared to  the same period last year.    The above positive changes show that since the second half  of  last year, the series of measures implemented by the party  Central Committee and the State Council in order to carry out  macroeconomic regulation and control and deepen reform have been  correct and have already realized obvious achievements.    [JINGJI RIBAO] If we are to maintain the fine situation seen  in economic development at present, what aspects do we need to  continue to pay attention to?    [Qiu] My personal opinion is that, at present, the major  question we need to pay attention to is prices. Since the  beginning of this year, while the trend toward inflation has  been controlled, market prices have grown quite quickly.    Since the end of last year, due to the influence of various  factors and because of the delayed effects of overheating and  the chaos which has occurred in various aspects of economic  life, market prices have experienced a situation of strong  increases. From November last year to February this year, the  monthly national retail price index grew at an average of 3.4  percent. From March onward, as governments at various levels  adopted measures to hold prices down, the trend of rapid  increase was controlled. In March, the monthly index growth  rate fell to 0.9 percent, while in April it was 1.3 percent.  However, seen from the monthly index growth, the level of  prices is still somewhat high. From January to April national  retail prices were up 20 percent compared with the same period  last year, and while price rises were controlled in March and  April in medium-sized and large cities, the price rise situation  was still quite strong in rural areas and some small cities.  Seen in terms of commodity types, those products which saw the  greatest increases were mainly centered on those commodities  needed in daily life. Thus, they had quite a strong impact on  low-income households.    Second, it is worth pointing out that market restraints have  become increasingly prominent. Since the beginning of this  year, domestic markets in some spheres have seen the beginnings  of cooling down through stability. From January to April, real  growth in national retail sales, after excluding price factors,  was 4.2 percent. This was 3 to 4 percentage points lower than  in a normal year. The production-sales ratio for industrial  products was 92.2 percent, nearly 4 percentage points lower than  normal. The volume of means of production traded also declined.  Although this trend is very beneficial to structural  readjustment, in the short term it will probably be accompanied  by some negative effects on the economic cycle.    In addition, some deep, structural contradictions which  affect the bringing into play of the vigor of state-owned  enterprises have not yet been eliminated, and some state-owned  enterprises are still in serious difficulties. The scale of  fixed-asset investment in projects under construction is still  quite great, and some disadvantageous factors in agricultural  production have still not been completely eliminated. These are  all disadvantageous elements which affect the fine cycle of the  economy.    Seen from the deep level, we can recognize that the problems  which exist in economic life were not formed overnight. Thus,  the resolution of the problems cannot be completely achieved  within a short period. Macroeconomic regulation and control in  the earlier period only resolved the superficial effects of the  problems. Also, the various reform measures implemented this  year have not been in place for a long time. Thus, if we want  the economy to enter a fine cycle, we need to continue to make  great efforts.    [JINGJI RIBAO] In response to the new changes in current  economic life, what new policies should we adopt?    [Qiu] In terms of the macroeconomy, the new changes which  have appeared in economic life at present are mainly changes,  whereby the resource restraints of an earlier period--restraints  in terms of energy, raw resources and transport--have been  changed into market restraints. That is to say, whether or a  not a product has a market has become an important factor in  whether an enterprise's production operations are good or bad.  This change was due to the control of the transitional,  speculative, short-term demand of the earlier period and to  contradictions where products were not suited to the market or  were unable to keep up with market changes becoming increasingly  prominent. To a certain degree this reflected the fact that  attempts to optimize the deployment of resources lagged behind  the development of the situation.    The appearance of this situation required, at the same time  as deepening reform, a further improvement of macroeconomic  regulation and control. That is to say, there is a need to  switch from mainly controlling overall volumes to considering  both control of overall volumes and structural readjustment, and  a switch from mainly considering the macroeconomy to taking both  macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations into account.  Regulatory and control measures must be shifted from mainly  monetary policies to those where both monetary and fiscal  policies are utilized. As for the targets of regulation and  control, we must switch from mainly short-term targets to the  consideration of both short-term and long-term targets.  Short-term targets refers to stabilizing prices and controlling  inflation. Long-term targets refers to the healthy and  sustained development of the economy. As to what is  specifically needed at present, first, we must ensure that  fixed-assets investment is maintained at an appropriate scale  and that the investment structure is rational. Second, we need  to implement various agricultural policies and strive to achieve  a good harvest.</p>

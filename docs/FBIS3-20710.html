			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 28 January issue of the Ljubljana  daily DELO carries on page 6 a report by "Correspondent" Zdravko  Latal titled "Silajdzic Severely Criticized" based on a  one-page-long article published in the Bosnian paper BOSNJACKI  AVAZ and written by that paper's director and owner, Fahrudin  Radoncic.    According to the DELO article, Radoncic accuses Haris  Silajdzic of having failed to "establish Bosnia-Herzegovina  diplomacy" while he was foreign minister in the Bosnian  Government and questions his qualifications for his current post  of prime minister, since "he has no background in economics."  Radoncic claims that Silajdzic's government has done nothing to  improve living conditions, which he describes as its most  important task other than defense. According to Radoncic,  Silajdzic still prefers the "diplomatic salon life" to solving  the everyday problems of survival in Sarajevo and the "free  territories."    As reported in DELO, Radoncic also disparages Silajdzic's  education (a religious school in Sarajevo, a theological school  in Libya, and a doctorate from the Pristina University), and his  work experiences (a translator for Belgrade businesses in Libya,  a chief of cabinet a former reis-ul-ulema). As for Silajdzic's  private life, DELO writes, Radoncic disapproves of the fact that  Silajdzic's family has been sent to live safely in Turkey, while  his sister was appointed ambassador to Turkey and later to  Pakistan. Silajdzic himself, DELO cites Radoncic as writing, has  never visited the front lines or liberated areas, and he tries  to "overshadow" President Alija Izetbegovic.    DELO correspondent Latal comments that while some of this  criticism is not new, it is "most specific and severe." The  logical question, Latal observes, is who stands behind BOSNJACKI  AVAZ and Radoncic.    According to some sources, Latal reports, Radoncic's  supporters can be found among older Party of Democratic Action  members or the party hardliners who favored Dr. Edib Bukvic for  the post of prime minister and also opposed three new members of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency: Kljuic, Komsic, and, in  particular, Durakovic.    Other sources, Latal states, claim that both Silajdzic and  BOSNJACKI AVAZ are supported by foreign powers. Latal cites Dr.  Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, as a  supporter of BOSNJACKI AVAZ and another plausible source of the  criticism of Silajdzic. Ganic first publicly attacked Prime  Minister Silajdzic for the "lack of a government program." He  then denounced the Geneva Declaration as a "continuation of the  Karadjordjevo agreement" between Presidents Milosevic and  Tudjman. Latal notes that Silajdzic, on the other hand, had  assessed the Geneva Declaration positively, saying that it could  lead to "mutual recognition."    But most people believe, Latal concludes, that BOSNJACKI  AVAZ  is supported by Sefer Halilovic, former Bosnia-Herzegovina army  chief and "the strong Sandzak lobby." Radoncic and Halilovic are  both from Sandzak. Radoncic used to be Halilovic's spokesman  before Silajdzic, as prime minister, purged the army of all  commanders involved in war crimes and other criminal activities.  Latal cites rumors that Halilovic will be rehabilitated soon and  receive the rank of general.    According to DELO, Silajdzic has yet to prove himself. Among  other things, he is being attacked in Sarajevo for his "futile"  meetings with Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska  assembly.</p>

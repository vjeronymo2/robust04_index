			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 15 April reports the  following combat situation in the republic:    "The situation is so bad that it cannot get worse. This  would, in short, be the description of the tragic events in  Gorazde yesterday and this morning," correspondent Enes Musovic  reports from this town. "The chetniks are charging on all  defense lines around Gorazde increasingly more intensively and  (?frantically). The UN Security Council resolution by which  Gorazde was proclaimed a safe haven is truly tragicomic."  Instead of pity and "moral support of the international  community," as Musovic continues, "Gorazde needs immediate and  concrete help now to stop the chetniks in their onslaught on  Gorazde." He says that "the latest reports suggest that 21  people have died while 62 civilians have been injured in Gorazde  in the last 24 hours alone. Last night and this morning, the  situation has been extremely difficult in (?Zabina), which is  being pounded by the chetniks from Cajnice from all available  arms."    Hamiz Deronjic, correspondent from "the Brcko free  territory," reports that "fierce offensive of Karadzic's Serbs  on the free Brcko territory continues. Ferocious tank-infantry  attacks, supported by all types of artillery arms, at the  positions of the 108th Motorized Brigade and 108th Infantry  Brigade have lasted until late last night. The biggest battles  were fought on Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-[place-name indistinct]  line." He reports that the fighters of the 108th Motorized  Brigade at 1830 last night destroyed another aggressor's T-34  tank with its crew in the region of Omerbegovaca." As he says,  "parallel to the attacks on the first defense lines, the  artillery of the Serbian aggressor has been shelling the  civilian targets on the free Brcko territory. Despite the fact  that he is suffering enormous losses in manpower and military  hardware, the enemy is intensifying the offensive against the  free territory." Deronjic also reports the arrival of fresh  Serbian forces and military hardware and their concentration  along the front lines. "Fierce attacks of the Chetnik infantry,  tanks, and artillery in the area of (?Boderiste) have been  underway since 0700," Deronjic says, "and at the moment of  sending this dispatch the attacks of the chetnik forces are  spreading to the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line."    As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac, "through private  radio  Velkaton, the members of Abdic's war headquarters have announced  another offensive against the free territory of the Bihac  district, which they have been [words indistinct] carrying our  together with the chetniks and [words indistinct] of the Serbian  Autonomous Region of Krajina."</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PORT REJECTS KING'S NAME ON S.D. CENTER  </P> <P> An 18-month effort to rename the city's bayfront convention center for the Rev.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ended Tuesday when the San Diego Unified Port  District commissioners rejected the City Council's request to do so.  </P> <P> In an anti-climactic, 4-3 decision, Commissioners Daniel Larsen, Raymond Burk,  Milford Portwood and Robert Penner voted to support Burk's motion to retain the  name San Diego Convention Center, established in a 1985 contract between the  city and the Port District. Commissioners Louis Wolfsheimer, William Rick and  Delton Reopelle, who supported the council-backed name of San Diego Martin  Luther King Convention Center, voted against the proposal.  </P> <P> The decision was the second repudiation of a San Diego tribute to the slain  civil rights leader in less than two years. In a referendum in November, 1987,  voters reversed a council decision to rename Market Street as Martin Luther  King Jr. Way, reinstating the downtown thoroughfare's original name.  </P> <P> Leaders of the drive to honor King vowed to pursue the racially and politically  sensitive issue, which has divided the city and dogged public officials since  the City Council's decision in April, 1986, to rename Market Street.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Is Not Over  </P> <P> Wes Pratt, the lone black on the council and a leader of the King tribute  effort, said the city still must find a suitable memorial to King and promised  to press for renewed council action.  </P> <P> "San Diego has to come to grips with its ethnic diversity at some point in  time," Pratt said after the commissioners' vote, held at a special meeting in  the Holiday Inn Embarcadero ballroom.  </P> <P> But a weary-sounding Mayor Maureen O'Connor said it was too soon to decide  whether to place the issue before the council again.  </P> <P> "At this point, I'm not prepared to say which way we'd go," O'Connor said in an  interview. "I mean, really, we've tried this every which way, and we seem to be  running into a dead end.  </P> <P> "At this point, it appears to be difficult to find a solution that would  satisfy a majority," O'Connor added.  </P> <P> The Rev. George Stevens, who has led an unsuccessful boycott of the convention  center since the port commissioners dodged the name issue in February, will  hold a public meeting Thursday night to discuss the King tribute campaign.  </P> <P> Pratt, however, said a boycott clearly will not work. The $160-million bayfront  facility, scheduled to open in November, has conventions scheduled through the  end of the 1990s.  </P> <P> Jim Jacobson, a coordinator of the Martin Luther King Tribute Coalition, said  members of the group also will meet to review options. Lacking the money for an  initiative campaign, he called for the council to put the matter on the ballot.  </P> <P> O'Connor virtually ruled out that tactic, saying a victory in such a referendum  would not be binding on the commissioners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Efforts Lagging  </P> <P> In the meantime, a privately backed effort to build a statue or other King  memorial in Balboa Park and establish a scholarship fund in his name also is  languishing. William Nelson, chairman of the 18-month-old Martin Luther King  Memorial Committee, said his group has raised $150,000 of the $750,000 it  needs.  </P> <P> "I would say it's stalled," said David Twomey, assistant director of the city's  Park and Recreation Department.  </P> <P> City Council renewed the King tribute controversy two months after the Market  Street referendum by appointing a 21-member committee to suggest an alternative  memorial to King, who was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.  </P> <P> After holding hearings throughout the city, that panel selected the convention  center. The council backed the choice in a 7-2 vote Jan. 11, but the Port  District skirted the issue in a Feb. 21 vote. By an identical 4-3 vote,  commissioners instead suggested making King the first inductee in an "avenue of  honors" that would be established on the center's terrace.  </P> <P> The question remained in limbo for two months until Wolfsheimer, Port District  chairman, acceded to an April 25 request from O'Connor that the commissioners  take a stand on renaming the convention center. The council has not addressed  the "avenue of honors" proposal.  </P> <P> Larsen, whose vote contradicted his Jan. 17 public promise to support the King  tribute, was the only commissioner to speak on the matter Tuesday.  </P> <P> Claiming that "this is a matter of pride that San Diegans have in their city,"  he said, "I am convinced after all this testimony that the vast majority in the  community wants to retain the name 'San Diego Convention Center.' " The remark  brought cries of "Prove it!" from King supporters in the crowd of about 200 at  the hotel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Avalanche of Letters'  </P> <P> In an interview after the vote, Larsen said he made the Jan. 17 commitment at a  council meeting "before the two public hearings we had, before the avalanche of  letters and calls and communications from the community" in favor of retaining  the generic name.  </P> <P> With all seven commissioners having stated their positions publicly during the  past several months, the atmosphere at Tuesday's meeting was more subdued than  the emotional Feb. 21 hearing.  </P> <P> Pratt asked the commissioners to remember King's ideals by honoring him with  the name change.  </P> <P> "Situations like these attest to our inability, our lack of desire to deal with  the question of race relations in a pluralistic city," he said. "Our refusal  allows the baser side of ourselves to hold on to prejudice, bias, racism,  insensitivity, and to vent it when it's publicly perceived appropriate to do  so."  </P> <P> But opponents of the name change continued to stress that the convention center  name is a crucial selling point in convention marketing efforts.  </P> <P> "The issue is, and rightfully should be, the economics of the San Diego  Convention Center and its impact on this community, the jobs to be provided and  the name recognition," said Robert Pruett, leader of the main opposition group.  "We are selling San Diego and creating a greater economic base by which all San  Diegans will benefit. Those who have booked conventions have booked the San  Diego Convention Center."  </P></p>

Implementation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the CWA, the states have a primary role in developing measures implementing water quality criteria. EPA expects that the State Board would implement these salinity criteria by making appropriate revisions to operational requirements included in water rights permits issued by the State Board. Consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA, the State Board has full discretion in determining the source of water flows necessary to meet these criteria. EPA has intentionally drafted its proposed criteria to be measured at or downstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. This allows the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a mix of flow conditions and export restrictions in both river basins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the State Board has full discretion to develop an implementation plan for these criteria in the manner it chooses, EPA and the other federal agencies involved in water resource management issues in the Bay/Delta (USFWS, NMFS, and USBR) urge the State Board to spread the burden across as broad a spectrum of water users as possible. The economic analysis prepared in conjunction with this proposal suggests that spreading the burden results in substantially lower costs than does imposing the burden on a particular geographical area or a narrowly defined group of water users. This is not just a matter of fairness. The federal agencies' preliminary discussions with water project managers indicated that increasing the pool of contributors substantially increases the operational flexibility of the water system, and thereby reduces the total impact of meeting the proposed criteria. For that reason, the federal agencies hope the State Board will continue the concept it adopted in its proposal for D&hyph;1630, and will allocate the burden of meeting these criteria across the broad range of the state's water users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Fish Migration and Cold-Water Habitat Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's designated uses for the Bay/Delta include Cold Freshwater Habitat to sustain aquatic resources associated with a coldwater environment, and Fish Migration to protect those fish which migrate through the estuary. The migratory fish species associated with the cold-water environment in the Bay/Delta are chinook salmon ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus tshawytscha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and steelhead trout ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus mykiss <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently there are four distinct populations of salmon in the Sacramento/San Joaquin river systems, each named for the season of their migration upstream as adults. The fall-run population is now the most numerous; in recent years, typically 90 percent of all Central Valley spawners are fall-run fish. Increased hatchery production of fall-run fish has resulted in stable spawning returns of fall-run fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the Sacramento River; however, wild fall-run chinook abundance is low and is decreasing. The Sacramento River system still supports small winter-run, spring-run and late fall-run populations, but these populations have all declined dramatically in recent years (USFWS 1992a, WRINT&hyph;USFWS&hyph;7). The winter-run population is now listed as threatened under the ESA. The spring-run population has recently reached low enough levels to be recognized as a species of special concern by the State of California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steelhead trout are also cold-water migratory fish within the Sacramento River System. They have suffered a 90 percent decline since the late 1960's, and are supported largely by hatchery production (CDFG 1992a, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

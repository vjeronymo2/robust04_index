			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the </F> Supreme Council of Crimea, by A. Sergeyev; place and date not  given: "Parliament's Potential Will Be Realized"]    [Text] [Sergeyev] Viktor Petrovich, you were a member of  the previous Supreme Council and have now become deputy  chairman. Is it possible maybe six weeks since the start of  business to evaluate the degree of readiness for work of the  present deputies?    [Mezhak] It is quite high, in my view. It can be seen even  now that it is not a "pocket" parliament, as some critics had  predicted it would be. A polarity of views on many political  issues may be traced distinctly. On the other hand, the deputies  find a common language perfectly well when socioeconomic  problems are tackled and are exacting toward the government and  see as its main role Crimea's extrication from the crisis and an  enhancement of the living standard of each Crimean.    [Sergeyev] Your last observation does not coincide very well  with the topic of conversation during the Presidium sitting,  when the program of targeted subsidies was rejected.    [Mezhak] Such a view (it is being disseminated by various  news media, unfortunately) is fundamentally mistaken. Neither  the Presidium nor the deputies at the session under any  circumstances rejected the principle of targeted subsidies for  the needy, which could today help to a considerable extent both  a stabilization of the economy and the preservation of funds in  the Crimean budget. The Presidium sitting proposed, on the  contrary, support for a program of targeted subsidies and the  corresponding amendments to the budget.    But, a program!    And when no one from the government could intelligibly  explain how the idea would be realized, when findings of the  specialists whom it would concern are lacking, and when it is  unclear where the funds for the preferential payment of targeted  subsidies would come from, what is there to support? The Supreme  Council not only is not opposed, it aspires to work and examine  all necessary innovations of the government. But in six weeks  the government has, strictly speaking, not once availed itself  of its right of legislative initiative. On the other hand, it  conferred, under the cover of the Supreme Council, the right, in  fact, to raise the price of bread.... The electorate would not  understand us and would be right.    And neither party nor geographical nor departmental  sympathies or antipathies have anything to do with it here. A  most important task of the legislature is to guard the interests  of the electorate. And no deputy, I am sure of this, understands  it as a desire to prevent the executive from working. But  reforms, even the least reforms, need to be implemented more  visibly. Which is what we are trying to ensure.    [Sergeyev] Many of the news media have reported the huge  privileges specified by the law of the Republic of Crimea  "Status of the Deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea" that was  adopted recently. What is the truth here?    [Mezhak] The truth is that the deputies should have an  opportunity to function normally. I have not encountered in a  single newspaper a comparison of what you termed privileges for  the Crimean deputies with the corresponding Ukrainian, Russian,  Tatar, or other laws. But should we seriously be discussing the  problem of whether the deputy should be running to the telephone  booth to get through to a government official that has bogged  down a voter's problem in bureaucracy? I would very much like to  read in a newspaper or hear on the radio a competent, balanced  evaluation of the law, not a desire to play in populist fashion  on the morbid strings of the Crimeans.    Our deputies currently have one privilege--working by the  sweat of their brow. But unless provision is made for the  realization of this privilege, the people of Crimea will be the  loser. So, if I were a journalist, I would take a look at this  problem from this side as well.</p>

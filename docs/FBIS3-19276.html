Sweden's contribution to the EU's research program will eat up  more than half of the National Environmental Protection Board's  appropriation for environmental research here at home.    This is what Erik Fellenius, head of research at the  National  Environmental Protection Board (SNV), says. He believes that  the government should distribute the EU payment to more Swedish  authorities and research councils that finance research on the  environment.  <H5>  Increased Influence </H5>   In 1992, when Rolf Annerberg, the general director of the  National Environmental Protection Board, turned his  environmental research study in to the government, SNV warned  that national environmental research goals could not be achieved  within the budget framework that the government set at that time  for environmental research.    Two years ago, 20 million from SNV's budget went to the EU  research program "Environment." In fiscal year 1995-96, between  70 and 100 million kronor from of SNV's total purse of 155  million will go to research projects decided upon by the EU.    "Even if we get increased influence over the EU's research  program, we cannot be sure that Sweden's special research needs  will be satisfied. At issue are research on acidification, the  salmon disease M74, and other things. The research program that  we need to form a basis for arguments in international  environmental negotiations is in danger of suffering serious  reductions," says Erik Fellenius.  <H5>  Spread the Contribution </H5>   He believes the government should distribute the EU  contribution to more Swedish financiers, for example the  Business and Technical Development Board (Nutek), the Science  Research Council, and the Forestry and Agricultural Research  Council.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Property: When tiny is best SMALL FLATS in London are a delicate barometer of first-time buyers' activity. According to Stern Studios, they also reveal some curious sub-markets. Stern deals exclusively in one-bedroom and studio flats, which have a much more rapid turnover than average owner-occupied properties. Director Tom Trudgian believes that the 'generally-accepted view that prices have fallen by 25 per cent since 1988 is an under-estimate.' Examples of studio flats on offer at one-third less than their 1988 sale price now seem nearer the mark. Because most people must now pay the community charge (or poll tax) as individuals, rather than collectively as with the old rating system, the use of a pied-a-terre for family purposes has become less economic and interest in that area of the small-flat market has declined seriously (although Stern notes that a number of business buyers are opting for a flat rather than a small office to use as a base, one reason being that poll tax is cheaper than the unified business rate). It is only among the tiniest properties that Stern finds a steady demand, though. By 'tiniest,' think of a property of less than 100 sq feet, with no kitchen and (probably) limited bathroom facilities. Stern calls these 'broom cupboards'; often, they are partitioned out of a larger old property. (None would get win planning permission as an individual home and, normally, they cannot be mortgaged). So why is there active demand to pay between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000 for them? British Rail's erratic services seem to be one reason. Otherwise, Stern says buyers want this kind of property in order to have a 'love nest'; to qualify for a resident's parking permit; as an accommodation or business address; to rent out; or as a straightforward investment.</p>

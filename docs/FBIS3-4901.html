"We are not obligated to show the country schedule to the  U.S. side, and we have not done so," a ministry official said.  The vernacular daily KUNGMIN ILBO quoted Economic Planning Board  and Agriculture Ministry officials as saying that the country  schedule was given to the United States even before it was  revealed domestically. Seoul had waited to reveal the schedule  to GATT headquarters until after the major trade negotiators --  the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union --  handed in their plans.    Officials here were analyzing the U.S. country schedule and  initially agreed that revision of the original draft was  unnecessary. They said Seoul may present its schedule as early  as Thursday.</p>

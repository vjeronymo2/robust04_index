			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Green profits A Japanese delegation visited a new steelworks in the north of England. It was losing money. The visitors made money using the same machinery in Japan. Asked for advice, they came up with 57 nit-picking suggestions. For example, the British opened their furnace doors to provide an 18-inch gap through which to shoot finished rods; for the same process the Japanese opened their doors only six inches. The saving on heat loss was measurable, and contributed to the profits earned by the Japanese company. This story was told by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, last week. His lecture is one of the most effective pieces of sales talk for a hard-headed environmental policy I have seen from any British minister - and I do not forget Mrs Margaret Thatcher's stirring words about how all we have of the earth is a life tenancy, with a full repairing lease. Mr Heseltine does not preach green virtue. There is a paucity of phrases about saving the planet. Instead there was a large dose of Heseltiniana ('what we need is . . . a green renaissance of Britain's economy'), spiced with juicy vistas of multibillions to be made from clean-ups and the production of greener goods. 'Where there's muck there's brass,' the secretary of state reminded his audience, quoting an estimate that Pounds 850bn will be spent in the European Community between now and 2000 on new capital equipment, environmentally-friendly products and associated services. The British share would be Pounds 140bn. In his characteristically self-effacing way he has posted copies of the speech to 1,000 chief executives and asked them to join a 'green club'. It is customary to question Mr Heseltine's motives. I do not think that in this address he was primarily concerned with chasing votes for the Conservative party. His belief is that public concern for the environment wanes during a recession, when unemployment and the like seem more pressing. His speech, with its touches about Europe and partnership with industry, contains an unspoken element of 'this is what you would have had if I had been prime minister instead of John Major', but only enough to assuage a modicum of vanity, nothing threatening or out of line. After all, he joined forces with his ideological opposite - the industry secretary, Mr Peter Lilley - to make Mr John Collins, Shell UK's chairman, head of a 23-member advisory committee on business and the environment. So let us take Mr Heseltine's words at face value. If they favour regulation, or the setting of standards, they do so on the basis of the argument that the country with the highest standards will be the one with the German cars emit the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No. 5 most competitive manufacturers. We all know, or should, the story of how the Germans have made their cars exhaust the waste-gas equivalent of Chanel No. 5, with other car makers having to follow. Consumers, and regulators, demand it. This beady-eyed approach is to be found in a new book, Costing The Earth, by Frances Cairncross, environment editor of The Economist newspaper. Ms Cairncross provides a checklist of a dozen suggestions for company chairmen, starting with 'put the most senior person possible in charge of environmental policy'. Her arguments, which are those of a market economist, seek at each point to attempt some measure of the costs as well as the benefits of a particular green policy. Thus she says that it would make sense for African governments to form an ivory cartel, rather than ban the trade in tusks. That would eliminate middlemen, drive up prices - and ensure that the elephant survives to earn future revenue. She refers to botanists who develop non-timber products to demonstrate that rain forests standing can be worth more than rain forests destroyed. Among the many sources quoted is the Yale economist Professor William Nordhaus, who apparently accepts that the benefits of banning chlorofluorocarbons, responsible for the hole in the ozone layer may outweigh the costs. But the goal of stabilising carbon dioxide output in 2000 at 1990 levels is alleged to be more costly to achieve than would be the benefits of avoiding global warming. Ms Cairncross dutifully records some of the green challenges to the Nordhaus equation, but implies that even if his sums are wrong his methodology has to be addressed. The question is, should it be? 'Ultimately, it is easier to think of environmental issues in terms of ethics than of discount rates,' she writes. 'Most people feel comfortable with the idea that their descendants ought to enjoy the same natural inheritance as they have themselves received.' She manages, nevertheless, to fill 256 pages of recycled paper with merciless analyses of every green proposition. I would not, however, accuse her, or Mr Heseltine, of confusion. Just because you are convinced of the imminence of catastrophe is no reason not to do a few sums. Both the minister and the author accept the precautionary principle - that in case the worst predictions are right it pays to do something now. Both perceive that one practical response to the global upsurge of green sentiment, which Ms Cairncross chronicles, is to use the profit motive as the driving force for change. Freer than any minister, Ms Cairncross can argue forcefully for higher energy prices, even taxes on energy. In short the agenda is no longer controlled by the goodly folk who first brought it to our attention. It is part of everyday discourse, and subject to its rigours. I believe that when the economy picks up, and perhaps another discovery takes us a few notches higher up the curve of fear, the costs of not protecting the future will loom larger, and professor Nordhaus's flawed equations will have to be re-worked. Meanwhile, watch how you open those furnace doors.</p>

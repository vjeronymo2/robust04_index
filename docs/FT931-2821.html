			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Hong Kong greets Patten with a very Asian smile: Simon Holberton samples views on UK row with China AS Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, was laying down the law about Hong Kong in Beijing yesterday afternoon, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, was out and about indulging in what he likes to call 'a little retail therapy'. In the streets of Hong Kong's central business district and the neighbouring Western district of Hong Kong island Mr Patten was greeted by hundreds of Hong Kong citizens. 'Hello, how are you?' he called out. They cheered, laughed and smiled. But the Asian smile is a deceptive thing. To many ordinary Hong Kong citizens the developments of the past few days are perplexing and troubling. Happy as they were to see their governor, many have found his behaviour toward China baffling at best, and unwise at worst. Reaction to Mr Patten's decision last Friday to publish his legislation for more democracy in Hong Kong may have been more than a little conditioned by China's adverse reaction. But then it is Hong Kong which will have to live with its northern neighbour in four year's time. As the owner of a trading firm in Western said yesterday: 'Democracy is an empty word. The British will go after 1997; Mr Patten is just giving Hong Kong people a cheque that will bounce.' His view was echoed by a businessman who had earlier stopped on Hollywood Road, in Central, to catch a glimpse of the governor. 'The British have been sleeping for more than 100 years. Why democracy now? The row is hurting Hong Kong, but what does he have to lose? He will leave.' On Queen's Road Central, Mr Patten found himself accosted by a group of democrats holding a banner proclaiming 'Hear the voice of Hong Kong democracy' and chanting: 'Submit the bill to the Legislative Council; Resume Sino-British Talks; Hear the voice of Hong Kong.' Their chanting, however, summed up the central dilemma for British policy makers and Chinese ones too. Hong Kong wants a number of mutually exclusive things. It wants more democracy, but it wants Britain and China to work it out together; in its almost deferential way it wants to be heard by both, and it wants a quiet life. A lot of middle-class people in Hong Kong have decided that China will not listen and that the colony is not a place where they can enjoy a quiet life. Last year 66,000 of them emigrated, mostly to the US, Canada and Australia, up from 60,000 in 1991. The row is also sapping the optimism of many who thought they had made their peace with China and 1997. The finance director of a large Chinese company, aged in his mid-40s, explained the reaction of many of his friends. 'Over the past couple of years we had all decided to stay. China was moving in the right direction; the Basic Law (the mini-constitution, published in 1990 by Beijing, for Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese sovereignty) wasn't perfect but it was OK. Now, with the way China has reacted to Patten, a lot of my friends are saying they can't take four more years of this. They would rather take their families elsewhere and live a quiet life.' A Hong Kong Chinese lawyer, who had emigrated to Canada but was thinking of returning to live in Hong Kong said: 'Maybe Patten has done us all a favour. He has made China show its true face.' The tone and substance of Mr Lu's remarks in Beijing yesterday make it unlikely that Britain and China will be able to discuss the arrangements for Hong Kong's 1995 elections. That being so, Mr Patten is likely to table his legislation before LegCo's Easter recess or soon thereafter. The betting in Hong Kong's political circles last night was that LegCo will do its best to give China what Beijing failed to extract from the British in negotiations, in short make the legislation less democratic than Mr Patten has proposed. The majority in LegCo for Mr Patten is getting slimmer and the group which wants to hasten slowly to more democracy is getting larger. Britain is prepared to accept LegCo's verdict, but how China would respond is unclear. Beijing has always said it will not accept a 'made in LegCo' compromise to its dispute with Britain. It has maintained that LegCo is simply an 'advisory body' of little consequence and that the 1995 polls are a matter for the current and future sovereign powers. In the meantime, Hong Kong's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 16bn) airport, the development of its container port, and many other business franchises will be put on hold. As Mr Ronald Arculli, a leading member of Hong Kong's conservative politicians, noted last night: 'Maybe they will agree to disagree on politics and continue talks about economic issues, but I think the chances are pretty slim.'</p>

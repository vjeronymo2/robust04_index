			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Management: Innocents abroad - Rethinking Europe / Christopher Lorenz begins a series on changing single market strategies with a look at the Phileas Fogg snack food group Phileas Fogg is supposed to be a seasoned traveller. He certainly trades on that reputation with great success on his British home ground. But the truth is that, while he has a smattering of knowledge about such exotic places as India, China and Mexico, he has almost always stumbled whenever he has crossed the Channel to continental Europe. Fogg laughs about his misadventures, even a recent nightmare in Germany. Behind his genial facade, however, he has grown so fed up with his track record that he has at last employed a proper guide. That, in a nutshell, is the story of how Phileas Fogg - not the man, but the brand of upmarket, exotic snack foods for adults - has failed to achieve its potential in continental Europe over the past decade. It is also why, after rethinking its approach, it is now making up for lost time. The medium-sized company behind the brand, Derwent Valley Foods, is run by a remarkably frank bunch of managers from Medomsley Road, Consett - an address which features, tongue-in-cheek, in their TV advertising. Consett is a former steel-making town on a windy ridge deep in the countryside of north-east England. Derwent Valley has developed impressively at home since its foundation in 1982, especially in its core market of south-east England. It expects total revenue for 1992-93 of Pounds 24m, and profits of above Pounds 2m. Yet barely Pounds lm of its sales are to continental Europe. When, just over four years ago, the Financial Times last examined how Derwent Valley was preparing Fogg for Europe's single market, the company's top managers were open about their past failings. One of them described their then desultory export efforts as 'a Mickey Mouse operation'. This disarming self-disparagement is typical of the company's style, but was not entirely fair for two reasons. First, its explosive growth in Britain left little management time to cope with the tricky problem of steering Fogg into continental Europe. Second, the company had encountered the same problems which beset most medium-sized would-be exporters of consumer products within Europe: fragmented and sometimes impenetrable national distribution patterns. In most industries these represent a far greater barrier to the creation of a single market than do national and regional differences in consumer preferences. Even when national retail patterns seem superficially similar, the reality is often otherwise. France has a growing number of large chains, but their buying patterns contrast sharply with those in Britain. They are not only more fragmented, but buying groups purchase on behalf of odd combinations of retailers. Even then, says Ray McGhee, Derwent Valley's marketing director, you still have to sell to individual shops, each of which levies a one-off charge for putting your product on its shelves. The company and its new French partner are spending Pounds 200,000 on this in 1992-93. In Germany there is a complex mixture of delicatessens and specialist stores, plus large retail chains. The latter, unlike their British equivalents, have numerous buying points. Under Roger McKechnie, the chairman and managing director, Derwent Valley decided in late-1988 to pause, lick its wounds, and start a thorough research and planning exercise in order to prepare a real attack on the continent. 'We've decided the time has come to do things properly,' he said at the time. It commissioned a consultancy study which, instead of proposing a marketing plan, as expected, 'concluded that we had a lot more preparatory work to do', McKechnie says. Throughout 1989 and 1990 the company and its consultants carried out consumer research. This demonstrated great potential interest in the Phileas Fogg brand. But it also showed that the range of flavours would have to be tailored to each of them. It uncovered, too, a need not just to do each country's packaging in its own language - at an initial cost of Pounds 10,000 a product per country - but also to design a distinctive shape of package to stand out on continental shelves. By this time a decision had been made to concentrate on four markets, with France and Spain the first two main ones. The export drive was still in the hands of McGhee and another of the company's founders, but both were still preoccupied with the UK. Hence the move in 1990 to recruit a 'Mr Europe': Kim Fletcher, an ex-Heinz manager who was operating across western Europe as international marketing manager for a flavours and essences company. His new brief involved two key tasks: fine-tuning Derwent Valley's products, packaging, pricing and presentation for each main market; and finding strong local partners which, unlike many of the company's previous ones, really knew the country and had expertise and muscle in sales and distribution. They also had to be committed to the brand concept, 'rather than just wanting an interesting addition to their product range', says McGhee. This strategy contrasted sharply with the company's previous approach of selling the product wherever and through whomever it could. Fletcher's groundwork bore fruit in 1992 with a quick succession of new deals - each with hand-picked but different types of partner - in the Netherlands, France and Spain. These are doing well and have boosted Derwent Valley's exports to the continental Europe by half in 1992-93. And then there is Germany. Back in late 1988, Derwent Valley thought it had broken its long run of bad experiences with German distributors, and had just signed up a local tobacco manufacturer moving into food brokerage. But, as with other tobacco companies, its sales force failed to break into the food side of supermarkets. The market opportunities in tobacco which arose from the opening of East Germany also distracted it in the midst of a Phileas Fogg test marketing exercise, and Pounds 200,000 of Derwent Valley's investment went down the drain in 1989-90. 'We really had our underpants scorched,' grins McKechnie. 'After that, we weren't in too much of a hurry to go back in.' Last October Derwent Valley finally appointed a new distributor - an experienced operator which sells to delicatessens. On the company's current projections, exports to European countries (including Ireland) will grow from Pounds 1.5m to at least Pounds 13m over the next three years. At best, they could go to almost double that. Whatever the actual outcome, Phileas Fogg does seem at last to be getting into his continental stride.</p>

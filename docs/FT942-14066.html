			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips over concern about interest rates Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday amid concern that the uptrend in interest rates could harm corporate profits, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.11 lower at 3,598.71, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.17 at 441.96. Declining issues led advances, 1,405 to 811, in heavy volume of 362m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 3.50 to 427.60, and the Nasdaq composite lost 7.33 to 705.52. The volatility of prices during the session again revealed an underlying ambivalence among investors about the economic outlook. At the opening shares surged by more 20 points ahead of news of a strong rebound in the housing sector last month. The Commerce Department said that housing starts in March had jumped 12.1 per cent, after an 8 per cent fall the previous month. The data suggested the industry recovered well from February's weather-induced contraction. The US Treasury market reacted calmly to the news. Bond prices improved steadily during the day. By contrast, the equitymarkets had a sudden shift in mood. Investors appeared to be concerned that the surge in interest rates over the lasttwo months would soon begin to harm corporate profitability, despite a strong first quarter. Caterpillar plunged Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 103 7/8 even though its first-quarter performance was outstanding. It posted net income of Dollars 1.89 a share, against 34 cents a year ago. For the second day, Chrysler was punished for failing to outperform expectations for the quarter. It lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 46 after shedding Dollars 2 3/8 the previous session. Fears of an economic slowdown also hurt Ford, which dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 . Some companies were rewarded after showing improvement. Compaq surged nearly Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 after announcing a 95 per cent increase in earnings. Bell Atlantic gained Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 as results came in slightly ahead of forecasts. Canada Share prices fell slightly in moderate trading, extending the Toronto market's losing streak to four straight sessions. The TSE 300 composite index was off 9.14 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 4,105.93, with declines leading advances 440 to 294. Volume fell to 60.83m shares from 75.26m shares yesterday and trading value declined to CDollars 712.7m from CDollars 850.5m. Mexico The stock market's key IPC index finished down 107.44 points, or 5.2 per cent, at 1,957.33 - the third largest decline this year. The dramatic fall was triggered by a surprisingly sharp rise earlier in domestic short-term interest rates, traders said. The 28-day Cete rate was raised by 342 basis points to 18 per cent. The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, said foreign institutions - including banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies - would be allowed to begin operating in Mexico in the second half of 1994.</p>

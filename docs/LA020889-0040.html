			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LUCAS PROVIDES SPARK FOR NORTHRIDGE WOMEN  </P> <P> Paula Lucas has spent much of her two years on the Cal State Northridge women's  basketball team as a seldom-used reserve. But, because of injuries, her role  has grown more important lately.  </P> <P> And so have her contributions.  </P> <P> Lucas scored a game-high 23 points and grabbed six rebounds to lead the Lady  Matadors to an 85-64 victory over Cal State Los Angeles on Tuesday night at  CSUN.  </P> <P> Lucas was 9 of 17 from the field and 5 of 6 from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Julie Arlotto added 20 points and seven rebounds for CSUN, which improved to  16-6, 4-3 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play.  </P> <P> Cal State L. A. (13-10, 4-3) shot 39.1% and committed 25 turnovers. Trisha Maly  led Golden Eagle scorers with 16 points.  </P> <P> Lupe Quintana, a three-time all-conference selection for CSLA, was held to only  two points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Chris Cavalin, CSUN's leading scorer and rebounder, made her first appearance  after missing three games because of a pulled groin muscle. Cavalin scored nine  points and grabbed eight rebounds in 16 minutes.  </P> <P> In other women's games:  </P> <P> Biola 66, Cal Lutheran 47 -- Heidi Griffith scored 17 points, but she received  little support from the rest of her teammates in an NAIA District 3 loss at Cal  Lutheran.  </P> <P> Biola led, 34-26, at halftime and held the Regals (6-14, 4-7 in district play)  to 21 points in the second half.  </P> <P> Biola's Donna Pollema scored a game-high 41 points as her team improved to  6-14, 4-7.  </P> <P> Occidental 71, UC San Diego 67 -- Forward Joelle Orton scored a game-high 22  points to lead Occidental in a nonconference game at Occidental.  </P> <P> Genevieve Wilkinson (11), Sharon Bruner (12) and Jennifer Giller (15) all  scored in double figures for Occidental (5-11).  </P> <P> WOMEN'S TENNIS  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge 9, Chapman 0 -- Northridge, ranked No. 5 in the nation in  Division II, coasted in its season and California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  opener at Chapman. CSUN swept all six singles and all three doubles matches. In  singles, Allison Kincaid (6-0, 6-1), Kalico Yandall (6-3, 6-1) and Brenda  Pantano (6-0, 6-2) won handily.  </P></p>

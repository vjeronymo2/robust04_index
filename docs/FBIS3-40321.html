			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Cebalovic: "When Will the Oil Start Flowing </F> in the Pipeline?"]    [Excerpts] The normalization of relations between  Yugoslavia and Croatia calls for, among other things, the  beginning of the operation of the Omisalj (on the island of  Krk)-Pancevo oil pipeline. Zagreb wished for something like that  to happen earlier, and so did Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia, which used to receive through this pipeline  significant quantities of petroleum that they needed, especially  since the once brotherly USSR route "had dried up."    In spite of a great number of problems that are difficult to  resolve, it is possible for oil to start flowing in the pipeline  as soon as Belgrade and Zagreb agree. However, one should not  forget that 120 km of the pipeline pass through the republic of  Serbian Krajina (RSK), and it is thus clear that the agreement  between Yugoslavia and Croatia is very unlikely to be effective  without the consent of Knin. When we wrote about the pipeline  earlier, Knin repeatedly stated that "the oil can continue to go  to Zagreb only if they return the confiscated Serbian oil and if  they pay for the transit through the RSK." Is Knin going to  maintain this position? If it is, it is very unlikely that the  oil pipeline will start operating very soon.    Everything happened on 6 September 1991, when the official  on  duty at the oil pipeline in Novi Sad recorded the information he  received at 1404 hours from Sisak that, due to damage, the  pipeline had stopped operating. [passage omitted]    Because of this act, 130,000 metric tons of oil intended for  the Pancevo refinery and 82,000 tons for the Novi Sad refinery  remained on Krk. Before the closing of the pipeline, blackmail  had been arriving from Zagreb for several months, and every oil  delivery intended for Serbia was charged a higher tax.  Everything was paid for regularly, together with the transit  costs. Zagreb did not permit even the unloading without proof of  payment.    But they were mistaken in Zagreb when they thought that they  could cut off the delivery of oil to Serbia and deliver it in an  undisturbed manner to the Slovene firm Lendava, to Hungary, and  to former Czechoslovakia. The control valves were in the RSK, in  Banija. The oil, of course stopped coming. [passage omitted]    The story of the pipeline is a long one. It started in 1966.  [passage omitted]. All the accumulated problems continued up to  1991. Nothing has been resolved: who the owners are (Croats say  that they are), how much oil there is in the pipeline and to  whom it belongs, the cost of transport, and who will manage the  facility. Nor has it been established who invested in the  construction of the pipeline and how much. How can now all of  that be resolved?</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Tetra Pak extends offer for Alfa-Laval TETRA Pak, the Swiss liquid packaging concern, is extending its SKr16.25bn (Dollars 2.63bn) bid for Alfa-Laval, the Swedish dairy and food processing equipment company. It is now giving until August 2 instead of May 17 for acceptances. This is necessary due to delays in finalising the acquisition because the European Commission has decided to investigate whether the planned merger was compatible with EC competition rules. Tetra Pak said that a final EC decision is expected not later than July 19 and that it reserves the right to close the acceptance period no sooner than on the tenth business day after EC approval. It said the deal will not be completed until it is satisfied all the conditions for the bid's implementation have been met.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: Optimists read between the lines - Wall Street INVESTORS THIS week got their clearest look yet at the state of the economy and corporate earnings, and seemed to like what they saw - which was surprising, because some of the numbers, at least superficially, were not encouraging. The economic news consisted of the second quarter gross domestic product report, while the earnings results were released by a variety of large industrial companies, including International Business Machines, Ford, General Motors, RJR Nabisco, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Du Pont, Allied Signal and Walt Disney. The raft of data, of course, was entirely historical, covering a period between April and June. Generally, share prices are driven by expectations, so in some respects this week's figures were not especially helpful. Yet, a close eye is always kept on earnings and economic releases because they tell investors whether their past predictions (predictions that are priced into stocks) have been accurate. Judging by their reactions this week - when the Dow set a new high and the important indices held steady or posted gains over the five days - investors believed that the data broadly met their expectations. That can certainly be said for the quarterly reporting season, which has passed so far with few surprises. The same, however, cannot be said for recent economic news, particularly Thursday's gross domestic product report. The government estimates that GDP grew by 1.6 per cent in the latest quarter. It was an improvement on the first quarter growth rate of 0.7 per cent, but it remained disappointingly short of forecasts. The weak growth surprised everyone, including those who really should know what is going on, such as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. Last week, he confidently told Congress that the economy would grow by about 2.5 per cent in the second quarter. Wall Street economists were looking for a slightly slower rate of growth - around 2.2 per cent. It was the second quarter in succession in which growth was well below forecasts. Yet over the last six months stocks have not paid the price of these unfulfilled expectations. Just the opposite, equities have kept edging higher. In normal times, bad news should force investors to drive prices lower until they reflected the new reality of market fundamentals. There are various explanations for this seemingly irrational behaviour. First, investors and most of the professionals on Wall Street are incurable optimists. If they were not, they would not be in the market - pessimists do not buy stocks, they buy bonds. Second, the economy may be struggling, but corporate earnings are improving, thanks to the measures taken by companies at the tail end of the last recession to cut costs, boost efficiency and improve profitability. Although some companies are coming to this process rather late - IBM's managers announced plans for thousands more redundancies and more plant closures this week - most have the bulk of the restructuring out of the way, and many are now reaping the rewards of their actions. Third, even if the fundamentals are not great, there is enough money flowing into equities to keep prices afloat even in all but the most difficult of times. So long as interest rates remain low - and the current sluggish state of the economy should ensure they remain low for a while yet - investors will keep switching their funds out of low-yielding short-term assets into stocks. Finally, economic figures such as the GDP data are rarely what they seem at first glance. Take this latest release, for example. The disappointingly weak headline number masked some positive news, such as 3.8 per cent increase in consumer spending and the low implicit price deflator (a key inflation barometer). Even more encouraging was the role of inventories in the data. The discrepancy between strong consumer spending and weak output was explained by inventories. They had grown so much in the first quarter, that during the second quarter manufacturers were able to keep up with the increase in consumer demand by running down their stockpiles of goods, rather than stepping up production. If inventories are excluded from the GDP numbers, growth in the second quarter would have been a handy 3.7 per cent. It is this kind of thinking that is keeping stocks at their current high levels. If the underlying improvement in the economy is eventually reflected in the headline figures (and, crucially, the jobs numbers), and if companies can sustain the upward momentum in earnings, then the stock markets have a chance of not just breaking new ground, but building on it in the second half of this year.  -------------------------------------------- Monday         3567.70   +    20.96 Tuesday        3565.46   -     2.24 Wednesday      3553.45   -    10.01 Thursday       3567.42   +    13.97 Friday         3539.47   -    27.95  --------------------------------------------</p>

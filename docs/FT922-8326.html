			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (2): Virtuous circle rewarded with public support - Stephen Fidler looks at how inflation has been tamed WHEN President Carlos Menem assumed office, Argentina was in a frenzy of hyperinflation. In that month, July 1989, retail prices rose nearly 200 per cent. At this level, commerce grinds to a halt. Simple transactions become impossible because people have no idea at what price they will be able to replace what they have sold. Hyperinflation threatened again in early 1990. Since then, the inflation trend has been dramatically down. Last year, prices rose 84 per cent, compared with over 1,300 per cent in 1990 and almost 5,000 per cent the year before. This year, inflation will probably be significantly below 20 per cent. For this brief insight into relative economic stability, the Argentine people have been grateful. As voters, they have responded with support for those who back the government's economic programme. As savers, they have begun to bring back capital: they accounted for much of the estimated Dollars 5bn that flowed into Argentina in 1991. As consumers, they have started to spend, encouraged by the emergence of what for Argentines is an unusual service: consumer credit. As a result, while some sectors have suffered, there is no sense of overall economic austerity. Gross domestic product rose some 5-6 per cent last year, with employment rising 3 per cent and industrial production up 20 per cent. This year growth could be higher: perhaps 7-8 per cent, according to Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister. The economy appears to have entered a virtuous cycle. This dates back almost entirely to a law, the brainchild of Mr Cavallo who took office in January 1991, that went into effect on the inauspicious date of April Fool's Day last year. The convertibility law turned the central bank into a currency board. It fixed the Argentine currency to the US dollar and only allows the central bank to issue local currency when backed by inflows of dollars to the central bank. (The dollar was set at 10,000 australs. This January, the government renamed its currency the peso and made one peso the equivalent of USDollars 1.) This law halted the Argentine inflation machine - by which the central bank printed money to cover a budget deficit estimated to have reached 14 per cent of GDP at its worst in mid-1989. It also made it imperative that the budget deficit was kept in check. The government has managed to do this by raising tax revenues, mainly through the imposition of an effective value added tax, and abolishing subsidies to public sector enterprises. The government shrank its overall budget deficit, including privatisation receipts, to 0.6 per cent of GDP last year, and a small surplus is promised for the next two years. A central part of the programme has been the privatisation of the loss-making public enterprises. This was envisaged in a state reform act which passed into law in 1989 and predated Mr Cavallo. The Menem administration also moved quickly to bring down tariffs and abolish almost all quotas on imports, turning Argentina very rapidly from one of the most protected economies on earth to one of the most open. Late last year, the reforms were supplemented by decrees abolishing large swathes of the regulation which has hobbled private enterprise. However, 60 years of state controls have produced a perverse economic system that will take more than a year to dismantle. Mr Cavallo, most of whose team came with him from the economic research group he founded, Fundacion Mediterranea, admits that there is still much to do. According to Mr Juan Llach, planning secretary in the economy ministry, the following are among the priorities: Completing Argentina's dramatic privatisation programme (see separate article), which will remove Dollars 700m annually or 1/2 percentage point of GDP from the budget deficit. Concluding Argentina's deal with foreign bank creditors. The government's aim is to complete the exchange of concessional bonds for loans by November or December this year. While the Brady agreement has been criticised internally for being too generous to the banks - interest payments to commercial banks will roughly double to about Dollars 130m monthly - the country will stop building up interest arrears to the banks. The deal is likely to improve the country's access to foreign capital markets. Winning congressional approval for reform of the social security system, an important contributor to the fiscal deficit. The aim will be to move towards a mixed system, allowing the creation of private pension funds It would also put the state sector on a sounder financial footing. Argentina has a higher proportion of old people than other Latin American countries (apart from Uruguay): as a result its state pension bill has been high. Argentina's monthly pension bill is about Dollars 800m, 7 per cent of GDP, compared with the 1 per cent spent by Mexico. While Argentina's pension system is in balance on a cash basis, old people do not get the pensions they are promised by the state. This builds up every month a notional deficit with pensioners. The ministry wants to lower the entitlement, perhaps to Dollars 150 a month, but to make sure everybody gets this amount. The private pensions, to which everyone under 45 would pay 10 per cent of salary, are also seen as playing an important role in the development of the capital markets, as they have in Chile. Reforming the labour laws. These help contribute to high labour costs in Argentina. Reform has several facets, one of the most important of which is the law on social medicine. This obliges trade unions to provide medical treatment for members. While the system gives access to medical coverage to a large sector of the population, it is seen as costly and inefficient. The idea is for the state to provide a basic health service, but allow people to opt for private medical care, which the vide. The ministry is also seeking to tackle the laws of collective bargaining to allow for a much more decentralised system of wage bargaining. Further tax reform would reduce taxes on labour, which increase labour costs by up to 50 per cent. More changes in the regulatory system. The government will seek further deregulation, for example, by inducing Argentina's 24 provinces to deregulate in areas where they have jurisdiction such as in the setting of professional fees. In other areas, where natural monopolies are being privatised, the state will seek to establish effective regulatory regimes. The efforts by the ministry to establish an overall budget for the government, divided into ministries is also important. In January, Mr cavallo delivered to Congress and secured passage of the first budget since 1953. For some time to come, if the government manages to preserve relatively low inflation, Mr Cavallo's programme should retain his popularity. However, low inflation will not secure eternal gratitude from Argentine voters. There will probably emerge in time dissatisfaction about the ability of the state to provide the social goods such as health and education which fall into its much reduced remit. In the longer term, growth is the key to Argentina's remaining in the virtuous economic circle. Given the financial straitjacket that Mr Cavallo is constructing around the public sector, the key to the long-term success of the programme has to be private sector investment. This is why Mr Cavallo has placed a high priority on normalising relations with foreign creditors and why he wants to abolish the rules that inflate Argentine labour costs. Private investment will depend on the world being convinced that Argentina is a place where investment can be made under fixed and transparent rules: something which cannot be said yet to have been achieved, in part because of a lack of trust in the judicial system. Such investment is also sensitive to economic confidence which can be upset. For the moment, the fixed exchange rate regime has given Argentines confidence to bring their money home. But a clumsy adjustment of that regime could damage confidence badly. It seems almost certain - despite average monthly consumer price inflation of around 2 per cent in the first four months of the year - that Mr Cavallo can maintain the fixed rate for 1992. The picture varies, but many manufacturers say that the combination of tariff reductions and the relatively strong peso has left the cost of imports little changed. The government emphasises too that wholesale price rises are running at much lower levels than retail inflation - an average 0.6 per cent monthly in the first quarter. However, if rises in retail prices lead to upward pressure on wages, then the competitive position of Argentine exporters will be damaged. This will in turn increase the pressure for a devaluation of the exchange rate. The government in the meantime is hoping that deregulation can shake up the services and oligopolistic retail sector, to put downward pressure on retail prices. Meanwhile, the inflows of capital represent a two-edged sword in the inflation fight: they make it easier to continue the exchange rate regime but also cause an expansion in the money supply which puts upward pressure on prices. Most damaging to confidence in the short term would probably be the disappearance from office of Mr Cavallo. He and President Menem are widely reported to have differences, but know they need each other. The economy minister denies suggestions he has ever threatened to resign, and says that any fears that he and the president would part company in a damaging way 'underestimates me and underestimates President Menem.' Mr Cavallo is widely considered to need another 18 months to complete his programme. Another worry is that Mr Menem's assumed wish to stay on another term (impossible under the present constitution) may involve him and the Congress in unnecessary horse trading. The fear is twofold: that the president may bargain away certain parts of the economic programme to secure support for his reelection and that the constitutional changes might saddle the government with unnecessary restrictions on its freedom of manoeuvre.</p>

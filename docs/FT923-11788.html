			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Iranian banks delay trade payments IRANIAN banks, which usually have an exemplary payments record, have been delaying payments on letters of credit for the past three weeks. The delays come at a bad time for Iran, as the UK Export Credits Guarantee Department continues negotiations with the Iranian government aimed at establishing medium-term cover for Iran. The delays result from the loosening of controls by the Bank Markazi, the central bank, which wants to remove itself from the commercial arena. Bank Markazi used to open all letters of credit but it has now transferred this to commercial banks. 'Since Bank Markazi distanced itself from the commercial banks, they have not handled their foreign exchange allocations and cash flows as well as they might,' said a British banker, whose bank undertakes Iranian risk. He said Bank Markazi had clamped down on the numbers of letters of credit being issued. Some of the Iranian banks have taken out interbank loans to ease the problem and Bank Markazi is said to have injected Dollars 400m into the banking system about 10 days ago. Both Iranian and British banks have put the delays down to temporary cash flow problems. One Iranian banker claimed the Iranian commercial banks, which are government-owned and include Bank Melli, Bank Tedjarat and Bank Saderat, had made incorrect income calculations. He said funds had been used to discount one year usance letters of credit without keeping back enough foreign exchange for letters of credit falling due from a year ago. 'These are technical delays which will exist for a few weeks but it is a temporary situation and business is as usual,' said another British bank. Iranian banks are paying interest to letters of credit claimants for the delay. The banks have also come under pressure because Bank Markazi restricted the supply of hard currency in mid-May, leaving the banks to settle outstanding debt by going to the open market. The shortage of foreign exchange stems in part from over-estimates of oil income. The price of oil was expected to remain high after the Gulf war. This year for example, Iran may find itself earning only Dollars 14bn in oil revenues instead of an estimated Dollars 16.6bn. Downpayments on projects drawn up in the five-year development plan have increased the strain on resources. The government is to submit a report soon to the majlis (parliament) when it hopes to say that significant progress has been made on projects in the plan. The weakness of the US dollar and the fact that Iran's main trading partners are Japan and Germany rather than the US have made the import bill more expensive. In addition, Iran has increased its defence expenditure for which it will have had to use hard currency rather than any form of oil barter arrangement. Western banks undertaking Iranian risk have been told the delays will be over by the end of August.</p>

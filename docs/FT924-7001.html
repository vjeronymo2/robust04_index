			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (10): Investment is needed to match rivals - Textiles THE TEXTILE and clothing industry, which is important to Turkey's economy, is entering unpredictable times. It needs investment on a large scale, and the ability to cope with competition at a time when the evolution of the Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) may be in question. The MFA, in turn, depends on what happens next in the global trade liberalisation talks in the Uruguay Round under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). In the event of their failing, existing quotas under the MFA, designed to protect the industries of the richer countries, would remain. Whatever the outcome, Turkey must seek new export markets. Within the manufacturing sector, textiles and clothing contribute 20 per cent to output, and employ around one third of all workers. According to the State Institute of Statistics, the value of the industry's exports has risen steadily, from Dollars 838m in 1980 (28.8 per cent of all commodity exports) to Dollars 4.3bn (31.8 per cent) in 1991. But in order to compete with its main rivals - including China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Pakistan and Bangladesh - something like Dollars 6bn will have to be invested in modernisation over the next five years. This will involve updating weaving and spinning plant. Ninety per cent of spinning machines, for example, are more than 15 years old. Modernisation is needed to offset the gradual rise in Turkish labour costs. At the heart of the problem is the fact that the government has, for political reasons, preferred to invest in (or to subsidise) farmers producing cotton, especially in the main growing regions around Izmir and Adana, rather than in textiles - paying as much as twice world cotton prices. In terms of current political issues, the apparent stalling of the Gatt talks is, in one sense, bringing only partial grief to the Turkish textile industry. On the one hand, there was not enormous satisfaction with the planned 10-year phasing-out agreement of the MFA - theoretically agreed on within the context of a successful Uruguay Round. On the other, the absence of an operative MFA makes Turkey vulnerable to a growth of bilateral agreements and quotas. The Istanbul Textile and Apparel Exporters Association (IKTIB), with its 10,000 members producing something like 80 per cent of exports in the sector, realises this. The sector is not without problems. There is competition from producers in the Asian and far-eastern countries. These low-wage producers and their influence on the world market had the effect of causing lay-offs among the full employment total of about 2m. IKTIB maintains that the competition from these developing countries is unfair, because of government subsidies. Indeed, in a rare case for a developing country towards another, in October 1991, Turkey imposed a 20 per cent anti-dumping tax, due to expire on December 10, on cotton yarn imports from Pakistan. The principal market is the European Community. But here Turkey has run into difficulties, because of accusations of dumping which date back to 1981. Brussels relented to some extent, by announcing in October 1991 that it was dropping countervailing duties on imports of Turkish polyester fibres and yarns, following Ankara's agreement to phase out its subsidy on these textile exports. But in March the EC Council of Ministers imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on cotton yarn of 12.1 per cent, with exceptional duties of between 4.9 and 12.1 per cent for certain companies. The EC, in particular, accused Turkey of dumping cotton yarn on the European market in 1981, and imposed then a 12 per cent tariff. Broadly, IKTIB does not regard EC textile trading policies as fair. Since then, tariff disputes have surfaced periodically. However, in November 1990, as part of Turkey's compensation for applying economic sanctions against Iraq, the US administration agreed to increase the quota for textile imports in 1991 by 50 per cent. The evolution of Turkey's textile and garment industry as one of the major suppliers to the EC has taken place over the last five years. Overall, exports of clothing dominate. From Dollars 314m in 1981, they rose to Dollars 3.2bn last year, representing 69.6 per cent of the Dollars 4.6bn textile and clothing exports. Over the past decade, clothing exports, apart from dips in 1985 and 1986, have experienced substantial growth rates - 13 per cent in 1991. The relationship with the EC, where Germany currently takes 65 per cent of Turkey's textile and clothing exports, is dominant. Three-quarters of textile and clothing exports go to the EC. In 1991, after Germany, Britain, Italy and France took altogether about 10 per cent. The role of Germany in this export pattern reflects the close economic and social relationship between the two countries. According to IKTIB figures, Turkey is the world's seventh largest cotton producer, with the 1991-92 crop, estimated at 2.8m 480 lb bales, accounting for 3 per cent of the world cotton crop. Cotton yarn production has grown steadily since 1967, and subsequently, as a result of government incentives in the early 1970s, at a swifter rate. Yarn production reached 500,000 tonnes in 1987 and has remained at about that level since, amounting to 530,000 tonnes in 1990. Within the total woven textiles industry, cotton woven fabrics have the highest share of production, amounting to 314,000 tonnes in 1990. Turkey also produces all the major commercial synthetic yarns and fibres, with acrylic fibres in the lead, ahead of polyester yarns and fibres and polyamide yarn. Production of these, 215,000 tonnes in 1985 has risen. The US market for textile and clothing exports, which amounted to Dollars 304.4m, or 6.6 per cent, in 1991, is expected to be increasingly difficult if protectionism strengthens. IKTIB takes some satisfaction from its high quality and supply-time response of five weeks for the EC, which it claims the Far East cannot match. But the formation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Mexico and Canada, could make the US market more difficult. Some compensation could come from exports to the neighbouring countries of the former Soviet Union, and to South Africa. Closer production co-operation with Japan could also result in an increase in exports. But growth potential lies more in ready-made garments than with textiles. However, much will depend on government investment policies.  ------------------------------------------------------        TEXTILE AND CLOTHING EXPORTS  ------------------------------------------------------                       Volume                       ('000           Value                       kilos)       (Dollars bn)  ------------------------------------------------------ 1990:  ------------------------------------------------------ Textiles               373.6           1.4 Clothing               184.9           2.9 Total                  558.5           4.3  ------------------------------------------------------ 1991:  ------------------------------------------------------ Textiles               385.8           1.4 Clothing               210.0           3.2 Total                  595.8           4.6  ------------------------------------------------------ 1992 (Jan-July)  ------------------------------------------------------ Textiles               185.3           0.8 Clothing               133.7           2.2 Total                  319.0           3.0  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Industrial Development Bank of Turkey  ------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------                COTTON PRODUCTION AND USE  ------------------------------------------------------                      Production    Capacity                       (tonnes)      use (%)  ------------------------------------------------------ Woven cotton  ------------------------------------------------------ 1985                  254,000        93.4 1986                  259,000        89.6 1987                  282,000        94.3 1988                  290,000        93.2 1989                  307,000        93.8 1990                  314,000        89.0 1991                  302,000        83.2  ------------------------------------------------------ Cotton Yarn  ------------------------------------------------------ 1985                  408,000        90.7 1986                  434,000        86.3 1987                  500,000        91.4 1988                  515,000        90.8 1990                  530,000        79.7 1991*                 484,000        67.9  ------------------------------------------------------ *At end-1991, production capacity was estimated at  713,000 tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: Industrial Development Bank of Turkey  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

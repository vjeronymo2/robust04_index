			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Man in the News: Odd couple with a common cause - Clinton's new 'counsellor' blames partisanship for many of America's problems / David Gergen In the current hot movie, Dave, a rotten, promiscuous president suffers a stroke in flagrante delicto. His administration is saved by his physical double, the eponymous Dave, who normally runs an employment agency and does all the nice and good things the real president eschewed, and by his accountant, Murray, who sorts out the budget deficit in a trice. Nobody in Washington is seriously suggesting that David Gergen, five years older, two inches taller and with a thinner thatch of unstyled hair than Bill Clinton, is being charged with a similar mission, though some comedians have been unable to resist the obvious comparison. But the new 'counsellor' to the president, precise duties still to be determined, would not have been brought on board if the current White House had been steaming smoothly ahead in untroubled waters. Gergen and Clinton are not quite the odd couple they might seem. It is true that, while Clinton was protesting against the Vietnam war, Gergen was going to work for Richard Nixon. Equally, when the former was a firebrand liberal first-term Democratic governor of Arkansas, the latter was Ronald Reagan's communications director, helping to sell those conservative policies that the current president is now intent on reversing. But the two southern boys (Gergen grew up in North Carolina) have grown personally and politically closer over the years. They met regularly at the annual Renaissance weekend, a new year's New Age gathering on the Carolina coast of mostly like-minded politicians, lawyers, academics and journalists. As Clinton, in his later terms in Little Rock, moved towards the middle, so Gergen, never entirely at home among the Reagan ideologues, left government. He became a senior editor and columnist at US News magazine and a commentator on the MacNeil/ Lehrer public affairs programme on public television. His Friday duet with Mark Shields, the literate and witty consultant to the Democratic party, far exceeded in quality of comment the clamorous verdicts of the journalistic kangaroo courts that have come to dominate much political discussion on television. He became, as many media stars now do, much in demand on the speaking circuit, cultivating an ever wider range of political contacts around the country. He also immersed himself in conspicuously non-conservative organisations with an international scope, like the Aspen Institute. The net result of a lot of public talking and writing was the suspicion that his disappointment in George Bush was such last year that he forsook his long allegiance to the Republican party and in the end voted for Bill Clinton. Reflecting either this or the president-elect's promise to reach out to moderate Republicans, he was rumoured in the transition period to be under consideration for a senior administration post, possibly running foreign aid from the state department. Up to a point, he was kind to Clinton this year, too, approving of his initial budget victories and welcoming the new dawn in intelligent government. Even his later criticisms as things began to go wrong were tinged with admiration. While he worried about the president's tendency to tax and spend too freely and even questioned a lack of backbone, he could, in the same paragraph of a US News column on May 24, still describe him as 'one of the most gifted, dedicated men ever to serve in the Oval Office . . . a wonderful head and a big heart'. This article, in retrospect, should be read as an overt appeal to Clinton to return to where Gergen believed the president belonged - in the reformist middle - and less than two weeks later the president was announcing his appointment from the Rose Garden. Gergen fleshed out his reasons for signing up in another interview this week. Complaining about the neglect of American education and of US competitiveness, he told National Public Radio that the root problem was partisanship run riot. 'I think he (Clinton) is someone who is trying to come up with innovative ideas that get beyond the boxes of the 1980s, . . . to define solutions that will draw support and inspiration from both camps. We reek of privilege and power in this city - we've got lots of it - but we refuse to get together and see if we can help define common ground and find some answers. I think people around the country are disgusted with that and I think they have a right to be disgusted with that.' As best as can be defined, Gergen joins the Clinton inner circle that comprises the president, his wife, Mack McLarty, the maligned chief of staff, and Al Gore, the vice-president. He sees his duties as combining political and policy advice together with the public presentation of whatever decisions emerge. George Stephanopolous, doubtless relieved no longer to have to fight the media daily, may be a floating member of the group. ('Only in Washington,' Paul Begala, a Clinton adviser, observed sarcastically, 'is it considered a demotion to spend more time with the president than with the White House press corps.') It may be no accident that Gergen's recruitment coincided with a significant shift back to the centre by the president himself. There were hints of compromises on the budget, especially the energy tax, on deferring an increase in the minimum wage, on the admission of homosexuals into the military, trade with China, and, most painfully for Mr Clinton, the withdrawal of the nomination to the justice department of an old friend, Lani Guinier, because, as he conceded on Thursday night, 'I cannot fight a battle that I know is divisive . . . if I do not believe in the ground of the battle'. If this was a retreat from the left, it was conducted with several guns blazing. In a Milwaukee speech, the president stuck to the argument that his approach to the budget was right and that the complexities and basic fairness of his programme were misunderstood or not grasped at all, thanks to a combination of muddled White House messages and a wilfully perfidious media. Yet behind the smoke there were the sort of overtures to the Washington establishment, of which more can be expected under Gergen. Two White House dinners this week, for example, included invitations to representatives of the heavy writing press, previously almost ignored. Though the media may have changed, some things do not. The Reagan administration's mastery of television was made possible by some discreet courting of those newspapers from which television still lifts many of its reporting leads and opinions. James Baker, whom Gergen acknowledges as a mentor, spent 12 successful years in Washington employing the same technique. But Gergen's accession, while generally reckoned to be a smart move by the president, did not pass without reservations. The more cynical, who have been writing off the Clinton presidency for weeks with increasing vigour, doubted whether Gergen could work a sea change on either Clinton himself or, as an ageing nominal Republican, on a young, partisan Democratic White House staff. Veterans recalled that the last luminary of the opposition party to be brought in to work miracles was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now the senior Democratic senator from New York, mysteriously hauled in to advise Richard Nixon in 1969 to minimal ultimate effect. 'There is no magic in personnel changes,' intoned Johnny Apple of the New York Times. His newspaper was more disturbed by another aspect of what it called 'Gergenism' - packaging over content - and worried that the new governing ideology is now no longer represented by two political parties with distinct philosophies but by a phenomenon known as inside-ism. In a similar vein, David Shribman in the Boston Globe wrote of 'a political class - a culture all of its own - inscrutable to outsiders . . . and populated with interchangeable political operatives'. If Dave suggested that even presidents were interchangeable so long as they looked alike, another older movie, The Bermuda Triangle, was perhaps more apposite to David Gergen's week. He flew to the island for a short break but, far from disappearing without trace, found himself boating with none other than Ross Perot, who 'expressed pleasure in my new job'. He could, of course, have pushed the pesky Texan populist overboard, but just getting him off Clinton's back would be no mean initial service.</p>

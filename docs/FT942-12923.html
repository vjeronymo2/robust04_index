			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Income rises 16% at Walt Disney Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in second-quarter profits to a record Dollars 248.4m. Growth in income from animated films and consumer products offset disappointing contributions from its live-action films and theme parks. The strong earnings performance - achieved on record revenues of Dollars 2.27bn, up from Dollars 2.03bn - will be a welcome lift for Disney, which has suffered several setbacks recently. These have included the financial crisis at its 49 per cent-owned Euro Disney theme park outside Paris, opposition to its planned Dollars 700m historical theme park in Virginia, and the death in a helicopter accident of Mr Frank Wells, the group's popular and highly-regarded president. Disney said the financial impact of its investment in Euro Disney was not included in the latest quarter's results, which covered the three-month period ending March 31. Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with the growth in earnings from classic and new animated films, which helped boost revenues from the filmed entertainment division 19 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Sales of home videos of The Jungle Book and Bambi, and its newer film The Fox and the Hound, were strong, and compensated for the weak performance of its new live-action films. Revenues from the theme parks and resorts division increased only 3 per cent to Dollars 802.4m. Disney said park attendance fell primarily because of a decline in foreign tourists. The January earthquake in southern California, home of Disneyland, also led to lower attendance. The group's consumer products division reported 15 per cent growth in revenues to Dollars 368.8m, due to the continued strength of the European and Asian licensing and publishing businesses. A deal to restructure Euro Disney's debt is being reviewed by the theme park's lenders, under which Disney will inject another Dollars 750m capital. Last year, Disney took a Dollars 350m write-down to cover its investment in Euro Disney. Disney shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

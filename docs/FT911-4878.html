			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / IBM studies new telecom network INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer company, is considering establishing a pan-European telecommunications network based on a novel satellite technology. It has retained Hyperion, a UK-based information technology consultancy, to help with a feasibility study. If IBM decides to go ahead, it could create a substantial new market for a telecommunications service which has so far failed to realise its potential in Europe. It would also force IBM's competitors in the computer industry to follow suit or risk losing market share. The satellite system - very small aperture terminal or VSAT - is already big business in the US. With the relaxation of Europe's regulatory environment, it has become increasingly possible to establish a VSAT network but so far no organisation has taken the initiative.</p>

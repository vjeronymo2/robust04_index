			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Japan's finance minister may insist that his rapidly-unveiled package of economic measures was not a response to the further fall in Japanese equities, but the markets believe otherwise. Tuesday's fall was precipitated by the current twin obsessions of Japanese investors: falling earnings and the parlous state of the financial system. Mr Hata's remarks only underline the seriousness of the banks' position. With the Nikkei average at these depressed levels, there is a real threat that Japanese banks will be unable to meet new capital adequacy requirements next March. The government's position deserves some sympathy. A large package of fiscal measures including substantial public works is being prepared for the end of the month. In advance of this stimulatory boost the finance minister is trying to prevent banks bolstering their balance sheets by selling profitable stock holdings. However, Mr Hata's specific suggestions are not reassuring. By allowing banks to value securities at cost, rather than market value, the government is merely disguising the hole blown in bank balance sheets. Making it easier for banks to sell loans to insurance companies may also transfer some of the credit squeeze on to companies without the banks' capital constraints. However, that raises the question of which loans to sell. Disposing of good loans will degrade the banks portfolio, poor loans may only be sold at a discount, which means write-offs of the banks' core capital unless hidden by off-balance sheet shenanegans. One thing in favour of the package is that it may temporarily ease the risk of a credit crunch. But that is little enough to set against an equity market locked into a bearish psychology.</p>

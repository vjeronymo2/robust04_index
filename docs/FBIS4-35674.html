			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri has attended a  gathering of seminarians, scholars, and teachers of Qom seminary  at the Dar al-Shafa' school. [passage omitted]    Stressing the success of the fourth Majles, the speaker  said:  The government is dutybound, despite the reduction in the price  of oil, to provide essential goods for the public and the  foreign exchange required by manufacturing plants. That has  increased high prices and inflation within society.    He announced that Iran's foreign debts amount to $10  billion.  He said: They are loans obtained from other countries which  were spent on infra-structural projects in the country.</p>

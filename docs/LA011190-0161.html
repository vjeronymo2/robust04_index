			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARK SIGN IS THREATENED  </P> <P> It has appeared next to Jamie Lee Curtis in "Love Letters" and on the same  screen as Richard Gere in "Breathless."  </P> <P> One of Inglewood's biggest inanimate celebrities has a host of other credits,  including appearances in "Earth Girls Are Easy" and "The Golden Child," and a  photo spread in the bathing suit issue of Hot Rod magazine.  </P> <P> A nice list of credits, especially for an oversized doughnut.  </P> <P> The 45-foot-tall, 20-ton steel and cement treat balanced atop Randy's Donuts on  West Manchester Boulevard dates back to the days of programmatic architecture  -- a style that proliferated in the 1950s and included giant chili bowls, milk  bottles, tamales, ice cream buckets -- and even a coffee cup and a pumpkin.  </P> <P> The three-dimensional billboards were devised to catch the eye and whet the  appetite of passing motorists, said Teresa Grimes, preservation officer with  the Los Angeles Conservancy.  </P> <P> In the non-consumable category, there was a florist shop in the form of a  flower pot, a shoe repair shop masquerading as a shoe, a music school as an  accordion and a camera store as a camera.  </P> <P> "If we didn't have the doughnut on the roof, we'd be just another doughnut  shop," said Ron Weintraub, who runs Randy's Donuts with his brother Larry.  </P> <P> But changing times threaten to gobble up Randy's, a fate that has already  descended on a number of the area's other roadside wonders.  </P> <P> The Weintraub brothers own the shop under the doughnut, but they rent the land  it sits on. City redevelopment officials have targeted this prime property over  the past decade for projects such as an office complex, a hotel and, most  recently, a Cadillac dealership. All the plans have fallen through, giving the  shop one reprieve after another.  </P> <P> Pat Way, Inglewood's acting redevelopment director, said no plans for the lot  have come forward since negotiations with Jim Lynch Cadillac broke down in  November. She said the city may consider moving the doughnut shop to another  location within the city if new plans emerge.  </P> <P> "Randy's Donuts is a fine example of a type of architecture that is fairly  unique to Los Angeles," said Grimes, who traced the pop style back to the  1930s. "At one point there were many Randy's Donut shops, but over the years  they've been demolished."  </P> <P> A few other giant doughnuts remain atop shops in Gardena, Los Angeles and Long  Beach.  </P> <P> "It's part of the history of the community," Ron Weintraub said. "Everyone who  stops at the traffic light (on Manchester Boulevard) just stares at it. Kids  are pointing at it right now as I look out the window."  </P> <P> Weintraub is eyeing state or federal landmark status for the shop, but  preservation officials are not optimistic that even that would protect the  giant doughnut.  </P> <P> If the shop were to be demolished, Randy's fans say it would leave a giant hole  in the region.  </P> <P> "It breaks my heart to see these places go down," said Pat Hinz, a sculptor  from the Palos Verdes Peninsula who is planning to capture the shop in clay.  </P> <P> Brenda Conyers, a member of the Historical Society of Centinela Valley, added:  "We all care about the doughnut. . . . It's a local thing we like to see in the  movies."  </P> <P> Legend has it that Randy's was Salvador Dali's favorite L.A. landmark.  </P> <P> And Weintraub says the doughnut has also served as a landmark of another kind.  A pilot once told him he uses the doughnut as a guide when he descends into Los  Angeles International Airport.  </P></p>

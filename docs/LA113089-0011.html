			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 24TH INFANTRY IN KOREAN WAR  </P> <P> The Times is to be commended for its continuing coverage of the Army's last  black 24th Infantry Regiment and of the 10-year effort to correct the unit's  mistreatment in official Korean War history.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, John Broder's article ("War and Black GIs' Memories," Part A,  Nov. 15) treated only the 24th's initial weeks in Korea, rehashing many of the  negative reports of the 24th and every other regiment's baptism to fire without  reporting a single subsequent outstanding combat action. As I have long  maintained, the 24th fought as well as other American regiments throughout its  14 1/2 months of extended front-line combat.  </P> <P> Broder also fails to complete an important comparison between the 24th and two  sister regiments during the initial weeks of combat. The 24th experienced an  unprecedented 13 changes in battalion commanders (only two were  casualty-related) in its first three months in action -- an average of one new  battalion CO per week, not the one per month Broder reports. Its sister  battalions, the 27th and 35th, had just one and three changes, respectively.  </P> <P> The fact that the 24th had throughout these initial two months fought as well  as other American regiments is a tribute to the extraordinary performance of  the regiment's company-grade officers, white and black, and to its exceptional  NCOs.  </P> <P> DAVID K.

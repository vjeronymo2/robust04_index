			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Intel to make PC range for Amstrad AMSTRAD, the UK consumer electronics group hit by the recession in its main markets, is planning to boost its role as a supplier of professional personal computers (PCs) to corporate customers. It is due to announce in Hanover, Germany, tomorrow, the launch of a range of PCs to be manufactured to its own design by Intel, the world's leading supplier of microprocessor chips. The new machines will be based on Intel's most advanced microprocessor, the 80/486, and will carry Intel's trademark as well as Amstrad's label. Service and support will also be provided by Intel. Amstrad, which began trading as an audio company and moved into computers in the early 1980s. It has been successful in marketing word processors and games computers but it has suffered among corporate customers from its image as a consumer electronics company. Profitability has been declining as a result of price cutting among PC makers, especially at the lower end of the market, and a fall-off in consumer spending. In the first six months of the current year, the company suffered its first-ever loss of Pounds 15.18m before tax on sharply reduced sales of Pounds 196.07m. The share price, which has been in the doldrums since profits started to slip, gained 12 per cent to 36p over the weekend on rumours of the Intel deal. The new machines will be priced from Pounds 1,400 to Pounds 3,200. Intel already manufactures PCs for American Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications group. Amstrad, which last year announced a colour portable computer, will tomorrow launch a laptop machine, priced at less than Pounds 2,500 in the UK. 'Cloning' tussle, Page 30</p>

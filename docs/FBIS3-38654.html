The drama of Sarajevo's  civilians continues and the latest tragic events make the  severity of the problem clear.    Searching for those responsible is a duty of all parties  involved in the international community. However, what is  urgent now is to at last find a peaceful, swift, just, and  viable solution to the Yugoslav crisis.</p>

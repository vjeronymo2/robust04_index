At  the conclusion of his two-day visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that his country has a "real will  for a lasting and comprehensive peace." At the same time,  however, he rejected "partial negotiations" with Israel. After  the Hebron massacre, the international community now must exert  pressure on Israel, which, in Syria's view is not "seriously"  interested in a "just peace."    He fears that, with its policy of two-sided negotiations  with  its neighbors, Israel just wants to divide the Arab camp,  al-Shar' said. "Partial solutions" would not bring about peace  but, perhaps, even worsen the situation. Thus, the agreement  between Israel and the PLO did not bring peace, but only  encouraged extremists. The bloodbath of Hebron was the  "consequence of this agreement." With this position al-Shar'  contradicted the view of his host, German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany), who had called the  agreement a first step toward a "constructive prospect for a  lasting reconciliation."    Despite his rejection of partial negotiations with Israel,  in  talking to journalists al-Shar' evaded the question of whether  and under which conditions Syria would be ready or resume direct  talks with Israel. He repeated the demand for a complete  withdrawal of the settlers and a complete return of the occupied  territories. Diplomatic circles in Bonn noted positively that  the Syrian minister accused "extremists from both sides" -- and  not just Israel alone -- of endangering the peace process.    Syria is interested in more intensive relations with the  European Union. Kinkel promised to advocate a meeting of the  European-Syrian Cooperation Council at the end of the year.  Reportedly, he urged his guest for an extradition agreement  with the FRG. According to intelligence service findings,  German terrorist and Carlos associate Weinrich has found refuge  in Syria. Syria's government denies this.</p>

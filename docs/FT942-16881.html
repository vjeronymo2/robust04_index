			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (9): Drift of trade to London causes concern - An official commission, scheduled to report this summer, is considering reforms of the stock exchange in line with the EU financial services directive There is increasing international interest in Danish securities, both bonds and equities, but there is a catch viewed from the Danish perspective. More and more of the trade in Danish securities is taking place in London. Accurate statistics are hard to come by, but in some periods about half the turnover in Danish bonds appears to have taken place outside Denmark, as well as a considerable share of the trade in the most liquid equities. The Nationalbank (Central Bank) is clearly concerned at the trend, asserting in its 1993 annual report, published in March, that without reform of the market, 'there is a risk that the Danish securities market will become of declining significance in the (face of) strengthening international competition ...' One of the reasons why trade is taking place in London, in the bank's view, is that non-residents cannot trade over the Copenhagen Stock Exchange unless they are physically present in Denmark. The bank recommends a general liberalisation of legislation covering this aspect of the financial markets, to include the right for non-residents to trade on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Reforms of the Stock Exchange are currently being considered by an official commission, due to report this summer, with a view to the implementation of the EU's investment services directive in 1996. There is a lively debate taking place between the various interested parties  -the big banks, the independent brokerage houses, the big bond-issuing institutions, and the institutional investors - on what changes are needed. One of the problems, said Mr Eigil Pedersen, partner in investment bank Gudme Raaschou, and a former chairman of the Association of Danish Stock Brokers, is that the set-up in Copenhagen currently favours the two big banks. They account for about 60 per cent of the transactions, and for trade in the very liquid securities, but there are a lot of illiquid securities, both bonds and shares. 'We want to keep this market alive,' he says. He has been looking at reforms of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, which faced a similar problem of trade going to London, but has managed to reverse the trend by changing the structure of its own market, allowing non-resident brokers to trade over the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and by establishing separate wholesale and retail markets. Making changes is a difficult process in Copenhagen, where the Stock Exchange and its related institutions, the Securities Registration Centre and the Guarantee Fund for Options and Futures, operate under legislation which gives the Stock Exchange a monopoly. The supervisory boards of the institutions, in principle self-owning, are appointed by the Ministry for Industry. The present set-up means that the Stock Exchange mixes commercial with administrative and regulatory tasks. 'We think it is a necessary condition for a stock exchange to function as a market place that it must be run on a commercial basis,' said Mr Kai Struwe, secretary-general of the Association of Danish Stockbrokers. But he agrees that, as Denmark does not have the London market's tradition of self-regulation, the debate on freeing the Stock Exchange to function on a strictly commercial basis will be a difficult one. Copenhagen now offers trade in a full range of derivatives, as well as in bonds and shares. A future on the 3-month Cibor, introduced last autumn, added a money market derivative to a selection of stock options and futures based on benchmark bonds and the KFX index of the 10-most traded shares. A feature of Copenhagen is that all these instruments are traded on a single exchange. The Danish market was the first in the world to abolish paper securities and introduce a fully electronic book entry and settlements system, starting with bonds in 1983 and shares in 1988. Electronic registration of foreign securities has been possible since 1989. Automatic trading systems were introduced in 1987, Decentralised trade - from broker's offices - became possible in 1988 and the floor of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange was closed in 1989. Technically-speaking, the system has worked extremely well, but not every one is satisfied with the rules of the system. It embodies an extreme degree of transparency, with a 90-second requirement between making a deal and reporting to the Securities Centre. This, said Mr Struwe, exposes a dealer who has a big position as he or she has no way of getting out of the position without the entire market knowing that he must. Some trade may have gone to London simply because there is greater degree of anonymity. The Copenhagen market is dominated by bonds. 'We are one of the most exciting markets in Europe,' said Mr Struwe. A substantial share of the benchmark treasury bonds are traded internationally. Last year the introduction of 30-year mortgages attracted international investors and on April 6 a 30-year treasury bond was launched. The Copenhagen equities market is relatively small, and only around five per cent of the shares listed in Copenhagen are held by non-residents. In the other Nordic countries somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent of the shares are foreign-owned. Interest in Danish equities may be picking up, however. The Dollars 3bn Tele Danmark privatisation issue taking place in April, 85 per cent of which is expected to be sold internationally, will introduce a new and liquid share. The DKr1.7bn international issue by Unidanmark in February was a further sign of the times. It was the first time that a Danish bank has launched an international issue, Mr Thorleif Krarup, Unidanmark's chief executive pointed out, and the issue, at market price, was oversubscribed four times. Mr Krarup was particularly encouraged by the considerable interest in the issue in France and Germany in addition to the UK and the US. 'If Danish companies make a systematic effort, they can make Danish shares more interesting and more liquid,' is Mr Krarup's conclusion.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STOCK EXCHANGE TURNOVER (DKrbn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Market profile                                      1993 4th quarter  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bond turnover (nominal value)                              3,743,417 Volume in circulation                                      1,919,675 No of bonds                                                    2,359 Share turnover (market value)                                 35,864 Volume in circulation                                        318,435 No of equities                                                   595 Futop, bond-related                                          351,810        share-related                                          12,358  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Copenhagen Stock Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

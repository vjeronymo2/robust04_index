			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hans O. Alfredsson report: "Center Leaning Toward Yes to </F> EU"]    [Text] The Center Party will probably say yes to Swedish  membership in the EU [European Union]. This is now the view of  [party leader] Olof Johansson. Johansson himself will wait a  month before finally making up his mind.    There was a lot of talk about "the democratic process,"  "dialogue," "not laying down the law," and "not lecturing  people" when the Center Party leadership gave a news conference  in Stockholm yesterday. The news conference took place in  connection with a whole day's meeting of representatives of all  the party's districts meeting as the party's board of  representatives.    Andreas Carlgren, the party's second deputy chairman, a warm  EU supporter, summarized his impressions of discussions by  saying that there is every indication that the party executive  will recommend the extraordinary congress on the EU to decide in  favor of membership. Olof Johansson backed him up by saying  that that was his impression too.    "Things are leaning in that direction, yes," he said in  reply  to a question.    In the same breath he reiterated that the party's internal  processes must be allowed to take their course. Most  immediately this involves holding 24 regional conferences.  After that the party executive will review the situation and  put forward a recommendation for the EU congress. It is likely  that at that time too Olof Johansson will confess to his faith  in the EU in public.    The questions about why he cannot do so now became so  numerous that Andreas Carlgren felt the need to intervene a  couple of times and explain and defend his party leader's  position.    "Olof's approach is necessary so that the Center Party can  complete the democratic process," he said.    The party's foreign affairs spokesman, Par Granstedt --  another warm advocate of the EU -- was irritated that  journalists are so interested in the absence of any decision  hitherto on the EU question on the part of the Center Party  leader. This is "something of a democratic problem," he  claimed, since it is merely a matter of a few weeks one way or  another.    "This sabotages a serious debate and I think that this is  mildly serious."    Granstedt himself put a 28-page report, "Green Future for  Europe," before the board of representatives. This can, if  largely by implication, be read as a long plea for membership.    Par Granstedt claims that the Center Party's conditions for  a  yes have been met in the agreement that has been negotiated.    This means, he said, that Sweden cannot be forced to abandon  its nonalignment, forced into cooperation in the defense field,  or be forced to have the same currency as other EU states.  These conditions have been strongly emphasized by the three  most recent Center Party congresses.</p>

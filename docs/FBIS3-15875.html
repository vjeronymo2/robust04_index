Urges That He Be </F> Involved in Legal Action"]    [Text] Yesterday marked the end to the 10-day deadline for  filing appeals against the ruling by the Shchelkovo court, which  deemed the elections in the Shchelkovo electoral district to be  invalid. It is well known that Mr. Zhirinovskiy was elected to  the State Duma in the district. His lawyer, S. Belyak, said  that Zhirinovskiy was not involved in the criminal proceedings  either as an interested person or as a plaintiff, hence, he did  not have the right to appeal. According to S. Belyak, Vladimir  Volfovich learned about the trial only from newspapers.    It seems that the case will come to the attention of an  oblast court: the district electoral commission, against which  the complaint was actually lodged, did file an appeal. V.V. Zh.  [Zhirinovskiy] has left a statement at the oblast court  objecting to the Shchelkovo city court's ruling and requesting  that he be invited to attend the trial as an interested  observer. According to S. Belyak, rumors about that have  reached Nikolay Ryabov, whose reaction was strongly negative:  Zhirinovskiy's lawyer quoted him as saying that "if everyone  who failed to enter the State Duma turns to arbitration courts,  there will be anarchy in the country!"</p>

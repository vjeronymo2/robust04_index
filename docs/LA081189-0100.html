			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 22 KILLED IN BEIRUT SHELLING  </P> <P> At least 22 people were killed and 140 wounded as Syrian and Christian forces  clashed in eight hours of artillery duels in Beirut, officials announced.  Shells hit the hilltop residence of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy in Yarze, a  Christian suburb of the besieged capital, as well as the residence of French  Ambassador Rene Ala in the suburb of Hazmiye, but police said no one was hurt.  The day's casualties raised the toll to 571 dead and 1,462 wounded, by police  count, since the artillery war began in mid-March. Many of the latest victims  were caught in the streets as they tried to take advantage of a three-day lull  in what is only the latest round in Lebanon's 14-year civil war.  </P></p>

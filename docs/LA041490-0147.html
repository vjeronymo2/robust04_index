			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIMME SHELTER;  </P> <P> FOUNDED IN THE '70S BY STUDENT SQUATTERS, UCI'S LOW-RENT TRAILER PARK MAY GO  MOBILE  </P> <P> It sounds rough, living in a thin-walled trailer the size of a large bedroom.  Getting a decent shower means throwing on a bathrobe and walking down an  asphalt road to a communal bathroom. On a cold night, the power fails when too  many space heaters click on to combat the chill. And everyone has a story about  leaks during heavy rains.  </P> <P> At UC Irvine's only student trailer park, Irvine Meadows West, on the  undeveloped edge of the campus, the grass grows long, the animals run wild and  no home looks like another. Friends drop by with dinner or invite neighbors out  to a movie, and every so often, a group gets together to tidy the grounds or to  sing around a campfire.  </P> <P> Irvine Meadows West is home to about 100 students -- a low-priced, alternative  form of university housing pioneered by UCI. It has survived for nearly 20  years, ever since a handful of students first squatted in buses, vans and  campers on the original site across from the college.  </P> <P> The four-acre trailer park is sheltered from the nearby academic buildings,  undergraduate apartments and a campus road running alongside it by hillsides  and large trees. It opens toward pristine hills now green from rain. Fashion  Island is off in the distance to the west, and nothing but open space is  visible in between. To the south are more knolls, some with University Hills  homes for faculty and staff peeking over the crest lines.  </P> <P> Five years from now, however, buildings will stand on this site, and presently  no one knows if there will be land on campus set aside to accommodate the 80  trailers. Residents fear the worst: that someday there won't be an Irvine  Meadows West.  </P> <P> Renting the space for a trailer is $100 per month, with electricity and water  thrown in. The community is friendly and laid-back, and a passing "hello"  easily becomes a 10-minute conversation. And years without a building code have  allowed the expansions of many trailers, resulting in a hodgepodge of  odd-shaped and -sized room additions. This alone sets the settlement apart from  the private apartments next to the university or other campus housing projects  -- for which residents are grateful.  </P> <P> "It kept me kind of sane," said Toby Buchanan, a two-year resident of Irvine  Meadows West and one of its three student managers. "I don't like the Irvine  attitude where all the colors have to be the same and you can't have your car  in the alley."  </P> <P> A walk along the asphalt fire road that separates the park's inner and outer  rings of trailers reveals, for example, a white camper with "Al's Bed and  Breakfast" written on its front in blue letters. An addition resembling a  hillbilly's shack erupts skyward from its top. Others have patios and rooms  attached to their sides.  </P> <P> Residents grow strawberries and sweet peas, fertilized from small compost  piles, in small gardens behind some of the trailers. The communal Circular  Garden, about the size of a ball diamond, is filled with bamboo,  licorice-smelling fennel and cacti.  </P> <P> The garden was a thesis project by a fine arts major who lived in the park when  it first opened, said Brian Miller, another of the park's managers. Scattered  among the plants are large art projects, legacies from other residents. Giant  ceramic feet stand silently, and a totem pole-like statue guards the garden.  </P> <P> "Here, there's nice bushes and trees and rabbits running around that don't look  like they were stuck there," said Graham Davis, a sophomore art major and  resident since January.  </P> <P> Despite its idyllic setting, Irvine Meadows West is not a campground.  </P> <P> Dinner's not cooked over a can of Sterno; it's zapped in the microwave.  Entertainment's not limited to watching the sunset and going to sleep when  darkness falls; there are plenty of stereos and VCRs. The nearest water supply  is not a hike away; it comes from the tap, in hot or cold -- and you don't need  to boil it to kill germs.  </P> <P> Still, some of Kimberly Spears' friends thought the senior English major was  crazy when she moved into the park a year ago. But two friends who saw the  8-foot-wide, 40-foot-long trailer she bought from a former resident for $3,500  signed up on the park's one-to-two-year waiting list the next day.  </P> <P> Spears' 35-year-old trailer is essentially a long, wooden box without the  stationary tables and seats of conventional recreational vehicles, allowing her  to decorate and furnish it like a small house. She has a full-size refrigerator  and a queen-size bed, a small blue couch and a little desk lit by a pink lamp  -- all found in any regular apartment. And she has the place to herself.  </P> <P> "I don't feel like I'm living in a travel trailer," Spears said. "I'd lived in  a dorm for a year, then shared a room, so coming in here, it felt spacious."  </P> <P> Not all residents have trailers as nice as Spears'. Some live in small ones  where the kitchen table doubles as a desk and folds up when there's need for a  living room.  </P> <P> Space is a constant consideration. Tiny refrigerators mean never buying a  two-liter bottle of Coke, and minuscule freezers make the park's communal ice  machine a popular appliance. It's a common sight to see residents clutching  soap and shampoo as they stroll to the park's modest bathroom facility because  their hot-water tanks are too small to provide a long shower.  </P> <P> But these are minor inconveniences compared to other forms of student housing,  residents say. To them, a rough life is paying an average $250 or more a month  to share an apartment bedroom, on or off campus. There's not much privacy in  those places either when people are squeezed into an apartment to lower  expenses.  </P> <P> The park's low rent attracts students without parental support or who lack  hefty scholarships. "These are mostly independent students," said Jim Craig,  UCI's director of housing, "who are trying to make it on their own."  </P> <P> Beyond the rent, residents say they're attached to the park's strong sense of  community.  </P> <P> Lydia Passannante, a junior fine arts major who has lived in the park since  September, says residents look out for each other. Her neighbors know that she  doesn't have a car, so they ask if she needs anything when they go shopping.  When someone has extra food or furniture, it's donated to another resident.  "Things don't get thrown away here," she said, "they move around."  </P> <P> Some residents say the tight-knit community exists because of the people  attracted to a lifestyle that provides life's necessities on a small scale.  Residents are characterized as everything from "a real granola crowd" and  "earthy" to "rebels" and "leaders," depending on whom you ask.  </P> <P> Another explanation for the community spirit could be that a smaller population  is a closer one, said Gretchen Casey, acting associate director of the Campus  Village undergraduate apartments.  </P> <P> There are only 100 or so residents of Irvine Meadows West compared to almost  800 students in Campus Village, UCI's undergraduate apartment complex. About  11,500 of UCI's 16,000 students -- 72% of the campus student population -- live  off campus, according to the UCI Housing Office.  </P> <P> Turnover is slow at the park because once residents have a space, they may stay  as long as they remain full-time students. An unenrolled roommate is allowed,  which helps a few former residents hang on to the low-rent, idyllic life.  </P> <P> Many of the old trailers with additions manage to hang on, too, rather than be  rooted up and replaced when new residents move in. Residents like the extra  space some of the older trailers offer, and depending on amenities, trailer  prices can range up to $4,000. Most residents break even or make a small profit  when they sell their trailers, but many invest time repairing and improving  their homes after they buy them, Miller said.  </P> <P> The trailer park has moved three times since it began, gaining size and  strength with each move, despite the odds.  </P> <P> Its origins in the early 1970s were unlikely. Modern-day squatters living in  buses, vans and campers on private property across from UCI asked the  university if they could move onto the campus. The city of Irvine had taken aim  at people like the squatters in the winter of 1972 by passing ordinances  prohibiting sleeping in a vehicle and parking an RV on city streets.  </P> <P> Allowing students to live in a housing experiment on campus during the time of  the Vietnam War protests wasn't an easy idea for the proponents, including  squatters and two campus officials, to pitch to the administration.  </P> <P> "It was fairly revolutionary," said Robert F. Gentry, associate dean of  students who was acting dean of students at the time.  </P> <P> James Phillips, acting director of housing then, narrates a taped oral history  of the park and recalls the different reactions to the idea: "The squatters'  proposal was met head-on with a whole spectrum of closed minds. Safety people  said it wouldn't be safe. Health people said it would be unhealthy. Insurance  people said it would be risky. A vice chancellor said that people shouldn't  live that way. When asked why, he said, 'Because it's a crummy way to live.' "  </P> <P> But with a severe housing shortage on the 7-year-old campus, and  then-Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. behind the idea, doubts were pushed aside  and a temporary site for 12 trailers was prepared.  </P> <P> When it opened in September, 1973, Irvine Meadows -- as it became known after a  small sign was posted by a resident in the early years -- boasted perks such as  two toilets and a cold water tap. No electricity. No telephones. Rent was $10.  </P> <P> The site changed once more in 1979 from near the present site of the Bren  Events Center to its current location. A rent increase to $70 accompanied the  move.  </P> <P> While it may appear that the park has beaten the odds and is a permanent  fixture at UCI, its biggest fight for survival is yet to come.  </P> <P> This month, construction begins on a road around the far side of the park which  will effectively end its isolation. The park will no longer be forgotten on the  edge of the campus but rather exist as part of the campus whole.  </P> <P> Residents said they fear that officials in the administration who think the  park is an unsightly sprawl will eliminate Irvine Meadows West.  </P> <P> "We're here at the edge of the campus, and it's wonderful. They're going to  build a road around us, and who knows what that'll do? We want to plant trees  and keep it enclosed," said resident Passannante.  </P> <P> To address concerns over safety and appearance, the park's management agreed to  a building moratorium after consulting with the campus housing office last year  following a fire marshal's inspection, Buchanan said. Trailers moving into the  park are restricted to 35 feet in length and 8 feet in width, and residents are  required to keep areas around their spaces neat.  </P> <P> Under the university's long-range plans, physical sciences classrooms, office  space and research labs could be built on the park site in the next five years,  according to Leon M. Schwartz, vice chancellor of administrative and business  services.  </P> <P> The park site "is seen as temporary," said housing director Craig. "That means  some time in the future, it might be redesignated as academic space. I would  like to think it would be relocated."  </P> <P> The future area for new student housing -- where the park would probably be  relocated -- is within view of the upscale community of Turtle Rock, on a hill  overlooking UCI.  </P> <P> The question asked by Schwartz is: If some administrators find a collection of  trailers unsightly, "what are the people in Turtle Rock going to say?"  </P> <P> Another concern, Schwartz said, is that high-density housing projects are  prefered.  </P> <P> The fate of Irvine Meadows East remains to be seen.  </P> <P> It's demise would sadden Christopher Stevens, a 1984 graduate student in fine  arts who lived in Irvine Meadows and helped moved trailers to Irvine Meadows  West.  </P> <P> "That would just be terribly sad. It's a good institution. It would be an  extreme loss," Stevens said. "Some people would not have been able to be  students if it weren't for living there."  </P></p>

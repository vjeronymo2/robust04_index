			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Soft bark and a weak bite: Bronwen Maddox asks whether the UN's nuclear watchdog has the teeth to do its job The prospect of a second Korean war has receded with the agreement by North Korea to talk to its southern neighbour for the first time since the second world war. The talks, later this month, will indicate whether the secretive northern regime of Kim Il-Sung can be discouraged from building nuclear weapons. But whatever the outcome of the discussion, tensions on the Korean peninsula have raised pressing questions about the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog. It was the refusal of North Korea to allow the agency to inspect its nuclear sites which triggered the current crisis. The Nuclear Control Institute, a respected Washington-based lobby group, attacked the agency last week for failing in its job of 'blowing the whistle' on the spread of nuclear weapons. Officials at the US Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, responsible for US strategy on North Korea, agree privately that the agency 'has not been as aggressive as it could have been'. The IAEA, a mouthful of vowels pronounced easily by nobody in a UN country, was born in 1957 as part of US President Dwight Eisenhower's 'atoms for peace' plan. In line with prevailing optimism about the potential of civil nuclear power, it was given the job of helping UN countries acquire nuclear skills, particularly safety techniques and medical treatments. It was also given a second, separate role: 'safeguarding' or supervising civil nuclear reactors to ensure that their contents were not diverted to bombs. Although the cold war had dented hopes that the superpowers would scale down their nuclear arsenals, it still seemed probable that nuclear weapons' capability could be restricted to a tiny handful of countries. The signing of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by 164 countries has put much weight on that second role: signatories without nuclear weapons were obliged to submit to regular IAEA scrutiny of their civil nuclear programmes. Although inspections now take up only a third of the agency's annual Dollars 200m budget, the agency's role as watchdog wins it a disproportionate share of headlines. The treaty's renegotiation next year will put its record under the spotlight. Criticism of that record begins with a single word: Iraq. In the decade before the 1990 Gulf War, the agency failed to detect Saddam Hussein's Dollars 3bn clandestine weapons programme, saying that Iraq complied fully with the treaty. The episode is by common agreement the agency's most embarrassing hour. Mr David Kyd, spokesman at the agency's Vienna headquarters, acknowledges that 'Iraq was a shock for us'. After the war, it became clear that Iraq had imported sensitive western technology for a decade, and employed 10,000 engineers in attempting to make nuclear explosives in a dozen desert factories. Those included the site of Iraq's two small reactors, which was regularly visited by the IAEA. To the agency's critics, the crisis over North Korea's nuclear intentions and capability suggests that the lessons of Iraq have not been assimilated. In particular, they feel the agency was slow to raise the alarm. 'The place runs like the post office,' says Mr Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute. Mr David Kay, the former IAEA inspector in charge of the agency's post-war inquiry into Iraq, who now advises the US nuclear industry, also sees the agency's endeavours in North Korea as technically inept. Its video cameras 'are essentially consumer technology', he says. He believes tension in the North Korean capital Pyongyang was heightened unnecessarily because agency inspectors entered and exited nuclear sites repeatedly to replenish batteries and tape, although 'there are cameras available which they could have used to beam straight back to Vienna'. In response to these attacks, the IAEA says that people frequently overestimate the scope of its action. 'There is a public perception that we were super-cops (in Iraq), but we were super-accountants,' according to Mr Kyd. The agency carried out its task of monitoring the fuel inside Iraq's reactors, he argues, but it had not looked for a weapons programme separate from these civil reactors, because this is an expensive route to acquiring a bomb. The agency adds, however, that it has accepted the need for some change. 'We are being encouraged by our members to be nosier,' Mr Kyd says. Members now pass information on from their intelligence services; photographs last year from the US Central Intelligence Agency helped alert the agency to the North Korean threat. But the agency's ability to become more intrusive is limited by its statute, Vienna officials argue. They say the frequency of inspections is set strictly in proportion to the size of a country's civil nuclear programme. This condition was set in the 1950s when the threat of Germany, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland acquiring nuclear weapons seemed great and, as a result, IAEA inspectors still spend two-thirds of their time on western Europe, Canada and Japan. 'But if we tilted that principle, developing countries would scream 'discrimination' and leave,' Mr Kyd says. That fear - that countries will resign from the IAEA and the NPT - is the greatest restraint on the agency's aggression, according to its officials. They see the agency's twin roles inextricably linked in a fragile bargain. 'It is industrialised countries who want safeguards inspection, but developing countries mainly want technological assistance, and would not want to be members of something directed entirely at curbing their research programmes,' Mr Kyd says. To those watching the watchdog, this dilemma lies at the heart of its shortcomings. 'If some countries can't live with intrusive inspections, and threaten to leave the IAEA, the world should know,' says Mr Kay. To critics, the agency's attitude to Iran over the next few years will show whether it is overcoming its weaknesses. Western intelligence experts are keeping a close eye on Iran's procurement of technology in its current bid to boost its military strength. Some of the agency's problems, however, arise from political and technological changes that have arisen since it was created. The countries now embracing civil nuclear power with most enthusiasm are in the developing world and in Asia, which lie outside the agency's traditional areas of expertise. Fresh techniques have emerged for refining uranium and plutonium to the grade where they can be used for bombs. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has increased the possibility for clandestine trade in assembled nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, reprocessing plants such as the UK's Thorp and France's Cogema will begin to inject large quantities of plutonium into the world's stockpile as a by-product of treating left-over fuel. To monitor these new threats - trade in nuclear technology, and the production of civil plutonium - the IAEA's statute would have to be extended. Whether that is desirable, or possible, is a question which next year's debate on the NPT's future will have to tackle. But if governments choose to maintain a pact to curb proliferation, they will need some kind of watchdog. Given the IAEA's performance in the two crises of the past three years, it is fair to conclude that the watchdog will need to be more alert than in the past, and probably larger, if it is to succeed in raising the alarm.</p>

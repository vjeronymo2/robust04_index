			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A number to ring instead of Beattie's - The industry is inviting investors to switch their privatisation holdings THE UNIT trust industry has turned aggressive. It launched a hard-hitting marketing campaign in December, which sought to persuade investors to switch their BT and other privatised shares into unit trust holdings. A risque slogan - 'Why settle for a quickie with BT when you could have a fulfilling relationship?' - tried to emphasise that unit trusts were best for small investors in the long term. And Philip Warland, the UTA's director general, attacked the tactics used by the government in its privatisation programme. 'Privatisations which entice people with certain swift gains are a perversion of capitalism. They replace the desire to save with the lust for greed,' he said. Mr Warland also argued that the government's perceived bias against collective funds, such as the Pounds 3,000 personal equity plan limit on unit trusts and existing investment trusts, was wrong-headed. He added that only two other countries showed the same bias as the UK against collective investments - Cuba and China. Under the UTA's initiative, which will run until March 9, investors ring a special telephone line* and give their name and address. They will then be sent a brochure, giving details of schemes offered by three management groups. The three will be randomly chosen from nine companies: Brown Shipley, Crown, Fidelity, Framlington, Invesco MIM, Prolific, Prudential Holborn, Scottish Equitable and Societe Generale Touche Remnant. Dealing charges will vary between the groups. Most will charge nothing at all, and some are offering discounts on the bid-offer spread. The UTA also says that groups will be flexible about their minimum investment levels (normally Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000), because those who buy into privatisation offers have often received paltry allocations. A limited number of trusts - mainly UK income and growth funds - are available from most of the groups. Prudential is the exception, allowing investors to switch into one of 16 different trusts. The other groups' trusts are: Brown Shipley Growth, Crown Growth, Crown High Income, Fidelity UK Growth, Framlington Managed Portfolio, Invesco MIM Taxbreak Plus (a Pep), Prolific High Income, Scottish Equitable Worldwide Tactical, Scottish Equitable High Income, and SGTR General Growth. The UTA is not saying that these are the best trusts, or even the best management companies - M&amp;G, for example, is not participating in the scheme. Is it worth switching? Most privatisation stocks have performed extremely well, and in the case of utilities such as water and electricity, have recession-resisting characteristics. A good unit trust, however, ought to provide a better diversified portfolio than a collection of privatised stocks. A bad trust, of course, might not: so investors should look for good performance, over the long term (five years plus) as well as the short term when picking a trust. *0483 461010.

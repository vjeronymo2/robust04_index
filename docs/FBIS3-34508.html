The group was  planning to blow up public places and assassinate a number of  intellectuals.    Replying to a question at a House of Representatives session  held today under the speakership of Tahir al-Masri and attended  by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, the interior minister  added:    [Begin recording] [Salamah Hammad] In the name of God, the  merciful, the compassionate. Almighty God has said: Remember,  Abraham said: O my Lord! Make this city one of peace and  security. [Koranic verse]    Mr. Speaker, Honorable Deputies: With the help of God, this  country will remain secure because the Almighty has blessed our  country with a leadership believing in God and sincere in  performing its duty, and because this country has qualified  security organs that believe in their duty to protect the  homeland and the citizen. We do not brag about that because they  are all your sons and brothers, people of this country.  However, they deserve admiration, appreciation, and respect.    Recently, a group or groups of people have been arrested.  They sought to harm this country. They had aims, which  included plans to blow up public places. These included the  House of Representatives, considering it a state institution.  They also planned to blow up places such as cinemas, video  shops, and night clubs; assassinate a number of intellectuals  and economists in this country; rob banks, considering them  usurious establishments; attack police foot patrols and seize  their weapons and also attack intelligence men; and attack  public places.    Four crimes against supermarkets, taxi drivers, and a liquor  store were carried out. They also committed crimes in the  Rivoli Cinema in Amman and the Salwa Cinema in al-Zarqa', as you  heard and as we announced. An explosive charge planted in  Zahran Cinema in Amman was defused and did not explode.    Yesterday, a group of persons were arrested. They had in  their possession two bombs intended to be detonated in Irbid,  and another two in al-Salt.    This morning we received information that a bomb had been  planted in al-Hashimiyah Square [in Amman]. All measures were  taken, but the bomb was not found. Last night we received word  about a bomb in the al-Nasr Cinema in al-Zarqa' and we  investigated that this morning.    In fact, brothers, investigations are going on and efforts  are continuing. In reply to the brothers' questions, I wanted  to clarify these points, and all details will be announced when  the investigations are completed.    The eyes of your sons, the men of all security organs will  remain open, with God's help, to serve this steadfast country.    This is what I have, Mr. Speaker, at present. When the  investigations are completed, we will announce all dimensions of  this issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.    [Tahir al-Masri] Thank you Mr. Minister, and thank you all  for these efforts that, with God's help, will keep this country  safe and secure. [end recording]</p>

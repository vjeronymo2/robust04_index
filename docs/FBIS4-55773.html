			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- On Tuesday [17 May]  journalists received a written statement on the Monday meeting  between Hungarian Foreign Minister Jeszenszky and Yugoslav  Deputy Prime Minister Simic, denying that Hungary saw sanctions  against Yugoslavia as useless. The foreign affairs spokesman  said that Simic's remark about his complete agreement with  Jeszenszky that UN sanctions against rump Yugoslavia have become  absurd was inaccurate. "Hungary's position on the embargo is  unchanged," the spokesman said.    Simic also indicated that, in keeping with the January talks  of President Milosevic and Jeszenszky, concrete steps will soon  be taken to resolve problems for Hungarians in the Serbian  region of Vojvodina. There will be negotiations between the  Serb Government and the Democratic Hungarian Community of  Vojvodina (VMDK). Hungary asked Yugoslavia to demonstrate its  commitment to promoting peace, lessening tension, and settling  the crisis.    The United Nations would see licensing of CSCE missions in  Yugoslavia, ensurance of free navigation on the Danube, easing  of tension in Kosovo, and progress in guaranteeing the rights of  Serbia's minorities, including ethnic Hungarians, as gestures  towards peace. The Hungarian side was happy at Serbia's  readiness to open talks with the VMDK.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> REQUEST CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood has asked the City Council of Santa Maria for $60,000 in  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood claims that it needs the money to help poor women. Why does  it want to use HUD money? Is it right to take the funds provided for affordable  housing for families and senior citizens, just so Planned Parenthood can  continue the slaughter of 28 million unborn children? Are they really concerned  about the poor? Planned Parenthood is the leading provider of abortion in the  nation and the world.  </P> <P> Planned Parenthood receives millions of dollars from taxpayers' money. Do they  still need more? What are they doing with the money?  </P> <P> CLARA DAVIS  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

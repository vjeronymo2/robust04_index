			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Observer: Spy spat Not all the scriptwriters at Russia's Foreign Ministry have been changed since the old Soviet regime - judging by yesterday's furious reaction to Norway's expulsion of a Russian diplomat. Following a week's silence on the hurried return home of Viktor Fediuk, a third secretary said to be in the employ of Russian military intelligence, come indications that the cold winds sweeping the Moscow streets have now penetrated one of the most liberal ministries of the post-Gorbachev era. The foreign affairs functionaries yesterday lashed out at the Norwegian media for conducting a 'campaign  .. to revive distrust and suspiciousness which had become a thing of the past .. The stirring of passions and far-fetched statements is aimed at damaging the prestige of Russia.' A Norwegian correspondent in Moscow saw it differently. 'A spy scandal in a small country like Norway with a big neighbour like Russia is great stuff for our newspapers'.</p>

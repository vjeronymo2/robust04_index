			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Majdi Hilmi] </F>   [Text] 'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, representative of the Cairo  Lawyers Association and deputy chairman of the Egyptian Human  Rights Organization [EHRO], has begun a hunger strike at the  association's headquarters in Cairo. He said he would continue  the hunger strike until Prosecutor General Raja' al-'Arabi  publicizes the findings of investigations into the death of  Lawyer 'Abd-al- Harith Madani and releases the detained lawyers.    The Lawyers Association Council held a meeting in its  general  headquarters yesterday to discuss developments in the case.  'Abd- al-'Aziz Muhammad, a 58-year-old diabetic, announced the  beginning of his strike and sit-in and said that he would give a  press conference at the headquarters tomorrow, Monday [20 June].  The meeting was attended by heads of the association's  sub-branches.    Sayyid Khalaf, secretary general of the Cairo branch of the  association, is expected to join the hunger strike on Monday.  The association's council members will follow suit.    Yesterday EHRO appealed to all human rights organizations to  intervene with the Egyptian authorities to release two of its  lawyers. The appeal affirmed that the two lawyers were arrested  in court as they were performing their duty of being present at  the interrogation of lawyers arrested during riots outside the  association. The two lawyers--Jamal 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Sayyid  Fathi--work at the EHRO's Field Unit.</p>

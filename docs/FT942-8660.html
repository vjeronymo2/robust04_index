			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure buys site for Pounds 2.4m Parkdean Leisure, the caravan park operator which floated last autumn, has made its first acquisition as a public company. It is paying Pounds 2.4m cash to the Marsh family for the Cherry Tree in Burgh, Norfolk, close to its existing Summerfields site near Great Yarmouth. Although acquisitions had been foreshadowed, the deal is larger than expected. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said that whereas earlier acquisitions had been of sites needing development, the park already had 'cracking facilities'. Further it had planning consents over an adjacent 10 acres to take another 150 units, expanding from the current 350 units. The assets being bought had been valued at Pounds 2.4m. Pre-tax profits in the latest financial year, to end-November, were Pounds 120,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.42m. Parkdean said margins should improve as the Cherry Tree park benefited from its supplier discounts and cost controls. The site trades for a shorter season than Parkdean's other sites, Mr Wilson said, and could be added to the group's central marketing operation with little extra cost. Buying it now would give the group the benefit of current year trading, he said, and enable Parkdean to assess the site in time to print its 1995 brochure. The acquisition will be funded by debt, taking gearing to about 30 per cent at the year end, Mr Wilson said. The group repeated its view of cautious optimism for the current year with Easter satisfactory, but reservations for the peak season were following the trend for later holiday bookings.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / EC cash transfers a costly business BANKS have failed to make it easier for customers to transfer money across EC borders over the past five years, according to the European consumers' organisation. The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) published a survey yesterday which indicates that transferring money around the EC is more costly, less transparent, and no quicker than at the time of its 1987 survey. The organisation called for legislation to force banks to change their ways, and to prevent them wriggling out of obligations to customers. It was particularly worried about the deterioration in information available to consumers about bank transfers, and the existence of 'hidden commissions' on some transactions. The survey was carried out for the European Commission's consumer policy service. Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for consumer affairs, said yesterday that legislative action would be taken if banks had not improved their payment systems by the end of this year. The Commission published its own guidelines for banks in March and promised to reassess the situation in the first quarter of 1993. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan said Brussels still believed co-operation with the banks would be more effective than legislation. 'We don't dispute the findings, we know things are still wrong, but we have given them (the banks) until the end of the year to improve their act.' Beuc sent 160 payments of about Ecu130 (Pounds 104) across Europe, via mail and electronic transfer, and found the average total commission charged on a transfer amounted to Ecu18, or 14 per cent, compared with 9 per cent in 1987. Banks in Britain, Portugal, Italy, France and Ireland were among the most expensive; the slowest were in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Netherlands.</p>

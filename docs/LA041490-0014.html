			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET REBELS ENJOY THEIR TITLE . . .  </P> <P> I finally figured out how the NCAA tournament selection process works, and what  a shame for Joe Harrington and his brave Long Beach State 49ers.  </P> <P> All they had to do to get an invitation was beat the eventual NCAA champion  UNLV in the Big West tournament and they blew it. They could manage only to  keep up with the Runnin' Rebels for a half. Still, that's 20 more minutes than  Duke did.  </P> <P> DAVID T. LIU, Irvine  </P></p>

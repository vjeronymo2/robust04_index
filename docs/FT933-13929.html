			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Blackland moving into China via Pounds 27m acquisition BLACKLAND Oil, a small onshore oil exploration company, plans to acquire Kingsleigh Petroleum, an energy trading company in China, for Pounds 26.7m in shares. Blackland is issuing 761.9m new shares of 1p to Kingsleigh's shareholders and separately placing 286m shares at 3 1/2 p in a bid to raise Pounds 9.2m net. The new company created by the deal will be called Fortune Oil. Kingsleigh is involved in trading oil in China as well as the construction of an offshore loading point and 15km pipeline. The transaction will involve 9 Chinese businessmen joining the Blackland board including Mr Sun Zhaoqing, chairman of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, as non-executive chairman. 'What we're buying here is connections in China as well as an earnings stream from a major engineering project,' said Mr John Mottram, who will be finance director of the joint company. Blackland currently has a series of small onshore exploration and production interests in the UK. It incurred an operating loss of Pounds 321,000 for 1992, compared with Pounds 472,000. Losses per share were 3.59p (5.28p). Mr Mottram said the acquisition would create the first company with a sizeable Chinese shareholding to be listed in the UK. The Pounds 9m from the share placement will be used to pay part of Kingsleigh's investment in the Chinese shipping facility as well as pay down group debt.</p>

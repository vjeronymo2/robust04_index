The Europeans are trying to mediate --  in their very own interest. In fact, compulsory measures by the  United States against Japan in the sphere of trade policy would  also affect the Europeans. In a trialogue among the major GATT  countries, a solution must be found.    President Clinton has announced "several trade measures"  against Japan for March. During the meeting with Clinton,  Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa was not ready to bow to  pressure. However, there is still a possibility of "improving"  the agreement and opening up the import markets to a greater  extent. The 1993 Japanese-U.S. trade balance turned out to be  fuel on the flames. The U.S. deficit increased by 20 percent to  an alarming level of $59.3 billion. This corresponds to 50  percent of the entire U.S. deficit.    In the Pacific dispute, Japan must show flexibility. In the  meantime, Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced that Japan is  preparing "emergency measures" to open up its market to a  greater extent. They should be adopted before the next G-7  meeting at the end of the week, if possible. However, the  secretary general of the government, Masayoshi Takemura, has  dampened excessive hopes of the GATT partners. Tokyo continues  to reject the U.S. demand for the stipulation of fixed quotas  against which the level of market access can be measured. No  additional spectacular concessions in the sphere of trade  policies are to be expected from Tokyo. Yet Japan apparently  wants to avoid an escalation in the dispute with the United  States.    The unilateral U.S. policy of pressure, which threatened  "retaliatory measures" in the form of new import barriers and  increased tariffs against Japan is rightly meeting with  criticism from both the GATT secretariat and the European  Commission in Brussels. The United States is a long way from  applying the principles of liberalism in its own country that it  demands from its trading partners, GATT pointed out. The main  targets of criticism are the U.S. laws impeding imports, which  are summarized under the name "Super 301." The number of  complaints of the partners against the application of these laws  adopted in 1988 (U.S. definition of dumping, ban on subsidies,  and the adoption of retaliatory trade measures) is growing  constantly.    On the part of the European Union, its chief GATT  negotiator,  Sir Leon Brittan, criticized above all the U.S. demand that  Japan should guarantee the United States fixed market shares in  certain areas (for mobile telephones, for example) in bilateral  agreements. If these markets were only opened up for the United  States, this would entail disadvantages for the European  enterprises that want to export goods to Japan. In addition,  the Japanese exporters would squeeze the products which they can  not sell in their domestic market (because of the "guaranteed  shares" for the Americans) into the tight European markets.  After all, the trade deficit of the European Union vis-a-vis  Japan has increased to $26 billion this year.    Thus, the U.S. trade attack on Japan upsets the fragile  triangle among the three major world trading powers. In any  event, both the Americans and the Europeans did not negotiate  successfully with and vis-a-vis Japan in the large GATT round.  Tokyo skillfully hid in the shadow of the transatlantic quarrel  about the liberalization of agricultural trade and the reduction  of "green subsidies." It is not exactly a sign of diplomatic  skill to bang the table during the current talks. The Europeans  and the GATT partners are also interested in greater access to  the Japanese markets but they want -- in accordance with the  most-favored-nation clause of the GATT -- equal rights for  everyone. They want to prevent disadvantages both in the  Japanese and domestic markets that would result from bilateral  Japanese concessions for the United States.    The European Commission is considering two kinds of actions  to settle the transpacific conflict peacefully: The  above-mentioned trialogue among the three major world trade  partners, and comprehensive informative assistance for the  enterprises to enable them to gain a foothold in the difficult  Japanese import markets. The worldwide GATT agreement must be  "utilized to the maximum extent by all partners in friendly  cooperation," Brittan demanded. In any event, it must be  prevented that strong "interest groups and the creators of  markets" establish new trade barriers. Like the criticism by  the general secretariat of the GATT, this is an indirect appeal  to President Clinton to show fairness vis-a-vis all partners and  to avoid a trade war.    Above all, the partners should vest greater direct powers in  GATT for the settlement of trade disputes -- on a multilateral  basis. Bilateral agreements, preferred by the United States, or  more or less forced export restrictions undermine GATT as a  multilateral world trade organizations.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Big technology stocks feature in busy trading Wall Street US prices rose across the board yesterday, aided by a strong showing from big technology stocks and more good economic news that ensured market sentiment remained positive, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.96 at 3,305.16, the first time it has closed above 3,300 since September 21. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which reached new highs last week, firmed 1.18 to 431.34, a new record, while the Amex composite fell 1.72 to 395.11 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 3.24 to 652.73, an all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 230m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,138 to 661. Although the market's mood was positive at the opening, following recent signs that the pace of the economic recovery is quickening, there was no initial surge in demand of the type that pushed shares sharply higher last week. Buying picked up, however, after the Chicago purchasers' report was released, showing that the index of manufacturing activity in the region had risen from 49.72 in October to 54.22. With the National Association of Purchasing Management's report due out today, the Chicago figures raised hopes that business activity is accelerating across the US. Investors also hope that the pick-up in manufacturing will presage an improvement in labour market conditions. The latest data on the jobs market are due on Friday when the November employment report is released. The Dow was given a considerable boost by strong demand for technology stocks, particularly IBM. The poor performance from IBM over the past few months is one of the main reasons why the Dow has lagged other market indices which have set record highs in recent days. Yesterday, however, IBM rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 68 1/4 in turnover of 2.4m shares after Smith Barney, the broking house, upgraded the stock from 'hold' to 'speculative buy' on the grounds that it believed the shares have bottomed out. Other technology stocks rose in IBM's wake, with Digital Equipment up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 34 1/4 , Motorola Dollars 2 5/8 higher at Dollars 102 7/8 and Hewlett-Packard up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/2 . Neiman Marcus jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 on reports that sales from the luxury retail group's Christmas catalogue were at record levels. Ambac fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 42 5/8 after the broking house Salomon Brothers cut its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold' and removed it from its recommended list. Another stock to suffer from a Wall Street broker's downgraded was Amdahl, which slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 7 on the American Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq market, AGCO firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 on the news of its pact to be the exclusive farm equipment distributor in North America for the big manufacturer Varity. Canada TORONTO stocks ended slightly higher in active trading. Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index gained 6.30 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,282.83. Advances led declines 299 to 246, in a volume of 32.605m shares with trading value of CDollars 286.7m.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The tax cost of party gifts ALTHOUGH the political parties have an apparently insatiable appetite for funds, the tax system gives surprisingly little encouragement to political donors. There are few tax breaks for individuals and none for companies. Neither the real nor phantom Budgets proposed relaxations. A casual student of British tax law might be struck by the apparent similarities in the treatment of political and charitable donations. First, both are exempted from inheritance tax. The qualification for a political party is undemanding - two MPs returned at the last election, or a single MP combined with a national vote of at least 150,000. Since small gifts will be covered by exemptions and life-time gifts fall outside the IHT net provided the donor survives for seven years, the only conceivable relevance of this concession is if a person leaves a political bequest in their will. Second, gifts to political parties can be 'rolled-over' for capital gains tax purposes. This means that, provided both donor and party make a written election to the Inland Revenue, the donor pays no tax but the party takes on the donor's original CGT base value. Suppose that as a gesture of gratitude for the government's privatisation programme, Sid decides to donate to the Tory party 1,000 shares in British Telecom which cost him Pounds 2,000 but have risen in value to Pounds 3,000. In the unlikely event that the Conservatives felt it politic to hold a stake in BT, and assuming the shares are subsequently sold for Pounds 4,000, the Tories would be taxable on a gain of Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 4,000-Pounds 2,000). Had Sid sold his shares and then donated the proceeds, his gift would have been reduced by 40 per cent CGT to just Pounds 2,600. This way he is able to pass on the full Pounds 3,000 value. The Revenue is unable to estimate the annual cost to the Exchequer of these two rather obscure concessions. The analogy with charitable giving breaks down when it comes to income tax. Whereas philanthropists can obtain full income tax relief for their donations - whether by deed of covenant or, for larger sums, under the Gift Aid scheme - there is no equivalent for political contributions. If Sid wants to support John Major with cash rather than BT shares he will have to do so out of his after-tax income. Assuming he is a higher-rate taxpayer, a Pounds 3,000 gift will cost Sid Pounds 5,000 of gross earnings - rising to more than Pounds 7,300 if the Labour Party are in a position to implement their 59 per cent top rate of income tax and national insurance. In practice, the majority of those who make political gifts probably do so indirectly as shareholders in companies. Under the Companies Act, donations for political purposes must be disclosed in a company's accounts; hence the recent rumpus over the failure of Asil Nadir's Poly Peck International to inform its hapless shareholders of a Pounds 100,000 boost to Tory coffers. Disclosure is required, shareholder approval is not. Nevertheless, a number of companies put their political contributions to the vote. Continuing the apparent link between political generosity and ultimate financial ruin, the collapsed conglomerate, British &amp; Commonwealth, was the first to take the democratic plunge. A number of companies now seek express authority from their shareholders before making political payments. Whether or not they consult in this way, companies who have helped to pay for the current election campaign should not expect any help at all from the Revenue. It feels that political donations can never be deducted from profits for corporation tax purposes. Denial of relief is not a result of a specific statutory provision. Instead, the taxman's thumbs-down is based on an interpretation of the general rule that corporate expenditure is only deductible if incurred wholly and exclusively to benefit the company's trade. Although companies donating to the Conservative party - the beneficiary of virtually all corporate donations - doubtless believe that a fourth Tory term would be good for business, that is too remote a connection to satisfy the deductibility test.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 13 May (TANJUG) -- The General Staff of  the Army of Yugoslavia issued a statement today reiterating that  "there are no members of the Army of Yugoslavia outside of the  borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore not  in Bosnia-Herzegovina either."    The statement reads:    "Some false reports of a rather primitive type on the  participation of units of the Army of Yugoslavia in the war in  the former Yugoslavia have again appeared in some media. These  articles are trying to present the Army of Yugoslavia in the  same light as the units of the regular Croatian Army, whose  participation in combat activities in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is indisputable.    The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia has on several  occasions, in connection with this, informed Yugoslav and world  public that no members of its Army are outside the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. This fact has been acknowledged several  times in statements by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] military  officials and political functionaries of the countries whose  forces are serving within UNPROFOR.    Reiterating accusations against the Army of Yugoslavia  despite the facts in an atmosphere of a serious aggravation of  the conflict raises the question of the motives and objectives  of such risky schemes.    To assign blame for the war to an army that is not taking  part in it, and to absolve of responsibility the forces that  cause and aggravate it, cannot be seen in any other sense than  propaganda support for the escalation of the war.    The General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia again reiterates  its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, while  following with greatest attention the developments that could  affect the security of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  the survival of the Serb people wherever they live.    There are no members of the Yugoslav Army anywhere outside  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore not in  Bosnia-Herzegovina either," the statement says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed untitled report] </F>   [Text] According to the investigation's theory, the  attempt on the life of Moscow City Duma Deputy Nikolay  Moskovchenko was made by persons from the Tajik antigovernment  opposition, informed sources in the Moscow prosecutor's office  have disclosed. According to a source, the suspects were in  Moscow as part of a criminal gang connected with the drugs and  arms trade. Composite pictures of some of the gang members  suspected of the crime have been compiled, and a Russia-wide  hunt for them is under way. "We know who we are looking for,  but it will not be easy to catch them because they are migrant  elements, and by now they may already be in Afghanistan," the  source pointed out.</p>

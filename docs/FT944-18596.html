			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UBS At one level, Mr Martin Ebner, the maverick investor whose fund has built up a 19 per cent stake in UBS's registered capital, has certainly done the bank a favour. Many large Swiss companies have rightly unwound discriminatory shareholding structures in recent years on the grounds that they are inappropriate in a modern world of global investment flows. Banks thought this presented special legal difficulties, connected partly with restrictions on foreign ownership of property. Mr Ebner naturally has an interest in preserving the status quo but his attack has at least forced UBS to look again and discover that no such problems stand in the way of a modern capital structure. That said, it will require extraordinary unselfishness on the part of registered shareholders to vote away their privileges. The registered share price would inevitably fall steeply. By siding with Mr Ebner, shareholders might also increase the chances of him forcing management to pay closer attention to increasing return on shareholders' funds. Yet although increased shareholder activism is welcome in the Swiss market, Mr Ebner is still taking things a little far. UK institutions rarely intervene directly and publicly with management unless things have gone manifestly wrong. Mr Ebner is behaving less like a concerned institution and more like a buccaneering conglomerateur who wants to seize control on the basis of minority stake. Retail investors in his fund will not thank him if, having used their money to buy expensively into UBS, he fails and has to sell out at a loss.</p>

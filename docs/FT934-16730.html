			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Artists true to their imagination - William Packer admires modern art that is not avant-garde The French are still capable of surprising and gratifying us all. Just as we finally despair of the current, apparently terminal state of the visual arts, with a supposed avant-garde committed to nothing more than the glib orthodoxies of critical fashion and the market-place, up they come with an exhibition that clearly shows us that true painting and sculpture have been going on all the time. And what is it exactly, this 'true painting'? It is easier to say what it is not, for here is nothing of empty conceptualising, no striking of self-conscious attitudes, no idea-led and limited investigation or polemic, no art about art. Above all, there is nothing in which responsibility for the work as it actually appears is shuffled off onto mere process or the bare proposition of idea or image. Here is the work of artists as individuals, engrossed simply in the resolution of their work in terms of their own direct experience of the world. At the last it is neither more nor less than what they themselves have done. Responsibility is all. That said, it has its limitations. Manifeste is hardly an earnest for the future, for many of its artists are dead and none is exactly young. There is to it all a whiff of the old-fashioned, which, to be fair, is openly acknowledged in the excellent catalogue. 'Here are the crossers of the ford. They have known another Europe, one still essentially agricultural, industrial and artisan, such as it was in the 19th century, a culture from before the media . . . They were active when those ideas that shaped our epoch were in the melting-pot . . . they conducted their debates, of solitude to solitude, with an astonishing vitality, for all their apparent respect for traditional techniques, or their indifference to the spectacular developments of newer generations.' And, this being France, it is of course over-whelmingly Franco-centric, not so much a celebration or attempt to reassert the primacy of the School of Paris, but rather an acknowledgment of its survival. 'They knew how to keep their distance. In the singularity of their work, these artists have indeed written a 'parallel history', though its global sense was perhaps lost with the end of the dominance of l'Ecole de Paris.' The exhibition is drawn from the collections of the Musee nationale d'art moderne which are held at the Centre Pompidou, and of its international element - that includes Balthus, Giacometti, Picasso, Soto, Vasarely, Tapies, Fontana, Poliakoff, Miro, Calder and many more - only Francis Bacon and Anthony Caro, at a quick check, spent no extended working period in Paris. The point is not altogether gratuitous, for that missing sens global might well have been supplied, were there the works within the collections to supply them, or the curatorial will to choose them. Quite whose fault that is is an open question. We do well to remember that a narrow chauvinism, though a French word, is by no means peculiar to the French. The show is divided under headings - the painter and his model: figuration, defiguration: the skin of the work: sign and handwriting: gesture and colour: the surprises of geometry: and so forth. And, given the period, it is not hard to find the places that might have been filled by American painters such as Guston, Rothko, Motherwell, Kelly or de Kooning, or British for that matter, such as Bridget Riley, Freud, Auerbach, Kossoff. It remains true that most British painting of the period is barely known abroad. As for the Americans, one of the show's most spectacular paintings is by Joan Mitchell, an abstract expressionist who died last year at the age of 66, having been resident in Paris for many years. She is not represented at all in the current survey in London of 20th century American art. Forgetfulness or indifference? But this is a School of Paris show, even so, to be taken as it is, with all its special emphases and lacunae, and as such it is one of the most stimulating and encouraging exhibitions of near-current art to be seen in recent years. The reason, adumbrated before, is simple, with the artist shown once again in proper relation to his work, one to one, direct and physical. The imagery might be more or less figurative - Picasso's desperate, fading sexuality; the more ambiguous, charged sexuality of Balthus, the angst-ridden intensity of Giacometti, the humane despair of Bacon, the dreadful, symbolic autobiography of Zoran Music. Again we might have Pol Bury with his clicking, shifting, mechanical surfaces, Vasarely with his eye-teasing opposition of positive to negative, Morellet with his dense, meticulous cobwebs, Soto with his disrupted, moire-pattern effects, all of them testing the muscular, palpable sensation of vision. Or here are Burri and Tapies, Kemeny and Fontana, working the surface as a physical object, or Mitchell, Bazaine, Riopelle, Viera da Silva, taking the mark and the gesture at the brush's end and conjuring from it the internal landscape of the mind to which all abstract painting would seem to aspire. Whichever it is, before each particular work we confront an artist's singular engagement with work, achieved with his own hands and resolved through the medium of his own imagination and experience. This is some of the work with which my generation grew up and, the nostalgic frisson apart, it is good to see it brought once again into the light, not as a critical curiosity, but as something still vital and imaginatively potent. Painting is not dead, nor even moribund and in despair, but it is critically neglected, especially that of the more recent generations.

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Skandia to sell US unit to ITT Hartford Life SKANDIA, the Swedish insurer, is selling its US life reinsurance unit, American Skandia Life Re, to ITT Hartford Life Insurance, the big US insurance group, for SKr170m (Dollars 21.6m). The group said the disposal would enable it to concentrate on its fast-growing annuity business in the US, carried out through American Skandia Life Assurance Corp. Premiums for this business amounted to SKr4.7bn in the first nine months of 1993, more than double the SKr2.2bn achieved during 1992. American Skandia Life Re is based in Shelton, Connecticut and has annual gross premiums of around SKr1.5bn. It specialises in risk analysis and financial reinsurance for American life groups. Skandia said it is committed to US non-life reinsurance within Skandia America Corp, although premiums are being reduced as it concentrates on casualty business.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pausing to reflect on strategy - Lloyds' result gives Pitman plenty to mull over MR BRIAN PITMAN was performing his role as British banking's philosopher king yesterday as the Lloyds chief executive pondered what the future held for his bank. The bank's struggle to maintain profitability in its British retail business, and speculation that it may soon seek an acquisition, gave him plenty to mull over. Lloyds' results, the first of the UK clearing banks to report its full-year results for 1992, had some encouraging aspects for the sector. It achieved a modest rise in operating profits to Pounds 1.5bn, and its pre-tax profits rise was aided by a net Pounds 122m release of Latin American debt provisions. Among the highlights of the results were much improved earnings from foreign exchange trading, caused by currency volatility last year. This income rose from Pounds 72m in 1991 to Pounds 136m, and Mr Pitman emphasised that earnings were likely to continue at a high level while volatility remained. The bank held down its costs - reducing operating expenses by Pounds 20m and cutting its ratio of costs to income from 62.3 per cent to 61.6 per cent. It reduced its employees by 4,159, or 6 per cent, and its staff numbers are now 22 per cent down on their peak in the expansionary late-1980s. It also displayed a far better performance in its corporate banking and treasury division as provisions for lending to companies with turnover above Pounds 25m fell from Pounds 228m to Pounds 58m. The division's performance rebounded from a small loss of Pounds 1m in 1991 to healthy profit of Pounds 174m last year. But despite these achievements, the results also displayed a fundamental challenge to Lloyds in keeping up its record as Britain's most profitable clearing bank. Profits in the UK retail bank, which has traditionally generated much of its earnings, fell sharply, from Pounds 105m in 1991 to just Pounds 5m. This performance partly reflected the size of provisions on lending to small and medium-sized businesses, which Mr Pitman emphasised yesterday had been loss-making in 1992. Provisions for corporate and personal lending in the retail bank rose obstinately to Pounds 563m from Pounds 551m as other provisions fell. More fundamentally for Lloyds' long-term performance in the domestic market, it showed the domestic profit squeeze created by the combination of a fall in loan volumes and a reduction in base rates. The second produced a 32 basis point cut in domestic net interest margin, and cost the bank Pounds 115m. This prompts a fundamental question over Lloyds' future: whether its current UK business can raise loan volumes and margins - as well as fee income - enough to renew profit growth. The alterna-tives are to sit on its current capital strength, or to seek an acquisition to provide growth. Mr Pitman was not giving anything specific away yesterday, but he had many general thoughts. The first was that the bank would be happy to keep strengthening capital. 'We are going to make ourselves as strong as possible, so we can take knocks, and take advantage of any opportunities,' he said. Although the second half of the year showed a marginal growth in domestic interest-earning assets over the first, Mr Pitman insisted that the bank would remain careful. 'Chasing market share just for sheer volume always ends in tears, though the tears may take two or three years,' he said. Mr Pitman argued that Lloyds' capital strength and retail profitability were not the only reasons for it to reflect carefully on strategy. Another was uncertainty over whether Britain was in long period of low inflation and interest rates - something on which Lloyds directors have mixed views. If so - and if gilts then held an attractive enough yield over bank base rates - then it might make sense for the bank to return to the tradition of not being 'fully lent'. Instead of offering using all its funds in loans, it could instead invest in government gilts or on swaps markets. But this uncertainty over strategy does not mean Mr Pitman has abandoned his view that the British banking market is due for rationalisation. Despite the failure of the Midland bid - which cost Lloyds Pounds 4m - he believes his well-capital-ised bank should still look for ways of achieving consolidation. 'The gap between good performers and poor performers will continue to widen, and if you look at US bank mergers it is usually a strong bank taking over a weak one,' he said. This was one reason why he was sanguine at the prospect of the bank's capital rations climbing further. He did not give the impression that his thoughts were confined to looking for weakness in the TSB Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. 'I will be terribly interested to see the other bank results. I think there is a tremendous amount of hope value in other shares,' he said.</p>

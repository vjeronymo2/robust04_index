			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China today called for  regular high-level meetings supported by the developed nations  to coordinate efforts against AIDS in the developing world and  other hard-hit regions.    The call was made by Chinese Health Minister Chen Minzhang  at  a ministerial level international conference in Paris, which is  being held ahead of a Paris summit proposed by France for  December 1 on the fight against the killer disease.    China supports international and trans-regional cooperation  in the fight against AIDS, said Chen, stressing that more  attention and efforts should be given to anti-AIDS plans in  developing countries.    It urges neighboring states to coordinate their efforts to  fight AIDS by setting up information networks and developing  regional cooperation projects, he added.    Chen also briefed the conference on the Chinese Government's  anti-AIDS work and pledged to make contribution to the global  strategy against AIDS.    The two-day conference, which started today, is being  attended by ministers from 50 nations and representatives of  some world health agencies.</p>

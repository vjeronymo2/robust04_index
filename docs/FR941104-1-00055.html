			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service funded a visit in the Spring of 1994 to Moscow and Kalmykia by Dr. James Teer, Welder Wildlife Foundation, Sinton, Texas, and Dr. Fred Lindzey, Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, to report on the status of the saiga. Teer and Lindzey opined that the Kalmykian saiga population can no longer sustain itself when harvests for horns, meat, and hides are permitted for export, but that it can sustain a small offtake from hunting. Even so, they were concerned about poaching and the ease of movement of saiga parts across borders. They also felt that the Kalmykian population might rebound due to the great fecundity of saiga, along with a reduction in livestock, habitat improvement, and the control of poaching, all factors the Kalmykian authorities claim they are implementing. While realizing that an Appendix II listing would not prohibit exports, Teer and Lindzey suggested that the United States might delay proposing a CITES listing to allow time for current management measures and the population status in Kalmykia to be evaluated, and to give Kazakhstan time to become a Party to CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As a result of comments and information received concerning the amount of poaching of saiga antelope and the illegal trade in saiga horns, the use of saiga horns in combination with or as a substitute for rhinoceros horns in traditional medicines in conjunction with intensified pressures to stop the trade in rhinoceros horn, and the evidence of considerable declines in populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. t. tatarica  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> over the last two decades for various reasons, the Service has proposed that populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. t. tatarica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be included in Appendix II of CITES. The numbers of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. t. mongolica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are so low in the wild that the full protective potential of CITES seems warranted, therefore the Service has proposed that the Mongolian population be included in Appendix I of CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Urial ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ovis vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The Service requested information and comments to help clarify which populations of the urial should be included in Appendix I as a result of the 1973 listing of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ovis vignei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by India. Confusion regarding the intended inclusiveness of the original listing of 1973 arose as a result of (1) actions considered at COP2 in 1979; (2) range information presented in the CITES-adopted check list for mammals, Mammal Species of the World, 1982, edited by Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl; and, (3) distribution and synonymy given in Mammal Species of the World, 2nd Edition, 1993, edited by Wilson and Reeder. The issue was whether the original listing implies a conservative application of the name, thereby restricting the listing to only populations in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, or there was a broader intent, as presented in Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl, 1982?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five comments were received within the comment period on this problem. TRAFFIC USA passed on information from TRAFFIC India attesting to the endangered status of the urial sheep in India, and from TRAFFIC France indicating that urial hunting trips in central Asia are being organized by French companies. Dr. Steve Edwards, IUCN, supported the submission of a proposal to clarify which populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. vignei  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are to be included in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three remaining comments were from Safari Club International, Dr. Richard Mitchell, and Mr. Ron Young of Expeditions by Ron. The first two commenters argued that the intent of the original listing was to include only the population in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, while the latter noted that, according to his observation, the Transcaspian urial, the Afghan urial, the Blandford urial, and the Punjab urial are all abundant in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government of Pakistan indicated that the shapu ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. orientalis vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> = O. v. vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )), the gad ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. o. blanfordi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> = O. v. blanfordi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )), and the Punjab urial ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. o. punjabiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> = O. v. punjabiensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )) are in fair numbers in Pakistan and that there is no need to list them under CITES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, Mr. Earl Baysinger, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who attended the Convention's Plenipotentiary Meeting and COP2, provided a detailed account of the discussions that took place at that meeting of the Parties concerning the proposal and ultimate listing of the urial, and claimed that the Parties intended to include only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. vignei vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is, therefore, proposing that only  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. vignei vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir be retained in Appendix I, and that all other populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> O. vignei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be included in Appendix II for biological and similarity of appearance purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Box turtles ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp.). Prior to COP8, the New York Zoological Society recommended listing box turtles in Appendix II. However, the Service did not have sufficient information on trade in these species, and did not submit a proposal for consideration at COP8. Since then the Service has accumulated data in its Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) on exports and imports of box turtles in an effort to obtain appropriate trade information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes the four species ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. carolina, T. coahuila, T. nelsoni,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. ornata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), with 11 subspecies recognized among them.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene coahuila  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is currently listed in Appendix I of CITES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene nelsoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs in a small fragmented range on the west coast of Mexico, while  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. ornata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is found over a large area of the midwestern United States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Terrapene carolina  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has the largest range, occurring from Canada to Mexico as far as Yucatan, and from the Atlantic coast west into approximately the eastern edge of the prairie in the Midwest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

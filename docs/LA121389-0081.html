			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> BOYS TOWN USA PROJECT APPROVED  </P> <P> Despite a last-minute objection from a resident, the County Board of  Supervisors Tuesday granted final approval to Boys Town USA to build five homes  on 13 acres northeast of Mission Viejo near Trabuco Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The board voted 5 to 0 to approve the project following a final appeal by Ray  Chandos, co-founder of the Rural Canyon Conservation Fund. He claimed that  changes had been made to plans since the last public hearing two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Chandos, who lives in view of the project that is located on a ridge between  Rose and Hickey canyons, said the changes should be reviewed by the public and  appropriate government agencies before the board gives its final approval.  </P> <P> But Michael Ruane, director of planning for the Environmental Management  Agency, said the latest changes did not require more formal review and in fact  "strengthen the project."  </P> <P> Chandos has filed suit seeking a court order to set aside the county Planning  Commission's approval of the project. The suit claims that the project is  inconsistent with parts of the county general plan.  </P> <P> Residents opposed to the project say they are not against Boys Town or the  project, but to its location on a ridgeline. They are concerned that it will  set a precedent for building on ridgelines. GEORGE FRANK  </P></p>

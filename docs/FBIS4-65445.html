			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexander Wendt and Robert Vernier: "Wooing for </F> Red Socks"]    [Text] Wolfgang Kurzweg has little liking for the  "blessings of the western community of values": "Robbery,  violence, and fraud," the chairman of the Brandenburg  Republikaner preaches, have swamped the former GDR. Saxony's  Republikaner chief Guenter Bernard added his comments on market  economy: "A system of money and crooks."    Franz Schoenhuber, federal chairman of the right-wing  extremist Republikaner, is sending his men to catch votes in the  east with anticapitalist statements. The targets are the  typical losers in the change: people over 50, whom unification  deprived of their jobs and their firm view of the world. Old  cadres are supposed to build the bridges for the right-wing  extremists.    Saxony's Republikaner chief Bernard is using familiar  vocabulary in his efforts. In the time of the GDR the professor  of sociology taught in the "Scientific Communism" section in  Leipzig and kept his colleagues toeing the party line as party  secretary of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany].    Brandenburg's Wolfgang Kurzweg was also an SED official. The  professor was the head of the central Animal Hygiene Institute  in Eberswalde -- there party membership was compulsory.  Kurzweg's career as a Republikaner was controlled by the  headquarters in Bonn. "A high-ranking member of the party  leadership" asked him to take over the land chairmanship. "They  saw that I had experience with administration and leadership."  And good connections with the clients. In the east,  Schoenhuber is wooing the same potential voters as the Party of  Democratic Socialism: "People who do not agree with  reunification as it is," as Kurzweg describes them.    Schoenhuber has been wooing party cadres and National  People's Army [NVA] soldiers right from the beginning of his  expansion toward the east, "where many things have remained more  German than in the satiated and gluttonous west." SED Professor  Kurzweg is helped by his deputy, NVA Colonel Hermann Flemming.    In Saxony, Republikaner chief Bernard is proud of the former  NVA officers, who now serve in the Bundeswehr. With great  pleasure Berlin's Republikaner chairman Werner Mueller, a former  government official of the Social Democratic Party of Germany,  also points "to several former GDR officers." Schoenhuber's  troop in Thuringia is headed by former SED official Goetz  Rudloff.    Schoenhuber's wooing of the red socks has had little result.  The comrades in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are now  investigating Land Manager Juergen Zedler, who is suspected of  having cooperated with the Stasi. Only 3,440 of the 24,000  Republikaner members come from the new laender. And in Leipzig  the red-brown socks may not even run for local elections: They  did not get the 360 signatures necessary.</p>

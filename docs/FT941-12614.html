			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sutherland urges new global forum Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday called on world leaders to establish a new high-level forum for international economic co-operation, with members drawn from developing and former communist countries as well as the industrialised nations. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Sutherland said new co-operative structures were needed to deal effectively with global economic issues and problems. Existing mechanisms were not up to the job. For example, the Group of Seven rich industrialised nations 'self-evidently excludes most of the world's population and a large number of the world's substantial and fast-growing economies'. Mr Sutherland was also critical of the lack of co-ordination among the various international institutions, for instance in dealing with Russia's difficulties. The successful completion last December of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, if fully exploited, 'should mean nothing less than a new start for sustainable growth and a new system of collective economic security for the world', Mr Sutherland said. It had also shown that economies were 'too mutually interdependent to reach their full potential in isolation or at cross purposes'. World leaders should follow through the logic of the round to put in place new co-operative structures that would recognise the realities of the next century. 'We cannot continue with the majority of the world's people excluded from participation in global economic management,' he said. The G7 summits have come in for increasing criticism in recent years as irrelevant and ineffective, partly because of their restricted membership and partly because of inadequate institutional support. Mr Sutherland's proposed alternative would bring a wider range of countries together at prime ministerial and trade and finance minister level, with institutional support coming from the IMF, World Bank and the future World Trade Organisation which will supersede Gatt next year.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Trouble spots Algeria: The number of foreign nationals killed in Algeria over the past three months now stands at 23, writes Francis Ghiles. The latest incident took place last Tuesday night when 12 Croats working on a water project were knifed to death. Many foreign companies repatriated the families of their employees working in Algeria in the wake of the first killings last September. Since then a trickle has grown into a flood though it is difficult to estimated how many of the roughly 50,000 foreigners working in Algeria remain. The US, Russia and many European countries have also repatriated the families of staff at their embassies in Algiers. French tours operators have cancelled all their bookings for winter holidays in the Algerian Sahara. Foreign affairs ministries throughout the west are following the British foreign office line, which is to discourage tourism and travelling to Algeria except for essential business reasons. Russia: Cancellations, long delays and overloading of passengers on internal flights are frequent, particularly in the Transcaucasus. It is not known whether maintenance procedures are always properly observed. For safety travellers are advised where possible to fly directly to their destination on an international flight originating outside Russia. There have been widespread outbreaks of diphtheria affecting adults and children. Visitors are advised to seek medical advice concerning this and other recommended inoculations. Do not drink tap water. Incidents of mugging, theft and pickpocketing in all cities, especially St. Petersburg and Moscow, are increasing.</p>

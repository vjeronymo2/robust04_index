			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, since preserving a language and ensuring its continuation is generally one of the first steps taken toward strengthening a group's identity, activities proposed under this program announcement will contribute to the social development of a native community and significantly contribute to its path toward self-sufficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans recognizes that eligible applicants must have the opportunity to develop their own language plans, technical capabilities and access to the necessary financial and technical resources in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. ANA also recognizes that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities to address specific language concerns at various levels. This program announcement reflects these special needs and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B.

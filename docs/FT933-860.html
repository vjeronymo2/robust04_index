			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Say yes to freedom - Architecture I suppose it is inevitable that a critic writing about architecture towards the end of the 20th century is going to be charged with scepticism, arrogance or even hostility towards the architectural establishment. Anyone who questions objectively the value of the achievements of the profession in the last 50 years will be seen, not as broad minded and catholic, but as narrow minded and prejudiced. These thoughts are encouraged, not by resentful letters from architects and art bureaucrats, but by the broader debate which has been prompted by the government's decision to 'deregulate' the title of architect and allow fresh air to blow into the closed shop. In the Queen's Speech opening the next session of parliament a deregulation bill will propose, in the context of a wish to scrap as much government red tape as possible, the end of the statutory protection of the title, 'architect'. At present only someone registered with the nominally independent Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom (Arcuk) can legally call himself an architect. This body was set up in 1931 to regulate the membership, conduct and education of the profession. It was necessary because governments have always questioned the monopolistic powers of the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba)  - a body that sets professional standards and (until recently) established fixed scales of fees. Inevitably what has happened over the years is that Arcuk has really been run by the weight of Riba members on its councils, and the sense of an unfair monopoly remains. When he was interviewed recently in this newspaper the current president of the Riba, Frank Duffy - a man of great personal conviction and integrity - squealed a great deal about the dangers of deregulation. But what is odd is that the profession does not welcome the freedom it is being offered. Deregulation will allow the Riba to ensure that its own standards are worth having because of their merits, not because they are officially protected. Good architects today are not marginalised by the building process. In a freer climate it does not follow that only the cheapest and the worst will thrive. The nub of this regulation or deregulation problem is that the Riba feels wrong footed by the government. The profession should have grasped the nettle a long time ago and taken the lead in setting the highest possible architectural and environmental standards. Instead, it appears that during the 1960s a silent majority of salaried architects allowed a managerial profession to develop which is largely without imagination or awareness of the client's needs. The Riba's identity crisis has increased recently: is it a learned society or a trade union? Deregulation offers freedom - something people often find difficult. Architectural educational standards will continue to be supervised by the Riba, so the Institute should take the lead and promote the ideas of imaginative architecture and sound building. It should welcome a more competitive climate. If the mediocre architects - and there are lots - go to the wall, then so be it: they will be no loss. The chance to open windows to all who build has arrived. How tragic and how typical of architects to fight a rearguard action instead of offering an inspiring leadership emphasising quality. ***** The growing interest of the public in the visual arts and architecture gets a boost this week with the launch of a new art magazine, Tate - The Art Magazine, which is published in close association with the Tate Gallery in London. In the first issue the artist Bridget Riley writes inspiringly about the need for a new gallery of modern art in London. This debate has been masterminded to date by the director of the Tate Gallery, Nicholas Serota, but now it has to become a much more public issue. In the same way that deregulation of the architectural profession should make architecture itself much closer to the client and the community the creation of a major national centre for contemporary art should involve the public in art in a new way. Will the Tate rescue the great Giles Gilbert Scott power station on London's Bankside as its new home and link it to the City with a new bridge? The Tate debate has just begun but it could bring art and architecture into public prominence in a positive way.</p>

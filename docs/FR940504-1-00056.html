The trustee(s) should ensure respondent confidentiality. 59 FR 1183.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One important aspect of survey administration is the determination of an appropriate response rate. The Department believes that trustee officials should obtain as high a response rate as possible, consistent with the requirements of reasonable cost, in order to ensure reliable inferences to the general population. Low response rates pose a risk of compromising the statistical validity of the survey when nonrespondents have systematically different values than respondents. Another risk associated with low response rates is that estimates of response variance may be significantly affected such that the indicated confidence of survey results is questioned. Since the likelihood of these risks cannot be determined unless nonrespondents have been surveyed, trustee officials should minimize nonresponse in the final survey to the extent practicable. For example, trustee officials could design the survey instrument so that individuals must decide whether to respond before the exact nature of the environmental insult is revealed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAA has proposed that response rates shall not fall below 70 percent. The Department solicits comments on whether there should be a specified minimum response rate and, if so, whether 70 percent is a reasonable floor. Further, the Department solicits comments regarding the administrative costs associated with alternative response rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another important aspect of survey administration is selection of the mode of administration. The three generally used CV survey administration modes are in-person, mail, and telephone. There are advantages and disadvantages of each method, and often the selection of the appropriate method is dependent on a number of factors such as cost, turn-around time, desired response rate, type of information to be conveyed, use of visual aids, required population coverage, and the ultimate use of the survey results. For example, telephone surveys can approximate simple random sampling of households through random digit dialing; can produce fast results; are relatively easy to administer; and are less expensive than in-person interviews. On the other hand, visual aids cannot be used; interviews need to be relatively short; interviewer bias may be involved; and individuals without telephones are necessarily omitted from the sample. Self-administered mail surveys are the least costly of the three methods. However, probability sampling is difficult; respondents can review the survey before deciding to participate (imparting self-selection bias); there can be no random selection within the household and no control of question sequencing; and a higher number of incomplete responses are likely to result because there is no interviewer to motivate the respondent. Finally, in-person interviews permit random selection of the respondent within the household; maintain control of question ordering; allow the use of visual materials; and generate high response rates. In-person interviews, though, are the most costly method to administer; require complex field operations; involve the use of many documents and forms (e.g., calling cards, interviewer evaluation forms, verification forms); and may involve interviewer bias. For a more in-depth discussion of each method, see EPA, ``Survey Management Handbook,'' vol. II, pp. 24&hyph;35, 230/12&hyph;84&hyph;002, December, 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that selection of a mode of administration should be left to the discretion of trustee officials, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. Nonetheless, the Department believes that in-person interviews provide certain advantages in the natural resource damage assessment context. Therefore, if trustee officials select a mode of administration other than in-person interviews, they should document the factors that led them to reject in-person interviews. The Department solicits comments on whether the final regulation or its preamble should state a preference for in-person interviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While recognizing that mail surveys can provide invaluable information for many academic studies and regulatory purposes (e.g., the U.S. decennial census), the Department believes that mail surveys at this time lack certain features that are desirable for use in the natural resource damage assessment context. Telephone surveys also have limitations. A CV survey designed for natural resource damage assessment purposes is likely to impart a large amount of information to respondents causing interviews to be lengthy and often complex. In-person interviews offer the opportunity to motivate the respondents and to hold their interest by providing important information in a graphic and pictorial format and asking interactive questions regarding the respondents' understanding and acceptance of key features of the survey instrument. In-person interviews also permit interviewers to record verbatim responses to important open-ended questions. Such information may be critical in demonstrating that a trustee official has adhered to regulatory standards for the design and administration of the CV study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also believes that trustee officials should consider the use of modes of administration other than in-person interviews during the survey instrument development stage. For example, a telephone survey may be an appropriate and cost-effective method to test a design feature such as question ordering or the understanding of technical terms. Further, the Department is interested in comparative empirical testing of other administration modes, such as random digit dialing for initial contacts, followed by mailed descriptive information and visual materials, culminating with a telephone survey. If such testing demonstrates that other modes can produce the type of information and results comparable to in-person interviews, the Department would consider encouraging trustee officials to use those methods for the final survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the mode of administration, the Department believes that all surveys should be administered by a survey research organization, as provided in NOAA's proposed rule. The Department believes that use of a survey research organization is necessary because the preparation and administration of a general population survey require practical survey expertise and substantial logistical support. The Department also believes that trustee officials should select a survey research organization that has implemented procedures to meet the standards outlined in either the Council of American Survey Research Organizations' Code of Standards for Survey Research or the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Code of Professional Ethics and Practices. Use of such an organization would help to maintain reliability and confidentiality. Further, such organizations are likely to have proven track records and the staff necessary to conduct a survey in accordance with any regulatory standards. Nevertheless, the Department solicits comments regarding the requirement that surveys be administered by an experienced survey research organization. Further, comments regarding alternative codes of standards for survey administration are solicited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

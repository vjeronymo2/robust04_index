			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Mubarak accuses Iran over bombings PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday accused Iran of attempting to destabilise his government by sponsoring recent bombings and attacks on tourist targets in the country. 'For sure, Iran is fundamentally behind this,' Mr Mubarak said in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Mubarak's remarks are the most explicit allegation he has made of direct Iranian attempts to bring down his government. They mark a further deterioration in relations between Egypt and Iran after sharp exchanges between the two governments earlier this year. The president warned remaining Iranian diplomats in Cairo that they were being closely watched and he would not hesitate to throw them out if there was evidence linking them with the wave of bombings. Mr Mubarak avoided making a direct connection between Iran and the bomb attack on the World Trade Centre in New York last month, but added that an Egyptian returned to the US last week to face trial had provided 'full information' about the group which was responsible. He said Mr Mahmoud Abu Halima, one of five men held in connection with the New York bombing, had given details about alleged quarrels over money that he had with Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who has denied any involvement in the explosion. Mr Mubarak, who tomorrow visits Germany before travelling on to Britain and the US, said the men responsible for recent attacks in Egypt had previously been in Afghanistan, were trained by Iran and had gone via Sudan and Libya to Egypt. More than 40 people have died in clashes this month between Egyptian security forces and Islamic extremists. Mr Mubarak said the violence had been 'very shocking' but pledged it would not destabilise his government. Last peace train, Page 6</p>

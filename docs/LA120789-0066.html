			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: BEST OF '89'S FOOD, NUTRITION AND FITNESS BOOKS  </P> <P> "There is no frigate like a book," wrote Emily Dickinson, describing  literature's power to transport. True enough, but some books need take us no  farther than our own kitchens to provide year-round pleasure.  </P> <P> To our mind, the best place to make headway with holiday shopping is at a local  bookstore, especially the food, nutrition and fitness section, with a side trip  to the cookbook department. To help you choose gifts, we've listed the cream of  this year's crop:  </P> <P> Topping the roster is the splendid "Beyond Cholesterol" (Johns Hopkins  University Press, $18.95). If you want to learn once and for all about  cardiovascular disease, this is a first-rate choice. Dr. Peter Kwiterovich,  director of the Lipid Research Clinic at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,  guides you step-by-step through the maze of evidence about risk factors. He  explains how to modify them with diet, exercise and, if necessary, drugs. The  book also contains recipes, complete with nutrient analyses.  </P> <P> Speaking of recipes, we have two cookbook suggestions, both designed to promote  a heart-healthy diet. One, "The American Heart Assn. Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol  Cookbook" edited by Scott Grundy MD (Times Books, $18.95) opens with an  overview of diet and cholesterol links, but focuses mainly on buying and  preparing food. Recipes range from low-fat appetizers to such apparently rich  desserts as chocolate souffle with vanilla sauce.  </P> <P> The second, "Mediterranean Light" by Martha Rose Shulman (Bantam Books,  $21.95), will tingle taste buds with dishes like classic ratatouille,  orange-flavored North African beet salad, hot yogurt soups and chicken  bouillabaisse. Again, nutritional information is provided. Seasonal menus are a  nice additional touch, especially useful for the novice.  </P> <P> On another tack, how long can you keep chicken in the refrigerator? How do you  tell whether eggs are fresh? How do you know if nuts in the shell are stale?  The answer to these and hundreds of other questions appear in the  well-researched "Keeping Food Fresh" by Janet Bailey (Harper and Row, $10.95).  Judging from the questions we receive every week, this would be a great choice  for almost anyone on your list.  </P> <P> Pomegranates may be among the oldest fruits ever eaten. Yet to millions,  they're a new food, only recently seen in the upscale section of the  supermarket. Cassava, a dietary staple in Africa, is similarly alien to most  Americans. In "The New Foods: A Shopper's Guide With Recipes" (Henry Holt,  $19.95), Camille Cusumano provides descriptions and recipes for foods and herbs  new to the supermarket scene.  </P> <P> For athletes, both casual and serious, we suggest "The Sports Nutrition  Guidebook" by Nancy Clark, (Leisure Press, $12.95). Beginning with basic  nutrition advice, Clark also considers fluid replacement, carbohydrate loading,  pre-event meals and use of supplements. Using case studies from her clinical  experience, she presents reasonable solutions to nutrition problems (including  weight control) faced by athletes and nonathletes alike. A final section gives  recipes with analysis of carbohydrate, protein, fat and calorie content.  </P> <P> Another choice for athletes is the recently revised "Food For Sport" by Nathan  Smith MD and Bonnie Worthington-Roberts Ph.D. (Bull Publishing, $9.95), a  sports-medicine physician and a nutritionist, respectively. Giving tips to the  selection of foods and fluids, it also explains nutrient needs geared to  particular sports and discusses nutrition for athletes of all ages, beginning  in elementary school.  </P> <P> For those whose interest in food extends beyond mealtime, consider "Food in  History" by Reay Tannahill, a British historian and novelist (Crown Publishers,  $19.95). First published in 1973, this completely revised volume covers 500,000  years of fascinating information and anecdotes about the history of man's diet.  </P> <P> Another wonderful gift is "Pomp and Sustenance: 25 Centuries of Sicilian Food"  by Mary Taylor Simeti (Alfred Knopf, $25). While there are practical  concessions to dietary concern (such as the suggestion to broil eggplant rather  than fry it), many recipes here don't fit easily into the daily routine of a  prudent diet. No matter, the interweaving of recipes and Sicilian history and  the wealth of beautiful illustrations are reason enough to enjoy this book.  </P> <P> For anyone interested in women's history, try "Never Too Thin" by Robert  Pollack Seid (Prentice Hall, $19.95). The author, a social historian, traces  the evolution of the widespread dissatisfaction with weight and body shape that  has plagued generations of women.  </P> <P> Last, we think there's no better gift in print than a subscription to the  "Tufts Diet and Nutrition Letter." Order from the Tufts University Diet and  Nutrition Letter, Subscription Dept., P.O. Box 57843, Boulder, Colo.  80321-7843, or call (800) 937-9465. The first subscription is $20; subsequent  orders are $16. The newsletter will provide friends and relatives on a holiday  list with accurate, up-to-date information on nutrition all year long.  </P> <P> Keep Eggs in Carton When Refrigerated  </P> <P> Question: A friend told me that it's better to store eggs in the carton than in  the egg rack on the refrigerator door. Is that true? Second, how long can you  keep fresh eggs in the refrigerator?  </P> <P> Answer: Eggs lose moisture and absorb odor through the shell, so keep them in  the carton, not the door. Also, the temperature on the door is warmer than in  the interior, leading to more rapid deterioration in quality.  </P> <P> Provided eggs are clean and unbroken, they can be stored safely for as long as  four to five weeks. They will not, however, be at the same level of quality as  they were when you first brought them home. Deterioration will be both in  flavor and texture. Ideally, they are best used up within a week, especially if  they are to be eaten as is.  </P> <P> You can freeze whole eggs that you don't use up within a reasonable period.  Simply pierce the yolk with a fork and stir it slowly to mix the yolk and white  together. Do not beat it, because incorporating air bubbles will cause the eggs  to dry out as they freeze. You'll also need to add sugar or salt (depending how  you eventually will use them) to stabilize the texture. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt  or 1/2 teaspoon sugar per cup of eggs.  </P> <P> Individual eggs can be frozen in ice-cube trays, then unmolded and stored in  plastic bags.  </P> <P> Q: I was in a health-food store looking at supplements for athletes. The sales  clerk advised me that carnitine supplements can help improve performance in  endurance contests. Is there any truth to that?  </P> <P> A: No. Carnitine is an amino-acid derivative that functions in the metabolism  of fatty acids. Several years ago, Italy's World Cup soccer team publicly  attributed its success to carnitine supplements, but the claim is unfounded.  </P> <P> Carnitine is found in abundant amounts of animal flesh as well as in dairy  products, but in only limited amounts in vegetables. But that is not important,  even to strict vegetarians, because it is produced in the liver and kidney.  Thus, while carnitine is essential, healthy individuals have all they need.  </P> <P> Supplements may actually be counterproductive. The reason is that they usually  contain two different forms of the compound, and one inhibits the action of the  other. In short, your diet and body will provide all the carnitine you need,  and supplements are best left on the health-food shelf.  </P> <P> Q: During the past several years I have acquired 25 unwanted pounds. It took  bad news to motivate me to attack the problem: My doctor says my blood sugar is  too high. He advised me to follow a sensible, low-calorie diet and to come back  for reevaluation in a few weeks. I know how to cut calories, but is there  anything special I should be doing because of the blood-sugar problem?  </P> <P> A: No. A sensible, low-calorie diet, just as your doctor advised, is really all  that's needed. However, that does imply certain ground rules. First, fats are  the most concentrated form of calories. But it is especially useful to cut down  on saturated fat, which drives blood cholesterol up and increases risk of heart  disease.  </P> <P> Second, to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet, it's important to make the  calories you do consume count. That means it's a good idea to dispense with  sugar.  </P> <P> This translates into a diet based on skim milk and low-fat dairy products, two  or three eggs a week, small servings of lean meat, fish or poultry, and  alternates of dried beans, plenty of fresh vegetables and fresh fruits --  especially those rich in vitamins A and C -- and enriched breads and cereals.  </P> <P> You know best how drastically your own diet must be revamped to fit this model.  For some people it takes no more than cutting back on portion sizes, trimming  off excess fat and eliminating occasional desserts or calorie-rich,  nutrient-poor snacks.  </P> <P> Others realize that the problems with their diet go well beyond an excess of  calories. For many, difficult work schedules have led to dietary habits in need  of major reshaping. These individuals might do well to seek the help of a  registered dietitian.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been officially announced in Rabat that  Morocco has again rejected any OAU participation in carrying out  the self-determination referendum in the Western Sahara, which  the United Nations has set for the end of 1994.    This confirmation came after the Moroccan Government  received  a message from the UN secretary general in which he informed  Morocco of the appointment of two OAU representatives charged  with the task of monitoring the work of the voter identification  commission for the people invited to participate in the  elections.</p>

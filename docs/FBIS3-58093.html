			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Swedish European Affairs Minister </F> Ulf Dinkelspiel by Inger Jagerhorn; date, place not given]    [Text] An extraordinary summit between Sweden and the  heads of government of the EU [European Union] countries could  be held to resolve the final tricky issues in Sweden's  negotiations for membership of the Union. At this hard  bargaining session, contributions to Swedish farmers could be  played off against the size of Sweden's membership fee.    European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel is bearing this in  mind as a possibility, and a meeting has been preliminarily  penciled in by EU president Greece for late February/early March.    Ulf Dinkelspiel is preparing himself for the final spurt in  the negotiations. At the same time he is very aware of the  opposition to the EU in public opinion.    The notorious EU optimist admits that the "yes" side's  uncritical praise for membership could have reduced its  credibility. He even went so far as to mention certain  disadvantages.    Ulf Dinkelspiel, star negotiator under the Social Democratic  government and today a Moderate Coalition Party minister, said  that much could happen in the very last phase of the  negotiations. A possibility that he does not rule out is that  the size of the Swedish contribution to the EU budget could be  played off against the contributions which Swedish farmers will  receive from the EU.    Sweden's membership contribution to the EU has been  estimated  at 22-24 billion kronor per year. This gigantic sum will be a  further strain on Sweden's already overstretched state coffers.  The Swedish negotiators are trying on the one hand to persuade  the EU to change the basis for calculating Sweden's membership  contribution, and on the other to win agreement for phasing-in  during a transitional period.    But so far this has fallen on deaf ears in the EU. One  compromise could be found instead in smaller subsidies for  Swedish farmers from the EU's agriculture budget.    In an interview with DAGENS NYHETER on the eve of the final  spurt of the negotiations, Ulf Dinkelspiel said that for the  time being at least each issue is being negotiated on "its own  merits." But he spoke more about the importance of regional  support than about the importance of agriculture. Sweden wants  to continue to pursue its own regional policy, and it also wants  support from the EU's structural fund.    Very different and much smaller sums are involved here than  in the case of agriculture.    When Swedish influence in terms of the number of votes  Sweden  has in the EU's decisionmaking body, the Council of Ministers,  is to be determined, a similar give-and-take situation could  arise.    The EU has offered Sweden four votes, while Portugal with  just over a million more inhabitants than Sweden has five. The  Netherlands with 15 million inhabitants also has five votes.  Asked whether Sweden could be forced to "buy" the fifth vote  through lower agricultural subsidies or higher membership  contributions, Dinkelspiel replied:    "We, like our opposite number, must be prepared to give and  take in the final phase of negotiations."    Exhausted but happy, the Swedish negotiators traveled home  in  the days before Christmas. The long awaited "ketchup effect" (a  lot at once after several unsuccessful attempts) had  materialized.    Ulf Dinkelspiel exudes satsisfaction. He thinks that there  is a platform to be happy about. The EEA [European Economic  Area] agreement is in place, the GATT negotiations have been  sorted out, and in the EU negotiations the environmental issues  are among those that have been settled.    Dinkelspiel's assessment of the EEA agreement, which creates  a region of European economic cooperation embracing 18  countries, is that in material terms it is better than expected,  but in institutional terms is worse:    "For me it is incomprehensible that the `no' side is so  strongly critical of the EEA agreement because of its  institutional solutions (Swedish influence) and then opposes EU  membership."    He pointed out that the EEA agreement also embraces Sweden's  state alcohol monopoly and transport subsidies that are so  important for Norrland and the forestry industry.    "Regardless of what happens we are bound by the EEA  agreement. The membership negotiations do not really change  anything on these points. They are therefore of minor interest."    The uproar in Rostanga [village near Malmo] involving the  Ica  [Swedish grocery chain] storekeeper who challenged the state  alcohol monopoly on New Year's Day made many Swedes ask: Just  who is it who actually decides?    "In the EU it is the governments of all the countries which  decide jointly," the European affairs minister said. "But if  there are problems of interpretation, as in the present case, it  is the EU court which decides in the final instance."    Nor does the question of summer cottages worry him. On the  subject of the sale of Swedish leisure homes to EU citizens he  said:    "I do not think that this is a major issue either for the  country as a whole or for the electorate."    If the timetable is to hold, the negotiations must be  completed in seven or eight weeks' time. Sweden will not wait  for slower countries, the European affairs minister stressed:    "It would run contrary to Swedish interests to make our  negotiations dependent on those of other countries."    Norway and Finland are demanding transitional arrangements  in  the field of agriculture which would mean continued border  controls. Dinkelspiel affirmed that it is Sweden's goal to  abolish them in January 1995. Temporary border controls could  be introduced in the Nordic area.    Once the negotiations have been completed Dinkelspiel's  people will take two or three weeks to draft a departmental  memorandum on the results. It will go to the Riksdag and then  be sent out for comment for three months. Proposed legislation  on membership would not come before the summer, the European  affairs minister said.    But a referendum could very well take place before then, he  pointed out. A popular version of the result of the  negotiations will be published.    The whole government machine is chugging along as if  membership were on the cards, whereas public opinion poll  figures show that almost 60 percent of the Swedish people are  opposed to membership. What does Ulf Dinkelspiel think is the  essential reason for this opposition?    "Uncertainty," he replied. "Many interacting factors," he  added, without being specific. He repreated his criticism of  the Social Democrats:    "When Sweden's largest party does not make up its mind, it  is  not easy for the voters to do so. Uncertainty is given  legitimacy."    Ulf Dinkelspiel reiterated his prime arguments for  membership: peace, jobs, prosperity.    Are these arguments believable? Look at Yugoslavia, look at  the millions in Western Europe who are permanently unemployed....    For Ulf Dinkelspiel this is simply confirmation of the fact  that the European ideal has still not been fully achieved.    This time he did not say that better information will have  an  effect on the negative body of public opinion. Instead he spoke  of commitment. Not only on the part of politicians, but also on  the part of all Swedes who want a "yes."    "It is possible that we are allowing the 'no' side too much  room for maneuver."    Is it not possible that the "yes" side's glossy picture of  the EU as the solution to all problems has made the arguments  less believable? Should it not draw attention to the problems  and produce analyses in order to win people's confidence?    "Yes, I believe so," Ulf Dinkelspiel cried. "It is important  to draw attention to the fact that membership has both  advantages and disadvantages."    Mention a disadvantage!    "One of them is the net cost to Sweden. And in some respects  the bureaucracy is something that I would want to be involved in  reducing as a member. I will work for greater openness."    Ulf Dinkelspiel has the EU emblem in his lapel and an EU  watch around his wrist. Could these not be taken as signs that  he is more on the side of the EU than that of Sweden in the  negotiations?    He sees them as symbols of the European ideal.    "The negotiations are not some zero-sum game. It is a  question of finding joint solutions which are of mutual  interest."</p>

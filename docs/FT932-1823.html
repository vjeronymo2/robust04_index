			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Bradford &amp; Bingley sets up in Germany BRADFORD &amp; BINGLEY, the seventh largest British building society, is seeking to become the first non-German institution to establish a German building society. The society said yesterday that it planned to set up a Bausparkasse - the German equivalent - in Hamburg. It would be the first UK society to operate in Germany, although others have operations in France and Spain. This is a significant development for the German home loans market which has hitherto been served almost exclusively by domestic institutions, with the exception of loans made through the branches of foreign-owned banks. It is also the latest step towards continental European growth by societies. Halifax, the largest society, disclosed earlier this year that it had applied for a licence to take retail deposits for mortgage lending in Spain. The German housing finance market is seen as attractive as there is an acute shortage of housing in western and eastern Germany. Home owners are fewer as a percentage of the population than in other industrialised countries. Other UK societies are thought to have investigated the possibility of establishing operations in Germany, but have been put off by the regulatory requirements. Mr John Smith, Bradford &amp; Bingley's finance director, said the plan was to set up a Bausparkasse with capital of DM10m (Pounds 4m), the legal minimum. The aim was to take deposits as well as to make loans within the German market. Marketing for the subsidiary would be handled by a new company to be founded with German partners. This would sell life insurance policies, as well as loans to finance house building. Mr Smith declined to give full details of the plans pending approval for the venture from the Bundesamt fur das Kreditwesen, Germany's federal banking authority. He said that an application had been lodged and approval was likely to be granted within two months. Mr Smith said it was 'a sensible and modest way' to enter the German market and would avoid over-dependence on wholesale funds. Abbey National, the former society, has been hit by bad debts on commercial property loans in France and Spain.</p>

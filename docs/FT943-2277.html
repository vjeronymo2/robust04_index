			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: BB Biotech increases net asset value 16% BB Biotech, a start-up investment company specialising in biotechnology securities, has raised its net asset value 16 per cent to SFr2,493 (Dollars 1,953), in the four months from the end of April to the end of August. The company already has one of the largest biotech funds in the world with an investment volume of SFr487m. It has concentrated on the securities of only five US companies since its start-up last November, and has outperformed the CBOE Biotechnology Index by 25 per cent. BB Biotech raised SFr325m in its initial public offering of shares in Zurich and a further SFr150m in February through a free warrants rights issue. It is managed by Bellevue Asset Management. Almost two thirds of its funds are in Biogen and Genentech, with the remainder in Amgen and a small new stake in Affymax, a California-based leader in combinatorial chemistry. Its position in Alza, the drug delivery system specialist, has been sold.</p>

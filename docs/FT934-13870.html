			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / US Navy stops ship in Haiti blockade A US Navy frigate briefly stopped and boarded a ship from Belize bound for Haiti yesterday in the first maritime interception since the reimposition of a UN oil and weapons blockade on the Caribbean country aimed at restoring its exiled president, agencies report from Port-au-Prince. The ship's master reported he was carrying cement, an item not prohibited under the embargo. The ship was allowed to proceed after an hour-long inspection. Six US and three Canadian navy ships are off the coast of Haiti to enforce the embargo under Operation Support Democracy, and a French frigate is on the way to join them. Britain and the Netherland said they would send frigates, and Argentina is also considering sending vessels. In Haiti, Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the army commander, ignored demands to respect the UN-brokered plan for the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers snapped shots of him smoking and joking. Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans, he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.' The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow Mr Aristide to return to office on October 30. Gen Cedras was a key part of the military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide - Haiti's first popularly elected president - in 1991. The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a gallon and there were no queues. But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet preparing for Mr Aristide's return. The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'.</p>

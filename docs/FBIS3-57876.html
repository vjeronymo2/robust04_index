			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fininvest President Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Mario Sechi; place and date not given: "Berlusconi: There Is a  Limit to Taxes"]    [Text] He has not tasted the bitter cup yet but he already  wants to change the Constitution to put the brakes on a tax  mechanism that has gone crazy and is chopping up the savings of  Italians. Silvio Berlusconi proposes a maximum tax levy (35  percent) and his allies are [National Rebirth Pact leader]  Mariotto Segni (who has criticized Ciampi's maneuver), [Radical  leader] Pannella, and the Northern League. And those who  thought that Berlusconi was ready to incite a tax revolt,  perhaps being struck by [League ideologue] Miglio's ideas, have  been disappointed. The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has made  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto's and  [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema's moustaches stand on end with  these words: "More than 47 percent of what we produce ends up  in the State's coffers. This means that each Italian works from  1 January to 28 July for the government and works for his family  only from 29 July on." The PDS response was immediate.    [Sechi] Occhetto has called your proposals demagoguery and  has added: "Berlusconi should tell me how many old people he  wants to turn out into the street, how many schools and  hospitals he wants to close." What is your reply?    [Berlusconi] What old people on the street. How dare  Occhetto talk of old people. He is the one who has contributed  to destroying the real value of wages and pensions by forcing  old people to live in poverty, by being the accomplice of a  system that should have been opposed and not supported by an  opposition party. My proposal focuses on increasing wealth and  employment in Italy. It has been primarily the demagogic  choices made by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] and the PDS  that have damaged the national economy.    [Sechi] The tax ceiling is just the foretaste of a broader  program for economic recovery. Can you provide an outline, give  an anticipation of some points to our readers?    [Berlusconi] The program we are working on is at an advanced  stage and will be made public in due course. The only  anticipation I feel like giving is that it is a change in course  compared to what has happened over the past 10-15 years. Our  objective is to restore to Italians the liberties that politics  has confiscated from them. It is a matter of freeing ourselves  from the bureaucratization of society and the politicization of  life.    [Sechi] You are saying "Stop the blank checks to governments  that devour money." How can the Italians say stop. The League  tried with their tax strike but with little success.    [Berlusconi] What I maintain is that when effective  constitutional rules are lacking, the people in government are  exposed to the almost irresistible temptation to acquire  consensus and popularity by abusing public expenditure.  Fortunately tax revolts are rather rare events and can lead to  undesirable consequences. If we want to avoid these we must set  our hands to reforming the state to move from a system based on  trust in those governing to one that is based on the  predictability of well-defined regulations.    [Sechi] You have been defined as being a fan of the  capitalistic Far West but propose a tax code, barriers, rules.  Does this not seem to be contradictory?    [Berlusconi] The capitalistic Far West is a folkloristic  expression used by those who have still not understood that the  market is a rule. I prefer a market economy and therefore it is  perfectly in harmony with my partiality for constitutional  rules. The supporters of the market economy are also the  advocates of the state -- free traders in economics, liberals in  politics. When the Left sees a contradiction between the market  and rules it shows that it is insufficiently aware of the  principles of a free economy.    [Sechi] Who may your travel companions against supertaxes  be?    [Berlusconi] I strongly doubt that today there is anybody  who  is convinced that taxes should be increased. There is no  self-employed person, shopowner, or businessman who is not aware  of the fact that in Italy there has been an intolerable abuse of  tax pressure. The success of the League is one of the many  confirmations of this fact. Only the Left has not realized this  yet, even if they are careful not to openly suggest tax  increases.    [Sechi] Miglio says that your program has been copied word  for word from that of the League.    [Berlusconi] Miglio knows very well that the introduction of  a tax ceiling is not something new but has been supported for  many years and in the most varied countries. However, the  problem is not to determine the paternity of the idea but rather  to make it accepted and translated into state legislation.    [Sechi] The PDS states that you could not care less about  the  deficit and that you want to maintain consumption high to keep  your group's revenues up.    [Berlusconi] Like before, the postcommunists are masters in  the art of misinforming. As for the deficit, which is  threatening the financial solvency of our country and to whose  increase the postcommunists have largely contributed by  proposing ever increasing expenditures, the past year shows that  tax experiments do not solve the problem. Taxes have increased  enormously but the deficit, far from decreasing, has also  increased. In order to balance the government budget one must do  precisely what the Left does not want to do: cut public  expenditure. As for consumption, I am not the one who is saying  that private consumption has decreased, it is the official  figures. Finally, the fact that those asking that available  income be restored to families and workers are doing so in their  own interests, and this shows how little "those of the Left" are  worried about the well-being of the Italians.    [Sechi] Is the Left eating balance sheets or has it really  converted itself to capitalism?    [Berlusconi] Everything is possible. But is seems highly  unlikely that those who have preached statism and disdained the  market economy and capitalism suddenly become supporters of  economic liberty. If we ask ourselves why the enemies of the  market economy suddenly proclaim themselves liberals and free  traders, the answer is obvious: Statism has produced mourning  and ruins wherever it was attempted and it has thrown such  discredit upon itself that it is in nobody's interests to  proclaim oneself a statist.    [Sechi] Professor Martino has proposed a pay packet without  any deductions and the abolition of withholding taxes to unhinge  an old and oppressive taxation system. Do you agree?    [Berlusconi] The abolition of withholding taxes would make  workers know exactly how much taxes they must pay. Once again,  this must be a rule: Taxes must be clear and visible. Whether  this will then contribute to changing the tax system depends on  the taxpayers' reaction in determining the amount of taxes that  each has to bear and primarily to what extent those in  government will take this reaction into account.    [Sechi] How can expenses be reduced? Everyone has tried but  without success.    [Berlusconi] There are expenses that can be reduced  immediately and expenses that require radical reforms to be  reduced, but one thing is certain: In order to reduce public  expenditure it is first of all necessary to want to do this  (even though this is not sufficient). Nobody can deny that this  is a difficult task but it is not an impossible one if there is  a desire to see it accomplished. It is the task of politics to  accomplish things that are desirable.    [Sechi] Do you think that the problem of tax evaders can be  resolved? They say that you are their new Robin Hood.    [Berlusconi] Tax evasion must be fought without hesitation  in  order to have justice. However, if we really want to reduce  evasion and not limit ourselves to talking about it then we must  act on the causes: When income taxes are too high, this  discourages the production of income and encourages attempts to  avoid paying them in various ways. For this reason, I think  that we will have to follow the example of many countries, such  as Sweden and the United States, which have reduced tax rates  precisely to reduce evasion. Less exasperated progressive taxes  provide incentives for production and increase state revenues,  as the experience of other countries has confirmed. Second, if  it is true that we have a great number of useless taxes that do  nothing or little for state revenues, we should do away with  them. In doing so we will simplify the taxpayer's life and the  work of the tax authorities who could dedicate themselves to  seeing that the taxes that really contribute to increasing  revenues are paid. In any case, though we cannot give up the  battle against evasion, this is certainly not the road to  balancing the government budget.    [Sechi] If you were Ciampi what would you have done in  Crotone [scene of industrial unrest]?    [Berlusconi] What distinguishes the statist from the  politician is that the first is willing to run the risk of  becoming unpopular in pursuing the interest of all, while the  second does not hesitate in placing his political career before  the interest of the public. This does not mean that there are no  exceptional circumstances that call for specific, pragmatic  solutions. I only want to say that these exceptions must be  rare and not part of normal behavior.    [Sechi] Let us talk about savings. How can you convince the  army of BOT [government bonds] people that you are not against  them? And above all, how can you convince them to have faith in  joint-stock companies, in the Stock Exchange?    [Berlusconi] I really do not see why the people who hold  government bonds should be afraid of those who have always  defended savings and the right of ownership. Those that should  be afraid are those that have tried to criminalize these people  for years by accusing them of being parasites, the owners of  financial income, and responsible for the balance of payments  problem. Italian savers will turn to shares if the recovery of  the Stock Exchange can convince them of the advantages of  investing in shares.    [Sechi] Prof. Raffaello Lupi who is Minister Gallo's  consultant has said: Berlusconi seems to be like Zhirinovskiy:  He promises less taxes and more vodka. Rather than Einaudi,  according to the Left, you are a demagogue whose only expertise  is debts. What is your reply?    [Berlusconi] I would like to remind you that Zhirinovskiy is  a postcommunist nationalist Russian who calls himself a liberal  democrat. If there is somebody that resembles these people it  is not me, it is those that have acclaimed the Soviet Union for  years and that now proclaim themselves democrats just like the  tenants of Botteghe Oscure [PDS party headquarters]. As for the  content of this strange affirmation, I think that it confirms  the importance that the postcommunists give to the well-being  and liberty of the taxpayers.    [Sechi] When will you taste the bitter cup of politics?    [Berlusconi] We will see. Perhaps soon, perhaps never.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GLASNOST ON SET OF 'ROCKY V'  </P> <P> Sylvester Stallone brings boxer Rocky Balboa home from the Soviet Union on a  real Soviet airliner in "Rocky V," taking advantage of glasnost to film the  latest chapter of his pugilistic saga.  </P> <P> Stallone, whose character battled a Soviet boxer in "Rocky IV," filmed Monday  at the Philadelphia International Airport with the captain and crew of an  Aeroflot jet.  </P> <P> "It's amazing because six months ago this was totally impossible. It's truly  astounding," Stallone said.  </P> <P> The Ilyushin 86, which arrived from Moscow on Sunday, was the first Soviet  aircraft used in the production of an American film, movie publicists said.  </P> <P> Stallone said some moviegoers misunderstood the message of "Rocky IV," in which  Rocky defeated a Soviet boxer. "The real story at the end of 'Rocky IV' was we  can all get along," he said.  </P></p>

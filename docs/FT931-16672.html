			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses open new year in mixed fashion CONTINENTAL bourses started 1993 in a mixed fashion, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT, not widely fancied as a prospect for 1993, started the new year by giving up most of the gains it made on window-dressing last week. The DAX index closed 13.72 lower at 1,531.33 as turnover fell from DM3.8bn to DM2.3bn. Sunday's resignation of the economics minister, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, added to negative sentiment created by the poor outlook for the German economy. Retailers were weak as the January sales started, Karstadt dropping DM18 to DM482. PARIS eased in thin trading as a rise in short-term interest rates fanned fears of a possible rise in headline rates to defend the franc. There were reports of central bank intervention to support the French currency yesterday. The CAC-40 index fell 14.70 to 1,843.08 in low turnover of FFr1.2bn. Elf fell FFr6.20 to FFr356 and BSN ended FFr9 to FFr945. MILAN ended firmer in thin trading and the best performers were banking shares and other privatisation candidates. The Comit index was estimated at 451.86, up 5.53, but an official figure was not available. Turnover was estimated at L165bn after L145bn on December 31. Credito Italiano rose L109 to L3,269 and Banca Commerciale Italiana added L98 to L4,838. ZURICH extended its good run of 1992 with the SMI index 10.7 higher at 2,117.7. Among banks, CS Holding rose SFr40 to SFr2,170 and SBC bearers by SFr7 to SFr308. Trading in Swiss Volksbank was suspended at the request of the bank which plans to make a 'positive' announcement tomorrow. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by a firmer dollar, with the financial sector making strong gains. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.1 higher at 95.5. ING, up Fl 1.20 to Fl 55.80, and Aegon, Fl 1.30 higher at Fl 76.50, both finished at new 12-month highs. Hoogovens went against the trend, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 21.90. STOCKHOLM greeted the new year with a 1.9 per cent rise, largely due to the stronger dollar. OSLO and HELSINKI followed suit with, respectively, the composite index up 7.26 to 379.38 and the Hex 21.06 better at 850.06. Sweden's Affarsvarlden general index added 17.4 to 930.0 in moderate turnover of SKr400m. Volvo B shares advanced SKr15 to SKr358 despite the release of statistics indicating that new car registrations fell 23 per cent in December and that total registrations for 1992 were the lowest since 1958. VIENNA lost some 3 per cent on institutional selling. The ATX index fell 24.68 to 723.02 with OMV declining Sch26 to Sch590.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- January 4                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1081.71      1083.30      1083.82      1082.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1169.04      1170.44      1173.18      1174.71  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1168.96      1170.84      1171.23      1170.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1082.44      1081.53      1083.97      1083.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dec 31    Dec 30    Dec 29    Dec 24    Dec 23  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1083.35   1084.02   1086.47   1078.93   1073.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1169.11   1166.76   1167.59   1160.29   1154.31  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1084.05 ; 200 - 1175.29 Low/day: 100 - 1081.04  200 - 1167.66.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

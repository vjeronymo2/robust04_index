Pyrographite plates  were used as substrates in accordance with the specifics of  scanning tunnel microscopy. Nanometer-size structures were  formed on the surfaces by chemical modification of transition  metals and phosphorus with halogens. The first results indicated  that pyrographite treated with vanadium oxychloride had the most  structure ordering. Therefore, the present work was devoted to  studying the surface composition of vanadium  oxychloride-modified pyrographite using X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the carrier gas used  (air, nitrogen, or helium) plays a significant role in the  concentration of elements on the surface layer as well as the  shape of the V 2p[.sub]3/2[/], C1 s, O 1s lines in the  photoelectron spectra. A comparative analysis of the spectra of  modified pyrographite with the bulk oxygen compounds of vanadium  led to the hypothesis on the structures formed on the  pyrographite surface are similar in nature to that of hydrated  vanadium oxide. The concentration and degree of polycondensation  of surface structures are determined by the oxygen content in  the carrier-gas. Figures 3; references 6 (Russian).</p>

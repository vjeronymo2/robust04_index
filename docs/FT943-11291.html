			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Books: Soft targets of recent history - Malcolm Rutherford suggests that this biographer is simply sniping at easy meat EMINENT CHURCHILLIANS by Andrew Roberts Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 354 pages Three years ago Andrew Roberts made his mark as a historian with his admirable biography of Lord Halifax, the man who very nearly became Britain's wartime prime minister instead of Winston Churchill. He is currently writing a much-needed new biography of Lord Salisbury. Meanwhile, he has produced a pot-stirrer which should help keep his name in lights. Eminent Churchillians is modelled on Lytton Strachey's Eminent Victorians, first published in 1918, and Roberts fully acknowledges the debt. Strachey introduced a new form of biographical writing: subjective, selective and short, and by no means wholly dependent on narrative. In his own words, he sought 'a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing that is significant'. He could praise as well as blame. Roberts has many of the same qualities: incisive use of quotations, telling anecdotes and acquaintance with out of the way sources, especially diaries. Yet there is one huge difference. There was recognisably a Victorian era; there was no such thing as a recognisably Churchillian era. Churchill was a man who, had it not been for the second world war, would have gone down as a political failure. Even then, he was defeated in the general election of 1945. When he came back in 1951, it was fairly well known that - to put it mildly - he was too old for the job. To call all that the Churchillian era is stretching historical licence. Much of the period might as well have been called the coalition era or even the Attlee era, which then led quite naturally to Butskellism: 'wartime' and 'postwar' are the simplest terms of all. The insistence that there was something distinctly Churchillian mars the book. There is another fault. Roberts poses as a radical revisionist and, had he written 20 years ago, perhaps he would have been. In fact, he specialises in soft targets: King George VI, Lord Mountbatten, Sir Walter Monckton and Sir Arthur Bryant. I have not come across anyone for at least 15 years who regards any member of that quartet with uncritical admiration. Roberts treats the king relatively gently, more sniping than shooting. He accuses him of naivete and writing a 'fourth-form geography essay' after a meeting with Roosevelt. Yet if we have a hereditary monarchy, it is unreasonable to expect that they will all take firsts at Cambridge. The royal family's move to keep most of the dethroned sovereigns of Europe out of Britain - criticised by Roberts - seems rather astute. Despite the fact that he was at least as much an Attlee man as a Churchillian, Mountbatten receives 80 pages. His vanity and care for his own reputation are undisputed. Yet, as Roberts writes, ultimately that reputation must stand on his record as the last Viceroy of India. Roberts condemns him for his acceleration of independence and partition. Others will reach their own judgments. Despite the violence, it still seems one of the wisest decisions by the postwar British government (ie not by Mountbatten alone). One might look (as Roberts does not) at how other European countries tried to defend their overseas possessions after the time to leave: in France there was near civil war. Roberts appears to think that if Britain had stayed in India longer, and used air power to quell local difficulties, it might have been possible to impose democracy on the British parts of Africa. Still, all that is hypothetical. The Roberts case against Walter Monckton is that he was too much of a charmer. As minister of labour, he always sought to resolve industrial disputes by splitting the difference between the employers' offer and the unions' demands. That is true, but was very much the climate of the time. Monckton's successor was Iain Macleod; he regarded Monckton as a hero. No-one then thought of trade union reforms a la Thatcher, just as (unmentioned by Roberts) no-one thought of Britain joining the original Common Market. Arthur Bryant, as a fellow historian, is easy meat. Roberts tells the story of how close Bryant was to fascism right up to the war. There was a serious move to have him interned, but another historian, the now Lord Dacre, advised the authorities not to worry because Bryant would 'change with the times', which he duly did. The Dacre story is one of the best in the book. There is some other political tittle-tattle of the kind that will be enjoyed by those who like the diaries of Chips Channon and Alan Clark. But there is also a nasty streak. Historians should not seek to get away with statements like 'Murphy was an active homosexual and extreme left-winger' without some elucidation, and the claim that Rab Butler's move to the Board of Education was the 'wartime political equivalent of Port Stanley' reminds one of Lord Tebbit's recent remark that being president of the European Commission is like being chairman of Basingtoke Council. Indeed there is a touch of Tebbit - 'the semi house-trained polecat' as Michael Foot called him - throughout Eminent Churchillians. On to Salisbury before it becomes catching.</p>

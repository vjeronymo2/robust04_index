			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RYAN SPREADING HIMSELF OUT -- BUT NOT TOO THINLY -- AT BREA  </P> <P> Mike Ryan is a starter in three sports at Brea-Olinda High School -- football,  basketball and baseball -- and will have earned eight varsity letters when he  graduates in June.  </P> <P> As pep commissioner, he plans assemblies and rallies. He organized activities  leading to the homecoming game and helped construct the senior float. And he is  a member of the National Honor Society.  </P> <P> Ryan is equally versatile on the football field, where he helped Brea win the  Orange League title and earn the No. 4 seeding in the Southern Section Division  VI playoffs. Brea (7-2-1) will play host to two-time defending champion Corona  del Mar (5-4-1) at 7:30 tonight in the opening round.  </P> <P> Ryan returns punts and kickoffs, holds for kicks, calls the defensive  formations as a free safety and doubles as a backup tight end, wide receiver or  running back. He intercepted four passes and scored three touchdowns, including  a 94-yard kickoff return against Troy.  </P> <P> "He is the hardest-hitting secondary player I've coached in 16 years," Brea  Coach Jon Looney said. "Mike's strength is run support. He's very aggressive up  front. He has good range, and he hits with the best of them."  </P> <P> Ryan made the big plays in Brea's 23-21 victory over Valencia.  </P> <P> First, he set up the winning field goal with a 43-yard pass reception from  Jamie Baraglia. Then, he managed to control and hold a high center snap,  allowing Marco Hernandez to kick a 27-yarder with 42 seconds remaining and give  Brea its first victory over Valencia since 1981.  </P> <P> Ryan said he has replayed the film and still wonders how Valencia failed to  block the field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> "The snap was high and to my left, and I barely caught it," he said. "When I  put the ball down, I looked up and saw two guys charging. I told myself, 'This  isn't going to work.'  </P> <P> "Somehow, the ball sailed right through one guy's arms, and then it nearly hit  another guy in the head. It was fate."  </P> <P> Ryan said he reminded his teammates in the huddle before the kick that Brea was  going to win because "we have somebody else on our side."  </P> <P> Brea's players have worn No. 75 stickers on the side of their helmets in  tribute to former teammate Brian Arredondo, who was killed in a traffic  accident before the 1990 season.  </P> <P> "I told everyone, 'Brian is with us,' " Ryan said. "Nobody gave us a chance  against Valencia. There were a lot of doubters on campus.  </P> <P> "Nothing compares to winning the football title. Winning the league title means  a lot to me. These are definitely good times. They've been about the best."  </P> <P> Ryan has also experienced tough times. Only two years ago, he considered  quitting football while struggling as a varsity reserve.  </P> <P> "I wasn't playing much and wondered whether I wanted to continue playing  football," he said. "There were some problems at home. I took a week off, and  the guys on the team gave me a lot of support."  </P> <P> After a meeting with Looney, Ryan was moved to the junior varsity and was named  the most valuable player. Last year, Ryan was a second-team all-league  selection.  </P> <P> He credits his mother with much of his subsequent success.  </P> <P> "It's been just me and my mom (Pat) for the past 12 years," Ryan said. "She  drove me to practice and to the games when I played Pop Warner football. She  was my catcher when I practiced my pitching.  </P> <P> "She's always been my biggest fan and supported me all the way. She's the  best."  </P></p>

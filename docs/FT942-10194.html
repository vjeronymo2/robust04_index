			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Moves on Macedonia blockade Mr Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia, will make a fresh attempt today to persuade Greece to lift a trade blockade against the former Yugoslav republic. While there are few signs of a breakthrough, Mr Vance's revised version of a draft accord, rejected by both sides last month, avoids the difficult issue of Macedonia's name, while meeting both Greek and Macedonian conditions for re-starting talks. Mr Vance will have separate meetings with Mr Christos Zacharakis, secretary general of the Greek foreign ministry, and Mr Stevo Crvnkovski, Macedonian foreign minister. The draft provides for Greece to raise its trade embargo. Macedonia would drop the Vergina star, associated with the ancient Macedonian dynasty in northern Greece, from its flag, and declare it had no territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia.</p>

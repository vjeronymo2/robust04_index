			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Observer: For the chop? Appearances notwithstanding, John Major's Japanese visit has not been concerned purely with the state of the British Conservative party. He also found time to axe the Commonwealth Institute. One can see why the Foreign and Commonwealth Office waited for the green light from Tokyo before announcing yesterday that its annual grant to the Institute (currently worth Pounds 2.7m) will cease from March 1996. Only last May, the Queen was there celebrating the centenary of its opening and next month Major will accompany her to the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Cyprus. Normally the institute rates a paragraph of ritual congratulation for its work towards the end of the CHOGM communique. This time the PM had better expect some awkward questions. The FCO explains piously that it cannot provide the increased funding recommended in a recent review by Lord Armstrong. 'We hope the institute will not regard the decision as tantamount to closure,' says the FCO. At present it raises not even 20 per cent from sponsorship and commercial activities. The government apparently hopes that 'other members of the Commonwealth will fill the funding gap'. Hard to see why they should, if Britain's contribution after 1996 is to be precisely zero.</p>

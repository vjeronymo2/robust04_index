			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikio Haruna, Kyodo Washington Bureau chief] </F>   [Text] For the first time since the end of World War II,  Japan-U.S. relations are about to venture into perilous,  uncharted waters. Icebergs and reefs lurk in the rough seas of  the post-Cold War era. Unfortunately, neither our ship nor the  American one has a discerning captain on board.  <H5>  An Unmanageable Situation </H5>   The setting is the White House. The time is the afternoon of  11 February, the day when Prime Minister Hosokawa and President  Clinton held a joint press conference at the conclusion of the  Japan-U.S. summit. There were cheerful expressions on the faces  of some of Foreign Minister Hata's retinue of top-ranking  Foreign Ministry officials, in contrast to the somber  expressions on the faces of the U.S. Government bureaucrats  lined up at the right side of the podium. Some of them were  smiling, their faces flushed, possibly from the exhilaration of  having said no to the United States for the first time in the  postwar era.    With the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the  scene shifted from diplomatic negotiations between the two  nations to Japanese and American domestic and international  politics. Public opinion based on complex emotions came into the  picture, and the situation became even more unmanageable.    In the next act of this drama, the curtain may open on  severe  retaliatory measures invoked by President Clinton, including  sanctions against Japan. But eventually, the President is bound  to lean toward building a framework for new Japan-U.S. trade  negotiations.    If he does not, given the profound economic interdependence  between the two nations, a trade war may erupt. And if it  becomes serious, it will be the American consumer who suffers.    To avoid being blamed for the breakdown of the negotiations,  and to create the impression that Japan is responsible for it,  President Clinton has no choice but to resort to heavy-handed  methods. The truth is, though, that the President is aware that  the United States is also partly to blame for the failed  negotiations. But first and foremost, he is determined to  convince the American people that he is a forceful leader.    However, by using such methods he is playing a power game,  and is thereby courting real dangers, for the following reasons:    The leaders of both nations agreed to couch the reasons for  the breakdown in negotiations in a euphemism, i.e., "the  maturing of a relationship." But there is no hope of building an  adult relationship of equal importance to both nations any time  soon. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated any number of times that  the Japan-U.S. relationship has matured, but his statement was  later contradicted by Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to  the United States, who does not believe that it has.    Meanwhile, President Clinton is under pressure to  demonstrate  strong leadership by instituting a health care system, reforming  the welfare system, combating crime, and by skillful handling of  foreign affairs. His methods are completely opposite those of  former President Bush, who valued establishing good  communications with foreign heads of state, and who strived to  avoid "miscalculations" in international political moves.    Furthermore, dealings between Japanese and American  bureaucrats are overshadowed by suspicion, and are far from what  one would expect of a "mature relationship."    During the Cold War, a crisis management system was in  place,  which prevented the outbreak of trade wars. But that has  collapsed, with the "about-face" of the State Department and the  Pentagon.    In Washington, the prevailing wisdom now is that  Japan-bashing is a safe game to play. The belief is widespread  that Japan will not implement its own harsh measures in  retaliation.    However, if the Americans decide to impose sanctions on  Japan  because of the breakdown in the recent negotiations, the  reaction from the Japanese public and the Japanese media will be  far stronger than ever before. There is a distinct danger that  there will be more emotionally charged hostility between the  people of the two nations. If the leaders of the two nations err  in their handling of these problems, they may find themselves  faced with an unmanageable situation.  <H5>  The Japan-Is-Different Theory--The Starting Point </H5>   The "numerical indicators," the main reason for the  breakdown  in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, were inspired by the  Japan-is-different theory.    A leading exponent of this argument, the polemicist Clyde  Prestowitz, chairman of the Economic Strategy Institute, former  Commerce Department deputy trade representative, and a close  friend of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, has been giving  advice to Mr. Kantor privately on a daily basis.    Mr. Prestowitz's pet argument is that Japan's social and  economic systems differ from those of Europe and the United  States. He argues that, since efforts to use outside influence  to westernize Japan's systems would cause severe friction, thus  endangering Japan-U.S. relations, the two nations must agree to  managed trade.    Some time ago, Mr. Prestowitz proposed a "mini Breton Woods  conference," as an opportunity for Japan and the United States  to discuss and settle these problems. He was convinced that such  a conference would be successful, and assumed that Japan would  respond with enthusiasm. He even told this writer that the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] would likely  agree to participate, since the ministry would acquire more  power with managed trade.    Economist Laura Tyson, former professor at the University of  California at Berkeley, also belongs to the Japan-is-different  camp. She has suggested that the United States deal with Japan  in a different way than it does with Europe.    In her book Who's Bashing Whom? (Japanese  translation Dare ga dare wo tataiteirunoka?), Ms.  Tyson describes two types of managed trade: 1) a voluntary  import expansion agreement (VIE) similar to the Japan-U.S.  semiconductor agreement, and 2) voluntary export restrictions  (VER) similar to Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile  exports to the United States. She indicates that the United  States should adopt the first type, which would act to stimulate  trade and competition, rather than the second type, which would  tend to place constraints on trade and competition.    A supplementary document to the Japan-U.S. semiconductor  agreement expressed the hope that, in 1992, the share of  foreign-made semiconductors in the Japanese market would rise to  20 percent. Ms. Tyson has simply justified numerical targets in  economics terms.    President Clinton appointed this offbeat economist chairman  of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The person who  holds this position normally acts as a "caretaker of  macroeconomics." Since her appointment, Ms. Tyson has spoken out  aggressively about Japan-U.S. trade problems, and has actually  attended Japan-U.S. trade talks.    One must also remember that President Clinton has always  leaned toward managed trade. He has expressed his support for  managed trade at several Democratic conventions. Moreover, in  the economic policy statement he issued when he announced his  candidacy for the presidential election in 1992, he proposed not  only that the lapsed Super 301 clause, part of a 1988 trade law,  be revived, but also that it be made more forceful.    That same statement makes special reference to President  Clinton's election promise to create jobs, and emphasizes the  need to increase exports. It states that 20,000-30,000 jobs are  created with every $1 billion increase in exports.    From its earliest days, the Clinton administration has  demonstrated its intention to seek the inclusion of numerical  targets (which derive from the Japan-is-different argument) in  its negotiations with Japan.    Administrators and information specialists in the U.S.  Government started drafting plans for the new negotiations when  the Clinton administration took office. During that process,  former U.S. Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga and other Japanese of  similar stature were consulted. A U.S. Government source reports  that their reaction to the draft, which included numerical  indicators, was "positive." Could someone on the Japanese side  have spoken irresponsibly?    When U.S. Government officials began their preparations for  the new framework talks with Japan, they took special pains to  elucidate the differences between Bush and Clinton trade policy.  Since Clinton's harsh criticism of the Bush administration's  trade policy had helped him get elected, Clinton's staff didn't  dare adopt an approach that bore even the remotest resemblance  to Bush administration policy.    It was numerical indicators that made the "difference."  Clinton's people wanted results. The Bush administration had  urged Japan to make domestic structural reforms. There was no  expectation that Japan's trade surplus would decrease in the  short term.    At the press conference held after the talks broke down,  Prime Minister Hosokawa said that numerical indicators would  work against his deregulation plan. If Japan makes headway with  structural reforms, the logic that the Americans are using to  justify numerical indicators, which is based on the  Japan-is-different theory, will collapse.  <H5>  A Series of Blunders </H5>   During a briefing for White House correspondents, a U.S.  administration official boasted, "Late last night, I heard  officials from Japan's Foreign Ministry and from MITI yelling at  each other. If Japan's government agencies are that much at  odds, then we've won."    This incident took place in July 1993, during the Tokyo  summit. On that occasion, Prime Minister Miyazawa and President  Clinton had agreed on the framework for trade negotiations.    The error of the above-mentioned assumption became clear  when  talks held six months later broke down. The negotiations were  doomed from the very start.    The main point of contention then was the numerical  indicators, which were the reason why the recent negotiations  failed. The Japanese side objected to the establishment of  numerical targets. But then, it was Hisashi Owada,  administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, who ultimately  steamrolled MITI opposition.    The joint declaration on the framework for the new talks  established quantitative and qualitative "objective criteria,"  and stated that progress on trade problems would be evaluated by  these criteria. This was an extremely unpromising start for the  negotiations.    The Americans had proposed setting specific numerical  targets, but these were fiercely opposed by the Japanese, who  refused to accept them. An agreement was reached which entailed  establishing yardsticks, or "objective criteria," and using  those criteria to measure the extent to which trade problems  were being resolved.    But negotiators from the two nations were ultimately unable  to agree on the content of those objective criteria, and the  negotiations were marred by "religious disputes."    It is difficult to tell whether the Americans were pressing  for specific numerical targets, or simply yardsticks (objective  criteria).    Even some of the U.S. Government representatives  acknowledged  their failure to make the concepts clear. But the Americans did  not attempt to hide their suspicion that Japan would not make  efforts to open its markets unless the United States specified  targets.    Japanese Government officials, on the other hand, were  worried that if they agreed to numerical targets and were unable  to meet them, the United States would impose sanctions on Japan.    After the negotiations got off to a start, a series of  blunders was committed by both sides. The errors made by the  United States were fatal.    As previously indicated, the first error was committed by  Clinton administration officials, who were counting on MITI's  ultimate acceptance of numerical indicators.    But "fundamentalists" at the Foreign Ministry clung  steadfastly to the principles of free trade. At times they were  more vehemently opposed to the numerical indicators than were  the MITI bureaucrats. Furthermore, Japan's public relations  campaign, which equated the American demands for numerical  indicators with managed trade and protectionism, paid off.  Support for Japan's position grew among ASEAN members and in  Europe. The odds of Japan accepting the numerical indicators  grew slimmer and slimmer.    Second, the political situation in Japan had undergone a  major upheaval. When the Hosokawa government took office in the  summer of 1993, the negotiations actually came to a halt. The  Clinton administration had decided to wait and see how Prime  Minister Hosokawa's reform plans progressed. Formal negotiations  resumed in October.    In the meantime, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who had  been harshly critical of Japan, himself became the target of  criticism from some administration officials, and was replaced  as chief negotiator for the Japan-U.S. trade talks by Bowman  Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy.    At the Japan-U.S. summit held in New York in September,  President Clinton flattered Hosokawa, saying that he held the  prime minister in high esteem, and mentioning the rapport he  felt with him since both men were former governors, and both had  been elected because of their commitment to reform.    Obviously, Prime Minister Hosokawa read too much into  Clinton's words. The fact that Hosokawa dispatched his diplomacy  "ace," Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France, to confer  with President Clinton and Vice President Gore shortly before  the negotiations were to begin, and to explore the possibility  of postponing an agreement, belies his overconfidence. The  Hosokawa government was totally ignorant of President Clinton's  strategy, that is, his desire to demonstrate his leadership  abilities by accomplishing his political agenda.    Third, the Americans had overestimated the reform-minded  Hosokawa. Late last year, a U.S. Government official who is well  versed in Japan-U.S. relations, asked me if Administrative Vice  Minister for Finance Saito was going to be fired. Some American  administrative officials interpreted the resignation of MITI's  Industrial Policy Bureau chief Naito as a sign that the Hosokawa  government was wresting power from the bureaucrats. They  extrapolated further that Vice Minister Saito and Kazuo Ogura,  the Foreign Ministry's Economic Bureau chief, might also be  forced to resign. Most of this was wishful thinking, for the two  men are viewed as tough negotiators, but the rumor spread.    A statement made by Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of  international trade and industry, in which he acknowledged the  closed nature of Japan's markets, and another made by Foreign  Minister Hata, that might possibly be construed as meaning that  he would accept the numerical indicators, buoyed the Americans'  hopes.    But the truth is that Hosokawa, who has far fewer  specialists  in government affairs at his disposal than did his predecessor,  Kiichi Miyazawa, became increasingly dependent upon the  bureaucrats. Furthermore, Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] had cooperated with former  Ambassador Armacost in the latter's attempts to solve Japan's  "international contribution problem," and had become a valued  ally of the United States. But this time Ozawa sided with the  Finance Ministry in its tax cut plan, and demonstrated his  support for a consumption tax increase. This shift was a painful  blow to the Americans, who were opposed to these measures.    Toward the end of last year, when it became clear that the  negotiations were going to be an uphill battle, the U.S.  Government stepped up its attacks on Japan's bureaucrats, and  plotted to remove Hosokawa from their clutches. This proved to  be a less than brilliant plan, strategically speaking.  <H5>  Increasing Suspicion </H5>   Japan-U.S. trade negotiations have begun to take on the  atmosphere that prevailed during the arms-reduction negotiations  between the United States and the USSR. The setting of numerical  indicators and the announcement of the intention to keep a close  watch to ensure they are met are reminiscent of the Reagan  administration's demanding that the Soviet Union drastically  reduce its nuclear facilities and allow detailed inspections.  Other similarities crop up in the Americans' criticism of the  conservatism of Soviet bureaucrats and their hope that Gorbachev  and other Soviet politicians would go along with the American  policy.    Moreover, the Americans are increasingly suspicious that  promises spelled out in trade agreements will not be honored.  For instance, between 1991 and 1993, after agreements were  concluded between the two nations on paper and glass products,  not only did the foreign market share not increase, but it fell  from 4.3 percent to 4 percent for paper, and from 11 percent to  5.9 percent for glass. Though 33 trade agreements have been  signed between the two nations since 1980, Japan's trade surplus  has continued to mount, as has the Americans exasperation.    The Japanese, faced with the threat of sanctions if they  agreed to numerical targets and were unable to meet them, were  not prepared to take that risk. An attachment to the Japan-U.S.  semiconductor agreement signed by (then) Ambassador to the U.S.  Matsunaga merely expresses the hope that the market share for  foreign-made semiconductors will rise to 20 percent. Yet Japan  was later accused of having reneged on the agreement, and there  was talk of imposing sanctions.    The fact is that there were some hardliners in the U.S.  Government who insisted on including numerical targets in the  Japan-U.S. trade agreement, no matter what, and on imposing  sanctions if those targets are not met.    Furthermore, a bill proposed by Senator Baucus and  Representative Matsui, concerning the observance of trade  agreements, is now being deliberated in the U.S. Congress. If  this bill is passed, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office will  have the power to determine whether trade agreements have been  adhered to and, if they have not, to impose sanctions by  invoking Super 301. The foundation is being laid for a system  that would make it difficult for Japan to sign agreements that  contain specific targets.    According to research on the results of past U.S.-Japan  trade  agreements, U.S. exports to Japan have increased. Another  report, issued by the Congressional Research Service, states  that exports to Japan increased by approximately $4.9 billion  per year as a result of trade agreements concluded between 1985  and 1990. It states further that if all of Japan's import  barriers were removed, an increase in excess of $10 billion per  year could be expected. Moreover, research done by the private  research organization, the International Economic Research  Institute, suggests that if Japan's markets were completely  liberalized, U.S. exports to Japan would increase by as much as  $8.9-18.2 billion.    Reports like these prompt the Japanese to counter that the  closed nature of Japan's markets is not the one and only reason  for the trade imbalance.    However, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan for 1993 reached  the monumental figure of $59.3 billion, reflecting a  macroeconomic imbalance. Since allowing this one-sided imbalance  to continue unchecked is not a wise strategy, Japan will have to  come up with some sort of policy, one that produces results.    Once the Clinton administration had recorded some successes  on the economic front, for example, recovery from the recession  and a decline in the unemployment rate, it began to feel  vulnerable to attacks for its failure to decrease the trade  deficit. It sensed pressure to produce evidence of its efforts  to do so, for Congress and for the American people, by  introducing numerical targets into negotiations with Japan.    During the Cold War, when negotiations stalled, there was  always a "referee" who would step in. The referees were the  National Security Council, the State Department, and the  Pentagon. On many occasions these referees cited the strategic  importance of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and supported  Japan by holding the economic branches of the government at bay.    But during the recent negotiations, not one high-ranking  government official expressed support for Japan. Even Secretary  of State Christopher, after he had conferred with Foreign  Minister Hata, expressed his dissatisfaction that no progress  was being made in the trade negotiations, and dismissed Japan's  economic recovery measures, alluding to their "disappointing  content."  <H5>  The Unfinished "Japan Paper" </H5>   Last spring, the Clinton administration decided to do a  basic  review of Japan-U.S. relations. It instructed the relevant  government branches to hold discussions, and to publish the  results in a "Japan paper."    But at those conferences, the Pentagon did not come out as  Japan's protector, as it had in the past. In fact, the tenor of  discussions about Japan's defense within the Pentagon has  changed. For instance, at one time the introduction of landing  craft, scheduled for the next defense budget, might have been  welcomed, as they could be expected to contribute to  peacekeeping operations. However, during last year's  discussions, doubts were expressed about expanding Japan's  offensive capabilities.    Some U.S. Government officials have voiced, albeit  unofficially, their reservations about Japan's use of plutonium.  Still others have expressed their concern that, with the decline  in the importance of security in the relationship between the  two nations, and with the possibility that North Korea possesses  nuclear weapons, Japan may also become a nuclear power.    However, the "Japan paper" remains unfinished. The United  States is still undecided about Japan's strategic role.    Thus, the Clinton administration may cause serious  disruption  of Japan-U.S. relations if it imposes economic sanctions on  Japan.    Before the Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton is reported  to have assiduously studied suggestions sent to him by his close  friend Derek Shearer, former deputy under secretary of commerce,  and by Glen Fukushima, director of market development for  AT&amp;T.  These suggestions assailed the unfortunate U.S. approach to the  Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. They also proposed establishment  of a Japan office within the White House, which would  concentrate on U.S.-Japan problems. President Clinton underlined  passages he considered especially relevant and made copies of  them, distributing them to the staffs of U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor and Secretary of Treasury Bentsen. The  President, who for many years has valued Mr. Fukushima's  expertise, realized after reading his suggestions, that the  negotiations had failed, even before the summit.    President Clinton will probably order a review of the  Japan-U.S. framework talks. But before that, he is likely to  invoke sanctions in order to maintain his image of leadership.    Such sanctions may very well be carefully calculated and  extremely limited. But if the President fails to make efforts  toward mutual understanding between the two leaders, and if he  provokes a hostile reaction from the Japanese people, it may be  difficult for Japan to agree to negotiations for a new trade  framework. In that case, the hostility will increase, and  Japan-U.S. relations will be thrown into turmoil.</p>

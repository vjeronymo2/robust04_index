			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / France holds Carlos 'the Jackal': Notorious terrorist extradited from Sudan to face trial for killings Carlos 'the Jackal', the guerrilla and kidnapper who is blamed for many of the world's most notorious terrorist attacks over the past two decades, has been arrested and is being held in Paris, the French government announced yesterday. The capture of Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, is a significant victory in the battle against international terrorism. It marks the end of a bloody chapter of guerrilla attacks, often linked to conflicts in the Middle East, and partly reflects the limited refuge for terrorists following peace moves in the region and the collapse of communism. The 44-year-old terrorist was captured in Sudan where he was planning operations against foreign interests in the country, according to officials in Khartoum. After his arrest, following a tip-off from the French intelligence services, he was extradited to France yesterday morning and will be brought before judicial authorities on charges of killing French citizens. Sudan, which took credit for capturing Carlos, urged the US to remove it from Washington's list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism. US State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Sudan's handover of Carlos was welcome but 'of itself is not sufficient action to cause us to rescind their listing'. The French government sought to capitalise on the arrest. 'This proves that the government is determined to fight with all legal means against terrorism and terrorists,' said Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. The crimes of which Carlos is accused include some of the most spectacular guerrilla acts since the mid 1970s, many of which were linked to the Arab-Israeli struggle or the rise of radical anti-establishment terrorism in industrialised nations. He has been linked to the 1975 kidnapping of 11 ministers attending a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. Three people died in the attack and the ministers were taken in a hijacked aircraft to north Africa in a ransom bid. The guerrillas gave up after flying to Algiers and Tripoli, but were allowed to go free within a few days. Carlos has also been linked to the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics, the 1974 takeover of the French embassy in the Hague, and the 1976 hijacking to Entebbe, Uganda, of an Air France airliner. Following his early exploits, the press dubbed him 'the Jackal' after the terrorist sent to kill French president Charles de Gaulle in Frederick Forsyth's novel The Day of the Jackal. France has pursued Carlos since the killing of two French counter-intelligence agents in 1975. Mr Charles Pasqua, France's interior minister, said yesterday that Carlos was involved in attacks in France in which 15 people had died. The French minister said Carlos himself had admitted responsibility for the deaths of 83 people throughout the world. Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

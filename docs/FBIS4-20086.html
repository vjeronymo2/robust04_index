			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  envoy in Cyprus and former Canadian prime minister; his aide,  Gustave Feissel; and John Paul Cavanaugh, a UN political aide,  have been holding contacts in Ankara. [passage omitted]    After their meeting with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary  Ozdem Sanberk, Clark said that mutual lack of trust remains the  main problem in Cyprus. He pointed out that in the meeting,  they discussed various points relating to the  confidence-building measures [CBM's]. He said: One of the  points was what specific advantages the Turkish Cypriot side can  be given to balance the specific advantage the Greek Cypriots  will get when they are allowed to resettle in Maras [Varosha].  Naturally, these advantages cannot be realized without an  agreement.    In turn, Sanberk said that they exchanged views on the  CBM's.  He pointed out that he explained to Clark that the amendments  made to the original version of the CBM's -- the one to which  the Turkish Cypriots had agreed in principle -- substantially  changed the basic spirit and parameters of the package. Sanberk  went on to say that Clark expressed his views and briefed the  Turkish side on the contacts he has held on the issue.</p>

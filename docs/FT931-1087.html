			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Real returns required on railway projects a bar to investment Sir, In his letter (March 11), David Howell comments on the 'imperative need to raise levels of investment in the infrastructure of the country', and notes the need to take a long-term view of such investment. The government's approach to the problem of railway capital projects is to promote legislation which is highly unlikely to stimulate new investment, while requiring all new publicly financed projects to earn 8 per cent in real terms. One can plausibly argue that this rate of return is far too high, bearing in mind the current costs of capital implied by the level of the stock market and the risks of rail investment. The dividend yield on the FT-All Share Index is just above 4 per cent; if one assumes a real long-term dividend growth rate of 2.5 per cent a year and applies the standard dividend growth model, the result is that the implicit future real return on the market is about 6.7 per cent. Given a real yield on long index-linked gilts of approximately 3.5 per cent, the current risk premium on equities is about 3.2 per cent. In the sense of economic risk (the type measured by beta), rail investment seems likely to be of less than average risk, possibly compatible with that of other UK utilities. These have betas which average between 0.7 and 0.8 per cent, suggesting a risk premium of 2.2 to 2.5 per cent. However, these betas reflect equity costs of capital, and private-sector utilities benefit from the tax advantage of debt finance. Depending on the gearing assumptions one wishes to make, it seems reasonable to assume that a fairer required return on new rail investment is around the order of 4 to 5 per cent. Furthermore, any social benefits of railway investment should be included in the investment analysis. The current policy on rail investment could have far-reaching consequences for future economic development and the environment. Fortunately, the remedy is a simple amendment of the investment appraisal rules. The budget offered the chancellor the ideal opportunity to make such an amendment. He missed it.

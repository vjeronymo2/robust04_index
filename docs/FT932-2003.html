			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: The Brash lesson on central bank independence Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton made a valedictory plea last week. Giving his last Mansion House speech as governor of the Bank of England, he urged the great and good in British society to find a way of reconciling greater autonomy for the bank with accountability to parliament. Just a couple of days later, Mr Donald Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, was telling some of the same great and good at a meeting of the European Policy Forum in London how they solve the dilemma down under. Both men are determined inflation fighters who, at present, are operating monetary policies in countries with low inflation. But Mr Leigh-Pemberton has made no secret of his belief that an independent Bank of England would be better able to combat inflation than one that takes orders from the Treasury. The problem in Britain has always been finding a way of reconciling a more autonomous central bank with parliamentary accountability on matters of monetary policy. The German Bundesbank model of an independent central bank is not transferable to the UK because of the accountability problem. Mr Leigh-Pemberton's call for 'politicians, academics and the City' to consider ways out of the dilemma was inspired in part by signs of greater flexibility in Downing Street. Responding to Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said there was 'a genuine case' for an independent central bank. He indicated that he would regard the idea more favourably 'were a way to be found to get the benefits of an independent central bank without the loss of parliamentary accountability.' It is here that Mr Brash's address to the European Policy Forum last week on New Zealand's experience with central bank independence is relevant to the UK. New Zealand has a Westminster style parliament. It also seems to have found a way of making its monetary policy accountable to parliament while still giving its central bank sufficient independence to pursue price stability. At the heart of the New Zealand model is a contract between the government and its central bank. The government, as Mr Brash explained, is barred from instructing the Reserve Bank on how to operate monetary policy to achieve and maintain price stability. 'In this sense, the bank is truly independent of the government,' he said. But the bank's governing legislation explicitly acknowledges that government has a role in monetary policy. The government defines the bank's goal of price stability in a policy targets agreement (PTA) with the governor. It also has the right to change the objective of monetary policy as set out in the Reserve Bank act. The present PTA, signed by Mr Brash and Ms Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, declares that 12-month increases of 0 to 2 per cent in the consumer prices index are consistent with price stability. It allows that the index might move out of the target range because of particular shocks such as higher consumer taxes, natural disasters or big changes in import or export prices. But in that case, the bank has to detail its estimate of the impact on prices and the inflation target. The government can also change the objective of monetary policy by invoking an override provision. But this must be handled in a 'formal and public' manner. If the override provision conflicts with the PTA, a new agreement must be negotiated and presented to parliament. To Europeans used to the Bundesbank model, the override seems a singular weakness in the New Zealand approach. But Mr Brash considers that any government attempting to use the override for short-term political aims, such as giving a boost to the economy ahead of an election, would be likely to cause a huge political row and greatly damage New Zealand's standing in international bond markets. He is probably right in doubting whether any government would invoke it. The New Zealand model is also noteworthy for what Mr Brash calls its 'robust and transparent accountability mechanisms'. The fact that the bank's 'primary function' is to achieve price stability makes it simple to decide whether it is meeting its obligations. The PTA, by defining price stability as 0 to 2 per cent CPI inflation, makes judgment on this score even easier. Because Mr Brash's name is on the PTA, he can be held accountable if the bank fails to meet its stability target and in extremis dismissed by the finance minister. His performance is also monitored by a board of directors. At least every six months, the bank must publish and put before parliament a monetary policy statement. Mr Brash is frequently cross examined on this statement by parliament's finance and expenditure select committee. In Mr Brash's view, New Zealand's experience shows that it is possible to have an independent central bank that is politically accountable under a Westminster-style government. But, although a senior representative of the UK Treasury was making copious notes as Mr Brash spoke last Thursday, it would be premature to expect the UK to rush to follow New Zealand's example. Central bank independence in New Zealand was launched under the favourable star of genuine bi-partisan political support. That could not be guaranteed in the UK. Moreover, the New Zealand model has yet to be tested in conditions other than those of disinflation and recovery from deep recession. Then there is the Maastricht Treaty. Because it gives the government overriding powers, the New Zealand model is incompatible with the Maastricht rules on central bank independence. On the other hand, Mr Frank Vibart, the director of the European policy forum, points out that in some respects, such as accountability, the New Zealand model appears superior to the plans for an independent European central bank system under the Maastricht Treaty. He believes the UK should adopt the New Zealand approach for the Bank of England, while seeking to persuade the rest of the EC to incorporate its better features into the Maastricht blueprint.</p>

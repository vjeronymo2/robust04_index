			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Rwanda envoy due in Uganda: World News Digest Mr Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the United Nations special envoy to Rwanda, was yesterday scheduled to meet President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda as part of international efforts to persuade Rwanda's warring parties to end nearly a month of civil strife. However, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front said it would not take part in any UN efforts to resolve the crisis until Mr Booh-Booh had been withdrawn from the country. The US said yesterday it was sending two envoys to the region. Tanzania's President Ali Hassan Mwinyi said on Sunday government and rebels had agreed to talks in the northern town of Arusha today.

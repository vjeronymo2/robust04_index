			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: SANTA FE SPRINGS;  </P> <P> AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN CLOSURE OF BESIEGED BAR  </P> <P> A proposed agreement between the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control  and the owner of a topless bar would shut down the operation forever.  </P> <P> As part of the tentative agreement, the Cat Patch bar closed Oct. 17.  </P> <P> The pact also stipulates that owner John Marsh has 180 days to sell his liquor  license or lose it, according to documents the alcohol board sent to the city.  Marsh cannot sell his license to a family member or someone involved in running  the Cat Patch. Furthermore, the license could not be used to sell liquor at the  site of the Cat Patch for a year.  </P> <P> A liquor license, worth $17,000 to $20,000, is typically sold to an unrelated  business in a different location, officials at the alcohol-control department  said.  </P> <P> The Cat Patch was under siege by both the alcohol-control agency and the city  of Santa Fe Springs, which has periodically sought to close the bar for the  last 24 years.  </P> <P> On Oct. 4, City Manager Don Powell stopped the topless dancing by suspending  the bar's entertainment permit. He cited a variety of Health and Safety Code  violations as well as alleged criminal activity on the part of patrons and  employees.  </P> <P> Those same problems had prompted the alcohol board to consider revoking Marsh's  liquor license. The proposed settlement still must be approved by the alcohol  board leadership.  </P></p>

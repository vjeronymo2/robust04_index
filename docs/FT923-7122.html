			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate hopes help share prices INTEREST rate optimism, briefly revived by developments in the German money markets, helped UK equities yesterday, but gains were trimmed following discouraging news on last month's domestic retail sales. Trading volume remained poor but the market was enlivened by a number of special situations. UK investors turned cautious in late dealings on reports that a French public opinion poll was about to disclose reduced support for the Maastricht proposals; a poll conducted by Daiwa, the Japanese house, published during trading hours yesterday, showed 54 per cent of French opinion in favour of the Maastricht treaty. At the opening of the London market, shares showed every inclination of extending the losses of the previous session. But a fall of nine points on the Footsie was quickly replaced by a gain, eventually extending to 12 index points, when Bundesbank activity in the German money markets calmed fears of a rise in the Lombard rate today. Interest rate optimism was further encouraged when the Bank of Portugal cut intervention rates for the second time within a week. However, with equity turnover still in the doldrums, share prices began to falter. The report of a 0.3 per cent dip in UK retail sales in July was seen as evidence of continued economic gloom, while a 0.1 per cent rise in non-oil gross domestic product in the second quarter did nothing to lift spirits in the stock market. Optimism was dampened further after Ford Motor said two of its UK manufacturing plants were going on part-time working because of falling car sales. The Footsie turned back from the day's peak of 2,367.1, taking a fresh knock when Wall Street made a sluggish start to the new session following a modest narrowing in the US trade deficit for June. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,363.5 with a day's gain of 8.8. Dealers felt that, but for the Bundesbank's actions, UK stocks would have given back a little more of the attempted recovery which brightened trading sessions last Friday and on Monday. The strategy team at Nomura Research Institute maintained their bearish view, commenting: 'Our advice is to sell the rally - now.' The team's chief concern remains that of higher UK base rates. Seaq volume increased only modestly to 393.5m shares; Tuesday's 361.3m represented retail business worth Pounds 730.1m, still well below acceptable levels from the industry viewpoint. Among the day's casualties, Euro Disney shares fell in London, as they did across the range of European bourses, after a US investment bank expressed bearish views not dissimilar from those heard in London in recent weeks. The domestic corporate front, however, was brightened by a positive reception for trading news from BICC, the cable and construction group, although the chairman reiterated the need for lower UK interest rates to prompt recovery in the domestic economy. With sterling little changed by the end of the session, there was not much activity yesterday in the blue chip international stocks.</p>

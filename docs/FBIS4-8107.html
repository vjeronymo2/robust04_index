			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 8 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following today's lengthy  discussions the assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina  unanimously ratified the Zagreb agreement on a cease-fire and  the separation of Serb and Croatian forces.    Winding up the discussion Assembly Speaker Branko Vojnica  described the agreement as a constructive step in the  negotiating process toward the restoration of peace.    The Assembly tasked a delegation of the republic of Serb  Krajina to the so-called second phase of negotiations referring  to economic and humanitarian cooperation not to accept talks on  issues which could prejudice political solutions.    As the second phase of negotiations with the Croatian side  is  yet to begin, the assembly decided that these negotiations be  led by a new Krajina government, which is to be formed in about  10 days.    The Krajina parliament also unanimously decided that all  agreements and treaties reached in negotiations with Croatia are  subject to ratification by the assembly. The assembly session  continues.</p>

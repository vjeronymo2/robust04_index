			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT ACTIVISTS  </P> <P> As a member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition, I completely agree with Byron  Dillon's sentiments that the dire problems of our own country, such as drugs,  AIDS, racism and homelessness, must be dealt with immediately. But his  criticism of our organization is unfair for precisely the reasons he cites  (letter, Jan. 2).  </P> <P> It is very true that compared to a sit-in at the South African Consulate,  working for the homeless is unglamorous and yields little publicity. This is  exactly why people such as Dillon have never heard about our efforts to help  Los Angeles' homeless, such as our clothing drive to raise emergency supplies  for the men and women of Skid Row who lost what little they had when the  homeless arts and cultural center Another Planet burned down last summer. He  has also never heard about the educational anti-racism workshops the coalition  has sponsored for high school, junior high and college students, or our work  for the women's rights movement. I could give many more examples.  </P> <P> Obviously, the Student Coalition alone will never solve all the problems of the  world, or even Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Student Coalition members see themselves as part of a global  student community. To be disruptive to the actions of the South African  government's representatives in our own city is what we had in mind. Saving the  life of a South African citizen is no less worthy than saving the life of an  American citizen.  </P> <P> And if the Student Coalition can continue to bring together youth from all  cultural backgrounds, as we have been, and uniting them together in a common  goal, we are making the first big step in eliminating the racial barriers of  our own society.  </P> <P> KEVIN SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

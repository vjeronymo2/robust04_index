			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING MORE ROOM AT THE BOTTOM;  </P> <P> PROP. 107: THE FEDS WON'T DO IT, SO WE SHOULD -- VOTE YES FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> As many as 250,000 Californians are homeless. A growing number -- at least a  quarter -- are mothers and children in search of affordable housing. They need  help. Proposition 107 on the June 5 ballot would provide it.  </P> <P> The Housing and Homeless Bond Act would authorize $150 million in general  obligation bonds to provide 5,560 additional beds in emergency shelters and  transitional housing. And that is just the beginning.  </P> <P> The bond measure would also finance the renovation of 12,000 apartments and the  construction of 4,000 units designated for low-income senior citizens, disabled  adults who have special needs and the working poor.  </P> <P> The state must shoulder these varied housing burdens because the federal  government no longer does the job. California has the largest shortage of  affordable rental housing in the nation. Apartments that rent for $400 or less  are difficult to find in most urban regions. The shortage is especially severe  in Los Angeles. It forces hard-working families to set up housekeeping in  unimproved garages or unsafe tenements. The scarcity also forces poor mothers  and children to double up with relatives or camp out in battered cars. Equally  hard hit are elderly men and women on fixed incomes who can afford to spend no  more than $200 on housing.  </P> <P> Homeless men have the toughest time finding shelter. Many simply cannot  function; they drink, use drugs and are mentally ill. Others, however, are  capable of living decently if they can find a room in a safe and sanitary  single-residency hotel. The lack of such rooms forces poor men to curl up in  squalid doorways, sleep in cardboard boxes under freeways and stretch out on  sidewalks.  </P> <P> Emergency shelters provide a temporary solution, but night after night there's  no room at the inn. As many as 1,800 homeless men are turned away nightly at  shelters in Los Angeles County. That unfortunate scenario is repeated in other  counties. There is an urgent need for more beds in temporary shelters.  </P> <P> But, in the long run, the best remedy for homelessness is a lot more affordable  rental housing. Proposition 107 would help homeless people, and impoverished  tenants. It would also help 4,000 first-time home buyers, primarily young  families and veterans, to purchase a house -- no mean feat in most California  markets. This needed measure offers other benefits as well that would stimulate  jobs and new local revenues.  </P> <P> Most of all, the bond measure would provide a decent and affordable place to  live for thousands of Californians. Vote Yes on June 5.  </P></p>

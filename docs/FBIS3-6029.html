			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Four key unions  representing about 1.8 million workers have agreed to support  candidates in the next general election who are not members of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], political  sources said Monday [14 March].    The move marks a major policy shift from their longstanding  support for the party, they said.    It also indicates that cooperation within the seven-party  coalition led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be a  factor in whether candidates get support from the unions -- the  All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, the Japan  Teachers' Union, the Japan Telecommunications' Workers Union and  the Japan Postal Workers' Union.    The sources made the remarks in reaction to a front-page  article in the Monday morning issue of the ASAHI SHIMBUN, which  said representatives of the four unions reached the agreement in  a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on February 8.    The four unions have been among the key groups within the  eight million-strong Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation)  and have traditionally backed the SDP.    But some supporters of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)  inside Rengo have expressed reservations about solely rallying  behind SDP and DSP candidates, a move seen as deliberately  distancing themselves from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito [Clean Government Party], the ASAHI said.    The SDP, the DSP, Shinseito and Komeito are members of the  ruling coalition along with Hosokawa's Japan New Party, new  party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the United Social Democratic  Party.</p>

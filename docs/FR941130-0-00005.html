			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, on February 15, 1994, the FDIC issued an interim final rule adding a new section to Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations prohibiting State Savings Banks from converting to stock form without complying with the requirements of the interim rule (Interim Rule). 59 FR 7194. The Interim Rule, which remains in effect until the effective date of the final rule, requires State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form consisting of a description of the proposed conversion accompanied by a copy of all documents and application materials filed with the applicable state and federal regulators. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC currently reviews all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in: the use of the proceeds from the sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials; the participation of depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion; the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment of stock subscription rights; and the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Notice and Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the same date as the FDIC issued the Proposed Rule it also issued a notice and request for comments (Notice) on the possible need for fundamental changes to the mutual-to-stock conversion process. 59 FR 30357 (June 13, 1994). The comment period on the Notice ended on August 12, 1994. The Notice indicated that_despite recently initiated remedial actions taken, or proposed to be taken, by the FDIC, the OTS, or state bank supervisory agencies_in the view of some, the current design of the mutual-to-stock conversion process encouraged management abuses and windfalls, flawed and sometimes disingenuous appraisal methodology, and under-deployment of capital. The general purpose of the Notice was to elicit an open and free discussion on a range of issues involving mutual-to-stock conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, the Notice included a suggestion to provide ``rightholders'' of converting mutual institutions with certain stock subscription rights (or ``value'') which would only be provided after a legitimate decision to convert had been made by the trustees or directors of a converting institution. The Notice acknowledged that such a proposed approach likely would require specific legislative authorization from the Congress and the FDIC was thus assessing whether it would be in the public interest for it to pioneer such a proposed approach by recommending legislative action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to obtain information about whether the public concurred in both the assessment of these fundamental problems and the suggested solution, the Notice requested comments on 9 specific issues. In response to the Notice, over 1,000 comments were submitted by mutual institutions, financial industry groups, state banking or thrift supervisory agencies, municipalities, state legislators, members of Congress, industry attorneys and individuals. Commenters generally opposed the ``creation'' of the suggested ``rightholders''' interests as a matter of public policy. It was also argued that mutuality would be threatened because depositors, armed with the prospect of new rights, would pressure and force management of a mutual to convert to stock form_a situation leading to the eventual extinction of ``mutuality'' for insured depository institutions. Several commenters also specifically noted that complex tax and accounting issues would be raised by the creation of such rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

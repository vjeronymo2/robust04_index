			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zamira Koleci] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] The country continues to express deep  indignation against the criminal act by the Greek chauvinists  who took the lives of two Albanian officers and wounded several  others. As we have learned, President Berisha last evening met  with political party representatives, government members, and  chairmen of various associations to discuss this tragic and  painful event.    [Koleci] The president's press and information office  reports that President Sali Berisha yesterday afternoon  organized a meeting attended by Meksi, Vukaj, Malasi, Serreqi,  [Public Order Minister] Musaraj, [Social Democratic Party  Chairman] Gjinushi, Laco, [Republican Party Chairman] Godo,  Shamata, Hajdaraga, Kola, and [Independent Trade Union Chairman]  Xheka to discuss the massacre that one of the Greek commando  units carried out with premeditation in the early hours of  Sunday [10 April] in the recruiters barracks in Peshkepi e  Siperme, 4 km into Albanian territory.    President Berisha stressed that this act is a real massacre  and an unprecedented violation of Albania's integrity and  sovereignty since 1949. This marks an open hostile act by  Greece against Albania and is a continuation of other  terroristic acts committed by Greek forces, such as the case of  the murder of the shepherd in Devoll and the assault on our  warship in our own waters. All of these -- even though they are  documented -- have been negated by the Greek Government through  dishonest means.    For the past two years, Berisha continued, we have made  intensive efforts to develop cooperation and relations with  Greece. We have tried and will continue to try so that the  Greek minority in Albania and our emigrants in Greece will be a  powerful factor of cooperation and understanding between our two  peoples and countries.    Unfortunately, I would say, for the misfortune of the Greek  Government circles, we have ascertained that the Greek side has  used Albanian emigrants as a means of pressure against Albania,  even openly making calls for its destabilization. Concerning  the minority, attempts have been made to manipulate it and turn  it into an apple of discord for Albania.    Berisha stressed that our policy toward the minority cannot  change because of the absurd stance of the Greek Government and  officials toward Albania. The president continued to say that  the minority is and will be free citizens of Albania. We will  continue our efforts for the expansion of human rights and  freedoms for Albanians and the minority.    Further on, Berisha reconfirmed his determination and that  of  the government to persistently continue the policy of decreasing  the tension and contributing toward peace and stability in the  region, something that is not at all desired by those who are  interested in creating tensions and conflicts.    On the other hand, the Albanian president informed those  present that the government is making all the demarches to  friendly countries and international organizations to condemn  this grave act of terrorism on the part of Greece and ask her to  put an end to this policy by finding and convicting its  culprits. The Albanian Government will take every measure to  counteract terror of any kind and secure its own citizens.    Those present supported the statement by President Berisha  and considered this meeting very useful. They strongly  condemned the ugly and terroristic act against Albania and  supported the constructive policy of the Albanian Government in  the region. They also asked the government to condemn this  terrorist act to the UN Security Council and international  organizations and take all measures to see that such acts are no  longer repeated.    They also asked the Albanian Government to continue to  oppose  the policy of Hellenism in the south of the country and expand  its policy on preserving peace and stability in the region.  Those present at the meeting said that everyone should clearly  understand that when it is a question of the national question,  the Albanians are and will remain a sole voice.</p>

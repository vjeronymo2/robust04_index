			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Modest rise in Italian inflation Italian prices rose 0.3 per cent in August, giving an annualised inflation rate of 3.9 per cent, according to preliminary figures from the Italian National Statistics Institute. The previous government projected an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent at the end of the year. and Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, had forecast a rise of 4 per cent on the basis that manufacturers usually wait until October to be sure of demand patterns before passing on price rises to consumers. However, this year industrialists were sufficiently confident of the recovery - both export-led and now domestic - that this process had begun in late August. Robert Graham, Rome Denmark's current account surplus fell during the second quarter to DKr2.6bn (Pounds 260m) from DKr8.8bn during the same period in 1993. The European Union's annual rate of inflation rose slightly in August but still remained well below the level of a year ago. The rate of inflation last month rose to 3.1 per cent from 3 per cent in July, compared with 3.5 per cent in August 1993. Swedish retail sales declined 4.7 per cent in July compared with July 1993, mainly because of a 13.7 per cent decline in sales of durable goods after unusually warm weather during the month.</p>

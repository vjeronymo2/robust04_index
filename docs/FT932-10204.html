			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Altron ahead 11.5% at R103m ALTRON, the diversified electronics, information technology and power cables group, lifted attributable earnings in difficult operating conditions by 11.5 per cent to R103.3m (Dollars 32.68m) in the year to February from R92.7m a year earlier. The best relative performance came from Fintech, the information technology arm, which lifted attributable earnings to R26.2m from R20m. Powertech increased earnings by 7 per cent to R46.3m from R43.4m, but Altech's earnings fell back slightly to R90m from R92m as an improved operating performance was offset by lower interest income on cash balances and a higher tax bill. Group turnover edged ahead to R2.7bn from R2.6bn, but tough trading conditions saw operating income fall to R281.2m from R294.5m. The dividend was increased by 7 per cent to 170 cents from 159 cents last time. Mr Bill Venter, executive chairman, said the group had made progress in pursuing its policy of strategic acquisition while investing in new markets and growth opportunities domestically and abroad. Altron has acquired an investment in Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications systems manufacturer, which in turn has taken a 50 per cent stake in Alcatel Altech Telecoms. This deal, and existing ties with the Swiss ABB group, offers Altron entry to their markets.</p>

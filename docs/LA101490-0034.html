			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANNING RACIST SPEECH BEGS THE REAL QUESTIONS OF CURBING RACISM;  </P> <P> CODES: TELLING STUDENTS WHAT THEY CANNOT SAY, EVEN WHEN BIGOTRY IS THE TARGET,  IS A BAD IDEA. MORE SPEECH, NOT LESS, IS BETTER PROTECTION.  </P> <P> The American idea of free speech hinges on the basic principle that, subject to  a very few, very narrow exceptions, everyone may say what he wishes, even if  what he says is poisonous or hateful. A true democracy cannot do otherwise.  Democracy determines the form and procedure by which its citizens discourse; it  may not determine the content of that discourse.  </P> <P> But a new trend may be emerging. A series of speech codes have been enacted on  various campuses, including Stanford, the UC Berkeley and the University of  Wisconsin. If you say something racist, you can be suspended or expelled. The  codes themselves are usually narrowly drawn to cover the face-to-face,  intentional racial insult and, as such, they may even pass constitutional  muster. It is the justifications offered for these codes that are worrisome.  </P> <P> The speech codes -- one is tempted to say "loyalty oaths" -- are usually  defended by law professors, who should know better. One of them, Mari Matsuda  of the University of Hawaii, has been a primary proponent, proposing a ban on  racist speech, a "value-laden, non-neutral" approach that she proudly describes  as "heretical" to First Amendment thinking. "Speech is meaningless to people  who don't have equality," she says. Only oppressed groups would be protected  because "retreat and reaffirmation of personhood are more easily attained for  historically non-subjugated groups."  </P> <P> Leave aside for the time being the sociology jargon and an apparent desire for  the notoriety that leads to tenure. Turn, instead, to the basic concepts of  this philosophy. The starting point is the idea that speech is meaningless to  people without equality. And yet the whole concept of banning speech is  premised on the idea that it is very meaningful, indeed. We must protect  minorities from racist speech because speech is in some way important. Why  protect them? Because racist speech degrades and insults them.  </P> <P> Racist speech is, without any doubt, degrading and insulting. As a Eurasian, I  can assure you that it is far more debilitating than most whites realize.  Perhaps the only thing more degrading and insulting is the assumption that one  is too weak, too cowardly, too helpless to stand up for oneself against the  racists.  </P> <P> Victims of racist speech can shout back, throw a good left jab, file a  complaint, organize a boycott or a picket line. Or maybe -- and this is much  tougher -- they can just study hard, graduate at the top of their class and let  success be their revenge. Surely overreacting to racists is to allow them to  have more importance than they deserve.  </P> <P> But however one chooses to react, it seems counterproductive to cultivate  delicate sensibilities, or to nurse a conviction that one is entitled to  protection from the rough and tumble of life. It is ironic that the  beneficiaries of the campus speech codes are university students, who probably  confront a great deal less real racism than most ordinary working people.  </P> <P> What about the idea that the way to prevent or end racism is to silence  everyone who doesn't belong to a "historically subjugated group"? Many whites  -- Irish, Jews, and Armenians, for example -- have claims to historical  subjugation. And a lot of racism doesn't involve whites at all, but exists  between members of different minority groups. If we prohibit racist speech by  other minorities, are we subjugating them more? Do we have to choose which  group has been historically more subjugated in order to decide whose rights to  enforce?  </P> <P> Perhaps the saddest outcome of this largely academic insistence on form over  substance is that it distracts from real problems of economic inequality based  on race. Bans on racist speech don't prevent racism, or even its expression.  It's hard to solve real problems but easy to make up trendy proposals regarding  other people's civil liberties.  </P> <P> Does racism silence minorities? Most certainly. But accusations of racism, in  America today, are at least as silencing. People with good intentions, trying  to explain complex or ambiguous feelings, can be silenced immediately by the  accusation of racism. And that's the tragedy of the speech code. It won't stop  real racists, who don't care how they are perceived. It will only stop people  who actually care about how minorities view them.  </P> <P> The response to minorities who feel silenced is to encourage them to talk, not  to silence everyone else. The solution to bad speech has always been, and  always will be, more speech.  </P> <P> We have always honored the concept that everyone has a right to express an  opinion, no matter how much the rest of society may disapprove. We have always  feared that if we start imposing limits on some speech, we may find it  difficult to stop. But that is not all there is to the traditional defense of  free speech. Democracy is a bare-knuckle business. Free speech is the way we  find out what other people are thinking. That's the necessary first step to  persuading them of the justice of our arguments, of reaching democratic  compromises people can live with. We aren't talking about making sure no one  hurts our feelings. We are talking about getting the information we need to  change the way people think.  </P> <P> A racist won't stop being a racist just because you stop up his mouth.  Believing that the elimination of racist speech is somehow the same as  eliminating racism is plain romance.  </P> <P> The concrete measures of equality and power have to do with money, food,  education, housing. Hopefully, all those bright young minds in all those fine  universities will turn their minds to the solution of real race problems for  real victims, and leave hall monitoring to the First Amendment romantics.  </P></p>

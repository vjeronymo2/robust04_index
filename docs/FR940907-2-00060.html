			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If we do not publish a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice before the new fiscal year begins, readers may presume that until and unless notified otherwise, the criteria and standards which were in effect for the previous fiscal year remain in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In those instances where we are unable to meet our goal of publishing the subject  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice before the beginning of the fiscal year, we may publish the criteria and standards notice at any subsequent time during the year. If we choose to publish a notice in this manner, the evaluation period for any such criteria and standards which are the subject of the notice will be revised to be effective on the first day of the first month following publication. Hence, any revised criteria and standards will measure performance prospectively; that is, we will not apply new measurements to assess performance on a retroactive basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, it is not our intention to revise the criteria and standards which will be used during the evaluation period once this information has been published in a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. However, on occasion, either because of Administrative mandate or Congressional action, there may be a need for changes which have direct impact upon the criteria and standards previously published, or which require the addition of new criteria or standards, or that cause the deletion of previously published criteria and standards. Should such changes be necessitated, we will issue a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice prior to implementation of the changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all instances, necessary manual issuances will be published each year to ensure that the criteria and standards are implemented uniformly and accurately. Also, as in previous years, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice will be republished and the effective date revised if changes are warranted as a result of the public comments received on the criteria and standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Incentive Payments to Carriers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 1842(c)(1)(B) of the Act, this notice also describes the current methodology that will be used to award incentive payments to carriers that successfully increase the proportion of physicians in the carrier's service area who are participating physicians, or the proportion of payments to participating physicians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1842(h) of the Act sets forth the Medicare participating physician program. ``Participating'' means accepting assignment on all Medicare claims. ``Accepting assignment'' means physicians accept Medicare's approved amount as full payment, with the beneficiary responsible for only the Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts. The main goal of the program is to reduce the financial impact of medical costs upon beneficiaries by establishing incentives for physicians to accept assignment on all Medicare claims. The provisions give all physicians an annual opportunity to enroll or disenroll as a Medicare participating physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1842(b)(3)(H) of the Act requires Medicare carriers to implement programs to recruit and retain physicians as participating physicians. These programs include educational and outreach activities and the use of professional relations personnel to handle billing and other problems relating to payment of claims of participating physicians. These programs are also designed to familiarize beneficiaries with the participating physician program and to assist the beneficiaries in locating participating physicians. Carriers also increase participation through the use of public relations, literature, and training in the physician community. We believe carriers continue to perform these activities because they are advantageous to their operations. By properly educating the provider community, carriers save staff time and produce cleaner claims which result in fewer inquiries as well as fewer exceptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

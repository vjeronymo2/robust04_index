			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our Local Industry That Has Been </F> Cosolidated Under The Party's Leadership"]    [Text] Functionaries in the local industry sector and  people's consumer goods producers throughout the country are  accelerating production amid high zeal, upholding the party's  light-industry-first policy. They are filled with the firm  determination to actively contribute to implementing the party's  light-industry-first policy by effecting a new innovation in  people's consumer goods production at a time when thirty years  have passed since the dear comrade leader began to exercise his  leadership in our party's work, and they are now further  exerting themselves on the occasion of Local Industry Day [7  June].    On 7 June 1958, 36 years ago, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song published the historic work, "On Increasing People's  Consumer Goods and Improving Commodity Circulation Work," and,  thus, elucidated a brilliant future for the development of local  industry. Since then, he has strengthened and developed our  local industry, along with our large-scale central industry,  into a mighty and powerful consumer goods production base which  has greatly contributed to implementing the party's policy of  carrying out the revolution in light industry.    Shining on the path of the rapid development of local  industry is the immortal leadership achievement of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated:  Developing local industry is an important way of increasing  production rapidly and improving the people's living.    The dear comrade leader, with his deep insight into the  important position of local industry, has been deeply interested  in its development. When he personally conducted on-the-spot  guidance to local industry plants, the dear comrade leader not  only gave detailed teachings to the matters on increasing  quantities and kinds of consumer goods by mobilizing and using  local reserves and potential to the maximum and on improving  their quality, but also led functionaries and working people in  this sector to the single road of victory.    In the summer of 1962, the dear comrade leader conducted an  on-the-spot guidance to various local industry plants in Sakchu  county. This became an occasion for a new turn in the  development of our local industry.    Visiting Sakchu textile plant that day, the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il expressed satisfaction upon witnessing the  appearance of the plant, where workers were working vigorously  with modern equipment, and the cloth they produced, said with  joy at a meeting with functionaries of the plant: In four  years, the plant which started with a loom set in a room of  another person's house has changed beyond recognition today.    He then stressed the need to produce more good-quality cloth  by improving the level of technical provisions at local plants  and fully mobilizing and utilizing locally available sources of  raw materials.    The dear comrade leader also visited the Sakchu corn  processing plant and there said that only when we build local  industry plants with our own strength and develop technology  rapidly will we make the country richer and the people better  off.    Based on this deep understanding of the real situation in  the  Sakchu county and on his analysis of data, the dear comrade  leader published the historic document, "The Position and Role  of a Socialist Country's County," which is another brilliant  milestone in developing local industry.    In August 1963, the dear comrade leader visited Pungsan,  called the first village under the sky, and personally looked  around a nameless food store in the town of Pungsan. On that  day, he even personally tasted the soy sauce that is supplied to  residents. He even provided detailed instructions on the method  for producing more delicious soy sauce and bean paste.    In June 1990, four years ago, the dear comrade leader, in  his  historic letter to participants of the national meeting of light  industry, set forth concrete tasks and methods to further  develop local industry and to vigorously wage people's consumer  goods production as a mass movement. Thus, he vigorously  inspired functionaries and working people in the local industry  sector into the revolution in light industry.    Recently the dear comrade leader has been providing us with  constant love and care in order to provide our people with a  happier and richer lives by more rapidly improving the standard  of the people's living.    In an effort to repay the dear comrade leader's great love  and care with loyalty, functionaries and working people in this  sector have waged a vigorous struggle to produce various kinds  of good-quality people's consumer goods by effectively utilizing  the existing production capabilities and mobilizing locally  available reserves and potential to the maximum. As a result of  this, our local industry has made rapid development and is,  accordingly, contributing greatly to smoothly meeting the  ever-increasing people's demands for consumer goods.    Comrade Yi Kyong-yong from the General Department of  Local Industry of North Pyongan Province says:    [Begin recording] Thanks to our party's chuche-oriented  policy of simultaneouly developing central and local industry,  our North Pyongan Province has made rapid progress in local  industry. Local industry plants with modern production  facilities have been built everywhere in our province today,  including Changsong and Paetong, which were treated as remote  and secluded areas in the past.    These local industry plants in our province have produced  great quantities of various kinds of consumer goods with good  quality in order to make our people's living more civilized and  affluent.    Indeed, our industry which started from scratch, is today  demonstrating its appearance as a chuche-oriented industry which  can manufacture everything. This is indeed a great change.    This great change and great success on this land, is the  brilliant result of the great leader's wise leadership and the  dear comrade leader's energetic guidance. [end recording]    Functionaries and working people who work and live in  Sakchu,  the glorious land, where the dear comrade leader's immortal  achievements dwell, are effecting constant innovation in  building a raw material base and in modernizing local industry  with the burning determination to effect greater success in  developing local industry.    All counties in North Pyongan Province, including Changsong  county, Chongju county, and Kwaksan county, have each built a  200-chongbo base for raw material cultivation as demanded by the  party and are producing various kinds of people's consumer goods  based on the base.    Counties in South Pyongan Province, including Yangdok county  and Sinyang county, have collected great quantities of wild  fruit, wild berries, and wild vegetables for developing local  industry.    In addition, cities and counties like Huichon city and  Chonchon county of Chagang Province, Kim Chong-suk county and  Paekam county of Yanggang Province, and Pujon county of South  Hamgyong Province, have constantly developed local industry by  properly utilizing the specific situation of the regions.    These cities and counties have been developing their local  industry by building medium- and small-type power plants and  other numerous local industry plants, including chemical plants  and caustic soda plants, everywhere.    Functionaries and working people in the local industry  sector  have registered great success in their struggle to modernize  local industry, too.    Today, functionaries and working people in the local  industry  sector recall with high dignity, their proud days of having  traversed the single road of leaping under the wise leadership  of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. They are now  vigorously struggling with the lofty zeal to effect a decisive  turn in the production of people's consumer goods this year.</p>

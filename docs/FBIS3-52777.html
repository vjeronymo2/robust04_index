			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India and China are to increase their cooperation  in the field of coal mining. India is interested in sharing  China's experience and technology in mechanized long-wall mining  in underground mines. Greater emphasis is now being laid on  underground mines, as over 70 percent of Indian coal is coming  from open-cast mines at present. Underground mining is  necessary to increase the production of superior grade coal as  well as coking coal whose deposits are available at deeper  levels. Specific areas of collaboration between the two  countries are expected to be finalized during the visit of a  high-level delegation led by the coal minister, Mr. Ajit Kumar  Panja, to China beginning from Sunday [9 January].</p>

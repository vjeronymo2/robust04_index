			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kodak's divestment costs beat forecast EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment, has unveiled a third-quarter after-tax charge of about Dollars 140m, or 43 cents a share, substantially higher than the Dollars 45m, or 14 cents, many analysts had expected. The impact on Kodak's full-year earnings will be more than offset by benefits of about Dollars 150m, or 46 cents a share, from adopting a new accounting standard for deferred tax. Kodak said the change would be recognised from the beginning of 1992. The Rochester, New York-based company said about half of the third-quarter charges were linked to previously-announced plans to divest or otherwise exit from several non-strategic businesses. Another 25 per cent of the costs came from additional employees leaving under Kodak's early retirement programme. The remaining 25 per cent covered the costs of rationalising the group's overseas operations - primarily the consolidation of its imaging business in France, Japan and Brazil. In 1991, Kodak took restructuring charges of Dollars 1.03bn partly to cover early retirements this year. But workers responded more enthusiastically than expected to the programme, which offers full retirement benefits and an attractive health care package. Excluding the charges, analysts expect Kodak to earn more than Dollars 1 a share in the third quarter, against last year's third-quarter net loss of Dollars 118m, or 37 cents, including restructuring charges of Dollars 435m.</p>

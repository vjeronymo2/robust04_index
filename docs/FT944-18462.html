			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Rwandan camps 'calm but tense' Rwandan refugee camps in north-east Tanzania were 'calm but tense' yesterday and the United Nations refugee agency called for a swift end to lawlessness in one camp in Zaire which had kept aid workers out for a fourth day, Reuter reports from Kigali. Three days' violence rocked the Ngara camps last week; international aid workers said they were worried for their lives and those of refugees they were trying to help. The camps in Tanzania and Zaire are increasingly controlled by militamen and troops of the former Hutu-dominated government defeated in July by the mainly-Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front. Some 800,000 Rwandan refugees are thought to be in the Goma area, with half a million more in west Tanzania, in addition to 2m people displaced inside Rwanda by three months of civil war and massacres. One aid official said the Ngara camps were becoming unmanageable; some aid agencies had reported an increasing number of Rwandans entering the camps with guns.</p>

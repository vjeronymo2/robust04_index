			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Rise in British investment forecast The recovery in Britain will become more broadly based this year, resulting in a steady pace of growth, the OECD forecasts in its outlook, writes Gillian Tett. Although the UK's economic improvement is now well entrenched, business investment was, until recently, 'the missing ingredient', the outlook says. But in the coming months private investment should start to support the recovery 'as company balance-sheet positions and cash flow continue to improve', the report adds. The OECD's overall forecasts for the economy are slightly more upbeat than the UK government's own estimates. Whereas the UK Treasury forecast earlier this week that GDP would grow by 2.75 per cent this year and next year, the OECD predicts growth of 2.8 per cent this year, followed by 3.2 per cent in 1995. Consumers are forecast to continue spending, in spite of April's tax rises - although private consumption growth is expected to dip slightly in the second half of this year, it is expected to pick up after that. The main factors boosting this growth, the OECD says, will be a rise in employment, a further fall in the household savings rates, and a mild rise in house prices. The inflation outlook 'remains benign', the report says, although the OECD's forecasts are slightly higher than those of the Treasury. The OECD's internationally compatible measure of consumer price inflation forecasts a rise of 2.9 per cent this year, while the government forecasts underlying inflation will be 2.5 per cent at the end of this year.</p>

The Robinson model uses reported human hepatic and renal clearance values for nicotine and cotinine. The sensitivity of this model to these input parameters was investigated by varying them within the range of reported clearance values from infusion studies in humans. The resulting model predictions for post-infusion blood levels, urinary output, and the elimination half-lives of both nicotine and cotinine were found to be well within the ranges of those observed in human studies. Thus the model structure does not produce an exaggerated response to variation of the input parameters, and reflects the natural interaction between measures of clearance, volume of distribution, and rates of elimination. In the case of the physiological parameters, variability dominates over uncertainty, while for the distributional parameters, uncertainty dominates. In the case of the kinetic parameters describing clearance, it appears that variability again dominates. For example, the mean values for the terminal half-life of cotinine reported in different studies range from 12 to 21 hours in non-smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186]. The coefficient of variation in these same studies, a measure of interindividual variability, ranges from 17&hyph;22%, and the coefficient of variation for the entire collection of reported individual values is similar: 22% (N=35, mean=16.2). A review of the published data on infusion of nicotine and cotinine in humans [Ex. 4&hyph;270] found a 3-fold variation in reported half-lives for cotinine. For comparison, the variation in the volume of distribution for cotinine was 5-fold, while for the half-life and volume of distribution of nicotine, the variation was 8-fold and 6-fold, respectively. An even greater level of variability can be expected for the kinetic parameters for the renal clearance of nicotine and cotinine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA considers the use of pharmacokinetics and specifically PBPK models an important tool in characterizing and quantifying internal dose for evaluation potential exposures and seeks comment on the applicability of this approach in ascertaining the relationship between adverse health effects and exposure to ETS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Significance of Risk <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the Secretary can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, he must find that a significant risk of harm is present in the workplace and that the new standard is reasonably necessary to reduce or eliminate that risk.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Industrial Union Department, AFL&hyph;CIO  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Petroleum Institute, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  444 U. S. 607, 639&hyph;642 (1980) (Benzene). In the Benzene case, the Supreme Court held that section 3(8) of the Act, which defines a ``occupational safety and health standard'' as a ``requirement reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to promote safety or health requires that, before promulgating a standard, the Secretary must find, ``on the basis of substantial evidence, that it is at least more likely than not that long-term exposure to [the hazard without new regulation] presents a significant risk of material health impairment.'' 444 U. S. at 653. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

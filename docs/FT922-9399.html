			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wesfarmers climbs 77% WESFARMERS, the diversified Australian agricultural group, yesterday said it was confident of meeting its full-year net profit target of ADollars 60m (USDollars 45.4m) after reporting a 77 per cent increase in profits to ADollars 38m for the first nine months, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Sales were up from ADollars 877m to ADollars 984m. The group said lower interest rates and greater efficiency in the fertilisers and chemicals division contributed towards the better performance. In addition, fertiliser sales were higher than in the comparable period of last year. Wesfarmers said demand for cropping fertilisers grew strongly in response to improved wheat prices. The coal, dairy and retail operations contributed improved results, while profits from the gas and transport operations remained steady. The group said it was confident of meeting its full-year profit target, but warned the result was difficult to predict because of the possible effect of weather between April and June, when most fertiliser sales take place.</p>

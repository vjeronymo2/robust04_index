			<p>BFN     Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0112 GMT on 15 June  transmits the text of President Fidel Castro's speech at the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.  This version has been compared with the Havana Radio Rebelde  Network in Spanish at 2300 GMT version published in the 15 June  Latin America DAILY REPORT, pages 16-17, revealing the following  variation:    Column two, paragraph one, sentence one reads: Esteemed  President of Colombia, Cesar Gaviria; Your Majesty; excellencies:    Our summits that began in Guadalajara have been an example  of  inspiration for the rapprochement and unity of our peoples. We  have reaffirmed our determination to meet without the permission  of third parties and without aggravating exclusions. Our  efforts have born fruit in many aspects. The progress made by  Aladi [Latin American Integration Association], the Andean Pact,  the Central American Common Market, Mercosur [Common Market of  the South], and the growing importance of Sela [Latin American  Economic System] is proof of this.

How much cowardice,  mediocrity, and political poverty is truly reflected by this  exclusion. Cuba does not oppose that summit, however. We are  pleased the brother countries of Latin America and the Caribbean  will have an opportunity there to defend with complete firmness  and strength the interests of our peoples.    First, it is time to demand that the sacred right to health,  education, properly remunerated work, and the cultural and  ethnic identity of your people be considered and respected as  fundamental rights of man and that all forms of racial and  sexual discrimination end. It is time to demand an end to  homeless and abandoned children roaming the streets, victims of  all forms of exploitation, violence, and sexual abuse. It is  time to demand an end to hunger; an end to the millions of  deaths each year, deaths that can be avoided.    Cuba has resolutely supported the revolutionary struggle for  democratic processes in Central and South America and is happy  the current U.S. Administration will not foster...

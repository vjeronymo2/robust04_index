			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: FT guide to US healthcare debate The US government has spent months trying to reform the US healthcare system, but politicians still spend their time saying that the US has the best medical care in the world. What's wrong with the current system? There are two main problems: it costs too much - almost twice as much, in proportion to the size of the economy, as it does in any other developed country - and it doesn't cover everyone. Most people get health insurance from their employer as part of their pay. The elderly are covered by a government programme called Medicare, and military veterans get care in Veterans Administration hospitals. Another government programme, called Medicaid, provides some medical cover for the very poor. But that leaves 35m to 40m people, most of them working for small businesses or in seasonal jobs, without any insurance, and the number has been growing steadily. At the same time, medical expenses have been rising twice as fast as the general rate of inflation. This puts severe pressure not only on companies who are paying for insurance, but also on the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office last week estimated that Medicare and Medicaid costs, which today amount to 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product, will make up 6.2 per cent in ten years time. What are the ideas for dealing with this? President Bill Clinton's original plan would have extended health insurance to everyone by requiring employers to provide insurance to their workers, and pay at least 80 per cent of the cost. That idea is still in the bill now up for consideration in the House of Representatives, but no-one gives it much chance of passing. The Senate, meanwhile, is considering a bill which draws some elements from the original Clinton plan, but sets itself the less ambitious goal of covering 95 per cent of the population by the year 2000. It would offer insurance subsidies, particularly to low income families, pregnant women and children. If that does not bring enough people into the health insurance net, a commission would recommend additional measures. And if Congress failed to act on those, a requirement for employers to provide insurance to their workers - similar to the Clinton plan but making employers pay only half the cost - would come into effect as a fallback. Would this get costs under control? No-one is very keen on the payment limits the Clinton plan would have imposed, but not many people are confident that market forces alone are going to bring medical inflation to heel. The Senate bill proposes its own curb on prices: a 25 per cent tax on high cost health plans which raise their prices by more than a target rate. At the same time, any significant reform is going to cost the government more, at least for the first five or ten years, because of the money it will take to subsidise insurance for those who now have none. Don't the Republicans have any ideas? The Republicans have been just as divided as the Democrats on what to do about the health system. Some right wingers have been working to block any reform at all, and most of the party is now on their side. But some moderates have been working with Democrats at the centre of the party to build a 'mainstream coalition', and if a bill is to pass, it will probably be with their help. Isn't there anything everyone agrees on? Yes. Virtually every bill includes measures to stop insurance companies from turning down an applicant because of an existing medical condition, or from cancelling their cover when they or a family member gets sick. Premiums would have to be set on the basis of a whole community, not on how healthy an applicant appears. Almost everyone wants to raise the tax on a packet of cigarettes by 45 cents, which would help pay for some of the other reforms. When is Congress actually going to finish this reform? Possibly never. The Senate is debating some of the more peripheral issues at numbing length, while the House hasn't even started debate. If both chambers pass a bill, they would then have to reconcile their two versions and vote again on the combined bill. Even the Democrats who want reform now fear they are running out of time to do that before they have to go home to campaign for the November elections. That leaves two options: start again next year with a new Congress, or pass a barebones bill that includes some new rules for health insurance companies but not much else. Wouldn't Mr Clinton veto a barebones bill that doesn't cover everyone? That's what he promised earlier this year. His problem is that no-one believes he will actually do it if Congress passes anything that could remotely be described as significant reform.</p>

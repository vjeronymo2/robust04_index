			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BT phones home One swallow does not make spring. So it would be wrong to conclude too much from the encouraging 6 per cent growth in BT's inland call volumes in its final quarter. Even so, shareholders should be warmed by signs that its policy of boosting network usage is at long last bearing fruit. The general economic recovery, of course, goes some way to explain the strong growth in calls. So do enforced price cuts. But the company's belated efforts to market its services also deserve some credit. Over the past year, charge card customers rose two-thirds to 2.8m, residential subscribers to extra services such as call diversion more than doubled to 1.4m and freephone usage grew 30 per cent. Sunday calls have responded to lower weekend tariffs, though not enough to counterbalance the price cuts. Similarly, discounts targeted at business customers have slowed BT's loss of market share and helped it win back customers from Mercury. BT realises it has so far exploited only a fraction of this growth opportunity. Britons use their phones much less intensively than their American counterparts. The company therefore plans to step up its marketing campaign in an attempt to a create a 'high phone-usage culture'. Investors, who have heard management promise similar things in the past, may be sceptical whether growth will materialise, given that BT's market share is bound to fall further. They may also be concerned that earnings are likely to be flat this year following a more aggressive redundancy programme, focusing on managers, which will cost Pounds 750m. But the medium-term outlook is rosier. The stock's sharp underperformance since last November is starting to look overdone.</p>

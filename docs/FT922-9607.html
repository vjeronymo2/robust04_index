			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Letter: Prosecution not measure of success Sir, I welcome Nigel Wilkins' support (Letters, April 29) for the introduction of penalties for the late filing of company accounts. However, he incorrectly equates Companies House compliance effort with the number of directors prosecuted. We aim to secure compliance with the filing requirements of the Companies Act rather than to prosecute. Companies House has an active compliance programme, which includes the issue of letters and explanatory leaflets, regular roadshows and seminars around the UK, national advertising campaigns, and a video. Where these measures fail, we do, of course, prosecute. But a truer measure of our success is the fact that, currently, 8 per cent more companies are filed up-to-date than at the same time last year. This figure is encouraging, but the introduction of late filing penalties should be seen as an indication that Companies House is determined to improve upon this figure even further. In this way, we can offer a better service to the many customers who are entitled to the up-to-date information. Lynne Beal, assistant director (compliance), Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CP4 3UZ, Wales</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why my bank thought I was dead 'THE REASON that your bank have not paid the direct debit is because they say you are dead'. That is enough to turn anyone's hair white - but when you are in your mid-twenties and feeling healthy . . . My 'death' arose from a simple household mishap. It began when the pull-out clothes line over my bath became twisted. I took it off the wall to untangle it and put it back - securely, I thought, but when I loaded it with clothes it fell off and smashed a hole in the bath. I told the story to a cousin, who advised me to claim on my insurance. I filled in several forms and two weeks later a recorded delivery envelope arrived from the Well Known Insurance Company (WKIC). Hooray, I thought - a cheque] Not likely - I should have known that the course of true claims would not run smooth. The WKIC informed me that I had not paid my last two direct debits; therefore I had defaulted, and therefore it would not be paying out. There was a footnote: ' . . . if you wish to discuss this matter further please contact the writer.' I phoned the writer, who told me that I had not filled in a form the WKIC had sent me, and said that if I did not reply within 14 days my policy would be cancelled. I was mystified. I told him that I had not received any forms and that I wanted a better explanation. An hour later he phoned back to say that I had not been sent the form that I had not filled in. He was also sorry to tell me that the reason the direct debits had not been honoured by my bank - the Well-Known Bank - was because according to them, I was dead] The bank manager was very apologetic and diplomatic - after all, he was speaking to a deceased person - and promised to look into the matter. I stewed over the weekend and on Monday he rang to tell me that I had been killed off by a computer error. The WKIC had mis-spelt my surname and given the wrong account number to the WKB. The WKB, instead of pressing the 'Account does not exist' key, pressed the 'Account holder deceased' key by mistake. It turned out to be a combination of errors - the bank had changed all the account numbers two months earlier and said that it would inform all direct debits and standing order holders. I demanded a letter of apology from the WKB (which arrived by return of post) and that the WKIC honoured the claim - which it will.</p>

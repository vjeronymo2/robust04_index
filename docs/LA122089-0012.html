			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Eubanks Apologizes: Speaking of "Roger and Me," television personality Bob  Eubanks has issued a statement of regret for an offensive joke about Jews and  AIDS he tells in the documentary film. Eubanks was preparing to be filmed by  director Roger Moore in Flint, Mich., where Eubanks is a native son, when he  told a tasteless gag to the film's crew. Eubanks reputedly never knew the crew  had the joke on tape until someone who had seen the film told him it was part  of the movie. "It was not my intention to harm, insult or in any way demean the  Jewish people or persons with AIDS," said the one-time host of "The Newlywed  Game" in a prepared statement. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

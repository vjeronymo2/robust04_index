			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The FT portfolio A decimal point was misplaced in last week's article on the Weekend FT Portfolio Race. The value of the Lep Group's portfolio should have read Pounds 63.19, not Pounds 631.95. This has the effect of making the high yield portfolio even more volatile, and drops it to fourth place. The dart board portfolio is second, and the experts finish third.</p>

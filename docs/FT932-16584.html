			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: SmithKline chief gets 20% rise Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive of drug company SmithKline Beecham, received a 20 per cent pay increase last year to take his annual salary past the Pounds 1.5m mark. Mr Bauman, who has seen his high remuneration questioned by some shareholders in the past, received Pounds 1.02m of salary and benefits and a Pounds 571,000 bonus last year. During the period, SmithKline's pre-tax profits increased 11.3 per cent. Mr Henry Wendt, chairman, saw his pay fall from Pounds 978,000 to Pounds 541,000. This follows his December 1991 decision to spend only about half his time working for SmithKline.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The week ahead MONDAY sees interim results from Argos, the catalogue retailer. The figures are hard to forecast as the first half of the year is far less important than the Christmas trading period. There are also costs and losses associated with the new furniture chain. Most estimates are in a range between Pounds 8.5m and Pounds 9.5m pre-tax, against Pounds 10.7m last year. Long awaited annual figures from Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are also expected some time this week. Since January the group has made a series of statements about the figures for the year to February 1, which are expected to show a loss of Pounds 125m pre-tax after forecast exceptional costs relating to rationalisation measures of Pounds 98m and likely interest charges of around Pounds 27m. More interesting will be reports of the group's talks with its bankers and, perhaps, news of a capital restructuring. BICC, the cables and Balfour Beatty construction group, is likely to announce on Wednesday a pre-tax profit fall of roughly Pounds 10m from the Pounds 66m in the first half of '91. A key question will be whether profits are holding up from the European cables business. Marley, the building products manufacturer which announces interims on Wednesday, is expected to show a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.3m to about Pounds 8m. The bad news should be softened by a maintained interim dividend of 2.1p for the third consecutive year - albeit uncovered. However, the company may indicate a cut in the final pay-out. Rentokil Group, the environmental services and property care concern, is expected to stay on course for a 20 per cent earnings increase which when it announces its half-year results on Thursday. Forecasts are for about Pounds 53m compared with Pounds 42.3m. Profits should have been boosted by strong growth from environmental services, which in the past has more than offset the decline in property earnings. Soft insurance markets in the US and a weak dollar will have depressed Sedgwick and Willis Corroon, the UK's two biggest brokers, which report interim figures on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m at Sedgwick, compared with Pounds 65.3m. Willis's pre-tax profits could fall to between Pounds 55m and Pounds 65m, from Pounds 69.4m.</p>

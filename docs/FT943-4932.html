			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Nuclear industry urged to improve reputation Mr Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said yesterday the end of the cold war should make nuclear power more acceptable but the industry was still tainted by scare reports of plutonium trafficking and safety breaches, Reuter reports from Vienna. Mr Blix said more countries would adopt nuclear power to generate electricity only if the industry continued to demonstrate its safety and environmental advantages. Mr Blix said in a speech opening a four-day conference on the future of nuclear power said it is regrettable that the issues which now dominate the media 'tend to create an atmosphere in which it is difficult to have a balanced public discussion of the nuclear power option'. Delegates among the 200 experts from 37 countries stressed the need for global co-operation on safety and new technology. Mr Blix said alarm over plutonium trafficking and the nuclear programmes of such states as Iraq and North Korea had overshadowed the benefits of nuclear power. 'Disturbing as some of these developments are, they do not negate the overriding trend towards ever greater international co-operation to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy,' he said. Russian nuclear experts in Vienna said Moscow's dependence on nuclear power could double by 2010 but any further boost in output would depend on safety and cost. Russia has 29 nuclear reactors, producing 12.5 per cent of its electricity supply. Four more are under construction. Mr Viktor Sidorenko of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry told the conference that new plant designs were based on modern safety regulations and old units were now subject to stringent annual security checks. 'International collaboration and co-operation have become an integral part and condition for activities in the field of nuclear power in Russia,' Mr Sidorenko said.</p>

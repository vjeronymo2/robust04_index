			<p>CSO     [Text] Malaysia and Thailand have agreed to change the  orientation of the General Border Commission (GBC) in the era  following the end of the communist threat.    The two countries will make the GBC a commission that  emphasizes social and economic development for the sake of  finding a way to resolve the various security problems faced by  residents of the border area.    Malaysian Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Mohd. Najib Tun  Razak, who attended the 38th GBC Conference in Bangkok on 7  February, told UTUSAN that the main issue to be reviewed is the  future role of the GBC.    One of the subjects discussed was the threat of Islamic  separatist groups, such as the Pattani United Liberation  Organization (PULO) and the Pattani Malay National Front (BRN).    Najib said that in the high-level talks between the armed  forces commanders of the two countries, Malaysia stressed that  the problems faced by Thailand are internal ones.    "We also stated that we will not help, support, or protect  Islamic separatist groups. If we find Islamic separatist groups  in Malaysian territory, we will take action, such as arresting  them under Malaysian laws.    "This matter is rather complex, however, because of the  existence of family ties among the border residents of the two  countries.    "Free movement in and out of each country's territory can  make the problem more difficult," Najib explained.    He feels that the problem is one of perception, because some  Thai military leaders suspect that the Malaysian Government is  doing something secretly to help the Islamic separatist groups.    "I wish to state that we have never had any secret or  clandestine contacts that could be interpreted as helping those  groups.  <H5>  Military Action </H5>   "It is our viewpoint that the way out of the problem is to  seek resolution through talks. This problem absolutely cannot be  ended by military action.    "The only way to resolve the problem is to include and  involve all parties in the socioeconomic development process,"  he said.    Najib said that if Muslims in southern Thailand want a  better  future, they must seek a way to have talks with the Thai  Government.    This will enable them to get more benefit from the  development process and to find a way that will permit them to  have a more effective part.    He said terrorist activity is no longer an approach that can  help determine the future.    These subjects are among the main agenda items to be  discussed by the two countries throughout this year, and he  hopes that prior to the 39th GBC Conference next year Malaysia  and Thailand can find points of agreement to serve as future  guidelines for the GBC.    With regard to the comment by General Kitti Rattanachaya,  chief of the Fourth Army Division, that there are Islamic  separatist bases in Kelantan and Perak, Najib said such bases do  not exist.    "It is clear that Malaysia does not give protection to those  groups.    "If we find that they have fled into Malaysian territory,  however, and if we can track them down, we will take action  according to Malaysian law."</p>

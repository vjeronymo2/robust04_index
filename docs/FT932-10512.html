			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Bail law reform moves closer REFORM of the law on bail moved a step closer to coming into force yesterday, when the House of Commons passed without debate a bill to tighten up the existing arrangements. Some MPs believe, however, that the questions raised by the flight of Mr Asil Nadir go wider than bail provisions and include the handling of fraud trials. The bail bill, which will now go to be considered by the House of Lords, was brought forward before Mr Nadir fled to northern Cyprus, but his departure has given it fresh impetus. The measure, brought forward by Mr Michael Stephen, a Tory backbencher, and supported by the government and by MPs of all parties, would give the prosecution a right of appeal where magistrates grant bail against the advice of the police. While some MPs believe that it would have made a difference in Mr Nadir's case if the new law had been in force - the Serious Fraud Office had originally objected to his being given bail - others are very doubtful about whether it would have had any impact. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs, believes that the length of time fraud cases can take to come to court is a significant factor, which should be considered. The prospect of a two- or three-year time lag between charges being brought and the trial beginning must make it more difficult for magistrates to decide to keep someone remanded in custody rather than on bail. Recommendations for expediting fraud trials could come from the work already being undertaken by the royal commission on the criminal justice system on the investigation, prosecution and trial procedures of fraud cases. The commission is due to report shortly, but there would almost certainly be a further period of consideration before the government decided how to respond.</p>

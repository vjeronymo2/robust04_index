			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / MEPs seek cut in emissions THE Socialist group in the European Parliament called yesterday for a 20 per cent cut in EC carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005 - a much steeper reduction than the target the Community is already struggling to meet. The ambitious target is part of a list of 55 environmental measures the Socialists are advancing as a programme the EC should now take up with the same vigour the Community demonstrated in creating the single European market, which came into force this year. The EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, although Germany and Denmark have set themselves the 20 per cent cuts the Socialists are calling for by 2005, and Belgium and the Netherlands are aiming at 5 per cent cuts by 2000. The 199 Socialists MEPs are the largest bloc in the European Parliament, and one of their number, Mr Ken Collins, Labour Euro-MP for Strathclyde East in Britain, chairs its environment committee, which has had significant influence in shaping EC 'green' standards. The committee is one of the most heavily-lobbied bodies in the EC, especially by industry. The programme calls for early agreement on the controversial energy tax proposed by the European Commission to cut CO emissions and combat global warming, and mandatory energy efficiency standards on a wide range of appliances such as boilers, washing machines and cars. It would also introduce a general duty for manufacturers to take back and recycle 'end-of-life' products, move towards a comprehensive system of environmental liability, and strictly enforce environmental impact assessment on construction projects and all EC-funded programmes, in and outside Europe. EC environmental impact assessment rules have been an area of consistent friction between Brussels and all member states, particularly the UK, although the Commission has been backing away from legal action for fear of further upset in the tortuous ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Under Maastricht, the European Parliament will get 'co-decision,' or a legislative voice equal to the Council of Ministers of the 12 in setting framework programmes for the environment. But it will still be consulted only on measures with fiscal, land use, water resources or choice of energy resources implications. Under EC rules only the commission can propose such changes. Mr Collins, presenting the 55-point programme in Paris yesterday, said: 'It is now eight years since the White Paper on the completion of the internal market, and the project is all but complete. We must now plan for the next decade and the big idea must be the environment.'</p>

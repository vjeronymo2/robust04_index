			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Island row halts Iranian hands of friendship: The dispute over sovereignty of Abu Musa has poisoned relations in the Gulf THE DISPUTE between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over control of the small Gulf island of Abu Musa has shaken the region's recent calm and handed an unexpected victory to hardliners opposed to the policies of Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's president. Three years of policies aimed at improving Iran's relations with its Arab neighbours have been undone in less than a month - and hardliners, ousted from power in the May elections to the country's assembly, are saying 'we told you so'. The issue of who has sovereignty over the island, in the south-eastern Gulf, has also raised wider antipathies. Iran's old opponents in the region, such as Egypt, as well as some it has acquired more recently, most significantly Algeria, have come out in support of the claims of Sharjah, one of the seven city states which make up the United Arab Emirates, to the island. Both the Gulf Co-operation Council (Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar) and the 21-member Arab League have condemned Iranian 'aggression' over Abu Musa. Two months ago Iran was set to restore diplomatic ties with Egypt. But Iranian hardliners are claiming that a recent statement by Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, that the Arab countries must not give in to Iran, proves they were right to warn against the liaison. Iran and Sharjah agreed to share the island under an agreement signed in 1971 which gave Iran control over security and permitted an Iranian garrison on the island, while giving Sharjah sovereignty. The dispute now centres on claims that Iran is using its control of security to take over sovereignty. Abu Musa and the flanking islands of Lesser and Greater Tumb, also under Iranian control but disputed by the UAE, form a strategically vital triangle at the mouth of the Straights of Hormuz at the entry of the Gulf. Despite President Rafsanjani's protestations in mid-September that his government's 'hands are ready to press hands of co-operation and friendship in the region', Tehran appears to be using the Abu Musa dispute to show the GCC there can be no security in the region without Iran. Iran has, in particular, been aggrieved that the attempts by the GCC states, Egypt and Syria, to forge a regional defence structure out of the post Gulf war Damascus Declaration, little though they have so far come to, have been made without attempts formally to include Tehran. Tensions over the island have been growing for eight months, since Iran refused to allow a boat carrying Sharjah nationals to land at Abu Musa. Saalam, a daily newspaper which reflects the views of the Iranian hardliners, has called for a reduction in the level of the Iranian mission in Abu Dhabi and restrictions on trade with 'the sheikhdoms supporting hostile policies'. A report last week by AFP, the French news agency, quoting diplomats in the UAE as saying that 'Iran has no alternative but to leave the three islands,' provoked Iranian officials to break with the reconciliatory tones adopted. Mr Khamel Kharazi, Iran's representative to the UN, and Mr Morteza Sarmadi, the foreign office spokesman, both claimed that all three islands belonged to Iran. Mr Javan Larijani, a senior foreign policy official and member of the Supreme National Security Council, then used last week's Friday prayer service to issue a warning to his Arab neighbours. Mr Larijani, said policies adopted by the Arab Gulf states would lead them to 'destruction'. He said: 'Experience has proved that Islamic Iran will not allow aggression against its territorial integrity.' He also discounted claims by the UAE to have an historic right to the islands, saying that few of the present Gulf states existed 70 years ago, while Iran has a history of more than 2,500 years. While the politicians and negotiators talked of peace in Abu Dhabi, where the two sides met inconclusively late last month to seek a solution to the row, several Iranian military chiefs have been using more belligerent tones. Mr Mohsen Rezai, commander of the Revolutionary Guard, last week told his troops that if diplomatic means failed 'we are ready to protect our territory'. General Satari, head of the Iranian air force, said that if any aircraft took off against Iran, his men would be ready to defend Iran's soil. But Iran's newly assertive policy over Abu Musa is also thought to reflect domestic pressures in the country. A political analyst in Tehran explained: 'Iran is having trouble in her economic policies. This is already putting pressure on the government. The government therefore cannot afford to give up an inch of what the people see as Iranian land. It could have a devastating effect internally.' What is certain in all the confusion, is that Iran will not move on the territorial issue. Lose now and the country fears condemning itself to the second tier in the power structures of the region. More than friends, more than trade deals and more than international goodwill, Iran believes it must re-establish itself as a power to be reckoned with in the Gulf, the Middle East and the Moslem world. Abu Musa appears to be round one in the process.</p>

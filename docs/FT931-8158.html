			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: ICI faces decision on how to raise Pounds 1bn of new equity IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indust-ries, which is expected to announce on Thursday that it will proceed with its demerger plan, must also decide how to raise about Pounds 1bn of new equity regarded as essential to make the split work. The ICI board, chaired by Sir Denys Henderson, is understood to have set itself a number of goals in the financing, some of which appear to conflict. First, it is keen to reward loyal shareholders who supported ICI when Hanson took its 2.8 per cent stake in 1991 by preserving their pre-emption rights. ICI also wants the certainty of an underwritten issue, which many think can only be done in the UK market, so that it can proceed with the demerger with confidence. These two factors would tend to push ICI towards a rights issue, either before the demerger, or by Zeneca, the pharmaceutical side, after the demerger. However, Zeneca would like to widen its spread of shareholders, building an international, and especially US, investor base. 'That concept is clearly very important in the mind of Zeneca,' said one person involved. Only about 5 per cent of ICI's shares are held in the US. ICI and SG Warburg, its adviser, are looking closely at the Wellcome share sale last summer, which was designed to increase overseas ownership of the drug company's shares. The Wellcome sale was done on a 'book-building' basis. Potential buyers put bids in during a sale period and a price was set reflecting supply and demand. The price set was close to the market price, whereas a rights issue is normally made at a significant discount to the market price. But Wellcome did not face a pre-emption rights problem as the shares being sold were existing rather than new ones. Investment bankers are being asked to put proposals to ICI which can bring the differing aims into line. One suggestion is that Zeneca should proceed with a rights issue, but that the company should attempt to generate demand from new investors for the new shares while they are trading in nil-paid form. That could involve an international road show to whip up interest in the shares. That could prove an expensive option for Zeneca though, as it would mean issuing shares on a rights issue discount and then giving shareholders a profit if new investors are encouraged to buy. Another approach could be to run a book building sale which would probably set a strike price closer to the market price, but to give existing shareholders the right to buy back a large proportion of the issue at the strike price. That would have the advantage of preserving pre-emptive rights, and obtaining a better price for the shares. But it would be hard to combine that with a firm underwriting commitment. The hope of broadening the investor base to include US holders also depends on Zeneca being able to attract interest. Pharmaceutical stocks are out of favour at present, especially in the US. Zeneca itself is seen as weak. American sales of its best-selling drug, the heart drug Tenormin, have halved over the last 12 months following the expiry of its patents. And according to one banker, Zeneca has 'nothing promising in the R&amp;D pipeline for a couple of years. Are US investors prepared for a 2 to 3 year wait?'.</p>

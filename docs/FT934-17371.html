			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / People: Kleinwort Benson Michael Baliman has been appointed to a new position of head of group risk at KLEINWORT BENSON. The creation of a centralised risk management function across all business areas has become a trend among banks, particularly those active in the highly complex derivatives markets. However, Kleinwort is approaching the project 'more from a a management angle', according to Baliman. He will head a department of four people, and will be in charge of measuring and managing risk across all Kleinwort's business areas, which include fund management, market-making and corporate finance. 'Deciding how many apples equal one orange is not an easy business,' he says. David Felder will succeed Baliman as head of fixed interest investment.</p>

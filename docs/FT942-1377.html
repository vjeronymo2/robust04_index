			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Disastrous results if UN force were to be sent to Burundi Sir, Your perceptive leader 'Guilt trip to Rwanda' (June 22) accurately describes the pitfalls of sending French troops into Rwanda. It is clear that any intervention force in Rwanda must be seen as impartial by both the government force and the Rwandan Patriotic Front if a further escalation of hostilities and a worsening of the situation is to be prevented. Instead, France should be putting its political influence and resources firmly behind the UN by supplying logistical support to the African troops of the UN mandated force to Rwanda. We would, however, disagree with the point that 'the UN would do better to deploy a force in neighbouring Burundi where further killings might yet be prevented'. Burundi's fragile peace has been achieved by the positive steps taken by the acting president and these should be supported by both the British government and the international community. To send in troops against the wishes of the Burundian government, and at a time when delicate peace negotiations appear to be bringing both Hutu and Tutsi together around the negotiation table for the first time in years, could have disastrous results.

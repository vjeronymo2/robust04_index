In January the rate of unemployment was 16 percent, an  increase of 1.9 percent on December.    Also on Tuesday Deputy Labour Minister Jerzy Szreter told a  press conference that the rise in unemployment probably had a  seasonal character, and should be halted in March.    However, he feared that the anticipated number of unemployed  of 3.05 million at the end of 1994 might be "threatened" unless  more money was allocated for active forms of combatting  unemployment.    Unemployment rose in 48 provinces in January with the  highest  growth in Chelm (by 6.3 percent) and Cracow (5.3 percent)  provinces. The highest rate of unemployment was recorded in  Koszalin (29.3 percent) and Suwalki (28.9 percent) provinces,  the lowest in Cracow (7.6 percent) and Warsaw (7.9 percent)  provinces.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- Russia will continue to  adhere to its agreements with Bulgaria reached during the visit  of President Yeltsin to this country in 1992, says a verbal  message from President Yeltsin delivered to President Zhelev  today during his meeting with a Russian Government delegation,  journalists were told by the leader of the delegation Oleg  Lobov, secretary of the Security Council of the Russian  Federation. The delegation includes deputy ministers of  defence, economy, finance, etc., managers of the military  industrial complex and businessmen. Despite the difficulties in  restoring bilateral economic ties, in 1993 commercial exchange  between Russia and Bulgaria went up 20 percent, Mr. Yeltsin  observed with satisfaction, the Russian guest added. President  Zhelev was particularly interested in the prospects for setting  up direct transport links between Russia and Bulgaria across the  Black Sea and along Russian rivers, Mr. Lobov said. Cooperation  between the two countries will continue as before despite the  changed situation in the Black Sea basin which should remain a  zone of peace, Dr. Zhelev said in a verbal message to Russian  President Boris Yeltsin.    The interests of our two countries and armies dictate that  the two states preserve their own defence industries and develop  efficient kinds of armaments and combat equipment, Oleg Lobov  told journalists today. During the delegation's visit to the  Ministry of Defence today he assessed the prospects for  bilateral cooperation in the military industrial sphere as  optimistic. The meeting was attended by all directors of  Bulgarian defence enterprises and the talks were quite specific  and businesslike, a government spokesman told BTA.    A protocol signed today by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni  Matinchev and Oleg Lobov covers issues of military cooperation  and ways to upgrade transport links between Bulgaria and Russia.  The two sides also initialled a document on the setting up of  an intergovernmental Bulgarian-Russian Commission in the defence  industry. A representative of the Government Press Office  described the document as confidential. The Bulgarian side will  be headed by Evgeni Matinchev. Eight Bulgarian-Russian joint  ventures are already working in this field and five more are  preparing their documentation, Oleg Lobov told journalists. He  pointed to the importance of the eased tax and customs  regulations these ventures enjoy under Russian legislation and  the need to exchange experience in conversion.    According to Mr. Lobov, at the delegation's meeting with  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov today, the prime minister expressed  full support for the work carried out so far and showed  particular interest in the setting up of a system for  transporting cargo by ferryboat along the Varna (on the Black  Sea) to Novorossiysk (Russia) line. Additional work should be  done on issues related to partial repayment of Russia's debt to  Bulgaria with military equipment deliveries, Mr. Lobov added.  Joint expert groups will work on this in the next two weeks.  During the meeting we expressed the wish to promote joint  construction of oil industry projects in Russia and to increase  the number of the 12,000 Bulgarian builders in the Russian  Federation who are doing an excellent job there, Mr. Lobov added.</p>

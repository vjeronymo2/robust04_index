			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Bidders asked to talks on coal sale Advisers to the government on coal privatisation will hold detailed talks with bidders for mining assets this week with the aim of helping ministers to select the preferred tenders next month. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, contacted the bidders immediately after the deadline for tenders last Wednesday to arrange appointments for 'clarification' discussions. The speed with which the talks have been arranged reflects the tight timetable to which Rothschild is working. Bidders believe the bank wants to make recommendations to ministers on preferred bidders in early October. Ministers want to complete the sales by the end of the year. Sixteen bidders have now confirmed their interest. Another two companies, Rackwood and Kier Mining, are qualified to bid but have not said that they have done so. The confirmed bidders are: Aberthaw Mining, a team of former BP Coal managers, for the South Wales region. Caledonian Mining, a privately-owned company, for South Wales. Celtic Energy, a buy-out team, for South Wales. Coal Investments, a quoted company, and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, for the central England regions. CP Holdings, a private company, for at least one, unspecified region. English Coal, a management buy-out team, for the three English regions. Mining (Scotland), a consortium, for Scotland. Northern Coal, a management buy-out team, for central north. NSM, a quoted company, for South Wales. RJB Mining, a quoted company, for all five regions. Ryan Group, a private company, for South Wales. Northumberland Coal, a joint venture between Ryan and British Alcan Aluminium, for north-east England. ScotCoal, set up by Ryan and Miller Group, for Scotland. Taylor Woodrow, the construction company, for at least one unspecified region. Tebo (Tower Employee Buyout Team) for the Tower pit in South Wales. Wimpey/Powell Duffryn for South Wales.</p>

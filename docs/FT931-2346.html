			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: No age discrimination in US Sir, I was interested in your story 'Jobseekers 'past it at 45' ' (March 15). Your readers aged over 45 might be interested in the age breakdown of the unemployed in the US, where those aged 45 to 64 experience only two-thirds the national average unemployment rate. Possibly a similar distribution would now exist in the UK, had there been a law against discrimination for the last 25 years, as in the US.

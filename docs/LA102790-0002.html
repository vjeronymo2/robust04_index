			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO LONGER SO COUNTED OUT;  </P> <P> CENSUS BUREAU AGREES TO NEW PROCEDURE FOR ADDING UP ASIANS  </P> <P> For the first time since 1860 when the Census Bureau began counting Asians in  the United States, the federal government is finally making a long-overdue  effort to get a more accurate measure of America's fastest-growing ethnic  group.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau recently disclosed it will break out Asians as a distinct  category in data recently collected to adjust for undercounts of minorities in  the 1990 Census.  </P> <P> This change is particularly important to western states, especially California,  where Asian and Pacific Islanders account for about 9.5% of the state's  population.  </P> <P> Federal officials routinely conduct what is called a "post-enumeration survey"  after the formal census is completed. The purpose of the survey is to identify  undercounts in states and big cities. Asian-American activists had voiced  strong objections to the Census Bureau's original decision in June to confine  undercount efforts to three categories: blacks, non-black Hispanics and all  others. The bureau initially argued that Asians and Pacific Islanders compose  such a small percentage of the total U.S. population -- about 3% -- that an  undercount would not be detected.  </P> <P> But that was wrong. Census officials changed their tune after they found that  the recently completed survey of 150,000 households nationwide yielded a larger  sample of Asian and Pacific Island households than expected.  </P> <P> The survey will help identify undercounts of these groups in California,  Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii, as well as New York City. These counts  are crucial in ensuring that Asians get their fair share -- particularly in  federal funding and in representation in Congress.  </P> <P> The 1980 Census significantly undercounted minorities: almost 10% of the Latino  community; 9% of African-Americans and 7% of Asians. The new efforts should  narrow such discrepancies. Now it's up to the secretary of commerce to go ahead  and incorporate the undercount data in the final 1990 Census report. He should.  </P></p>

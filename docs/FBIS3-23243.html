			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All Algerian names as received] </F>   [Text] Algiers, March 7 (AFP)--A Muslim fundamentalist  group, the Armed Islamic Jihad Front (FIDA), on Monday said its  members killed the director of the fine arts college, Ahmed  Asselah, and his son, Rabah.    The FIDA claimed responsibility for Saturday's killings in a  statement faxed to AFP.    Asselah, 55, was shot several times in the face by two or  three men early Saturday shortly after he left his car and was  walking to his office in the school building, a university  spokesman said.    His son Rabah, a student at the university, was shot in the  abdomen and died later.    The assailants fled.    Asselah was prominent in the so-called "democratic" movement  which opposes Islamic fundamentalism. He was the brother of  Algerian independence hero Hocine Asselah, for whom one of  Algiers' main avenues is named.    "The Armed Islamic Jihad Front F.I.D.A claims the attack  perpetrated against Ahmed Asselah and his son," the statement in  Arabic and French said, before quoting a Koranic verse to the  effect that "offenders will know what fate awaits them."    The group first emerged when it claimed responsibility in an  anonymous telephone call to AFP for the February 21 murder of  French librarian Vincent Grau in an attack here.    Muslim extremists started a war against the authorities and  began targetting intellectuals after the January 1992  cancellation of the second round of a general election the  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was set to win.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Vodafone acquires GMC stake Correction (published 10th February 1994) appended to this article. Vodafone, the largest cellular phone operator in the UK, has paid Pounds 29.2m for a one third stake in General Mobile Communications, the UK's leading independent mobile telephone service provider, from Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French diversified services group. GMC's main operation is Talkland, which controls about 50 branded retail outlets in the UK for mobile telephones. The Talkland stake will give Vodafone direct or indirect access to nearly half of its 1m customers. Talkland has about 210,000 subscribers, with more than half connected to Vodafone's network. Vodac and VHL, Vodafone's wholly owned service-providing subsidiaries, together have more than 330,000 Vodafone subscribers. In addition to the sale price, Vodafone has agreed to lend GMC Pounds 29m for investment in Talkland. Talkland will continue to operate separately, and Vodafone said it had no plans to acquire a further stake in GMC. Mr Terry Barwick, Vodafone's director of corporate affairs, said: 'This is not a move to take over aggressively the independent service providers: it was a good opportunity in its own right.' However, the acquisition marks a further contraction of independent service providers, a key feature in the cellular mobile industry as regulated in the 1980s. Mercury One-2-One, the third cellular network operator which launched last year, sought from the outset to minimise the role of independent service providers. The acquisition leaves about 10 large service providers without direct links with either Vodafone or Cellnet, the second largest network operator owned by BT and Securicor. In 1992 CGE incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.6m. It expects a profit for 1993, before exceptional items. According to Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone chief executive, 'service provision is one of the cornerstones of the UK mobile industry, and Talkland is one of the key players.' CORRECTION The Pounds 2.6m pre-tax loss for 1992 attributed to Compagnie Generale des Eaux in yesterday's FT was in fact that incurred by its General Mobile Communications subsidiary, in which Vodafone has taken a one third stake.</p>

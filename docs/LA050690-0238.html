			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WINSOME WINNIE: THE ACTRESS BEHIND THE GIRL BEHIND THE BOY  </P> <P> "It's weird. People come up and say, "Hi Winnie!" They know me, but I don't  know them."  </P> <P> The truth is, most people only know 15-year-old Danica McKellar as Winnie  Cooper, Kevin Arnold's puppy love affair on "The Wonder Years." The show has  completely swept bittersweet TV audiences into the post-pubescent liaisons of  the two star-crossed lovers. The first kiss. The Valentine's card. The make-out  room.  </P> <P> What makes Danica nervous that is some people don't want to know who Winnie  really is. They want to believe Kevin and Winnie's relationship is as authentic  and tangible as their own fragile memories of first love. "So many people are  tied up in the relationship," Danica said. "It's kind of freaky."  </P> <P> Fred Savage agrees. "Sometimes when I'm walking down the street, people will  yell out, "Hey Kevin, where's Winnie?," he said. "It just makes me laugh."  </P> <P> "Right now we're together, so everything is OK," Danica said. "But it can't  last too long, or we wouldn't have a story, right?"  </P> <P> The young actress said that at the very least, people want to believe that she  and Fred are an item off screen. "Everybody asks that. Everybody wants to know  if Fred and I are going out. And they want it to be true. They want it to be  real."  </P> <P> Danica exhaled a deep breath, like a teacher repeating information for the  students who weren't listening. "We're good friends. That's all." On the set,  Danica and Fred interact like any of the other young actors-in fact, just like  the regular kids that they are. "A lot of times I may be having a conversation  with Fred on the set, and similar lines will appear in the script two weeks  later because the writers were listening," Danica explained.  </P> <P> "The Wonder Years" is Danica's first acting job on a regular series, following  three years of acting school and bit TV parts. "It's not like having a job at  the mall on Sunday," she said. When Danica was 12, she answered a cattle call  for the role of Winnie. The field was ultimately narrowed down to her and  another girl-her younger sister.  </P> <P> "I tried out for the part with my sister, Crystal," Danica said. "We both got a  call back the next day. It was down to just the two of us. They kept us there  until late that night trying to decide. Finally, they told me that I got the  job, but they liked Crystal so much that they wrote a part for her also."  </P> <P> As it turned out, 13-year-old Crystal plays Becky, Kevin's girlfriend before  Winnie. Although Kevin received his first kiss from Winnie in the pilot, Winnie  found an older boyfriend, so Kevin took up with Becky for a short-lived fling  earlier this season.  </P> <P> Both sisters live with their parents in West Los Angeles. Danica doesn't see  future scripts of "The Wonder Years" until the episode is being shot. So she  wasn't able to provide any insight into what's in store for Kevin and Winnie's  relationship. But she expects to be around for the duration of the series, even  if it's in a limited role.  </P> <P> "I think The Wonder Years' will run the five years of its contract," she said,  "and not get picked up after that. We all want to go on to other things. I want  to act in films. We'll all be grown up at that point, anyway. I'll be 18 years  old. There won't be as much left to wonder about then."

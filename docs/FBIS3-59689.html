			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.  (PNC) announced that on 1 October it will resume the production  of plutonium fuel for the Monju FBR. Fuel production had been  suspended since June because of trouble at the fuel production  facility. To bake and harden the fuel pellets, the PNC will use  a spare electric furnace that was recently set up in place of  the production-line-style electric furnace that broke down. The  plan is for the fuel production to end by next February, and for  the Monju to reach criticality (a state in which the nuclear  fission reaction occurs continuously) by next spring. Fuel  loading is to begin around the middle of this month. For the  initial loading 198 fuel bodies are needed, but now there are  only 160.</p>

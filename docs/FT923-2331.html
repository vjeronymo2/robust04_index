			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / HK bows to China over finance for new airport POLITICAL reality intruded into Hong Kong's plans to build a new airport yesterday, when the colonial government walked away from its previous proposals to fund the project and accepted China's solution. To placate China, the government will commit HKDollars 40bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in new equity to the project - taking the total public sector contribution to the HKDollars 163.7bn project from Dollars HK80.4bn to HKDollars 120.4bn  -and in the process virtually eradicating the need for debt. Mr Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, has sanctioned this offer - presented to Beijing on Wednesday - without any guarantee that the Chinese will accept it. As his officials were quick to point out yesterday, it is a Chinese offer the government had agreed to. But there are enough changes to the Chinese idea - not the least being a doubling of the amount of new equity - for them to cavil. 'It's just a matter of facing reality,' said one official. 'And we have the money.' The government's acceptance of the Chinese plan - which allows for the use of funds from land sales to be ploughed into the project - underlined a growing concern within the administration about the need to get China's agreement. A big contract expires in November and costs would rise if it needs to be re-tendered. For the past six months, colonial officials have been saying that the proposals they presented to China in the spring were the most cost-effective and efficient way to build an airport and connecting railway to serve Hong Kong well into the 21st century. These initial proposals called on the government to provide two public corporations with only a modest amount of up-front equity - HKDollars 16.6bn  -to support a maximum of HKDollars 73bn of debt. Yesterday the government said it would increase its equity contribution to the airport by Dollars HK25bn and the railway corporation by Dollars HK15bn. This will allow the debt the corporations would have to incur to fall to a maximum of HKDollars 22.9bn. The reduction in debt goes a long way to answering the concerns of China which - domestic Hong Kong politics aside - has always been alarmed by the level of borrowings the project was expected to carry. Acceptance of the Chinese offer left some in Hong Kong's financial community feeling slightly queasy. As a banker noted: 'It just doesn't make sense. Borrowing costs are low and the financial package as constructed was bankable.' Local politicians also expressed concern about Mr Patten's augmented proposal to the Chinese. Mr Stephen Poon, a conservative, said he had doubts about the equity injection for the airport, given that the old plan was considered 'cost-effective'. Mr Lee Wing Tak, the Democrat's spokesman, pointed to the possibility that the increased land sales - 62 hectares in all - needed to raise the equity for the project would have a downward effect on land prices and hence, total government revenue. But as Mr Lee said, Mr Patten's reply represents a 'political compromise rather than economic considerations'. Now all Mr Patten has to do is wait and see if China will accept this victory or ask for more.</p>

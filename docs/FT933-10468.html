			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Management: Race to the top - Initiatives to boost the number of black managers in South African companies After 350 years of racial segregation, corporate South Africa is facing the stark fact that 5m whites cannot manage a nation of 40m people - especially once the other 35m have the political power to insist on a piece of the action. So South African corporations, most of which have been agnostic on the question of black advancement, are rapidly embracing affirmative action. Last month the South African Chamber of Business, the employers' federation, called on its members to put affirmative action programmes in place urgently, clearly fearful that a new government might otherwise impose racial quotas. Like their counterparts in other countries, South African managers are struggling to balance the demands of shareholders with the needs of society. Most nations face the problem of how to remove inequalities in the corporate world, but few face it in such stark and daunting form as South Africa. Discrimination has affected the vast majority of employees - not a small minority, as in the US - and government policy has deliberately nurtured a vast skills gap between the managers and the managed. 'Any company that wants to survive is looking at affirmative action,' says Wendy Luhabe, whose company, Bridging the Gap, tries to place candidates in companies seeking to advance blacks. No black-led government can be expected to accept the status quo: that less than 3 per cent of managers are black. And although the African National Congress says it wishes to avoid legislated racial quotas, expectations are high. The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the black business federation, has demanded that blacks hold 30 per cent of seats on the boards of all listed companies by 2000. It also wants blacks to hold 40 per cent of equity and 60 per cent of posts at all management levels. No major South African corporation comes anywhere near these targets - except National Sorghum Breweries, set up recently when the government privatised its monopoly, Sorghum Brewing Company, under black ownership and management. The small number of blacks in business reflects not only prejudice but also a severe shortage of qualified black candidates after years of sub-standard education under apartheid. Still, some companies such as South African Breweries (SAB) have a long track record of affirmative action and provide an example for those just starting out. In the group's beer division 46 per cent of salaried employees are black, up from 13 per cent in 1978; and 16 per cent of senior managers are black. Executive chairman Meyer Kahn, whose forceful personality and blunt charm have done much to promote the affirmative action programme, has set what he calls headcount targets. By 1995 each of the group's operating companies must have at least one black executive director (there are none at present); by 1997 20 per cent of senior managers must be black; and by 2000 all salaried staff must 'reflect the demography of South Africa', which means 80 per cent must be non-white. Kahn sets out the lessons from the past decade's efforts. 'Job segmentation is the answer to affirmative action,' he says. 'When the world was going for job enlargement, we restructured jobs into smaller modules that were more do-able.' That means, for example, splitting the traditional job of finance director into two functions: accounting and treasury management. Black candidates exist to fill the accounting position but lack the experience to perform both jobs at once. Reducing the workload of the job can also help. A relatively inexperienced sales manager has a better chance of success if given seven rather than 15 representatives to manage. An internal SAB document sets out some dos and don'ts of affirmative action. Among them: do not window dress, and make clear to new recruits that 'your black skin is no passport'; 'don't go overboard to accommodate black power blocs - stand up for what is right, businesswise'; encourage mentoring, preferably by the immediate boss; impress on whites the reality of the current political situation and weed out obstructors; root out covert and overt racism; and try to make blacks feel they belong. The document offers some recruitment hints. Choose 'trouble-shooters and arguers' rather than passive and pliable people who 'know their place'; look out for cultural bias in selection techniques; choose those who can identify with free enterprise - many blacks suspect big business of having colluded with apartheid and black communities sometimes equate success with co-option. But as Joe Horner, consultant to SAB on affirmative action, argues, no real progress will be made unless managers understand that advancing black colleagues is an essential part of their job. 'You must make clear to managers that they will be judged by how well they ensure blacks succeed, that it's as important as cost cutting and profits. You must audit this policy as rigorously as you do financial audits. And you must make clear to line managers that they . . . must devote a large amount of high-quality personal time to coaching.' Public-sector bodies such as the electricity utility Eskom also have lessons to offer. Dawn Mokhobo, head of the Eskom's department of social harmonisation, says the utility has established a sort of shadow management board composed of black senior general managers who will not attend regular weekly board meetings but will join special extended board sessions each month. 'It's a way of getting people into the system,' she says, adding that this method creates a pool of candidates from which future black board members can be drawn. To expand the pool of qualified black managers in general, Eskom is spearheading an initiative with big private-sector companies to provide fast-track training for 80-100 people from 8-10 large corporations, at a cost of R3m (Pounds 500,000) per corporation. As Harry Oppenheimer, the patriarch of South African business, says: 'It's extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material stake in the country . . . we've got to see that people in the majority have as large a share in the material assets of the country as we can.'</p>

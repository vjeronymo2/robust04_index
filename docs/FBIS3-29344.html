			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A national waterfront dispute is escalating  with ports around Australia already at a standstill.  Australia's major stevedoring company has begun dismissing  workers in a move to break the strike action which began in  Sydney a week ago when compulsory redundancy notices were issued  to 55 employees. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of  exports are being held up on the nation's docks.    Leader of the opposition coalition National Party, Tim  Fischer, said the federal government must intervene to bring an  end to the strike. He said the strike is an attempt by unions  to block the progress of waterfront industry reforms.    The Australian Meat Exporters Council said at least two meat  processing companies will also start standing down workers from  today as a result of the ongoing waterfront strike.    The council said one plant in Victoria will lay off its  entire work force of 550, while in Tasmania, a processor with  150 employees will also be forced to halt production. [passage  omitted]    The federal government is keeping its distance from the  escalating waterfront dispute, saying it would prefer the  parties to settle the matter through the Industrial Relations  Commission. But, the spokesperson for industrial relations  minister, Laurie Brereton, said the minister is very concerned  about the implications of the dispute for Australia's trade  reputation.    The spokesperson said that is all the more reason the matter  should be settled through the commission although the Australian  Chamber of Shipping has faxed a letter to the minister  requesting his intervention.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Guerrillas sink Sri Lanka navy ship The newly-elected Sri Lankan government's efforts to make peace with separatist insurgents in the north of the island yesterday suffered a severe setback when guerrillas sank a naval patrol boat, Mervyn de Silva and Stefan Wagstyl write. At least 30 sailors were reported dead or missing in the attack, 80 miles north of Colombo. The raid came in the wake of attempts by Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the prime minister who took office a month ago, to start talks with the Tamil Tigers, fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic Tamils. To show goodwill, she lifted an economic embargo and hinted at a possible ceasefire. Hopes of an early settlement were raised when Mr Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tigers' leader, gave a rare interview on the BBC's Tamil language service, and voiced his support for peace. But he set tough conditions for talks, demanding the Sri Lankan army abandon a heavily-fortified camp at Pooneryn at the base of the Jaffna peninsula, the Tamil stronghold.</p>

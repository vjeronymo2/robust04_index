			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes above 21,000 for first time since June MOUNTING hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate continued to support share prices, and the Nikkei average closed above 21,000 for the first time since June 3, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average ended 113.91 higher at 21,026.60, its sixth consecutive gain, after a volatile session dominated by profit-taking by institutional investors and buying by arbitrageurs and dealers. Share prices firmed during the morning ahead of the government's emergency economic cabinet meeting. However, comments by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, ruling out the need to cut the discount rate, depressed sentiment later and the index fell to a day's low of 20,831.08 in the early afternoon on profit-taking. It subsequently rose to a high for the day of 21,029.70 on buying of telecommunications-related stocks. Volume expanded to 350m shares from 203m. Rises outscored falls by 547 to 408, with 203 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 15.46 up at a 1993 peak of 1,693.09. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.66 to 1,295.91. Some traders expect profit-taking to cap a further rise in the Nikkei index, while others suggest that a further advance could prompt buying by investors who currently hold short positions. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said: 'If the index keeps edging up like this, it could trigger short-covering.' Banks were bought on hopes of a rate cut, Bank of Tokyo climbing Y70 to Y1,810 and Sakura Bank Y50 to Y1,660. Housing shares were higher on hopes of tax benefits for house buyers. Sekisui House rose Y30 to Y1,470 and Misawa Homes Y30 to Y1,370. Real estate issues were also firm, Mitsui Fudosan adding Y10 at Y1,340. Telecommunications-related issues fuelled a late rally in the Nikkei as Fujitsu appreciated Y9 to Y848 and NEC put on Y10 at Y1,020. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y5,000 to Y960,000. Victor, the audio manufacturer, lost Y30 to Y1,020 on reports that it might post a pre-tax loss in excess of Y20bn for the current year to next March. Namco, down Y20 at Y3,500, was sold on reports that it would bail out Nikkatsu (up Y13 at Y35), the insolvent movie maker which will be delisted on October 2. In Osaka, the OSE average closed 107.72 firmer at 22,881.47 in volume of 37.9m shares. Roundup ACTIVITY IN the region was mixed, with Kuala Lumpur, India and Pakistan closed for holidays. HONG KONG regained some of last week's losses, the Hang Seng index rising 126.75, or 1.7 per cent, to 7,549.73. Turnover came to HKDollars 3.8bn. Activity was a little subdued ahead of interim results from HSBC Holdings, which came out after the close. In London the bank's half-year profits were adjudged to be much in line with expectations. Hutchison moved ahead 70 cents to HKDollars 23.40 on suggestions that it might sell its British Telecom interests. SINGAPORE broke through the 2,000 level on late buying of Sembawang Shipyard. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.56 higher at 2,008.66, rebounding from an intraday low of 1,977.35. Sembawang added 40 cents at SDollars 12.60. SEOUL fell back as investors reacted with disappointment to government measures aimed to boost equity investment. The composite index shed 7.24 to 664.88 in 16.7m share volume. TAIWAN retreated further on a late wave of selling, the weighted index closing off 31.41 at 3,892.04. Turnover remained thin, at TDollars 11.4bn against Monday's TDollars 9.5bn. The textile and paper sectors saw sharp declines, with Shihlin Paper losing TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 76 and Hualon, the textile manufacturer, falling 40 cents to TDollars 18.10. JAKARTA set another 1993 peak, the JKSE index closing 7.63 higher at 417.30. Banks were stronger, but Astra International, a star performer last Thursday, was corrected down by Rp450 to Rp17,000 under continued selling pressure by foreign shareholders. AUSTRALIA added a further 6.2 to the All Ordinaries index, which ended at 1,962.2. But activity was generally described as dull, reflected in modest turnover of ADollars 268.6m. Among the blue chips, BHP and News Corp both eased 6 cents to ADollars 16.16 and ADollars 9.98 respectively. The banking sector was strong as National Australia advanced 18 cents to ADollars 11.56 and Commonwealth 16 cents to ADollars 9.60. NEW ZEALAND was slightly lower as Telecom receded after weakness in the US, shedding 4 cents to NZDollars 3.80. The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 1.31 to 1,982.79. Brierley Investments continued to buck the trend, rising a cent to NZDollars 1.26, with speculation that a large asset sale was planned.</p>

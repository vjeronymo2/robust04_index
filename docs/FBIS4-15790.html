			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly studio interview with Georgian State Council </F> chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by journalist Nato Oniani -- live]    [Text] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the past week was rather  busy. A quadripartite agreement on the return of refugees and  displaced people and a declaration on the measures to settle the  Abkhaz- Georgian conflict peacefully reached in Moscow have  become the subject of parliamentary discussions. You have  already voiced your stance on these documents but I still want  to ask you: Do you think the internationalization of the  conflict has produced any positive effect? And what effect  could have been expected had the documents been denounced in the  parliament?    [Shevardnadze] Only now can we speak about a real  internationalization of the settlement and general handling of  the conflict. Before this, everything was at the level of  resolutions, as it were. However, resolutions passed by the UN  Security Council, statements made in various states and the like  comprise a very significant stage leading to the present  situation. Favorable conditions have come about for  international forces to be involved in settlement of the  conflict. Russia's political role, mentioned repeatedly by the  Russian leadership and the president, has become more clearcut.  Our friends have embarked on more active work -- I mean the  United States, France, England, the FRG, and the CSCE, which is  also involved in the issue.    Negotiations will begin in Geneva tomorrow on the deployment  of international forces in Abkhazia. The first round of talks  about the return of refugees ended in Sochi yesterday. A special  commission has been established in connection with these issues.  A meeting will be held on the 19th. A very important meeting  will also be held in Geneva on the 19th which will be mainly  dedicated to a discussion of various aspects of Abkhazia's  political status. Thus, a long-expected process has started.  And it started relatively smoothly.    I would like to single out two issues again and again for  everyone's attention and especially for the attention of our  brothers, our friends, sisters and mothers -- I mean the  Abkhazian refugees. The principal aim and task we have assigned  ourselves during the process of negotiations is the return of  refugees to their homes. The return must be secure and  honorable, which will only be when they are met there by joint  international forces who will have been given adequate rights by  the United Nations.    I cannot avoid repeating that it is regrettable that some  politicians demonstrate not simply critical or even negative  attitudes, which are acceptable, but an unexplained  aggressiveness toward the changes for the better and I would say  even resentment and fury toward a tendency which has more or  less shaped as a reassuring one of late. They seem to be  putting up obstacles against their own country and their own  people. This cannot provoke a resentful reaction in me. I just  want to read out, to understand the reasons for such conduct.    I believe that a power struggle is behind all this. This is  also understandable. But in times of present difficulties  hardly ever experienced by a rich country, we all should think  of consent and unity and seek ways of overcoming this most  difficult test for the state and ways of easing the movement  toward peace and stability, unity and the restoration of  territorial integrity.    I believe that these outbursts in the parliament and  elsewhere are temporary. Everything depends on how the events  will develop at negotiations and various meetings and,  eventually, what decision will be taken by the Security Council.  If all this develops in a positive way, and decisions are taken  in conformity with our government's requirements, it will die  away of its own accord and we all will forget it.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, you have requested the parliament  to discuss two issues referring to the demands by the  opposition. One was an issue of the denunciation of the above  documents and the other was an issue of vote of confidence in  the authorities. The opposition has withdrawn the demand. Will  you raise the question of confidence again, say at tomorrow's  sitting or later? And how justified do you consider raising  this issue taking into consideration the current complicated  critical situation?    [Shevardnadze] The issue of denunciation was raised but, I  would say, they lacked the courage to defend their position  because they were not confident in their correctness and the  logic of their activities. This position appeared to be mostly  a pose, I could say a lie or they were probably securing their  position. In case what has been decided and planned does not  come true, they will say: Look, we have been warning you about  all that.    That is why I really wanted this issue to be raised and  voting on the issue to be put on the agenda. And the history  would retain the names of who was for and who was against. This  has not happened and I do not worry about it any more. At  least, the parliament did not share an opinion about the  denunciation of the agreement and practically consented to what  we had agreed on in Moscow. As for the vote of confidence, I  have stated that after the Cabinet of Ministers is established  we will have to return and consider this issue. Regrettably,  the Cabinet of Ministers has not been confirmed yet.    I have already expressed my stance about the parliament's  failure to endorse the minister of education. I have expressed  my opinion about Mr Tamaz Kvachantiradze and a certain sorrow.  The session will probably be resumed tomorrow and I do hope  that the issue of establishing the government will be settled in  a few days.    As regards to the next stage, of expressing confidence in  the  authorities and the head of state, definite regulations exist in  motions for a no-confidence vote. The opposition can take a  motion by getting over 50 votes. Fifty-one votes are required  to get the issue on the agenda. If the opposition fails to get  those or does not dare do this, I will find another way to have  the parliament and the people discuss the issue. The discussion  will lead to a decision. Because an end should be put to a  situation when the authorities or the name of the head of state  or a figure of any other rank are constantly sullied; there  should be an end to talks about something anti-national,  anti-state, unjustified, criminal, and various other things  which are commonplace in parliament. This must be finished one  way or another.    If the state is governed by criminal elements or by inept or  rather incapable people, and I know who is usually meant and  this does not require deciphering, we cannot simplify it or shut  our eyes to it or plug our ears or swallow it just like that.  That would demonstrate recklessness and incompetence. Neither  the head of state, not the parliament nor the people can adapt  to this. If it is close to the truth, a healing mechanism must  be found. Either remaining or quitting. But whichever it is  should be deserved.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, I would like to return to the  Abkhazian issue. Some politicians say that you went to the  United States to request the deployment of NATO troops in  Georgia. How do you view the assumption that a head of state  goes to the United States with a proposition like that? How  true is this?    [Shevardnadze] I would like to say one thing as regards to  the deployment of U.S. troops or NATO troops and so on.  Political debates are essential. Nothing can be done without  them if we want the truth to be achieved. However, generally,  we have to exclude illegal holds, as sportsmen say, or rather  lies and arbitrary handling of lies and rumors in politics. A  lot of lies are said and then the person who is to answer has no  time and opportunity first to study all these lies and then to  expose them.    For instance, here is a lie that Shevardnadze requested the  United States to deploy their armed forces and his request was  refused. In fact, this would be a failure. If you asked  something and it was the sole purpose of your visit and it was  turned down, that would be a failure. This was said just like  that, as if in the course of a conversation. I    telephoned the television center and asked them to broadcast  a reminder that I had not made a request like that while in the  United States. I requested support for taking a decision on the  deployment of peace-keeping forces and financing this action,  because this is one of the most difficult and serious problems.  [words indistinct]    A Western newspaper allegedly said that Shevardnadze'  request  was turned down. If it is true, if you really read something  like this, please do us a favor and name the source, the  newspaper, the article, and the author who offered a version  like this. This is an elementary rule. It is an elementary  rule to cite a person, an author, a work which you are quoting.  This just said that Shevardnadze was turned down and nothing  happened.    Luckily, I had the television on and I heard this.  Otherwise, there would have been no reaction and the idea would  have gained a hold that the head of state went on a visit  without having studied the issue well in advance and his request  was turned down. I am talking of only one example. This is a  false idea wrapped in rags, which has nothing to do with the  truth. Then they demand that you prove something that cannot be  proved. However, they speak so convincingly that inexperienced  people find it difficult not to believe.    We have to learn this culture of discussions, arguments, and  political debates. There should always be commitments during  discussions. Without commitments the opposition will not be  able to gain the stand and image to which it aspires. I really  want to have an opposition, an opposition which can seriously  argue with the majority or the authorities or whoever. But  using correct arguments. If we all learn this we will have a  real opposition.    As regards to troop deployment, we have two variants. One is  being discussed at the moment. This is the deployment of  international peace-keeping forces. It is not easy but outlines  of a decision can already been seen. Or the other hand, there  could be a completely Russian contingent. This will be easier  to implement. Easier, because both President Yeltsin and I have  given our consent to this in principle.    [Oniani] But not under the UN flag, only Russians ...    [Shevardnadze, interrupting] Certainly, only under the UN  flag. And they support this idea. However, at the present  stage, the issue of international troops is being discussed.  These forces will include a certain number of Russian troops.  They may comprise 20 percent or 30 percent maybe. I do not  think it matters much. A few countries have applied to the  United Nations expressing readiness to participate in the  peace-keeping mission. I do not know how sufficient this will  be. This must be elucidated.    [Oniani] We have to point out, Batono Eduard, that we speak  of peace-keeping forces rather than the deployment of NATO  troops in Georgia.    [Shevardnadze] Indeed. Perhaps some time later, when we sign  certain documents and start cooperation with NATO, this issue  will be topical. But I do hope we will need neither NATO troops  nor Russian troops. However, NATO forces could take a definite  part in our [word indistinct]    [Oniani] Soon a summit of the CIS countries will be held in  Moscow. What can our country expect from this meeting regarding  two problems most acute for us, I mean Abkhazia and our economy?    [Shevardnadze] I will not elaborate on this issue. In the  coming two days I will probably speak to our listeners and TV  viewers. At present, work is being done on documents sent by  various countries. We have our opinion. A definition of a frame  for economic cooperation will be the main issue under  discussion. A scale and conditions for this will also be  discussed. It is natural that issues of conflicts will be  considered, as well. As I have said, a serious work is being  done in all the ministries, agencies and the Cabinet of  Ministers and soon I will be able to share my opinion with the  listeners and TV viewers.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, recent operations by the Interior  Ministry, Defense Ministry, and Security Ministry have produced  certain changes for the better. These are the first effects and  maybe they cannot be well noticed by the population. We are  coming closer to the establishment of order such as exists in  our neighbour, Azerbaijan.    Last week, railway cars were blown up in Sadakhlo. On 9  April  a device was exploded on the premises of the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA  newspaper. Facts like these have accumulated.    [Shevardnadze] Everyone will obviously agree with me that  order has improved a little. This is probably a result of a  better implementation of a decree on this issue by the  law-enforcement bodies. [words indistinct]. Now, the  law-enforcement bodies have to turn their whole attention to  revealing the crimes. Criminal cases like the explosion in  Sadakhlo or the explosion in the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA building  must not be closed without investigation. I would like to voice  my great hopes that the law-enforcement bodies will work  efficiently on these cases.    In any case, the trend toward general improvement can be  seen  and all efforts should be directed toward establishing law and  order in the country. These are real prospects today rather than  those of the future. We have begun our work in this direction  and will lead it to a conclusion.    [Oniani] Finally, five years have passed since the tragic  day  of 9 April. The 16th anniversary of the events that took place  on 14 April 1978 will be marked this week. One is considered a  day of national unity and the other is considered a day of the  Georgian language. April seems to be eventful.    [Shevardnadze] I have a request in this connection. Any  anniversary related to a sorrowful event is used by one part of  the population only with one aim, I mean, not to allow the  country to calm down, to have instability continued and to press  the authorities to resign, as it was demanded on 9 April. Such  a mood cannot receive a positive assessment. I sometimes wonder  what these people want. Do they want good for the country and  its unity or destruction? [passage indistinct].    In this connection I would like to say that they will fail  because Georgia is not and will never be what it used to be.  The people will not follow dark forces and no one will take  them to the dark and the mire.</p>

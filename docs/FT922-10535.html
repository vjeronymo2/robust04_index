			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Low Pay Unit briefs European parliament members If Britain complied with the European Community's proposed working time directive it would add less than one per cent to the nation's wage bill, according to the Low Pay Unit, Ivor Owen writes. In a briefing issued to members of the European parliament, ahead of today's meeting of EC social affairs ministers, the pressure group strongly disputes the claim made by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the directive 'would hurt British industry and destroy jobs'. The unit says Britain has fewer public holidays than most EC member states - only Denmark and the Netherlands have less - and that most provide a statutory entitlement to four weeks holiday.</p>

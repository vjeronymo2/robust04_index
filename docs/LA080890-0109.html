			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACOUSTIC QUARTET MARKS A DECADE OF HARMONIZING;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE 10-YEAR-OLD QUARTET MUSIC PLAYS ITS FIRST LOCAL CONCERT OF THE YEAR  TONIGHT AT THE LONG BEACH MUSEUM OF ART.  </P> <P> Quartet Music has become one of those groups that comes together when it's  convenient, said percussionist Alex Cline, and it actually works because the  ensemble isn't the music of any one or two of its members.  </P> <P> "The group reflects those four people when they play music and it just takes on  its own life," Cline said. "The compositions they contribute are written  strictly with the group identity in mind so it dictates its own style. Because  of that, it will always have a life we can return to -- it isn't something  we've had difficulty rekindling if we've been away from it for awhile."  </P> <P> Quartet Music also includes Jeff Gauthier (violin), Eric von Essen and Nels  Cline (acoustic guitar) and makes its first local concert appearance this year  tonight at the Long Beach Museum of Art. It wasn't for lack of trying -- two  scheduled 10-year anniversary performances earlier this year were canceled due  to illness and injury.  </P> <P> The group formed when Von Essen and Nels Cline began looking to expand the  range of their duets in an acoustic framework. Gauthier was recruited from a  classical orchestra and Alex Cline, who was involved in a number of a  wide-ranging jazz explorations, rounded out the lineup. The acoustic nature of  the music forced adjustments on Cline's part.  </P> <P> "It necessitated creating a different set-up of (percussion) instruments that  would blend well with that instrumentation," said Cline, 34. "We laughingly  call it an acoustic group because everything has to be miked or you can't play  with a drum set. With the set-up I have, I can flail away at full intensity and  not completely overwhelm the band."  </P> <P> Quartet Music isn't Cline's only outlet. Since 1976, the lanky percussionist  has appeared on more than 30 albums -- mostly on small Los Angeles-based labels  -- and served as the accompanist/collaborator on many experimental dance  projects.  </P> <P> In addition to his ongoing involvement with Quartet Music, pianist Richard  Grossman's trio and saxophonist Vinny Golia's Quintet and Large Ensemble, Cline  recently formed his own group and released his debut album for ECM, "The Lamp  and the Star." Another side of his music will be displayed during the Los  Angeles Festival when Cline performs a solo percussion concert at 5 p.m. Sept.  8 in Griffith Park.  </P> <P> "I haven't played a solo concert in six years so I'm looking forward to it," he  said. "I used to have a repertoire of solo pieces but after I recorded some in  1981, I decided I was just going to improvise my solo concerts."  </P> <P> Cline will have no shortage of instruments around to negotiate those musical  points -- his standard alignment of drums and percussion takes a minimum of two  hours to assemble. His quest for a broader vocabulary has led him to  incorporate everyday implements like kitchen pots and wrenches as well as an  imposing array of chimes, gongs and cymbals.  </P> <P> "When I play solo, there's more focus on the Asian elements of what I'm doing  with the gongs and bells and singing bowls which fit into their Pacific Rim  thematic idea," Cline said. "I've always been drawn to rich sounds and the  Asians for centuries have had the market cornered on high-quality metal  percussion instruments. The singing bowls and hand bells from the Tibetan  region, in terms of harmonic range, sustain and sonic richness, are probably  the best ever made."  </P> <P> A Los Angeles native, Cline began playing in rock bands with his twin, Nels, in  the late '60s before gravitating toward jazz behind the influence of drummers  Tony Williams, Jack DeJohnette and Roy Haynes. The early '70s groups of Herbie  Hancock, Pharaoh Sanders and the Art Ensemble of Chicago introduced Cline to a  wider array of percussion sounds.  </P> <P> Now Cline faces the challenge of trying to secure work for his band, not the  easiest task when the group features an ethereal, evanescent sound that doesn't  strive for dramatic effect. Some listeners might relegate Cline's music to the  New Age zone but he rejects the label.  </P> <P> "There's enough of a discomfort factor in my music to scare New Age people off  because they're really looking for background music and that doesn't interest  me at all," he said. "I like to be moved by music -- I don't need it to be  sonic incense."  </P> <P> "Some people might think what I do as a solo percussionist is too (New Age-ish)  because they're not accustomed to hearing one or two bells ringing together as  enough to listen to in itself . . . but without becoming too Cage-ian, that may  be something the listener needs to re-evaluate."  </P></p>

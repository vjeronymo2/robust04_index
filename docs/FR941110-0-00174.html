			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked if there was any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between ``all new admissions'' in &sect;488.417(a) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``new admissions'' in &sect;488.417(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There is no difference. We are revising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations text to conform to the section's title.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some general comments we received on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in this section of the proposed rule were as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;They are unjustifiably severe;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Providers can not comply with them in all cases because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some deficiencies take more than 90 days to correct; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;They are unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At HCFA's request, the Institute of Medicine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (IoM), which is part of the National Academy of Sciences,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted a study of the policies and regulations governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the certification of nursing homes participating in Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Medicaid. Its report, issued in March 1986, cited the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urgent need for enacting statutory provisions extending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies available to HCFA and the States in enforcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with nursing home regulations. A General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting Office (GAO) study (``Medicare and Medicaid:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (July 1987)) also concluded that penalties short of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decertification of nursing homes are needed to deter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance. HCFA's operating experience also bears this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out. Traditionally, if facilities were unable to correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies within 90 days of the survey date, their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider agreements would have been terminated by the 90th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day. We, along with the IoM, GAO, and the Congress believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these regulations are necessary, are not unduly harsh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or severe, and that it is possible for providers to comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with them. Furthermore, the denial of payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions is not only authorized by the Act, but required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Act in certain circumstances, such as when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance remains after 3 months or when substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care has been cited in three consecutive standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.418&blank;Secretarial Authority to Deny All Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying Act, we noted that we did not include a section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule explicitly stating the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to deny all payment to a facility. Under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2)(B) of the Act, if a facility has not met a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, the Secretary may deny payment for all Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents. Under section 1819(h)(2)(E), the Secretary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to deny payment for all current Medicare residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or for all Medicare new admissions if a SNF, on three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consecutive standard surveys has been found to have provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

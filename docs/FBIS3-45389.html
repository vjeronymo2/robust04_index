			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 19 (AFP)--The Chinese Government  Wednesday warned regional authorities on the possibility of  social instability this year as a side-effect of China's  unprecedented economic reforms.    "This year will see the highest degree of reforms," said  Hong  Hu, vice-minister of the state commission for restructuring the  economy, adding that the greater the degree of reform, "the  stronger the social impact will be."    "Governments at all levels will act in accordance with the  overall arrangement of the central committee and the State  Council," he said at a news conference. "We will deepen the  reforms and maintain stability," he added.    Beijing decided in November to speed up liberalisation of  the  economy, particularly reform of state enterprises, banking, real  estate, and the taxation and price systems.    Hong said the reforms were necessary to establish a  socialist  market economy, but were risky as China was facing inflationary  pressure from the previous year.    But, he added, "we are confident of keeping inflation under  10 percent" in 1994.    In 1993, the economy grew at 13 percent, with the cost of  living climbing 14 percent, despite an austerity plan imposed  during the second half of the year.    Last year's overheated economy was aggravated by the  inability of the authorities to fully control provincial  development, and Beijing knows future economic liberalisation  has to be controlled to prevent chaos, Chinese and western  experts said.    One of the most dangerous reforms socially is the  transformation of state enterprises, making them responsible for  their own losses and profits. "It is the most difficult area",  said Hong.    One third of state firms suffered losses last year, with  another third encountering financial difficulties, according to  government sources.    These reforms have to be accompanied by a stricter  application of bankruptcy laws, and could cause millions of  lay-offs.    For the time being, the reforms will be applied in the 100  largest companies. "The most important (thing) is to improve  and reinforce macro-control," Hong said.</p>

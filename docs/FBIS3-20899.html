Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure    2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New  Political Efforts    Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term  Investment  and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis    New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing  Interlinking    New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial  Innovation Develop    Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial  Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary    Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle'  Level of Technology and a `Wide Range'    Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example:  Baden-Wuerttemberg    Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential  Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double  Structural Change    Box 3: Research and Technology Support Activities by the Old  Laender (according to the BDI [Federal Association of German  Industry] Handbook of Research and Innovation Support in 1992)    Stocktaking and Specific Restructuring of the Entire German  Industrial Research Landscape    Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and  Development  in the Old Laender  <H5>  Final Document </H5>   Within the framework of a research contract from the Federal  Ministry of Economics, the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems  Technology and Innovation Research, Karlsruhe, and the Institute  for Economic Research, Halle, Berlin Office, organized a hearing  on 8 and 9 April 1992 in Suhl/Thuringia on the survival problems  of industrial research establishments in the new laender. More  than 30 experts from the economic sector, research and politics  from the entire FRG took part.    The participants expressed themselves very openly, with  criticism and constructiveness, and as complicating conditions  for restructuring the eastern German research landscape they  mentioned:        -  the slim market for research and development work;    -  the great uncertainty about the economic development, which  could last another five to seven years;    -  the barriers to entering the market, which many eastern  German  enterprises must overcome against the established  competition.       The participants in the workshop agreed on the following  recommendations:    1. Industrial research must be retained in its core sectors,  or the process of reindustrialization will be even more delayed.  Industrial research establishments in the new laender need  conditions similar to those of the competing institutions in the  old laender, meaning        -  they need buildings, facilities and real estate;    -  they must be relieved of old encumbrances and old loans;    -  they have claims on equal treatment in the distribution of  research contracts.       2. The governments of the new laender must recognize the  major importance of applied research for the economic  development. They should guarantee proportionate basic or  fundamental financing for efficient R&amp;D, in which activity  they  could be guided by the corresponding practice in the old laender.    3. It must be guaranteed that eastern German applicants are  not discriminated against in evaluating project applications. At  present, western Germans dominate in associations and on expert  panels. The chances of experts from the new laender to have a  say should be improved.    4. R&amp;D enterprises need a secure financial base in  order to  fully utilize their scope for action. To this end the Trust  Agency should contribute by transferring or conveying property.  Rapid decisions are necessary, primarily for the so-called  research companies.    5. Support for scientific and technical cooperation with  Central and Eastern European countries could open up new demand  for the output of eastern German research institutes.    6. The Working Group of Industrial Research Associations  (AIF) should support activities to found new research  associations and their acceptance as members. The conditions  used so far, which are particularly favorable for project  contracts to R&amp;D establishments in the new laender  ("exemption  from self-supplied funding"), should be retained until 1995.    7. The Trust Agency should to a greater extent supply the  industrial R&amp;D establishments with guaranteed liquidity  credits.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: March proves the cruellest month for IPOs - US investors are more selective about which offerings they buy March has not been kind to the US market for initial public offerings of stock (IPOs). First, Northwest Airlines shook Wall Street by slashing the asking price on its planned Dollars 400m public share issue, blaming weak investor demand for new stock. Then, a week later, the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates, the second monetary tightening in two months. For the booming IPO market, both events spell trouble. Or do they? Northwest said it was lowering the price on its 20m-share IPO by almost a third because of the poor state of the market for stocks and new issues. A rise in interest rates is traditionally bad for companies trying to sell new stock, because higher rates tend to depress shares prices and make shares look less attractive, compared with other investments. However, the IPO market may be strong enough to withstand both developments. Take the Northwest deal. Although it was not the first issue of the year to encounter problems, the sight of a large IPO in trouble unnerved Wall Street. One investment banker said it should have worried the institutions which buy the bulk of IPOs. 'Northwest was a big deal with big visibility. When they cut the price, it sent a loud message. If I were on the buy side, I would have to look at that and say: 'Whoa, what's going on here?' ' Yet airline industry analysts were quick to argue that the company was forced to perform emergency surgery on its IPO because of problems unique to the domestic airline business, and investment bankers were as quick to point out that the airline's failure to attract sufficient demand for its shares at the original asking price was not necessarily a reflection of a broader malaise in the IPO market. They had a point. While volume has slipped from last year's record totals, the IPO market remains active. According to Securities Data, the US financial information group, Dollars 41.7bn worth of IPOs were completed in the US last year, at an average of 59 deals worth Dollars 3.47bn every month. So far this year, the average number of deals per month is down only slightly at 54, while the average dollar value of deals is running at a still solid Dollars 2.6bn a month. While IPO activity remains strong, conventional wisdom would suggest that the latest increase in interest rates will slow the market. Not necessarily, judging by how well the market held up after the first rate increase on February 4. That monetary tightening rattled bond and stock markets badly, and throughout February stock market conditions steadily deteriorated to a point where the climate for IPOs appeared to be less favourable than it had been for more than a year. After the Fed's rate increase, however, IPO volume actually rose, climbing from 33 deals worth Dollars 2.19bn in January, to 68 deals worth Dollars 2.93bn in February. IPO volume this month - 39 deals worth Dollars 2.72bn by March 22 - is running at a similar pace. Moreover, the most worrying aspect of the February rate increase was the negative reaction it received in financial markets. But this latest tightening sent bond prices higher, not lower, as investors applauded the Fed's anti-inflation resolve. Yet the skies above the IPO market are not entirely cloud-free. First, Wall Street is worried that if interest rates are on a long-term upward path, the flows of investor money into mutual funds will eventually reverse. Heavy demand for stock from mutual funds loaded with cash has been one of the main factors behind the long-running IPO boom, and without it, the IPO market would clearly struggle. Second, there have been signs recently that investors have become more selective about which IPOs they buy, and any further increase in interest rates would only make them more cautious. Mr David Komansky, head of debt and equity markets at Merrill Lynch, says: 'For the past four or five weeks . . . we've seen the IPO market become even more selective than before. There is still a very significant pipeline of deals, but I think this break in the market has caused a degree of uncertainty that will certainly make investors more quality conscious.' A banker from another big underwriting house concurs: 'There is no question that the syndication process has got a little more difficult.' He believes the IPO market's immediate future depends on how quickly the bond and stock markets get over the interest rate increases. 'Ultimately, the longer it takes to shake off the effects of the Fed's actions, the more skittish the buyer becomes and the more difficult it is to sell new product.' Ms Susan Hirsch, an analyst who tracks the performance of IPOs at Lehman Brothers, says there is no immediate cause for concern, but agrees that if long-term interest rates keep climbing, it could spell trouble. 'If you get the long bond over 7 per cent, you start skirting with real problems.' Ms Hersch explains that most valuation models used by the growth-oriented investment institutions - traditionally big buyers of IPOs - are based on an assumption that the yield on the long bond stays at or below 7 per cent. The long bond yield has risen from 6.2 per cent to more than 6.8 per cent since the Fed first raised rates, and if the yield climbs through 7 per cent, growth-oriented investors will start to look at different price-earnings models when judging whether to buy into IPOs. 'It would have an effect on the IPO calendar for sure,' she says. For now, however, the outlook remains reasonably bright. The fact that the bond market took Tuesday's rate increases in its stride, and that the bond yield dropped below 6.9 per cent, suggested the recent sell-off of government securities may have run its course, at least for now. Moreover, because uncertainty generated by a shaky bond market has made investors wary of committing fresh funds to equities lately, there has been a significant build-up of cash on the sidelines. So, while investors are likely to be more selective about which IPOs they buy, interest rates would have to rise much higher than current levels before investors would start putting their cash into investments other than equities, which still provide the best returns available at the moment. As Mr Komansky of Merrill Lynch says: 'My own feeling is that there is a supply of mega-deals out there, and if the markets can accommodate them, dollar volume will be significantly higher than people expect. But the number of deals will certainly be down because of selectivity.'  --------------------------------- VOLUME OF IPOs COMPLETED IN US  --------------------------------- 1993               Dollars m  --------------------------------- January              1,742.6 February             2,272.6 March                3,442.6 April                2,063.2 May                  3,148.0 June                 5,630.6 July                 2,469.8 August               3,886.6 September            2,920.9 October              4,003.8 November             4,134.2 December             5,855.0  --------------------------------- 1994  --------------------------------- January              2,019.6 February             2.932.2 March                *2,139.5  --------------------------------- *up to March 22 Source: Securities Data  ---------------------------------</p>

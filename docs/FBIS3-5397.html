Korea"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 8 (KCNA) -- If the North-South  dialogue is to progress successfully and the peace and peaceful  reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved, such  fascist laws as the "National Security Law" [NSL] must be  abolished without delay in South Korea, said a spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today.    Answering a question put by KCNA about the controversy  between the U.S. and South Korean authorities over the  abrogation of the "NSL", the spokesman said:    Recently, the United States expressed its official position  calling for the abolition of the "NSL" in South Korea.    Several days ago, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Hubbard, speaking at a university of the United States, held  that the "NSL" of South Korea must be scrapped. Afterwards,  Secretary of State Christopher stated that this demand was not a  person's view but an official position of the United States.    As well known the world, the "NSL" of South Korea is a  fascist law that defines the North as an "anti-state  organization" and prohibits free dialogue and exchange between  the North and the South and is an offspring of the military  dictatorship.    The successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea  have harshly suppressed South Korean people, fostered  North-South confrontation and obstructed national reunification  by invoking the anti-communist fascist laws such as the "NSL"  under the patronage of the United States.    Those in the "civilian" regime in South Korea have trampled  underfoot human rights and obstructed reunification and dialogue  so recklessly that even high-placed officials of the United  States called for the abrogation of the "NSL."    The Kim Yong-sam regime is branded as a "civilian fascist"  regime because it keeps the "NSL" intact. And it is also due to  the "NSL" that the multi-channel dialogues and exchange between  the North and the South were foiled without progress in the past  and many South Korean people were put into prison or killed for  their demand for national reunification or visit to the North.    Such being the case, the "NSL" can be termed the second  concrete wall, from the legal point of view, built with in South  Korea by the South Korean authorities as high as their concrete  wall running along the Military Demarcation Line.    The "NSL" should have been abolished when the agreement on  reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between  the North and the South was adopted and effectuated.    It is a good thing that the U.S. Administration called for  the abolition of the "NSL", the biggest obstacle to the  North-South relations, though belatedly. I think that the call  came from its understanding that the "NSL" is one of the factors  that impede the progress of the negotiation between the North  and the South of Korea.</p>

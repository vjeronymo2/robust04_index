			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Placing will value JBA at Pounds 60m JBA International, a specialist in software for International Business Machines' AS/400 mid-range computers, is coming to the market by way of a placing which values the company at about Pounds 60m. JBA was formed in 1981 by Mr Alan Vickery, currently chairman, and Mr Kevin Jones, technical director. Both had worked previously for IBM where they realised the potential for developing business software for the US computer manufacturer's mid-range System/34 and System/38. The System/38 was redeveloped as the AS/400, and this week IBM will announce a new family of AS/400 systems, which should reassure those worried about the US manufacturer's commitment to the AS/400 line. In 1993, turnover at JBA rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 74.5m, of which the US contributed Pounds 27m. Profits before tax rose 31 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. The management owns 50 per cent of the shares, a range of institutions have 30 per cent and employees also have a stake. IBM holds 5.75 per cent. The placing is expected to raise up to Pounds 10m net of expenses, which will be used to fund international development. The group has subsidiaries in 11 countries, including the UK, the US, Australia, South Africa and Mexico.</p>

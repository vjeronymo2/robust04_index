			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEADING INDICATORS FALL FOR 4TH MONTH, SIGNALING RECESSION  </P> <P> The government's chief barometer of future economic activity fell in October  for the fourth straight month, the Commerce Department reported Friday,  foretelling a recession that most economists believe has already started.  </P> <P> The 1.2% plunge in the index of leading economic indicators came as Federal  Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his assertion that the economy  is still not in a recession but he conceded that "it may get there."  </P> <P> Analysts generally agree that three consecutive dips in the index mean that a  recession is on the way, and the October drop followed declines of 0.8% and  1.2% in September and August. In addition, the index for July was revised to a  slight decline of 0.1% from the previously reported no change.  </P> <P> Although President Bush and top Administration officials continue to avoid  referring to the current slump as anything other than a "slowdown" or a  "downturn," most economists now believe that a recession started last summer.  </P> <P> "The leading indicators seem to be lagging a bit," said David Wyss, an analyst  with DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. "It's telling us  recession is coming, when we've been in one for three months now."  </P> <P> "The indicators failed to give us a signal ahead of time but rather at the same  time we were falling into recession," added Bruce Steinberg, an economist with  Merrill Lynch in New York. "This index doesn't tell us anything we don't know  these days."  </P> <P> One problem with the indicators as a forecasting tool is that virtually all of  the 11 components chosen by the Bureau of Economic Analysis are reported  individually as they are compiled and are extensively monitored by economic  forecasters.  </P> <P> For instance, economists did not need Friday's report to determine that the  average workweek declined in October while unemployment compensation claims  rose. Likewise, it was widely known that industrial commodity prices are  falling, building permits have plunged, consumer confidence has crumbled, the  stock market has fallen and the Federal Reserve has kept money fairly tight and  interest rates fairly high. Yet all these are key components of the leading  indicators.  </P> <P> Government analysts noted that 8 of the 11 indicators included in the index  were negative: consumer confidence, unemployment claims, the workweek, building  permits, money supply, stocks, "sensitive materials prices" and vendor  deliveries.  </P> <P> Allen R. Sinai, an economist with Boston Co., said he now views the leading  indicators as more of a ratification of current trends than a reliable guide to  economic performance a quarter or two down the road.  </P> <P> "Four down months in a row in the LEI is pretty definitive (of a recession),  along with everything else we know about the economy," Sinai said.  </P> <P> "This time around, the index is sinking at the same time that the economy is  sinking," Sinai said. "In the old days, this would signal recession through the  second quarter next year and perhaps into the third. But because of the changes  in the structure of the economy, this report won't take it out that far."  </P> <P> So far this year, the index has fallen in six of 10 months -- another strong  signal that a recession already has arrived. Even President Bush, speaking to  reporters Friday, cited the damage inflicted on the economy by the Persian Gulf  crisis. "Our economy," he said, ". . . is at best in a serious slowdown. And if  uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse."  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a similar point, speaking  of "a meaningful downturn," while avoiding use of the word recession.  </P> <P> Speaking to a business audience Thursday in Minneapolis, Greenspan elaborated  slightly. "The overall economy is declining," the Fed chief said. "It has not  yet reached a point where it is definable as a recession. It may get there."  </P></p>

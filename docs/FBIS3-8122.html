Klaus stressed that until this morning it was not clear  which  planes had been involved. "We know well that in this strange war  many strange things are done by individuals which are not  entirely synchronized and coordinated with the others," he said.    In Bosnia there were now various "subcommanders who have the  power to send out four planes somewhere," Klaus said.  "Therefore I think I am right in saying that not even the NATO  commander was clear -- he said so this morning -- as to where  the planes left from and why they were going somewhere," Klaus  said, adding that "something happened, and it is unnecessary to  speculate about what it will lead to."</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Malaysia detains sect leader The leader of a banned Moslem sect in Malaysia has been detained under the country's tough internal security laws to prevent him 'acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia'. Mr Ashaari Muhammad, head of the Al Arqam sect, was arrested at the border between Malaysia and Thailand at the weekend after being deported by Thai authorities. Mr Ashaari, with his wife, six-month-old daughter and four followers, is being held at an undisclosed destination under the terms of Malaysia's internal security act, which allows detention without trial for up to two years. Al Arqam was banned by the Malaysian authorities last month. The government said the sect was guilty of deviationist Islamic teachings and described it as the greatest danger to the country since the communist insurgency. Al Arqam says it is being victimised because of its growing influence in Malaysia, which is about 55 per cent Moslem.</p>

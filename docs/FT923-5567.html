			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Share gift question IF I transfer by gift at nil cost to my adult son, shares on which I would have a capital gain if sold at full value, what is the capital gains tax position first for me and second for my son were he to dispose of the shares in the future? You will be taxed as though you had sold the shares to him at their market value on the day of the gift (on the quarter-up basis). He will correspondingly be treated as having bought them from you at that price on that day. Ask your tax office for the free introductory pamphlet to capital gains tax, CGT14. This reply is based on the assumption that you are talking about shares in listed companies. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns.  All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

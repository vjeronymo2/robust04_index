			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Challenge Facing Mr. Mandela"] </F>   [Text] Now that Mr. Mandela is to be the president of the  country following his party's victory in the election, we wish  to convey our congratulations on this historic feat. The matter  does not end here, however, as the job comes with rather  difficult challenges.    The first challenge is that, though he is the leader of a  party that won a landslide victory, he must now be able to rise  above partisanship and be the leader of the entire nation. We  regard this as a challenge because, on many occasions in the  past, close party aides have given him bad advice that has led  him into error, when he on his own had rightly discerned the  truth of the matter.    The second challenge is to succeed in fostering  reconciliation and encouraging a spirit of peace in the entire  nation. He has identified this as a goal, and we with him  success. We do not say this lightly, but in earnest, because we  comprehend the difficulty of brokering peace between contending  sides.    The third challenge is to succeed in delivering on the  promises made to the electorate by his party. There are many  people who voted for the ANC because it promised them houses,  work, and other such things. A great many people think that as  soon as he is installed, they will have houses and jobs the very  next day, but no, that is not how it will be.    The greatest challenge, and we do not know how he will  achieve it, is that of bringing about peace and reconciliation  between himself, as Mandela the individual, and the Royal House  of KwaZulu and the Zulu nation as a whole. Perhaps there are  not too many breaches he himself can be held accountable for,  but there was most certainly much harm done by zealots in his  party, and their acts have not left Mandela untainted because --  as the saying goes in Zulu -- the master is responsible for what  his dog does.    We do, however, trust that if he is given the chance to be a  leader with authority he will succeed, because to our knowledge  he is a man with humanity and insight, who, if allowed to use  his own judgment, and the attributes given him by God Almighty,  will succeed in meeting all challenges.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: It is funny that Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres casts doubts about Syria's peace  intentions. He said in a statement that he doubts that Damascus  is prepared for real peace.    It is natural that Peres has no evidence of this, while the  whole world has proof that Israel not only rejects peace, but  seeks to sabotage it, divide its basic concepts, and besiege its  objectives. It does this so that peace, which the world thinks  should be comprehensive and just, is transformed into incomplete  deals and separate and paralyzed agreements that preserve the  occupation and strengthen hegemony, and entrenches aggression  against the Arabs -- aggression which has been continuing since  1948.    The Israel that continues to launch blatant aggressions  against south Lebanon in the atmosphere of peace for which the  international community has aspired, does not want peace. The  Israel that kidnaps a Lebanese citizen, while he was safe among  his family and children in a condemned act of piracy, does not  want peace. The Israel that looks at the comprehensive peace  process through narrow holes, and draws weak parties to the  cycle of its interests, and exploits them for its objectives,  does not want peace. It seeks to sabotage peace and to empty it  of its just humanitarian contents. Israel seeks to change peace  into mere deals between two parties: one that dictates, and one  that submissively signs under the pretext of international  circumstances and developments that cannot be confronted.    These are some of Israel's practices aimed at aborting the  peace process. These practices emphasize that Israel  understands peace far from its reality, and believes in it away  from the facts of the region and logic. Israel wants to isolate  parties, and then replace the comprehensive solution with  partial solutions that serve its concept of peace and its  interests while continuing the occupation and dictating other  conditions that serve its future aggressive objectives.  Regrettably, Israel has realized what it wants, due to Arab  division and the weakness of certain parties and individuals as  a result of shortsightedness, limited vision, and weakness of  their pan-Arab affiliation and understanding of the objectives  which the Arab people aspire to realize.    Nevertheless, while Syria is seeking to realize  comprehensive  and just peace it will never relinquish a grain of sand or a  single right whether Peres casts doubts or not. No progress in  the peace talks will be made unless Israel stops these practices  and responds to the requisites of comprehensive peace, foremost  of which is full withdrawal from the land to the borders of 4  June 1967 as one of the pillars of real peace--peace whose  requisites were understood by the whole world, not the peace  that Peres speaks about and wants. Peres is fully aware that  Syria wants peace, and this peace does not cope at all with  Israel's aggressive aspirations, but it restricts these  aspirations in a manner that corrects things and restores just  balances. This is how peace can be realized, and without this  there will be no peace.</p>

Talking to journalists, Kozyrev said: "We did not carry out  the democratic revolution to continue maintaining the same  policy and once again become a superpower jeopardising peace.  This is absolutely out of question," Kozyrev said.    He pointed out that objectively Russia was one of the  biggest  states in the world, but that it did not seek to return to a  bipolar world. It wanted to fulfill its interests in practice  through partnership, cooperation and good neighbourly relations.  This role undoubtedly required an active independent foreign  political line but not at the cost of confrontation, Kozyrev  said.    Responding to a question about mistrust of the Sarajevo  residents towards Russian soldiers who should reinforce the  UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] units stationed in  Bosnia Kozyrev described as absolutely unacceptable that the  Moslems be backed up by the Islamic world, the Serbs by the  Orthodox and the Croats by the Catholic churches. To set the  20th century world back to the time of religious crusades would  be a catastrophic scenario, said Kozyrev. "We will not allow  any such catastrophe to occur and will work for cooperation and  a unified approach by all super powers," he added.    He went on to say that the Bosnian leaders understood that  it  was necessary to advance towards a peaceful settlement of the  conflict and that they were in favour of Russia's active role in  the area, equal to that played by the other countries.    Commenting on his ministry's activities in the new Russian  Government, he said no changes had occurred there.    On demands concerning his resignation, he said: "I do not  dramatise them." He added that he frequently cooperated with  President Boris Yeltsin and that as a result his work seemed  easier to him.</p>

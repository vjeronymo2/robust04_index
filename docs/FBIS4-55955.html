			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Not Much Land Has Been Left Fallow. </F> The State of the Crops Is Good"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG  introduction]    [Text] Thanks to the favorable spring weather, the state of  the winter grains is extremely good. That was the most important  conclusion from the aerial inspection to which Laszlo  Medgyasszay, political state secretary at the Ministry of  Agriculture, invited the press.    When viewed from the air, it is striking that cultivation of  large plots is still predominantly typical of crop production.  Although there are small plots here and there, some of the new  smallholders are leasing their land to large-scale farms. And  one encounters also spontaneous associations. There is  substantially less land left fallow: 250,000 hectares, 5 percent  of the sowing area.    The experts accompanying the reporters pointed out that the  absence of artificial fertilizers in recent years is evident on  the fields. At the press conference following the aerial  inspection, the additional information was supplied that, in  spite of everything, the situation has improved this year in  comparison with recent years: the amount of artificial  fertilizer applied this year was double the amount used last  year, but several more years would be needed for agriculture to  attain the level needed for high quality crop production.    At the news conference after the inspection, the political  state secretary also said that the submitted applications for  loans from the Agricultural Development Fund would be judged  between 1 and 15 May. It seems that the fund's present  allocation would not be enough to satisfy the entire demand for  loans. Therefore the applications are being arranged in the  sequence they were received. The applications for which the  money in the fund has run out will not be rejected for good.  Instead, they will be set aside until the fund will have been  replenished. For the time being, the state secretary has been  unable to make a definite promise as to when that would happen.</p>

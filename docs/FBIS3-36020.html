At a meeting  with the president's regional representatives on Monday, he said  that the organizational and theoretical work to set up such a  party has already started.    A while ago, at a news conference in the Kremlin on the  results of elections to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin said  it was necessary to form a political force supporting the  president's course.    There will be no compulsory membership in the president's  party, however, there is a provision for: A structure at the  top that will work on issues of financing and of the electoral  campaign in terms of preparing for 1995-1996, when the  competition for the post of head of state will unfold.  Guidelines for the future party will be spelled out in the  presidential message that Yeltsin will deliver to the Federal  Assembly on 18 February, Filatov assumes. This will be a major  document set to develop the Russian Constitution, he said .    Representatives of the Russian president in regions also  intend to promote the formation of the presidential party.  Thus, an inter-regional constituent conference is scheduled for  7 February in Samara. On the same day a similar conference is  planned in Moscow.    According to Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Russian  presidential administration for work with territories, it is  people who are not involved in local administration who should  initiate the creation of this party, rather then the president's  representatives in regions. Structures of the presidential party  may have different names in regions, for example: People's  Party or Party of Support for the Reform. The heart of the  matter is that, according to its idea, the party must unite  democratic forces across Russia.</p>

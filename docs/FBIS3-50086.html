			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, January 22 (TANJUG)--The authorities of  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia have refused to issue  entry visas to world renowned Serbian writer Milorad Pavic and  the well-known academic choir "Branko Krsmanovic" of Belgrade,  who were to take part in a religious ceremony officiated by the  local Serbian Orthodox community. The Slovenian Foreign  Ministry has assessed, in agreement with the Ministry for  Culture, that the arrival of Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic"  choir in Ljubljana are "not in the interest of the Slovenian  state," TANJUG learned. The ministry did not specify in what  way the artists were a threat to the state of Slovenia.    Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic" choir were to take part in  an academy marking the day of St. Sava in Ljubljana, which is  organized by the Serbian Orthodox community. The action by the  Slovenian authorities has in fact indirectly prevented this  ceremony from taking place. St. Sava day has been celebrated by  Serbian Orthodox Christians on January 27 since the early  thirteenth century when Rastko Nemanjic, a Serbian medieval  ruler, monk and educator was proclaimed Saint Sava after his  death.    Peran Boskovic, a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in  Ljubljana, recently sent a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister  Janez Drnovsek, urging him to help enable the holding of  Orthodox religious ceremonies. There has been no reply yet.  This indirect assault on religious ceremonies of non-Slovenes  by the Slovenian authorities, which took place despite promises  by certain Catholic Church dignitaries that other religions  would not be discriminated against in Slovenia, might provoke an  embittered protest by tens of thousands of Serbs who live in  Slovenia.    Slovenia recently twice in two weeks banned entry into  Slovenia to well-known Serbian pop singer Mocilo Bajagic Bajaga,  although his concerts in Ljubljana and Maribor had been sold out.</p>

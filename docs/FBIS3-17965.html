			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Vasilevich: "Presidential Marathon Has </F> Begun"]    [Text] The Belarusian Party of Communists [PKB], which  until recently opposed the introduction of a presidency in the  Republic, will participate in the presidential elections. This  decision was adopted at the plenum of the Central Committee  convened to discuss the new political situation, which developed  after the Supreme Soviet passed a corresponding law. PKB  members nominated Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the PKB Central  Committee, as their candidate for president.    Assessing this fact, numerous experts and observers notice  that the left and left-centrist forces composing the People's  Movement of Belarus, have probably not agreed on a single  candidate for the job of Belarus' first president. At the same  time, the opposite wing presents only one candidate for this  post -- Stanislav Shushkevich. He was proposed by the Belarusian  Social Democratic Assembly. The Belarusian Union of  Entrepreneurs did not remain aloof and proposed its president,  Vladimir Karyagin, to participate in the presidential race.  However, in the immediate future, everything could change and  it is not ruled out that we will learn about other -- left,  right, centrist, independent, and, by all means, unexpected --  candidates.</p>

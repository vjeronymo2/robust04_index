			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Brussels set for Hanoi trade talks THE European Commission yesterday said it was ready to open negotiations on a trade and co-operation pact with Vietnam, boosting the Hanoi regime's campaign to end its commercial isolation. The announcement followed two days of talks in Brussels between the European Commission and a Vietnamese delegation led by Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister  -the first visit to Europe by a Vietnamese premier in 25 years. Europe's push for closer trade ties with Vietnam comes amid signs that the US is close to lifting US opposition to Vietnam's reinstatement in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The latest moves suggest a balancing act between the Clinton administration and the Commission on Vietnam. 'We are moving a little faster on trade because the Americans have the special problem with the MIAs (soldiers missing in action), but not so fast as to cause a cleavage,' said one EC official. Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner responsible for development policy, is expected to win a mandate for opening negotiations with Vietnam at the next week's regular meeting of the full Commission. The EC has trade and co-operation pacts with dozens of countries, including Vietnam's east Asian neighbours, which include requirements for the respect of human rights and democracy. EC officials say Hanoi's human rights record remains imperfect, but it has made progress in the principal test of reintegrating the Vietnamese boat people who fled in the 1980s. Some 39,000 have so far been satisfactorily accepted back into Vietnamese society, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The EC normalised its relations with Vietnam in November 1989 and relations have improved steadily since Hanoi signed the Cambodia peace accords in Paris almost two years later. During this week's talks, the Vietnamese delegation - which included the foreign, finance and development ministers - also expressed interest in joining Gatt, according to EC officials.</p>

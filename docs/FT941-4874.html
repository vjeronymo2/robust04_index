			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evode enhances Laporte's earnings Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, ended a three-year decline in earnings per share in 1993 helped by last February's acquisition of Evode, the adhesives and plastics manufacturer. At the time the City had been sceptical of Laporte's insistence that Evode would enhance earnings. But Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that all Evode's businesses had performed extremely well and that the acquisition had more than met the commitment made to shareholders. Evode, which cost Pounds 228m including debt, made an 11-month contribution with operating profits of Pounds 27.6m on sales of Pounds 250m. That helped group pre-tax profit advance 24 per cent to Pounds 107m (Pounds 86.6m). Group turnover jumped 47 per cent to Pounds 893m (Pounds 608m) including associates of Pounds 16m (Pounds 86m). Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to 41.4p (39.2p). The dividend is also increased by 6 per cent with a proposed final of 13.3p taking the total to 20.7p (19.5p). Mr Minton said that excluding acquisitions and favourable exchange rate movements pre-tax profits would have been 'just slightly ahead'. The level of provisions against Evode, which surprised analysts when first announced at the interim stage, has edged up Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.9m. Mr Minton said Evode's margins had more than doubled to 11 per cent and that there had been no benefit from written down stocks. Profits were struck after sharply higher depreciation of Pounds 27.2m (Pounds 17.8m) following several years of heavy capital investment. Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 74.1m to Pounds 48.8m and there was a cash inflow from operations of Pounds 21.8m, compared with an outflow of Pounds 81.2m in 1992. After peaking at Pounds 190m immediately after the Evode acquisition borrowings ended the year at Pounds 135m (Pounds 126m) for gearing of 44 per cent. Mr Minton said there would be further disposals this year with the proceeds 'redeployed in capital expenditure and add-on acquisitions'. The shares fell 20p to 794p. COMMENT The City seems to have regained its faith in Laporte after two years of doubt. Although earnings per share in 1993 were more than a tenth lower than the 46.7p recorded in 1989 supporters point to Laporte's achievements over the period, not least the exit from the Interox joint venture which left it a pure speciality chemicals company. The Evode deal shows once again it can make the acquisition numbers add up and the company can still blame market conditions for the lack of underlying growth. But that will have to change soon if its regained premium rating is to be sustained. Assuming profits of Pounds 120m this year, for earnings of about 45p, the multiple is now almost 18.</p>

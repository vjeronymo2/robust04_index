This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay jack pivots of the main landing gear, and replacement of the sidestay jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. This proposal is prompted by a report of fracturing of a jack pivot, which resulted in the inability of the main landing gear to deploy. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a wheels-up landing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by November 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;137&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The CAA advises that it has received a report of fracturing of a jack pivot, which resulted in the inability of the main landing gear (MLG) to deploy. The cracks are apparently caused by metal fatigue. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a wheels-up landing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB 32&hyph;233, dated June 24, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay jack pivots of the MLG, and replacement of the sidestay jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspections to detect cracking of the sidestay jack pivots of the MLG, and replacement of the sidestay jack pivot assemblies with new assemblies. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The referenced service bulletin recommends completion of the initial inspection within 28 days after the issuance date of the service bulletin. However, the manufacturer has notified the FAA that there is a delay in the availability of replacement parts for the sidestay jack pivot assemblies. The FAA has determined that a compliance time for the initial inspection within 28 days after the effective date of the final rule for this action will allow adequate time for the manufacturer to provide the replacement parts and for operators to comply with the requirements of this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 550 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA has been advised that the manufacturer plans to provide the required parts at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $181,500, or $330 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

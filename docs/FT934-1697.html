			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television Hugh Thompson and Phil Loftus, two London paparazzi, are the subject of today's Short Stories (8.00 C4). They are the ones who got the photograph of Joan Collins looking dowdy in a head scarf, a picture which earned them Pounds 8,000. But since they have to turn up just after first light to get a front row spot for an evening premiere, perhaps the job is not quite the doddle it may appear. There was something uniquely charming about the series A Victorian Kitchen Garden. BBC2's attempt to keep the bandwagon rolling with The Wartime Kitchen And Garden is nowhere near as successful. It has its moments, but feels contrived, and where the previous series was concerned with an age that is entirely lost, the present series is about a period which millions still remember (8.30 BBC2). All Or Nothing At All is a cut above the sort of drama we are coming to expect from ITV. Hugh Laurie, normally seen in partnership with Stephen Fry, is impressive as a compulsive gambler who longs to make all his friends happy by earning them a fortune (9.00 ITV).</p>

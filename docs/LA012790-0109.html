			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLETON REFERENCE IN OSMOND PIECE  </P> <P> I found the analogies used by Jim Washburn in his review of Marie Osmond's  performance to be tasteless and vulgar.  </P> <P> I have followed the story of Mary Vincent since the tragedy, and I am no less  appalled today by Lawrence Singleton's heinous crime than I was when it  happened.  </P> <P> I find it very difficult to believe that Mr. Washburn could not have found a  more appropriate way to convey his point. What is next? A reference to David  Rothenberg?  </P> <P> It's a shame that Mr. Washburn could not display some of the feeling and  sensitivity that he felt was lacking in Marie Osmond's performance.  </P> <P> DEBORAH NEWMAN  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

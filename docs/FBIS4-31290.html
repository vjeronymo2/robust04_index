			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Endre Hann] </F>   [Text] On 29 May the voters gave an absolute majority to  the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The past week was noisy  with the speculations and explanations of politicians and  political analysts. However, after a few days, what is  society's view on its own decision and what does it expect from  the winners? The Median Public Opinion and Market Research  Institute sought the answer to these question in a public  opinion survey carried out on 1 June, which showed expectations  in connection with the MSZP and an immense desire for a  coalition.    Three days after the second round, a sweeping majority (95  percent) of electors was aware that the MSZP had won the  elections. The majority of people were also familiar with the  size of the victory: Nearly one-third (30 percent) of the  electors precisely named the proportion of mandates at 54  percent, and one-fifth (22 percent) was almost exactly aware of  the proportion (51-53 percent). Only 12 percent estimated the  MSZP's result below the absolute majority, and 16 percent  presumed a bigger majority than the actual result.    The absolute majority of the public was surprised by the  final result of the elections. A significant majority of only  the MSZP's voters (who had voted for the MSZP list on 8 May)  claimed that they had expected such a large victory, but even  among them, every third person admitted that he was surprised by  the result. A similar division can also be seen in qualifying  the MSZP's victory: As opposed to three-quarters of the MSZP  voters, only one-quarter of the other parties' supporters  believed that the result was "good for the country."    A significant section of society has great expectations,  almost illusions, toward the MSZP government. Almost two-thirds  of citizens expect that the Socialists will sooner or later  increase pensions, and almost half expect wage increases, price  reductions, and relatively quick results in solving other social  and economic problems. Among the MSZP's voters, the proportion  of optimists reaches the absolute majority in the case of all  tasks.    At the same time, the majority of the public is thinking in  terms of a coalition, rather than a one-party MSZP government:  Three out of four people would like a multiparty government.  Some 82 percent of the latter named the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] as a desirable coalition partner, and 25  percent would also welcome the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] and 14 percent the Independent Smallholders Party in  the new government.    Regardless of their party affiliations, the majority of  people are in favor of coalition, a small difference only exists  in the proportions: "Only" 70 percent of the MSZP voters "wish  for a partner," while 91 percent of the SZDSZ voters believe  that their party should be in government.    While society is almost united in supporting the idea of a  coalition, it is much more divided about the most suitable  person to become prime minister. It might not be surprising  that, after the decline preceding the elections, [MSZP Chairman]  Gyula Horn again enjoys the support of a relative majority,  however, it is noteworthy that two "candidates" approach his  popularity. It is especially interesting that [former Prime  Minister] Miklos Nemeth still has significant support and he  even has a slight lead over [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate]  Gabor Kuncze. Apart from "nostalgia," this, of course, has  other reasons, too: According to 77 percent of the people  questioned, "it is important for the prime minister virtually to  be an economic expert," and only 23 percent saw this as a  negligible factor.</p>

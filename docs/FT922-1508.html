			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / The Faltering Economy: Signposts point to a bumpy road - Coaxing a revival out of the economy will take patience AS industry hauls itself along the 'bumpy road' to economic recovery signposted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, its leaders insist that they do not want to be rescued from recession by another short-lived boom. They can stop worrying: reports from boardrooms and factory floors around the country suggest that while the worst of the recession may be over, any upturn will have to be patiently coaxed out of the economy. The process of recovery promises to be a long haul. The prize may be the long-sought circle of low inflation, rising competitiveness and an increasing share of world markets. Failure will mean a slip in Britain's ability to pay its way in the European single market and in global markets. Many industries agree that, after a false dawn last autumn, the early months of this year saw renewed flickerings of improvement in demand. Most also suggest, however, that the momentum has stalled, with industry facing continuing spare capacity and uncertain patterns of demand. Where higher volume sales are achieved, they are invariably offset by lower selling prices. The result is that businessmen are again indulging in what one textile chief this week dubbed 'group therapy' - musing on corporate ambitions to be fulfilled when the economy finally permits. Manufacturers so far managing to report a brighter picture include some of those in pharmaceuticals and in plastics and paper. Any significant boost to car sales remains elusive, while commercial vehicle sales are still falling after nearly three years. Companies still deep in recession include engineering businesses as well as those in aerospace, shipbuilding and construction. All hopes for recovery now rest on a steady improvement in overall business activity during the rest of this year, with progress consolidated and built on through next year. 'The road ahead will be uneven and there will be setbacks along the way,' says Mr Sudhir Junankar, deputy director of economic affairs at the Confederation of British Industry. 'But by the end of next year we should see industrial activity levels back to where they were before the recession began to bite in 1990.' In spite of what promises to be painfully slow progress, industry is not beating on the government's door for help. Most calls for assistance centre on the need for an immediate start in reducing what remain historically high real interest rates. But Mr Lamont is in no hurry. Some manufacturers still want fiscal incentives to stimulate investment, but Mr Lamont has no intention of obliging. The managing director of an industrial machinery manufacturer based in the west Midlands says: 'The government is defying economic gravity by keeping interest rates so high. It makes full economic recovery a pipe dream.' Mr Simon Powell, finance director of the 600 Group, the machine-tool and mechanical handling company, says: 'Everyone was a bit too optimistic about the rate of recovery, but at least we see no prospect of collapsing again.' His company, like many others, sees no material change in business from a year ago. It has made big cost savings and in 'one hell of a shake-out' has cut a workforce of nearly 3,000 to 1,700 in two years. Mr Powell reflects: 'The real tragedy is that so many people have gone off to sell insurance, and they won't be coming back.' Although a further round of cuts in staffing in manufacturing looks unlikely, selective redundancies continue. Industrialists remain pessimistic about the outlook for jobs, claiming any improvement could be 18 months away. The manufacturing sector has so far lost about 750,000 jobs compared with 2m during the early 1980s. 600 Group is pursuing a programme of sharply focused investment. According to Mr Powell: 'We are not buying a machine if repairs will keep an existing plant going longer. We are spending in areas which can make us more flexible in our response to customer demand.' The picture is confirmed by companies such as Usher-Walker, the printing ink and roller manufacturer, which says that while ink sales to newspaper and packaging businesses are up on last year, customers are not yet replacing printing hardware. A return to higher levels of investment in fixed assets - down in the manufacturing sector by nearly 20 per cent since 1990 - can come only with better profit margins. A compensatory factor, however, is inward investment by overseas-based companies seeking a foothold in the EC. A strong feature of this recession has been the decline in long-term order books. 'We face far less predictable ordering patterns from customers, who cannot predict their own sales,' says Mr Edward Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Heath Springs, a Midlands automotive component manufacturer. Mr Roberts says there is a growing tendency among small and medium-sized companies to 'buy in' business at uneconomic prices in order to maintain output - 'a desperate measure and a recipe for disaster'. Industry also concedes, however, that the recession - as in the early 1980s  -has served to concentrate corporate minds on seeking new efficiencies. Productivity has improved more quickly in this recession than in the last, and is back to the levels of early 1990. Pay rises in manufacturing are running at half the level recorded a year ago. Price and cost inflation in the manufacturing sector are at their lowest levels for 40 years and some forecasts suggest they could be below 3 per cent by 1997. The prospect offers the opportunity to remain competitive throughout the remainder of the 1990s - a bonus already reflected in an export performance that has improved as home markets have deteriorated. The shedding of skilled labour, a reduction in investment and the threat of an eventual wage explosion may present serious handicaps as a revival gets under way. For the moment, though, industry confronts the continuing difficulties of underperformance rather than overheating. Mr Harry Evans launched Dolphin Packaging 21 years ago with a redundancy payment, and achieved a Stock Exchange quote for his Dorset company in 1987. He says although sales to supermarket suppliers are slowly but steadily improving, he is not about to put out any flags. 'Business will only really expand again when people who are now trying to get out of debt are again ready to take it on', he said. 'That could be a long time coming.'</p>

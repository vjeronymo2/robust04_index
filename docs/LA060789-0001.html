			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROLLING FIREARMS  </P> <P> Your editorial labeling gun-control opponents as "accomplices" of Purdy was  both irresponsible and an insult to the overwhelming majority of gun owners who  are law-abiding. Purdy was clearly deranged, but was hardly a "petty" criminal.  He could have been in jail that tragic day in Stockton for he had seven prior  felony arrests. Yet without exception they were plea-bargained down to  misdemeanors by lenient judges and prosecutors. The blood of five innocent  children rests on their hands.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J.

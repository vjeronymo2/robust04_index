			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOUBT OF JAIL TAX LEGALITY KEEPS IT STUCK IN CAPITOL  </P> <P> Revenge was on Sen. Marian Bergeson's mind as she walked out, shellshocked and  grim-faced, after a defeat in a committee hearing chaired by Assemblyman  Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose).  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Republican convened her own Senate Local Government Committee  two hours later and killed two of Cortese's bills by calling for a vote when  too few senators were in the room to support the measure. Then, in a rare  procedural twist, she persuaded her Senate colleagues to reconsider a Cortese  bill approved by her committee just that morning so she could switch her "aye"  vote to "no," personally scuttling that measure too.  </P> <P> The reason for Bergeson's pique: Cortese put Orange County's half-cent jail tax  bill on hold.  </P> <P> Touted by Orange County officials as their best hope to solve jail overcrowding  problems, Bergeson's bill would allow the county to ask voters in June, 1990,  to approve a half-cent-per-dollar sales tax increase aimed at financing  construction of new adult and juvenile detention facilities, as well as  additional courtrooms.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, the tax increase would produce an extra $121 million a  year, crucial seed money for the planned 6,000-bed Gypsum Canyon jail that is  projected to cost $700 million.  </P> <P> Sheriff Brad Gates said he figures the proposed sales tax hike would cost the  average Orange County family $50 to $75 a year. That, Gates contends, is a  small price to pay to keep an estimated 50,000 criminals a year from being  prematurely released to Orange County streets.  </P> <P> But those kinds of gut-level arguments have failed to impress lawmakers or  erase the political and legal questions surrounding the Orange County measure,  not the least of which is whether the proposal is legal under Proposition 13,  the landmark tax limitation measure passed by Californians in 1978.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge invalidated a similar jail construction sales tax  enacted by San Diego County voters because the county supervisors would control  the revenue.  </P> <P> The judge ruled if that county's supervisors hold the purse strings, such a  special tax requires approval of two-thirds of the voters. If a separate agency  not controlled by the supervisors was in charge, the tax could be enacted by a  simple majority, which is what the San Diego sales tax measure won at the  polls.  </P> <P> Despite amendments to the bill to cure any similar flaws in the Orange County  sales tax measure, that legal decision was cited as one of the reasons Cortese  on Wednesday asked his Assembly Local Government Committee to postpone a vote  on the measure for at least a month of study -- a delay that angered Bergeson  and prompted her retaliatory actions against his bills regarding growth  management.  </P> <P> Another problem for the Orange County sales tax measure is timing.  </P> <P> While it is certainly of paramount importance to Orange County residents, it is  only one of seven "urgent" sales tax proposals before the state lawmakers this  session.  </P> <P> Five of them would ask voters to increase local sales taxes to finance jail  construction in Orange, Riverside, Los Angeles, Ventura and Humboldt counties.  Bergeson, herself, is carrying the bill for Riverside County.  </P> <P> The two other bills would allow communities around the state to add sales taxes  to pay for everything from police services to local improvements such as  streets, sewers and schools.  </P> <P> Cortese contends that the spate of sales tax bills is a problem because each  measure is written differently. The resulting hodgepodge stands a good chance  of being rejected at the last minute by Gov. George Deukmejian, he said.  </P> <P> "I can imagine him saying, 'Hey guys, give me one bill that makes sense,' "  Cortese said.  </P> <P> The assemblyman said that to forestall that possibility, he wants his committee  staff to see if there is a way to streamline and combine all the measures into  one sales tax bill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legality In Question  </P> <P> Yet the legality question surrounding the Orange County sales tax measure, as  well as its legislative siblings, remains.  </P> <P> Proposition 13 says that before a local government, such as a county board of  supervisors, can impose a tax for a special purpose, such as building jails, it  first must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the affected voters.  </P> <P> In fact, Orange County officials could take that route without the aid of  Bergeson's bill. The Board of Supervisors could call a bond election to pay for  the new jail through an increase in property taxes, said Richard Keefe, the  county's manager for intergovernmental relations. But it is considered very  difficult to get a two-thirds majority at the polls, especially for a tax  increase.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying they won't" hold a bond election, Keefe said. "That's a  possible tool for our Board of Supervisors, (but) the reluctance to do that is  based upon the dismal record of any kind of (tax) proposal submitted to the  electorate by any agency.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to get the two-thirds approval," Keefe said.  </P> <P> Bergeson's bill would require only a simple majority approval for the sales  tax, a distinct advantage for Orange County officials who are gearing up to  campaign for the measure locally.  </P> <P> If approved, the money raised by the proposed half-cent-per-dollar sales tax  would not go to the county, but to a new government agency called the Orange  County Regional Justice Facilities Commission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independent of County  </P> <P> Bergeson and her supporters argue that the new agency would be independent of  the county because only two of its five board members will be county  supervisors, who, therefore, could not control decisions of the committee. (Two  other members would be elected officials from Orange County cities, and the  fifth would be a public member chosen by the other four.)  </P> <P> As such, they contend, the new body should be treated just like the Orange  County Transportation Commission, which by law only needs a majority vote to  impose a sales tax increase.  </P> <P> But critics of the plan say that distinction still won't be enough to stave off  a court challenge of the Orange County jail tax proposal.  </P> <P> The new agency's function is to build jails and courthouses, traditionally the  county's job. While it could theoretically make independent decisions on how to  spend the sales tax money, the agency was created primarily to help fund a new  county jail and courthouse. And Bergeson's bill still calls for county  supervisors to make a final decision on how and where a detention facility  would be built.  </P> <P> "I think they're going to have a difficult time going to court with a straight  face and saying, 'Yeah, this is a legitimate agency formed with another purpose  other than evading Proposition 13,' " said Thomas Homann, one of the attorneys  who successfully challenged the San Diego jail construction sales tax. "I don't  see them winning."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Mention of Commission  </P> <P> Critics also note that when it was introduced on March 9, there was no mention  of an independent commission. The bill originally allowed the Orange County  supervisors, through a special taxing district, to collect the money as well as  spend it.  </P> <P> But after a Riverside Superior Court Judge ruled March 24 that a similar  proposal in San Diego County was unconstitutional, Bergeson and attorneys for  the county scrambled to rewrite the measure.  </P> <P> The San Diego jail construction tax, approved last year by 50.8% of the voters,  funneled the money indirectly to the county through a new agency called the San  Diego Regional Justice Facility Financing Agency. But Judge Gordon R. Burkhart  ruled that the agency was so closely aligned with the San Diego County Board of  Supervisors that it was an "alter ego" of county government.  </P> <P> Burkhart also overturned the San Diego sales tax measure, saying it "purposely  circumvented" the two-thirds provision for a special tax under Proposition 13.  </P> <P> "The court finds that the tax here is placed in the . . . treasury and was not  to be spent for any general purpose the county wishes but rather must be spent  for the special purposes of constructing and operating justice facilities,"  Burkhart wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Amended  </P> <P> On May 12, Orange County supervisors voted to relinquish control of the  proposed Gypsum Canyon jail to a new government agency. On July 5, the Bergeson  bill was amended with language creating the independent Orange County Regional  Justice Facilities Commission.  </P> <P> Critics such as Homann contend that such efforts, coming after the judge's  ruling, could help bolster a charge that the county is trying to do an end-run  around Proposition 13 with its sales tax. Even one of the measure's supporters,  who asked not to be identified, admitted privately last week that the move by  the county was a "strategic error."  </P> <P> Yet Bergeson said she intends to continue pushing the sales tax proposal,  despite these questions, because it is the "best option" open to Orange County  officials, who have been under federal court pressure to relieve overcrowding  in jail facilities. She noted, too, that the San Diego case could still be  overturned on appeal.  </P> <P> "There has to be action taken," Bergeson said. "The county is almost at a point  of desperation in finding a mechanism . . . to comply with an issue that is a  health and safety matter. It's literally a crisis as a result of releasing  prisoners, arrestees, back onto the street.  </P> <P> "I think the fact that they (the county) are willing to go forward right now,  even with the San Diego case, highlights the need."  </P> <P> Gates, who has already organized an informational campaign to persuade voters  to pass the sales tax, said emphatically that Orange County's proposal is not  designed to circumvent Proposition 13.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sick and Tired'  </P> <P> "I get sick and tired of people who complain about these kind of things but  don't step forward with a recommendation or a solution to the problem," Gates  said of critics of the sales tax plan.  </P> <P> But in delaying action on the Orange County bill for further study, Cortese  said he is trying to make sure the sales tax solution doesn't create more  problems. He predicted that if the Legislature passes the Bergeson bill in its  present form, its chance of surviving a court challenge is "almost nil."  </P> <P> Cortese spoke gingerly when asked if the Orange County plan was an effort to  get around the limitations imposed by Proposition 13.  </P> <P> "They (Orange County officials) are not supposed to say that, and I'm not  supposed to say that, either. They would obviously be letting the cat out of  the bag. If they said it, it would go on record as their motive and it would  ruin their whole effort overnight.  </P> <P> "I can't say it either."  </P> <P> But maybe with minor modifications over the next month, the sales tax measure's  odds of withstanding a court challenge can be improved. "At least they will be  50-50," Cortese said.  </P></p>

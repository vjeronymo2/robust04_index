			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Hopes that Sinn Fein will announce a ceasefire in  Northern Ireland when it holds its annual conference in Dublin  at the end of this month collapsed today when the party made it  that clear its decision-making process would continue into March.    Sinn Fein said it would hold a public "Peace Commission" in  Belfast a week after the conference.    The party -- the IRA's political wing -- has been holding  the  sessions all over Ireland.    The announcement dashed rising speculation that the British  and Irish saw the republicans' annual gathering as the platform  for the announcement of their response to the Downing Street  Declaration signed by John Major and Albert Reynolds on December  15.    Neither London nor Dublin has put a time limit on a Sinn  Fein  response.    But both have shown increasing signs of impatience at the  long delay and had pinned hopes on Sinn Fein president Gerry  Adams delivering an answer at the conference.    Sinn Fein spokesman Richard McAuley said today: "The  consultation process will not be complete but it does not  devalue the Ard Fheis (annual conference).    "It provides republicans in Ireland with their first  opportunity to come together in a national forum to discuss the  peace process."    But Social Democratic and Labour Party deputy leader Seamus  Mallon predicted that the IRA would give up terrorism and that  the republican movement would enter the political process --  although not yet.    Mr Mallon, MP for Newry and Armagh, said he was more  convinced than ever that peace was on the way.    "I think they will have a cessation of violence. I think  they are on the road to peace," he said.    "I think they are having difficulties in doing that and I  did  not expect them to have anything but difficulties. I think it  will be longer than people think, more tortuous than people  believe, but it will happen, I am convinced of that."    Mr Mallon told the BBC Radio Ulster programme, Inside  Politics, that the cessation of violence would come from within  the republican movement.    There was a "burning desire" for peace within the whole  community and the section within the republican movement which  wanted to continue the violence would find it impossible to  sustain it in the face of that public desire.    But people should realise that it would be a slow process.</p>

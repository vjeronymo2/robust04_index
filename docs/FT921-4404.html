			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Statoil to reorganise top tier management STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, plans a reorganisation of top tier management and the establishment of two new units to develop and improve the group's structure. The reorganisation also represents a further clarification of roles and distribution of responsibilities between the corporation, represented by the executive board, and the management of the group's individual business areas. Most notable is the addition of two new executive vice-presidents, including the appointment of Mr Roger O'Neil, former director and vice-president of Mobil Europe London. 'President Harald Norvik, together with three executive vice presidents, will make up the executive board of the Statoil group,' the company said. Mr Peter Mellbye has been promoted to president of the natural gas division, succeeding Mr Terje Vareberg who rises to executive vice-president. Mr Tor Espedal will head the newly established labour relations unit, while Mr Ottar Rekdal has been appointed senior vice president of the technology division, also a new unit. 'I consider it natural to adapt the organisation in line with the Statoil group's development. 'Statoil is on the eve of a strong period of growth in Norway and internationally and, at the same time, sees its markets and the surrounding world undergoing rapid changes,' Mr Norvik said.</p>

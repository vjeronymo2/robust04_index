			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [16 June message of King Norodom Sihanouk to his compatriots </F> -- read by announcer]    [Text] Beijing 16 June 1994    Beloved compatriots: I have the honor to pay my great, most  affectionate respects to the two supreme patriarchs and all  venerable monks and to all my beloved compatriots. I would like  to inform you of the following news:    Following thorough and exhaustive examinations, my very  competent Chinese doctors were of the opinion that for me to be  completely cured, I must undergo three or four additional  sessions of anticancer chemotherary at the end of June, which  will require me to stay in the PRC for another three or four  months.    Although I have to live far away from you, venerable monks  and beloved compatriots, all my heart and my thoughts will  remain forever close to our revered motherland. Every morning,  I make my prayer and pay my deference to the august image of our  great guru, begging that full peace will return to all of  Cambodia so that my beloved compatriots can once again live in  happiness and enjoy prosperity as in the times of Sangkum Reas  Niyum before the 18 March 1970 coup d'etat.    I wish the two supreme patriarches, all Buddhist monks, and  all compatriots the five Buddhist blessings, that is, long life,  social prestige, happiness, good health, and enlightment.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

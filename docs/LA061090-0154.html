			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP VIEWS;  </P> <P> THE '70S REVISITED? YIKES!;  </P> <P> YES, AM HITS SUCH AS 'KUNG FU FIGHTING' AND 'SPIRIT IN THE SKY' ARE BEING  SALUTED IN A NEW 15-ALBUM SERIES. PERHAPS THOSE SONGS WEREN'T THAT BAD AFTER  ALL  </P> <P> When Rhino Records announced late last year that it would be releasing a  15-volume, 180-song series recollecting the disposable pop music of the early  1970s, naysayers couldn't be blamed for wondering if there was even the  slightest market for it.  </P> <P> When it comes to '70s nostalgia, folks just don't bother getting out their  usual rose-colored glasses. Americans as a culture hate the '70s -- especially  the clothes, the trivial artifacts and the pop music. We tend to remember mood  rings and wide collars and Grand Funk with only slightly more fondness and  pride than, say, block-long gasoline lines.  </P> <P> I found that out a couple of years ago when, presaging the current rage for  post-Vietnam/pre-Reagan kitsch, I threw a '70s theme party.  </P> <P> Guests were asked to come in proper period regalia: The wider the ties, the  bigger the bells, the better. The house was a veritable time warp, from the Hot  Chocolate music on the dance floor to the Tab in the refrigerator (nothing Lite  allowed). It was meant to be both a celebration and an exorcism.  </P> <P> A few dozen of the demonized did show up in their leisure suits and halter  tops, in search of closure and healing. Some friends, however, refused to come  to the party on grounds of moral principle, declining to dignify the despised  decade with their presence, as if they were Nora Dunn and the '70s were Andrew  Dice Clay.  </P> <P> Others politely declined in the expectation that it would be "too depressing."  Even some of the stalwarts who did come started moping around by themselves  halfway through, as if hypnotically re-experiencing a particularly bad prom.  </P> <P> A lot of people are having the same reaction to Rhino's "Super Hits of the '70s  -- Have a Nice Day," a real Rorschach of a cassette and compact disc series.  (Sorry, but it's not available in 8-track.) Like: Can't we let this stuff stay  buried?  </P> <P> A recent New York Times review took the standard critical view, with critic Jon  Pareles declaring, "To me, the early 1970s was when rock bottomed out" and  calling the Rhino compilation "a reminder of just how awful pop music was."  </P> <P> Obviously Gary Stewart, vice president of A&amp;R for Rhino Records, doesn't  agree. He sees the music in the 15-album series as in the same classic American  Top 40 pop tradition as that of the '50s and '60s. Stewart, who compiled the  series, thinks it's ludicrous to dismiss all the early-'70s hits just because  they didn't meet the test of "significance."  </P> <P> He has a point. There's a potential arrogance and a form of ageism in assigning  an entire generation's ear candy -- the hits by generally inconsequential  artists -- to the scrap heap, while celebrating equally lightweight hits from  one's own time.  </P> <P> The hits spotlighted in the Rhino series don't carry the artistic vision or  musical energy of the great early-'60s works from Motown, Phil Spector, the  Beatles or the Stones. The fact that everyone had bad haircuts doesn't help.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean they didn't still spotlight craft and provide lingering  pleasures. There is indeed an overwhelming banality to much of what Rhino has  revived, but in retrospect it's an endearing banality; even that which was most  insincere and calculated has a long-lost kind of benign innocence to its  calculation.  </P> <P> No doubt about it, the '70s are back, mostly for camp's sake. First  re-popularized amid England's acid-house scene, bell bottoms are now de rigueur  for anyone who's truly hip today in L.A. Smiley faces can be spotted up and  down Melrose. A Los Angeles dance club called 1970 specializes in period music  ranging from Donna Summer to T. Rex.  </P> <P> Bands cover '70s songs now the way they used to remake obscure '60s delicacies.  A short list from recent memory: Doctor &amp; the Medics and Fuzzbox both  recording "Spirit in the Sky" (see "Have a Nice Day Vol. 2"), Crowded House  doing "Signs" (see Vol. 6) at the Pantages, John Hiatt singing "Kung Fu  Fighting" (slated for a future volume) at McCabe's, Erasure resurrecting ABBA's  "Gimme a Man After Midnight" at the Palace, and the Replacements slaughtering  "Takin' Care of Business," "Rock and Roll All Night" and virtually every other  hard-rock song of the period on their mid-'80s tours.  </P> <P> In that spirit, Polydor Records is preparing an album of '70s hits updated by  current artists -- including Living Colour's Corey Glover tackling Rufus' "Tell  Me Something Good," Voice of the Beehive putting the sting on the Partridge  Family's "I Think I Love You" and Hothouse Flowers opening up Johnny Nash's "I  Can See Clearly Now." The inevitable title: "Guilty Pleasures."  </P> <P> Camp is also the catchword for Rhino's "Super Hits of the '70s" series, which  is not as inclusive as its name would indicate. Stewart decided to limit the  series to acts that had only one or two hits in the Top 20 -- parameters that  necessarily leave out album-oriented rock artists, along with acts that were  actually strong enough to have, say, three or four hits. Thus you get Daddy  Dewdrop but no Deep Purple; "Brandy" but not "Mandy."  </P> <P> "The idea was to collect all the odds and ends -- 90% of which is no longer  available," Stewart said. "In doing that, you sort of produce some music that's  even more of its time, as opposed to music made by artists who had career  longevity.  </P> <P> "Most of the artists that had one hit, their vision or their musical style or  their feel tapped right into that very moment and they probably weren't able to  hit on that again. That makes the music more time-specific and dated, in a  positive way."  </P> <P> Stewart sees the early '70s as "the last hurrah" for the Top 40.  </P> <P> "It was the last time people made records specifically for the singles market,"  Stewart said. " 'My Baby Loves Lovin',' 'Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),'  'United We Stand,' 'Gimme Dat Ding' -- all share the same lead singer, and all  were made by non-pros. They were writers and musicians who decided to get  together and make some single hits."  </P> <P> Stewart is going to cut off the series, which is being released in  chronological order, with Vol. 15 somewhere around 1975 -- "right up to when  the first Ramones record came out," he said. "That's when  </P> <P> Top 40 radio pretty much became totally invalid or unnecessary."  </P> <P> Was Top 40 ever valid or necessary in the pre-punk, pre-disco period Stewart  does cover? Even he admits the "Have a Nice Day" series is more for fun's sake  than to argue a case for serious historical and artistic consideration. It's  purposefully frothy -- and white.  </P> <P> "R&amp;B records are kind of excluded from this series, basically because that  music was genuinely good," Stewart explained. "Not that there aren't some good  singles scattered in this series. But I think soul and R&amp;B reached a sort  of apex during those years, and they're going to get their own series. (Rhino  also has '70s disco and glitter-rock collections set for release.) You can  actually take those records seriously."  </P> <P> And you can't take "Have a Nice Day" seriously as representative of its period  without its including any of what was uniquely great about the era -- Mott the  Hoople, early Bowie and Alice Cooper, Al Green, Steely Dan, Roxy Music, the  Philly soul sound, the Who, Marvin Gaye, et al.  </P> <P> But even some of the most shallow music of the era holds its rewards -- at  least in retrospect. There was every good reason in 1973 to truly hate the  DeFranco Family's "Heartbeat -- It's a Lovebeat," which awkwardly combined bad  melodrama and sickly sweetness in a theretofore unreckoned dosage.  </P> <P> Yet you know that that's indeed little Tony DeFranco putting his 13-year-old  heartbeat out on the line, a moment in time, without any sophisticated studio  trickery to puff up his transparently thin vocal range. The song went to No. 3  on the charts. It's doubtful you'll ever find such nakedness in a bubble-gum  record again -- at least not in an age when technology makes everything so  very, very professional.  </P> <P> Some of these sides, it should be noted, are actually enduring or innovative  quality work. Melanie used the Edwin Hawkins Singers on "Lay Down (Candles in  the Rain)" nearly two decades before Madonna used the Andrae Crouch choir on  "Like a Prayer," and to better effect.  </P> <P> Hotlegs' "Neanderthal Man," with a pre-10cc incarnation of Godley &amp; Creme,  probably has the most unusual production values -- tribal drums on top, vocals  mixed way down -- of any single ever to hit the Top 40.  </P> <P> Stories' "Brother Louie" went to No. 1 with a controversial interracial love  theme. The Buoys' "Timothy" introduced cannibalism to the charts 20 years  before warning labels.  </P> <P> Less trend-setting but equally outstanding pop songs were Smith's "Baby It's  You," Stealers Wheel's "Stuck in the Middle With You," Dobie Gray's "Drift  Away" and Loudon Wainwright III's "Dead Skunk."  </P> <P> You can even admire, if not necessarily like, the solid Tin Pan Alley  craftsmanship of "It Never Rains in Southern California" or the suicidal "Alone  Again (Naturally)," the earnest likes of which we'll rarely see on the  Billboard charts again.  </P> <P> Trade-offs have been made. Top 40 listeners and radio programmers have indeed  come a long way in tolerance for dissonance and odd harmonic progressions  ("Purple Rain" could never have been a hit in the '70s), but almost always only  if it has a dance beat. Weirdness and classicism both get homogenized by the  mutual insistence of modern pop's standardized drum sound; heartbeat -- it's a  machine beat.  </P> <P> The hit parade of the Me Decade offered as much junk as the Madonna Decade, but  it was an organic kind of junk, neither as wild-eyed as the quasi-hippie music  that preceded it nor quite as greedily gumptious as the factory-made teen  fodder it paved the way for. That may not mean that it might not be worthy of a  good exorcism anyway, but a lingering -- or perhaps first-time -- fondness for  the schlock monster is no cause for shame.  </P> <P> Having Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds and Dr. Hook as part of your heritage  is indeed a scourge, but it could be worse, thirty-something and  late-twentysome-thing comrades -- you could have been born later and have  "Hangin' Tough" for roots. In the words of the prophets: Hold your head up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A '70s Sampler of Hits  </P> <P> Here are selected titles from albums in the "Super Hits of the '70s" series:  </P> <P> Vol. 1  </P> <P> "More Today Than Yesterday" Spiral Staircase  </P> <P> "Venus" The Shocking Blue  </P> <P> "Mississippi Queen" Mountain  </P> <P> Vol. 2  </P> <P> "Spirit in the Sky" Norman Greenbaum  </P> <P> "Which Way You Goin' Billy?"

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields of SA holds fall to 4% GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA) held the decline in earnings in the year to June to 4 per cent in the face of weak commodity markets, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Pre-tax profit dropped to R342m (Dollars 123m) from R358m while attributable profit was down at R302m from R314m. Revenue fell to R505m from R518m in 1991 but the decline was attributable to a R20m decline in profit on the realisation of investments. The dividend was maintained at 200 cents per share.</p>

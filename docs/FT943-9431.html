			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Observer: Base attack at the crease The pressure is on Mike Atherton, England's beleaguered captain of cricket. Just when he might have hoped that the hullabaloo over his involvement in this summer's cause celebre - the case of the tampered ball - was over, US newshounds have picked up the scent. Sports Illustrated, the bible of the US sporting fraternity, has decided to add Atherton to its roll call of fallen sports stars around the world. Although the sports weekly does not normally show much interest in cricket, when it comes to ball-tampering US baseball players lead the world. However, Sports Illustrated's attempt to get to the bottom of the Atherton case has been hampered by a certain unfamiliarity with cricket. It was on target with its description of the English cricket team as 'woebegone', but erred in calling captain Atherton the team's 'best bowler'. Then again, judging by England's recent attack, the man from Sports Illustrated might not be far wrong.</p>

The briefing was  attended by Defence Minister Lajos Fur, Parliamentary State  Secretary for Defence Rudolf Joo and Army Commander  Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz.    They cited the new defence legislation as the main reason  for  the measure. The law, passed by almost unanimous parliament  support, rules that the defence minister is the superior of the  army commander, and that the armed forces are under permanent  civilian control both in peacetime and at war. The merger  incurs no extra costs for the Defence Ministry, and might even  bring some savings, Fur said in reply to a question.    The minister confirmed that senior officers who have  completed their 55th year will be retired. Lorincz will be one  of them this year. Two generals might be retired in the the  first half and four in the second half of the year. Lorincz  said he will turn 55 in February, and he is prepared to retire  as he fulfilled the army reorganization tasks assigned to him in  1989.</p>

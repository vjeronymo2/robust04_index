			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ten comments were received on eliminating the requirement that recipient agencies submit copies of the refund applications to the distributing agencies. All commenters were in favor of the proposal, stating that the elimination of this dual reporting requirement would reduce the paperwork burden. Since section 250.30(k)(3) of the current State processing regulations also requires processors to send copies of the refund applications and refund payments to the distributing agency as part of the monthly performance report, the requirement for recipient agencies to also send the refund applications to the distributing agencies was viewed as duplicative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ten comments were received regarding the use of the postmark date to track the timing for submission of the monthly performance reports. Nine commenters were in favor of the proposed change and one opposed. Those in favor stated that by placing this requirement in the regulations, any uncertainties about the required time frames for submission of the performance reports would be clarified. The one commenter opposed to this provision stated that upon receipt, each performance report is stamp-dated when received and that the envelope containing the postmark is discarded, because it is not practical to keep mailing envelopes on file. The Department wishes to clarify that the intent of this requirement was not for distributing agencies to maintain mailing envelopes. Rather, distributing agencies should record the postmark date that is on the mailing envelope and determine whether the performance report has been submitted within the required time frame. All comments received on the proposal that the date printed on a report transmitted by facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date were favorable; however, one commenter questioned whether it is necessary to include such a policy in regulations. The Department believes that it is important to state within the regulations that the date printed by the facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date, since this method of submitting performance reports is becoming more commonplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were generally opposed to the proposed requirement that processors would not have to submit performance reports for those months in which no sales were made and where processors had no inventory. Fifteen comments were received on this provision. Four commenters were in complete agreement, one commenter was in favor but with restrictions, and ten commenters opposed. Those in complete agreement with the proposal did not provide further explanation for their support. However, the one commenter in partial agreement with the proposal recommended that the requirement be eliminated when processors have no inventory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> no sales activity, but stipulated that upon arrival of any inventory or initiation of any approved sales from that period on, monthly performance reports be required. Those commenters who wished to require monthly performance reports for each month the processing contract is in effect provided the following reasons: (1) Distributing agencies often do not know if a processor has inventory or has made any sales during the month until the monthly report is received; (2) it would be difficult to know if a report was required, if a report was submitted but lost in the mail, if the processor forgot to submit the report, or if the processor purposely did not send the report; (3) distributing agencies may not know the status of a processor's inventory because incoming direct shipments of donated food may not arrive when anticipated or product can be backhauled without the distributing agency's knowledge; (4) monthly reports must be maintained to establish an audit trail; (5) auditable records should run consecutively without breaks in months; and (6) if the Department eliminates the annual reconciliation report, distributing agencies, FCS and auditors must have the monthly performance reports for each month the processing agreement is in effect in order to verify all activities that occurred during the agreement period. One commenter added that processors should always have sales activity each month because the current processing regulations discourage processors from entering into agreements if their activity will be limited. The Department finds the commenters' arguments persuasive that monthly performance reports be required for each month that the processing agreement is in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments received and the above reasons, this final rule adopts sections 250.17(f), 250.30(k)(1) and 250.30(m)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations without change, except that the proposal in section 250.30(m)(1) that processors would not be required to submit performance reports for those months in which no sales were made and where processors had no inventory is not included in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Contracting Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the performance report requirements under section 250.30(m) of the current State processing regulations, processors are required to submit to the distributing agency a list of all contracting agencies and their locations with which the processor has processing contracts. Because the Department believes that requiring this list every month is unnecessary and duplicative, the proposed rule would eliminate this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

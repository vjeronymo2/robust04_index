			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLESS ADMITS LIVING AT HOUSE THAT WAS  INVADED  </P> <P> Actress Sharon Gless, co-star of the "Cagney and Lacey" TV series, testified  Wednesday that she lied when she told reporters she did not live at the Studio  City house that an obsessed fan allegedly invaded with a .22-caliber rifle.  </P> <P> Testifying at a preliminary hearing for Joni Leigh Penn, Gless said she was  worried that disclosure of her address would lead to "copycat" incidents by  other fans.  </P> <P> Gless, through her publicist, had earlier told reporters that the house was  used primarily as an office and that she lived elsewhere.  </P> <P> The issue of whether Gless lived at the house is important because Penn cannot  be found guilty of residential burglary if the dwelling was not Gless' primary  residence, said Penn's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mitchell Bruckner.  </P> <P> Penn, 30, of Garden Grove was charged with two counts of residential burglary  after police said she barricaded herself in the Studio City house March 30.  Police persuaded Penn to give herself up after a seven-hour standoff.  </P></p>

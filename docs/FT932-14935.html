			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: Brussels alleges ship cartel THE European Commission has accused a group of shipping companies of operating an illegal cartel to push up prices for transatlantic cargo and is telling them to sever all ties, Commission officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels. They said the Commission had opened proceedings and was giving those involved in the cargo-shipping pact - the Transatlantic Agreement - three weeks to disband the cartel. The companies had broken EC rules on competition by teaming up on pricing for US-bound cargo shipments from European ports, they said. The agreement involves the Danish Maersk line, Atlantic Container Line of Sweden, Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and DSR-Senator Joint service, Dutch Nedlloyd Lijnen, P&amp;O Containers of Britain, Swiss Mediterranean Shipping and Polish Ocean Lines. Others are Korean Cho Yang Shipping, Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, Singapore's NOL, Japan's NYK, and Sea Land Services of the US. One official said the case was sensitive because EC action against Maersk could touch a raw nerve in the run-up to Denmark's referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18.</p>

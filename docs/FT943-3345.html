			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Coles Myer edges up 3% to ADollars 424m Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers, yesterday announced a rise of 3 per cent in full-year profits to July 31. The company made ADollars 424.2m (USDollars 315.7m) after tax, compared with ADollars 411.8m in the previous year. Total sales for the year were up by 5 per cent to ADollars 15.9bn, while fully-diluted earnings per share edged up to 30.7 cents from 30.1 cents. There is a 0.5 cent a share increase in the final dividend, to 9 cents, making a total of 20 cents for the year, up 2.6 per cent. Coles, which operates around 1,725 retail outlets and is in the process of buying out a 21.45 per cent stake in itself held by the US stores group Kmart, blamed the small rise on the Myer Grace Bros department store business, where operating profits (before interest and tax) fell by ADollars 29.5m to ADollars 94.8m. During the year, old stock and merchandise ranges were cleared and a restructuring got under way, with four smaller stores in rural New South Wales closing. The specialty stores group saw profits drop, from ADollars 55.8m to ADollars 20.2m, due to start-up costs at the new World 4 Kids and Officeworks chains. The supermarkets business pushed profits up to ADollars 200.1m from ADollars 172.7m, while the Kmart discount stores made ADollars 128.1m against ADollars 120.4m, and the Target stores ADollars 129.2m compared with ADollars 121.7m. Coles plans to open 130 new and replacement stores next year, and refurbish 274.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / London expected to lag in growth GREATDQ Kondon, hampered by sluggishness in financial and business services, is forecast to be the UK's slowest growing region during the 1990s according to the latest regional survey by the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre and Oxford Economic Forecasting. The survey says growth will be fastest in the less urbanised regions including the south, the east Midlands, Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, The north and north-west of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to lag behind the UK average. The report suggests that the economic boom in south-east England during the 1980s, which raised that region's share of national economic activity above its postwar norm, was unsustainable. By the end of next year it forecasts that employment in the south-east will have fallen from its 1990 peak of 8.8m by 835,300, a fall 1 1/2 times greater than the number of jobs gained from 1986 to 1990. Employment in financial and business services in the south-east fell by almost 5 per cent. 'Regional variations in the impact of the recession have turned the north-south divide on its head,' the report says.</p>

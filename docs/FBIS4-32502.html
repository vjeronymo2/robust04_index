			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jozef Hajko: "Voucher Privatization Will Become </F> Catalyst of Further Changes"]    [Text] The almost forgotten voucher privatization is  beginning to take on realistic dimensions after the report on  its planning was discussed by the government. The expectation is  that it will become an accelerating element of the entire  transformation and restructuring process in Slovakia.    Although the government discussed this report of the  Ministry  of Privatization, the precise amount of state properties  destined for voucher privatization is not yet known. The  Minister for the Management and Privatization of the Slovak  Republic [SR] National Property, Milan Janicina, set the target  too high, and, in the list of enterprises to be sold for  vouchers, he included assets in the face value of 170 billion  Slovak korunas [Sk]. At the same time, he himself expects that  the offer will include properties in the value of Sk80-100  billion. The definite number will become known only after a  register of shares is worked out with the founding ministries  and after an agreement is reached with the SR National Property  Fund [FNM], which administers stock in the value of Sk20  billion, which can also be offered to the citizens for their  vouchers.    The application of the voucher method, for which the  know-how  of Czecho-Slovak--and therefore also Slovak--economists is being  put to use, has its advantages as well as disadvantages.    Among the disadvantages of the voucher method can be  mentioned especially the subsequent unavoidable concentration of  economic power of key owners in individual companies and the  laborious process of acquiring the means for investments. If it  is the objective of the state to also contribute money for  privatization, then the voucher privatization brings another  disadvantage--it will not fill the FNM coffers.    In the current state of crisis in the Slovak economy, when  many state enterprises are on the brink of collapse,  privatization (even by means of bankruptcies) appears as the  only solution that will achieve long-term rectification. The  oppressive global economic climate in which independent Slovakia  found itself, and almost two years of marking time without any  concept about what to do (not only) in privatization, is  dragging into bankruptcy even many promising private enterprises.    Privatization is inevitable because, as has been true from  time immemorial, people value and improve only private property.  The voucher method today is seen as an inevitability. There are  three reasons for that.    First of all, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages:  voucher privatization is relatively quick, clear-cut, just, and  undemanding of domestic credit resources. It makes it possible  to avoid putting a financial burden on the new owner, who, when  a standard method is used, must pay for the purchase of the  privatized property. For a broad application of the standard  methods--direct sales, public competitions, and auctions--there  is simply not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, and,  unltimately, even time.    The second reason is the necessity of introducing a firm and  conceptual approach into the transformation process. The  Ministry of Privatization as well as the other ministries, when  approving plans for the second wave of voucher privatization,  will finally be faced with having to make a decision on how to  privatize the Slovak state enterprises. It does not mean that  all of their assets will be sold for vouchers. In each  individual case, as M. Janicina emphasizes, individual decisions  will be made, which will often call for the use of the standard  methods as well. The important thing is that, after two years of  unjustifiable foot-dragging, such decisions will finally be  made. That will at the same time solve the problem of strategic  interest of the state in individual branches of the economy,  when the highest executive power will have to define what is the  intended permanent share of the state in the assets of selected  enterprises. That will indirectly force the government to define  the economic orientation of Slovakia in future years.    The third, no less important, reason for using the voucher  method is to generate public confidence in the transformation  process. If the citizen has the possibility of sharing in the  privatization, he will get the justified feeling that the state  is treating him fairly. In addition, he will also gain  materially. And social peace is one of the few favorable entry  elements on which the macroeconomists and politicians in  Slovakia can count.  <H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>   Voucher privatization today appears to be inevitable. There  are three reasons:    1. For direct sales, public competions, and auctions there  is  not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, or time.    2. Transformation requires a resolute and conceptual  approach.    3. The voucher method will instill in the citizens  confidence  in the transformation process.</p>

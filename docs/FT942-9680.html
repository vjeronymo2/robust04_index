			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Power plan wins initial approval The government has given the go-ahead in principle to the National Grid Company's Pounds 200m plan to install 50 miles of 400kv powerlines through Cleveland and scenic North Yorkshire countryside. The proposal triggered 7,000 objections and opposition from seven local planning authorities. There was a six-month public inquiry in 1992. The plan will mean building more than 200 pylons, each about 140ft high.</p>

"In connection with this and other issues, I resort to the  widely spread practice in the West and am challenging the head  of state Eduard Shevardnadze to live television debates.    "As on the eve of the visit by the head of state to the  United States, when it became physically possible to adopt  hastily an unlawful resolution, then I consider that there will  also be time to hold television debates between us, provided  that the head of state, beside having arguments, has the wish to  participate in debates."</p>

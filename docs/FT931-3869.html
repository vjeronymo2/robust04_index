			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Cost of marketing PEPs inevitable - as is cost to clients Sir, Philip Coggan ('The high costs of 'good' advice', March 6) examines three PEPs recently launched by Fidelity, M&amp;G and Cazenove and concludes that M&amp;G 'is not being greedy' with its high charging structure - it's just that it has to pay commission to intermediaries. You may think it odd then that M&amp;G still attracted more money directly from the general public than Cazenove with much lower charges. The reason is that M&amp;G had a much larger marketing campaign to promote its PEP and the costs are of course borne by the client. There is no point in launching a new product unless people buy it: therefore, unless a company like Cazenove can promote its product more cheaply through favourable press comment or existing discretionary clients then it has to advertise, direct mail or pay commission to intermediaries. His argument that intermediaries should recommend Cazenove over M&amp;G on a pure charging structure is absolutely right. However, he fails to mention that if we did then by the time our fees had been removed the client would be in exactly the same situation. After all, we have to pay for our own marketing costs as do M&amp;G and Cazenove. Mr Coggan states that the FT would much rather see fee charging financial advisers and I can assure you that I would as well. However, the average member of the public is still not ready to pay fees in the same way that they do for accountants and solicitors.

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Some long faces at shortening of US debt mix - Success depends on short-term interest rates staying low ON WEDNESDAY, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, described his decision to cut federal interest costs by shortening the maturity on government securities as a 'carefully crafted, moderate move'. That 'moderate move' consisted of halving the issuance of 30-year government securities (through reducing the frequency of bond sales from one every three months to one every six months), eliminating the seven-year note altogether, and increasing the sale of securities with a maturity of three years or less to make up the difference. Although the bond market has taken the changes in its stride, the reaction from some parts of Wall Street has been anything but moderate. Mr Michael Basham, a former top Treasury official who now works for the securities firm Smith Barney Shearson, described them as 'monumental' and said the government could not guarantee the new policy would save money. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities, says the changes are poorly-timed, and Mr Louis Crandall, chief economist at RH Wrightson, called the idea of shortening the maturity on government debt now as a 'very bad one'. The Treasury is also likely to have incurred the wrath of the borrowing committee of the Public Securities Association, which earlier this year advised the government against making changes to the structure of the debt. The committee felt the current debt mix was 'broadly appropriate'. The Treasury has gone ahead with its reforms in spite of the committee's reservations because it was determined to find a way to cut the cost of financing the huge federal budget deficit. Over the years, various governments have considered saving money by shortening the maturity on debt. But the arrival of a new team at the Treasury after the Democrats' victory in last year's presidential election increased the likelihood that talk would turn into action. The government, however, did not commit itself to making any changes until February, when President Clinton announced in his first budget plans to save about Dollars 16bn over the next five years through alterations to the Treasury's debt mix. Once the president had promised these savings, it then became a question of how far the Treasury would go in changing the mix. In particular, would the 30-year long bond be phased out completely? In the end, a compromise was struck between the politicians, who wanted to aim for really big savings by eliminating the long bond altogether, and the more cautious Treasury staffers, who were worried what effect that might have on the bond market. Although the Treasury has decided to stick with the long bond, there are those on Wall Street who believe it is playing a dangerous game by altering the debt maturities. As Mr Brusca of Nikko says: 'They claim they're doing it to save money . . . yet it will take us 30 years to find out if the three-month interest rate then is the same as the the 30-year rate we can lock in now.' The Treasury is at least guaranteed some immediate savings. It pays out lower interest rates on shorter-dated securities than on longer-dated securities so, by selling more of the former and less of the latter, it will save some money over the next few years. Yet, over the longer term, expecting further savings assumes that short-term interest rates do not rise, or do not rise too far. This is an assumption that many economists believe is dangerous, and one that the government should not be making. Mr Jim Fralick of Morgan Stanley says: 'I'm worried about the interest rate risk and, if interest rates back up again, it will cost the government, and the taxpayer, money in the long run.' Wall Street also has reservations about the timing of the Treasury's move. Economists argue that, with long-term interest rates at their lowest levels in more than three decades, the government should be locking in these extremely low rates now by selling more, not less, long bonds. Moreover, critics worry that the size of the federal deficit means it is folly for the Treasury to be reducing the number of financing vehicles available to the government. In particular, if President Clinton does not get his way with Congress over his deficit-reduction measures, 'we could be looking at much bigger deficits and less ammunition in our holster to finance them', says Mr Brusca. Although the Treasury insists that it is changing the debt mix only to save the government money, it is clear that a secondary aim is to bring down long-term interest rates. By reducing the number of long bonds in circulation, the Treasury hopes long-term interest rates will fall, making it cheaper for US companies to raise long-term investment capital. But Wall Street is not sure that cutting long-bond issuance will do the trick alone. Economists warn that, without a credible deficit-reduction package, long-term rates may not come down very far, or fast. As Mr Brusca says: 'If you want interest rates to be lower, let's have a responsible fiscal policy.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 18 Apr (EFE) -- Uruguayan Interior  Minister Raul Iturria today stressed that there is no evidence  that this country is being used by international drug  traffickers for the ``laundering'' of money, thus denying a  recent UN report.    ``There is no evidence that supports that report. This  already has been denied by the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry and  our intelligence services,'' the minister emphasized.    ``There may be people who invest money that has come from  not  very ethical sources, but this does not allow for such a  vehement assertion that Uruguay is a market where money is  `laundered,''' Iturria stressed.    ``Ours is a country that was open to the entry of persons  and  capital long before drug trafficking with its current dimensions  existed,'' the interior minister said in remarks to the  Montevideo media.    Iturria indicated that during the past few months it has  been  the concern of Uruguayan authorities to equip the National  Directorate for Drug Fighting with modern technical equipment,  including materials and technicians from abroad.    The minister also indicated that the deputy secretary of the  presidency himself, Pablo Garcia Pintos, is the coordinator of  the National Antidrug Fight Board, which is charged with  drafting policies to confront the trafficking and consumption of  narcotics.    Bank secrecy is one of the fundamental values of Uruguay's  financial center, but last year the Uruguayan Central Bank  ordered that the industry's institutions must request and  identify complementary information on those persons who deposit  more than $10,000 in order to prevent eventual attempts at money  ``laundering.''    Three years ago the Uruguayan courts granted the extradition  to the United States of an Argentine citizen allegedly linked to  Colombian drug traffickers who had ordered him to invest in real  estate in Uruguay.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian wool market has continued to decline, with the market indicator down to 411 cents a kilogram on August 25, compared with 430 cents a week before. The low point in April was 381 cents. Business and buying interest remains low. There is no doubt that uncertainties on stockpile disposal policy raised by the Garnaut wool review committee have helped to check buying interest. Caution seems particularly evident in Japan, normally a leading buyer at Australian sales.</p>

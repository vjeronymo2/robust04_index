			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Marcos funeral planned THE FAMILY of Ferdinand Marcos, the late Philippine dictator, has informed the government of plans for the return of his body next Sunday from Hawaii where he had died in exile. Marcos lawyers told President Corazon Aquino's office that the family plans to fly the body by chartered aircraft directly to Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Mr Marcos's home province, where it will lie in state at his ancestral home in Batac town for a traditional nine-day wake. The burial has been set for April 21 in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. The move fulfils a condition set by the Aquino government that the family submit burial plans for approval before the homecoming. Last week Manila asked the US government to bar the loading of Mr Marcos's remains unless the coffin bears the Philippine consular seal in Hawaii.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ARKANSAS TOWN WAITING FOR EPA TO CLEAN UP 'PRIORITY' WASTE SITES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: SOME RESIDENTS BLAME THE POLLUTION FROM THE THREE TOWN DUMPS FOR  PHYSICAL AILMENTS. TEN YEARS AFTER AN EPA INVESTIGATION BEGAN, CLEANUP HAS YET  TO START.  </P> <P> Don Bailey remembers hunting rabbits as a boy down by the town dump, how the  frisky rabbits would jump when you sneaked up and run for half a mile. They  made good eating.  </P> <P> He also remembers swimming in nearby Lake Dupree, always curious about the  wind-whipped orange foam that lathered its banks.  </P> <P> Bailey is now 39. He is so ill he cannot work and has lost all feeling in one  arm. His brother and sister also have strange allergies and ailments the  doctors cannot seem to correct.  </P> <P> Today the dump has a chain-link fence around it with a red sign that says:  "KEEP OUT. HAZARDOUS WASTE AREA." As for the rabbits, Bailey remembers when  their always reliable numbers began to dwindle and you had to walk up and kick  one to get it to move.  </P> <P> "I killed one, took it home, cut it open and it was yellow as a lemon inside,"  he recalls. "It stank."  </P> <P> Jacksonville, a town of 30,000 just north of Little Rock, is the location of  three toxic waste sites on the Environmental Protection Agency's "priority"  list -- Superfund sites.  </P> <P> Thousands of drums containing waste byproducts of now-banned herbicides sit on  a covered concrete slab where four chemical companies operated for 40 years.  </P> <P> For more than 10 years, since the EPA first started investigating, some of the  town's citizens have been raising a stink of their own. They fear they are  being poisoned by dioxin.  </P> <P> Among more than 30,000 cleanup sites across the country -- including 1,194  priority sites -- three may not seem like many. But these citizens believe that  in a town this size it is quite a distinction, though dubious, and 10 years is  a long time to wait to get it cleaned up.  </P> <P> "This town is a chemical soup," said Claudette Hazlett, "and I'm angry about  it."  </P> <P> Hazlett is Bailey's sister, which would explain her anger, not to mention her  own constant headaches and back problems. She is also vice president of a group  called People Against a Chemically Contaminated Environment.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Jacksonville boosters say that the town has confronted its  problem and is supporting a cleanup, and that notoriety hurts the town's image.  </P> <P> "We are left with a legacy that requires remediation," said state Rep. Mike  Wilson. "Fortunately, that contamination is confined to a very small area that  affects no one that we can see. There's a lot of sex appeal for the media in  dead-baby stories."  </P> <P> Wilson is spokesman for a group called Jacksonville People With Pride.  </P> <P> A third group, Jacksonville People With Pride Cleanup Coalition, was awarded  three EPA grants of $50,000 to hire technical advisers to monitor cleanup at  all three sites: Reasor-Hill Chemical Corp. and successors Hercules Powder Co.,  Transvaal Inc. and Vertac Chemical Corp.  </P> <P> That is when the dispute boiled over. Hazlett's group, furious, told the EPA  that Hercules was a member of the opposition group, People With Pride. The  government, she maintained, would be paying a transgressor to monitor the  cleanup.  </P> <P> EPA withdrew the grants.  </P> <P> Wilson acknowledges that Hercules was a member of People With Pride and that  People With Pride Cleanup Coalition has many of the same members, but he says  Hercules was not one of them.  </P> <P> "Since we had told EPA from the very beginning that Hercules was a contributor  to Jacksonville People With Pride and they knew it, I can't understand why they  changed their mind," Wilson said. "Now that they have changed their mind, we  are going to find out why."  </P> <P> With the grants up for grabs, enter a fourth group: the Jacksonville  Environmental Network, which encompasses Hazlett's group and others who are  angry. That group has applied for the grants and has vowed to oppose any  attempt by the coalition group to try again for the money by "sanitizing" its  membership.  </P> <P> At least, Hazlett said, the EPA's withdrawal of the grants should inspire  people nationwide to fight regulatory decisions.  </P> <P> The president of the coalition, Ruby Brown, said the group did indeed intend to  use the technical advisers to play down publicity about the contamination, but  Wilson said that is not so.  </P> <P> "We have got a proven record," Wilson said. "The big picture in all this is not  whether we or someone else receives a grant. The purpose of the grant is to  educate and inform, and we are doing that anyway. The big picture is solving  the problem, and that is cleaning up this chemical contamination."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, those barrels of toxic waste remain.  </P> <P> MRK, an incineration firm in Zachary, La., received a contract in July to do a  trial burn next March at the 93-acre Vertac site. If tests go well, it could  start incinerating 2.5 million tons an hour a month later, Richard Merritt of  the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology said.  </P> <P> Vertac, which began as a World War II ordnance plant, produced the herbicide  known as Agent Orange. To incinerate about 28,000 barrels of the ingredients of  that herbicide would take about six months, Merrill estimates. If the EPA  judges the ash to be non-hazardous, it will be put in drums and buried in a  landfill.  </P> <P> Wilson says there is no medical evidence to link the chemicals and the  illnesses, which Hazlett concedes -- for now.  </P> <P> Even if the chemicals are burned and buried, she said, it will not slow her  crusade. She said her group plans to make a door-to-door health survey to  document community illnesses.  </P> <P> She has her own, and her brother, Don Bailey, has his, and Bailey said he had a  friend who worked at Vertac and died of cancer. Bailey said his friend told him  that the company sent home a letter telling his family to wash his clothes  separately.  </P> <P> But Bailey, a slight, bearded man with a useless arm, hands that tremble,  asthma, allergies and chronic headaches, said no one ever warned him about  swimming in the lake with the orange foam or about eating the rabbits and the  fish he brought home for the family table.  </P> <P> "They were doing this to people and they knew about it and they didn't tell the  people about it," he said.  </P> <P> But when he opened up a rabbit and it stank, didn't he suspect?  </P> <P> "It didn't dawn on people what was what," he said. After all, those companies  provided good jobs for good pay.  </P> <P> The only other big employer in Jacksonville is an Air Force base.  </P> <P> Only retribution against the polluters, it seems, will satisfy Hazlett.  </P> <P> "Don's life is ruined," she said. "His future is gone. And a  multibillion-dollar industry is reaping the profits at the expense of somebody  like this.  </P> <P> "I think it's time our government officials stood up and took a stand and said:  'That's enough.' "  </P></p>

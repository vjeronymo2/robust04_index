			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING TEAM FLIES IN THE FACE OF CONTROVERSY;  </P> <P> MALATHION: IT'S A THANKLESS JOB FOR PILOTS ENLISTED TO APPLY PESTICIDE OVER  PARTS OF ORANGE COUNY. THEY'VE BEEN CURSED AND, IN ONE INSTANCE, EVEN SHOT AT.  </P> <P> Jim Josephson and his workers say they really don't like their jobs. The hours  are bad. The work is stressful, dangerous. They are separated from their  families one week before Christmas. And the people they are supposed to be  helping are irritated, if not enraged, by their hovering presence.  </P> <P> "We've been condemned, badgered and shot at," said Josephson, a 49-year-old  Delano resident who runs a helicopter service in the San Joaquin Valley. "We  don't do this because we like to do it. We do it because a job like this needs  top professionals."  </P> <P> Josephson and six pilots form the backbone of a 50-member squadron that has  been enlisted to apply pesticide over parts of Orange County and other areas of  Southern California to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly, the crop-destroying  pest that has spread through more than 250 square miles of residential  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In the months ahead, their low-flying helicopters will become a commonplace  sight -- and sound -- over Southland neighborhoods. As part of an escalated  attack plan, officials have called for at least 12 aerial applications of the  pesticide malathion over each pocket of infestation. Previously, they had  attempted to fight infestations with only one spraying.  </P> <P> State and county officials say the aerial applications pose no health risks  because of the extremely low dose of malathion dropped in a sticky molasses  bait. Nonetheless, it remains controversial, eliciting protests from some  residents and politicians who question the need for such an extensive attack.  </P> <P> For Josephson's pilots and ground support crews, the sensitivity drives them to  extraordinary caution at every step. Virtually every action -- from unsealing  the pesticide barrel to mapping out the flight plan -- is checked,  double-checked and measured by somber-faced government officials. If something  should go wrong, if the pesticide is not properly mixed, or a helicopter sprays  the wrong neighborhood, a record of each action has been tabulated for the  resulting state inquiry.  </P> <P> Perhaps that is why the staff goes about their nightly duties on the tarmac at  El Monte Airport with little emotion.  </P> <P> "It makes you serious about everything," Jim Rudig, the state's aerial spray  program coordinator, said of the criticism. "I'd be lying if I said this was a  fun job."  </P> <P> On one typical spray night last week, three slick, white helicopters sat alone  on the tarmac, glistening beneath the airport spotlights.  </P> <P> The six pilots were five miles away eating dinner at a Denny's restaurant. They  are a quiet lot of middle-aged men from the San Joaquin Valley. Three are  Vietnam War veterans, one is a sheriff's deputy, another is a test pilot for  the National Guard, others are full-time pilots working for Josephson. They  said publicity didn't interest them.  </P> <P> "We aren't interested in being heroes or anything," said Josephson, a pilot  himself. "We just keep a low profile and stay out of the limelight so we can  get the job done."  </P> <P> They sleep in the Vagabond Hotel, eat dinner together in coffee shops like  Denny's and then head straight to the airport to tend their choppers every  night.  </P> <P> On this night, like all others, the six pilots arrived at 8 p.m. sharp, wearing  bomber jackets, down vests and jeans. Their arrival prompted a surge of  activity around the Bell 204 helicopters. The men circled the choppers,  touching the walls of the craft feeling for possible cracks, shining  flashlights on engine parts and rotor blades.  </P> <P> A chubby tanker truck pulled up along side the helicopters, followed by four  government pickup trucks. A man in a white jumpsuit unraveled a hose from the  tanker, stuck the nozzle into the belly of the helicopter and pumped out 250  gallons of corn syrup laced with malathion.  </P> <P> The crew spoke their own language, an odd mix of military slang and  agricultural terms. The "ships" were to follow "flight lines" above city  streets, guided by ground navigators' "cue-beams" as they dropped "bait spray"  over the sleeping populace.  </P> <P> The helicopter crews prefer the term "bait spray" to "pesticides."  </P> <P> "There's a big difference," Josephson said. "This is not contact spraying. Bugs  are not physically drowning in spray. What we do here is apply bait. A fly has  to eat the bait to die."  </P> <P> Josephson said that when he sprays crops in Bakersfield to kill bugs such as  the beet leaf hopper, it is not uncommon to drop 10 to 20 gallons of water and  pesticide over every acre. Officials say the Medfly sprayings drop 12.4 ounces  of mixture over an acre, 2.8 ounces of which is malathion.  </P> <P> Josephson's firm, San Joaquin Helicopters, is one of the largest aerial  application and ground spraying operations in the West. His company, which  charges the state about $40,000 a night to treat 20 square miles, was the  lowest bidder in a state contract awarded last year. He and most of his crew  are veterans of the Northern California Medfly infestation of 1980-81 and are  noted among their peers as pioneers of urban pesticide spraying.  </P> <P> Josephson said that in 1980-81, he and his crew flew amid "public hysteria"  over the aerial pesticide applications. One of his helicopters was shot at, but  not damaged, in that infestation. No such incident has occurred in the current  outbreak.  </P> <P> The customized choppers are equipped with 12-foot spray booms on each side with  three nozzles each. The booms, which look like metal sprinkler pipes, are  connected to a 300-gallon tank that sits in the belly of the chopper.  </P> <P> After completing a final nozzle test, the roaring helicopters gently lifted off  in unison and flew eastward, looking much like giant invader insects  themselves.  </P> <P> Night flying poses its own special difficulties, Josephson said.  </P> <P> "If we had our preference we would fly in the daytime when it is easier to see,  easier to land safely in an emergency," he said. "It's the hardest thing to  find a spray zone in the middle of 50 miles of city lights. I mean we have to  pick out that area, line up and spray. We have to keep in formation and keep  our lines straight."  </P> <P> The pilots use a sophisticated navigational computer called Loran, which stands  for long range area navigation. The pilots find the exact boundaries of the  spray zone by inputting the latitude and longitude of the street intersections  below.  </P> <P> The pilots fly single file in east-west lines, crossing the spray zone up to  300 times in a night. Their eyes are fixed most of the time on digital computer  figures and instrument compasses. When they reach a designated boundary the  co-pilot flicks on the spray switch.  </P> <P> All during the flight the Loran prints out the exact path of the chopper. If a  resident later complains that the wrong neighborhood was sprayed, state  officials have a record.  </P> <P> As a backup, six human navigators position themselves at each end of the  boundaries and hold up bright spotlights, "cue beams," to catch the eye of the  pilots. When the ships pass, they race to the next block and wait for the next  fly-by.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another team of agricultural inspectors is actually out catching  malathion rain drops. At several spots inside and just outside the zone, they  lay out 12-inch-square white cards that will show the drop size and coverage of  the spray. They call themselves the "Kimby card team," a non-military term that  refers to the absorbent baby diaper material lining the cards.  </P> <P> If drops show up on cards outside the zone, the Kimby team radios the  helicopter pilots and advises them to turn off the spray a bit earlier upon  boundary approach.  </P> <P> The intense activity leaves little time for the pilots to think about the  people down below, some who get caught in the spray.  </P> <P> "Sometimes we are up and see people playing tennis or out on the soccer field,"  Josephson said. "So we try not to worry about it because it will all wash off."  </P> <P> ANOTHER DOUSING: State officials have scheduled two more aerial pesticide  sprayings in January for North County neighborhoods.

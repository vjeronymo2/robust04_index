			<p>BFN     [Text] A new Hungarian interest protection organization is  to be formed in Vojvodina, Arpad Madarasz reports from Ujvidek  [Novi Sad]:    [Madarasz] According to the initiators, following the  General  Assembly of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina  [VMDK] in Zenta [at the end of March] it became clear that the  Hungarians of Vojvodina were left without an organization to  protect their interests.    To remind you, this was the General Assembly which was  convened to clarify the financial involvement of Sandor Hodi,  the organization's deputy chairman, in the matter of receiving  money from the Illyes Foundation, and where, at least seemingly,  the wing led by [VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston won the upper  hand.    According to a communique published in MAGYAR SZO of  Ujvidek,  the founding members of the new organization pledge to represent  the real interests of Hungarians in Vojvodina. Their priority  task is to unite the Hungarians in Vojvodina and to create the  conditions for them to remain there. One of the participants in  the founding session, Sandor Egresi, told the Ujvidek newspaper  that there is a need for an interest protection organization  which is not exclusive and which allows for different opinions.    Among the members of the founding committee are hitherto  VMDK  leadership members and present and former parliamentary deputies  such as Dr. Sandor Hodi, (Ferenc Csubela), and Dr. Zoltan Varga.  They intend to hold the organization's founding session within a  month.</p>

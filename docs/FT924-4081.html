			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / IG Metall deal raises hope for inflation fight HOPES are rising in Germany of a strike-free and inflation-beating pay round for 1993 in the wake of two trend-setting settlements, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. In the early hours of yesterday, IG Metall, the most powerful union in the country, accepted a basic deal for steel workers worth between 3 per cent and 4 per cent over 18 months. This followed a 12-month, 4.2 per cent agreement in the insurance industry. Compared with forecast inflation of less than 4 per cent and expected average productivity gains of around 2 per cent next year, the settlements suggest that pay-induced pressure on the price index could ease significantly if remaining negotiations reach similar conclusions. Economists suggested that would remove one of the main obstacles in the way of a cut in German interest rates, but they stressed that public spending and money supply growth still had to be brought under control before changes could be expected. The next test of the mood will come in negotiations between federal, regional and local government employers and the oTV public services union. Government advisers have urged rises of less than 3 per cent  -nil in some cases - while oTV posted a claim for a 5 per cent rise. Rising unemployment and sweeping job cuts have markedly dampened union aggression. But Construction workers, whose current agreement runs out in the spring, may be more ambitious. The building industry is one of the few in Germany still growing.</p>

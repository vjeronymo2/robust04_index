			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin report: "Ames Affair: The Furor Continues"] </F>   [Text] It would appear that the fuss raised over the  arrest of the Ames couple, who is accused of spying for Moscow,  is increasingly taking on a hysterical character in the United  States. An ITAR-TASS correspondent reports on the artificially  hyped atmosphere of spy mania around the so-called Ames affair.  An indicative example: On TV shows viewers are being asked  what punishment they would determine for this married couple,  who are accused of espionage. Whereas formerly it was claimed  that two Soviet citizens cooperating with the CIA were exposed  and executed in the eighties on Aldrich Ames' tip-offs, this  figure has now already increased to 10.    Meanwhile, after Ames fell under suspicion from the FBI in  1991, he was removed from top-secret work involving opposition  to the KGB and was transferred to a department remote from  politics -- the department for combating narcotics.    All the same, the exposure of a double agent, a routine  event  for the intelligence world, is still riveting the heightened  attention of the mass media. THE WASHINGTON POST reports on the  recently completed visit of a special CIA delegation to Moscow.  Details of the visit by the U.S. intelligence agents to their  Russian counterparts are not reported. The paper only says that  discussion of the Ames affair was unproductive. However, it can  be assumed with a great deal of probability that the visitors  from Langley could not have failed to take advantage of the  opportunity afforded to them of censuring their Russian  colleagues and rivals for not honoring a sort of gentleman's  agreement between the two intelligence services to stop  recruiting their agents among high-ranking officials, to which  category Aldrich Ames can apparently be assigned. It can also  be supposed that the Americans tried to twist the arms of the  Russian intelligence agents to make them wind down their  activity on U.S. territory and reduce the number of Russian  intelligence agents working there. And, possibly, they also  tried to find out what secrets Ames betrayed.    Of course, the leadership of the Foreign Intelligence  Service  [FIS] could not meet such demands. FIS Director Yevgeniy  Primakov once called on the Americans to wind up intelligence  activity against each other on a mutual, equal basis. However,  the Russian intelligence agency's call was left hanging in the  air. In principle it would be possible to return to discussion  of this proposal today. However, judging by the assessment of  this visit given by the Americans themselves, Langley believes  that only they have the right to carry out intelligence activity.    It would be unjust to accuse Russian intelligence agents of  perfidy and breaking a gentleman's agreement -- if, despite all  the stupidity of such an agreement, it does exist. The point is  that Ames, the U.S. press claims, was recruited back in the  mid-eighties before the beginning of Gorbachev's perestroyka.  And Russian intelligence agents, as it were, inherited him from  the Soviet intelligence agency. And it would be simply the  height of folly to refuse the services of such a valuable agent.  I am confident that, if the Americans were in our place, they  would have acted in exactly the same way.</p>

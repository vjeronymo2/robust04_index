			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Thomson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Nineteen parties  contesting next week's elections on Tuesday [19 April] handed a  memorandum to the European Community's election unit in  Johannesburg, requesting election campaign funds allocated by  the EEC be provided directly to them and not through the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC].    The request was made after a proposal tabled by the Federal  Party at a meeting of the IEC's party liaison committee on  Tuesday morning was carried by 14 votes to five. The proposal  was that the EEC be approached to distribute the funds among the  parties "in an equal manner".    A joint statement by the 19 parties said: "Due to the time  constraints between now and the elections we feel an urgent  decision on this matter is needed to ensure free and fair  elections and a multiparty democracy."    The parties are the South African Women's Party, Green  Party,  Western Cape Federalist Party, Islamic Party, Africa Muslim  Party, African Democratic Movement, Workers International,  African Moderates Congress Party, Federal Party, Merit Party,  Workers List Party, Right Party, Ximoko Progressive Party,  Soccer Party, Luso-South African Party, Minority Front, United  People's Front, Dikwankwetla Party and Women's Rights Peace  Party.    South African Women's Party leader Sue Millard told SAPA:  "The way in which the state electoral fund is administered  completely sidelines the smaller parties and is not in the  interests of the public. "The required signatures and opinion  polls (required to qualify for funds) are not ideal ways of  determining support. For example, a lot of people have to deal  with intimidation."    Ms Millard said most of the parties opposing the proposal  were those with ample funds, and it was clear who they were.</p>

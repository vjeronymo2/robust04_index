			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)). The principal impact of these changes is to provide a procedure for domestic applicants to quickly and inexpensively file a provisional application. The filing date of the provisional application will not be used to measure the term of a patent granted on an application which claims the earlier filing date of the provisional application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the National Government and the States as outlined in E.O. 12612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed rules contain collections of information subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (Act). The provisional application has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0651&hyph;0031 and 0651&hyph;0032. The cover sheet is necessary to expedite the processing of a provisional application and improve quality. Public reporting burden for the collection of information on the cover sheet is estimated to average 12 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden to the Office of Assistance Quality and Enhancement Division, Patent and Trademark Office Washington, DC 20231, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority granted to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C. 6, the Patent and Trademark Office proposes to amend Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR Part 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of Information, Inventions and patents, Reporting and record keeping requirements, Small businesses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 37 CFR Part 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Inventions and patents, Reporting and record keeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 37 CFR parts 1 and 3 are proposed to be amended as follows, with removals (other than &sect;1.60 which is proposed to be removed and reserved) indicated by brackets ([]) and additions by arrows (>&lt;): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

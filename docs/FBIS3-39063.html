He  expressed the hope that this will make it possible to implement  the European Union peace plan, Bohl said on ARD TV's morning  news program today. Peace will otherwise have to be brought  about through military means. Bonn has actively worked for a  unified NATO position "behind the scenes," he stated.    The Federal Republic cannot itself participate in military  actions for historical and constitutional reasons, but will give  the decisions made in Brussels its full "political and moral  support," he said. Bohl rejected the idea that Europe would be  on the brink of war after possible air strikes against artillery  positions in Sarajevo. To draw parallels between 1914 and 1994  is "false" and does not take into account the completely  different situation now, he asserted.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach tag could exceed Pounds 120m STAGECOACH, the Perth-based company which operates bus services all over the UK and in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is planning to raise Pounds 20.6m through a Stock Exchange flotation next month which could value the company at more than Pounds 120m. The company, which has expanded rapidly through the acquisition of privatised bus companies in the UK and abroad, is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.8m for the year to April 30 1993, up from Pounds 8.24m on continuing operations in 1992. Turnover was Pounds 104.3m for the 36 weeks to January 9 1993, compared with full year turnover of Pounds 131.4m in 1992. The pathfinder prospectus for the flotation is issued today. The sponsor is Noble Grossart, Edinburgh merchant bank, and stockbroker UBS Philips &amp; Drew. Analysts believe the shares could command a price earnings ratio of between 13.5 and 14.52. They believe the company would be valued at over Pounds 120m. After flotation, which will lead to borrowings of about Pounds 20.6m being replaced by equity, Stagecoach will save about Pounds 2m in interest charges, which will raise the forecast earnings per share from the 7.8p stated to about 9.3p. After flotation Stagecoach will have net assets of Pounds 43m. The company says it has identified possible acquisitions among the 32 remaining municipal bus operators and the 10 operating companies in London Buses which the government plans to privatise. Mr Brian Souter, 38, the chairman, and his sister Ann Gloag, 50, managing director, who founded Stagecoach in 1980, are expected to sell shares worth about Pounds 13m but will still end up owning more than 50 per cent of the company. Eight Scottish institutions which own convertible preference shares would end up owning 13 per cent of the equity if they convert all their shares but are also expected to make some realisations. Some 18 per cent of Stagecoach's 11,000 staff own shares, which if held will lead to them owning about five per cent of the company. The price should be announced on April 6. The offer will close on April 16 with dealings beginning on April 20. Prospectuses can be obtained by dialling 0645 100640.</p>

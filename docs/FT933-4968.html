			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Austria and Exim deals revive Euroyen sector THE LAUNCH last week of two large yen-denominated Eurobond issues by top-quality borrowers has helped to revive investor interest in the Euroyen sector of the international bond market. The Export-Import Bank of Japan raised Y75bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds and the Republic of Austria established a new benchmark at the long end of the Euroyen market with its Y60bn issue of 12-year Eurobonds. Syndicate managers say that Exim's 10-year Eurobond issue has helped to open up the Euroyen sector for other Japanese government-guaranteed entities. In the past, the Japanese finance ministry had discouraged them from raising yen-denominated funds outside the domestic bond market. However, the ministry has changed its stance in recent years. So far, the Japanese Development Bank (JDB) has been the only government-guaranteed entity to issue in Euroyen. It has launched two such offerings in the past two years, and is thought to be considering a third, of the same size and maturity as Exim's. Austria followed rapidly on Exim's heels, and both issues have provided liquidity which is badly needed at the long end of the Euroyen sector. Both issues were priced against the World Bank's yen global bond due 2003. Exim's issue was priced to yield six basis points above the yield on World Bank's bond. Some managers said the issue was generously priced. By contrast, the pricing of Austria's issue, launched at a spread of 13 basis points over the yield on the World Bank bond, was widely regarded as tight. Some syndicate managers said the spread should have been five basis points wider to compensate for the extra two years of the bonds' life. However, a spokesman at the lead manager, Yamaichi International, said last week the pricing was justified by the quality of the borrower and demand for long-dated paper. The pricing also reflected Yamaichi's view that Japanese interest rates will be cut in the near future, which would increase the attraction of the 4 1/2 per cent coupon. Syndicate managers say these two issues could herald a steady stream of Euroyen issues over the coming months, which would stem the decline in volume in this area of the Euromarket. According to IFR Securities Data, the percentage of all Eurobonds issued in yen fell in the first eight months of this year, to 10 per cent of the total from 11.5 per cent in the same period last year. By contrast, sterling's share rose from 8.7 to 12.6 per cent and the D-Mark's to from 9.7 to 14.5 per cent. The dollar's share remains the largest at around 35 per cent. The data also show that the yen dropped to fourth position in the table of the preferred issuing currencies from second position. The lack of swap opportunities this year has deterred non-Japanese issuers from borrowing in yen. Many issuers only tap the Euroyen sector if they can swap the proceeds of their offering into dollars which are fixed at a margin below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). However, swap conditions have improved recently and Exim is thought to have exchanged the proceeds from its offering into dollars, achieving an all-in cost of funds of 20 basis points below Libor. Non-Japanese borrowers have also been hindered by the yen's appreciation against other currencies in recent months. Syndicate managers say they are now looking more closely at the Euroyen sector, encouraged by expectations that the yen has reached its peak. 'Many borrowers would like to borrow in yen when it is close to its all-time high because their currency exposure should be reduced in the long term as a result,' says one syndicate manager. Expectations of a further cut in Japanese interest rates to boost the country's flagging economic growth have further enhanced the market conditions for borrowers. Many economists expect a cut of up to  3/4 points in the discount rate, which is currently at 2 1/2 per cent. The Japanese government bond market has been strengthening as a result of the hopes of a cut in rates. Analysts believe that after the cut, interest rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. In the light of such forecasts, investors are keen to buy long-dated yen bonds which offer a coupon with some premium over the current low yields in the government bond market. Yet despite the favourable conditions for borrowers and the current demand among investors for yen Eurobonds, syndicate managers are careful not to launch too many new issues for fear of saturating the market. The Euroyen market is less liquid than other sectors of the international bond market because of it is still limited to the highest credits, namely sovereign and supranational borrowers, or triple A-rated corporate names. As a result, many yen Eurobond issues become illiquid very soon after their launch. This is a drawback for investors wanting to sell their bonds before they are redeemed so they are reluctant to buy too many at issue. 'It is a self-perpetuating problem,' says one syndicate manager. Last week's deals helped to provide liquidity at the longer end of the market but syndicate managers say it will take a considerable time before this vicious circle is broken.</p>

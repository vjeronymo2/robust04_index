			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal lifts payout for quarter Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's top three banks, has raised its quarterly dividend, reflecting its own strong performance and the favourable outlook for Canada's big six banks as a group. Then bank yesterday said its dividend will climb to 30 cents a share from 28 cents. The higher dividend will be payable on February 25 to shareholders registered by February 8. Earlier, Bank of Nova Scotia lifted its quarterly payout from 29 to 30 cents. Bank shares have climbed steeply on the Toronto stock exchange in recent months in anticipation of stronger lending volumes and declining loan losses. Shares of Bank of Nova Scotia, which posted the highest return on equity among the six banks last year, were trading at CDollars 32.38 yesterday, up from last year's low of CDollars 21.88. Bank of Montreal has posted record earnings for the past four years. Mr Matthew Barrett, chairman, told the annual meeting yesterday that BMO aimed to be the first bank providing a full range of services across both the US and Canada. Mr Barrett warned that unless Canadian banks were willing to compete head-on with US banks south of the border, they should resign themselves to being regional banks, 'and perhaps not even independent regional banks'. Canadian banks 'sooner or later can expect to face much more intense competition from American banks right here in Canada', Mr Barrett said. 'We intend to engage the US competition on their own ground long before they cast their eyes northward.' The bank has said it plans to invest CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) in a bid to triple the market share of Harris Bankcorp, its Chicago-based subsidiary. Mr Barrett said that Harris was now worth USDollars 2bn, nearly four times the acquisition price in 1984. He said the bank would also strengthen its presence in Mexico and rapidly expand its seven-branch network in south-east Asia. Harris and the bank's Canadian securities unit Nesbit Thomson together would form a continental investment bank, he said.</p>

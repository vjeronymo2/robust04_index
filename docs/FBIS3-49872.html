"It seems that what certain people within the UN system try  to do is always always find a new fresh general not as creative  as the previous one," Sacirbery said during a BBC interview. "It  seems any time a commander in Bosnia finally is convinced that  the status quo needs to change, that's when someone decides the  commander himself needs to be changed." Sacirbey was reacting  to France's annoucement Tuesday that it was pulling out General  Jean Cot from ex-Yugoslavia by the end of March and replacing  him with another general.    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had asked for Cot  to  be replaced before his mandate ends on June 30 and had  criticized the general for asking to be given the power to order  air strikes. Sacirbey said Western powers have continously  overlooked their stated commitment to Bosnia. "It seems  everyone is eager to forget the commitments made by NATO (North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation)," he said.    According to a UN Security Council resolution adopted in May  1993 Butrus-Ghali is the only person that can call for NATO air  strikes in former Yugoslavia.</p>

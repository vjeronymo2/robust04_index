			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Earning credibility James Capel's research into the implications of forthcoming accounting changes is all the more authoritative for its workmanlike approach. Companies have little room to quiver with rage at its findings, even though these reveal an extraordinary impact - to coin a phrase - on published earnings per share. Last year's earnings figure at Courtaulds Textiles would fall by nearly half to 19.1p if the new approach were applied. British Aerospace would have reported a loss of 43p instead of 27.2p. Ideally the volatility of earnings figures under the new regime should cause the market to take a more considered look at the full picture. In practice, investors may want to establish a common yardstick for valuing shares relative both to the market as a whole and to other companies in the sector. The operational cash-flow figure may help. At least it is undistorted by differences in depreciation policy. But the most likely outcome, as Capel suggests, is that companies will iron out fluctuations in stated earnings by publishing a 'normalised' figure as well. The danger is that this would leave us where we started. There is no reason to assume that company-normalised earnings figures would be any less suspect than those declared at present. Brokers could produce normalised figures independently but the market could not cope with a plethora of figures. Besides, as we have been reminded by the debate over the status of research that has followed the controversy at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, it is open to question how far broker estimates would be likely to stray from a company-set norm.</p>

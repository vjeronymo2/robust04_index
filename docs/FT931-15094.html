			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic farming outgrows its niche - An industry conference in Brazil THE OLD favourites remained as popular as ever: papers being given on the 'Nodulation and Nitrogen Fixation of Selected Food Legumes in Organic Systems' and 'Ecological Agriculture and Indigenous Knowledge in the Bolivian Andes'. But conspicuously encroaching on the agenda of a recent international scientific conference on organic agriculture in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were topics that reflect increasing commercial success. Among the most salient issues under discussion at the gathering were trade, regulation, and certification standards. 'We've grown out of our niche,' proclaimed Mr Volkert L. Engelsman, representative of Eosta, a Dutch trading company that deals in organic and 'biodynamic' agricultural products. In an age of growing ecological and health awareness mainstream growers can no longer discount their organic competitors as a fringe element unable to tell a balance sheet from scrap paper destined for the recycling bin. If there is anything extraordinary about organic agriculture it is the sector's growth. 'It is growing like crazy,' remarked Mr Thomas B. Harding Junior, a Pennsylvania organic farmer, and vice president of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. Mr Harding looks like your average American farmer, with the sturdy build and slight paunch of a man who appears to enjoy his meals. As the only businessman (as well as the first non-European) among the German-based federation's leadership, he was the man with the figures. He estimated that organically cultivated products had a worldwide market of between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 40bn a year, mostly in Europe, with Germany in the lead. America, he said, accounted for between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 5bn of that - with the figure expected to reach Dollars 10bn by 1995. Countries like Mexico and Brazil were emerging as important producers, he noted. The success of this market depends on the ability to assure consumers that their produce, grains and processed foodstuffs are healthful and grown using environmentally sound practices. Some customers even want to be satisfied that labourers and small farmers, especially in the Third World, get a better deal than usual. Organic agriculture professes the use of natural inputs - spurning the use of chemical pesticides, for example. Biodynamic agriculture is a stricter cousin, using a 'holistic' approach that, among other things, aims to turn a farm into a 'closed organism', using recycling and other means to generate as many of its own inputs as possible. Unique consumer demands cry out for a credible certification system, creating more than the usual tension between free trade and regulation. 'All regulations are trade barriers, and we hate them,' said Mr Engelsman. 'But as a movement dedicated to better agriculture, we see the need for some protectionism.' The biggest barrier to international trade right now appears to be a set of European Community standards taking effect this month for imports. The regulations were implemented for EC producers in July, but the deadline for third countries was extended to allow more time for registration. Listening to exporters, the scheme sounds like old-fashioned trade restriction. 'More paperwork and bureaucracy,' complained Mr Alexandre H. Harkaly, of the Biodynamic Institute, a Brazilian non-governmental organisation that provides assistance to organic farmers. But they had better be prepared. In the US, a 1990 law similar to the EC provision is scheduled to take effect for imports in October. In many countries, the private sector is attempting to solve the certification problem through self-regulation. But, as Mr Engelsman puts it, that leads to a Christmas tree of certification labels too numerous to cram on to your average box of herbal tea. Government control, business people admit, may be the only answer - but the private sector wants a say. 'We're all worried about government control, but we need to play by a common set of norms,' said Mr Harding. 'Organic can't mean something in one place and something else somewhere else.' Another new twist is on the distribution side. Traditionally, organic products have been sold primarily in health food stores. Now supermarkets are showing interest. In England, 90 per cent of organic products are already sold in supermarkets and in Denmark the figure is 70 per cent, according to Mr Engelsman. Some major foodstuffs producers have explored opportunities in the sector, but smaller organic companies do not feel threatened yet. 'The corporations do not have a lot of experience with products that are not standardised, especially in terms of availability and continuity. They like to have everything exactly the same,' said Mr Ulrich Walter of Euroherb, a German company with a DM12m (Pounds 4.8m) annual turnover, that supplies organic herbs, spices, tea and coffee. Growing interest from big business has even given Mr Walter's company a boost. Euroherb supplies DM, the German drugstore chain, with a line of about 20 herbal teas sold under the chain's Alnatura brand name. Organic growers and distributors, whose prices tend to be higher than those of their conventional rivals, are leading advocates of environmental accounting, a concept batted around at the 'Earth Summit' in Rio de Janeiro. The approach would make businesses put numerical values on things like environmental degradation. Mr Harding noted that organic agriculture used less non-renewable resources, less energy, and that the lack of chemical fertilisers eliminated the threat of aquifer (water source) contamination and improved the health and safety standards of farm workers. 'If you account for these things, we produce more cheaply,' he said.</p>

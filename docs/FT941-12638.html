			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Something borrowed: but how? - Financing the Family / Paying for the wedding / Even well-off parents may wonder if elopement isn't a good idea, yet in the end, most pay up Your wedding may or may not turn out to be the best day of your life, but it will probably be one of the most expensive. Even during the past few years of recession, the average cost of a wedding has crept up to more than Pounds 8,000. There are more than 300,000 marriages every year in the UK, two thirds of them first marriages, which are more likely to involve lavish spending on receptions and outfits, though even the second or third-time bride often insists on a traditional do. As with any large project, wedding costs tend to escalate well above original estimates. You may start by planning a simple occasion, but as time passes it becomes clear that dozens of relatives would be mortally offended if they were not invited, so the size of the reception has to be doubled. Then, after weeks of trying on white lace and ruffles, the bride decides that the only wedding dress she could possibly wear is hand-made from pure silk and costs Pounds 1,000. And, of course, the bridesmaids have to look pretty as well. Then you flick through a few bridal magazines, and start thinking about the cost of printing invitations, hiring a photographer, finding a vintage car or maybe a Rolls Royce for the day. You discover that wedding cake must be one of the most expensive foods, and that to spend less than Pounds 250 on fresh flowers would be social suicide. Choristers don't come cheap, and what about a video? This is the stage when even comfortably-off parents start dropping hints about how elopements are so romantic, and that it's the height of fashion these days to get married in solitude on a Caribbean island. But in the end, most decide that it's a once-in-a-lifetime occasion (despite statistics to the contrary), and stump up their share. Some parents dream of white lace and confetti while their daughter is still a schoolgirl, and start stashing money away to pay for it all. There is no harm in that, and if the money is invested wisely it could become a tidy sum by the time their fond parental imaginings become reality: the average age for first marriages is now 25 for women and 27 for men. By their mid-20s, most young people are earning, and there seems to be a tendency for the bridal couple to make more of a contribution towards the cost of the wedding than was traditionally the case. About a third of couples pay for the reception themselves; while some expenses, such as the honeymoon and gifts for bridesmaids and the best man, have always been the responsibility of the bridegroom. However, a large part of the burden still falls on the bride's parents. Although a majority of couples now live together before they marry, many are heavily mortgaged and have to fall back on their parents if they want all the usual trimmings. If you are saving for a wedding at some indeterminate point more than five years hence, there is a wide range of possible savings vehicles. Insurance-based savings policies can be inflexible, as they have fixed maturity dates, and trying to withdraw money early carries heavy penalties. More likely to be suitable are the various types of building society and National Savings account. If the money will not be needed for at least five years, you could use a Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account) or one of the various NS products with a five-year term. Peps and unit and investment trust savings schemes are a more risky alternative, as they invest in shares, but returns can be better than on money kept on deposit, and they can be cashed in at any time. The average engagement lasts one year. That does not give the couple much time to save up for their contribution, but it is sensible to start putting money aside into a special account as early as possible, because expenses, such as the deposit for the reception venue, crop up very quickly. Not many couples would want to start married life in debt, but given the choice of postponing the wedding for a few years to save up for a big reception and designer wedding dress, or having a spartan ceremony now, some prefer to marry in haste, and pay at leisure, with the help of a personal loan. A few finance companies specialise in providing loans for weddings, but really there is no reason to choose a specialist rather than an ordinary unsecured bank or building society loan. Shop around for the best interest rates, and watch out for arrangement fees and early repayment penalties. Weddings are complicated events, and a host of occurrences could ruin the big day, from the hotel going bust and the car breaking down to the marquee collapsing and the bride's dress getting ripped. A death in the family might force you to postpone the whole thing. Most possible disasters (apart from the bride or groom getting cold feet) can be covered by wedding insurance, which costs about Pounds 30-Pounds 45 for a standard level of cover. Extensions are available if you have particularly expensive outfits or hired marquees to worry about. An insurance broker should be able to find a suitable policy, but some of the specialists are: Cornhill, Grand UK, Insurex Expo-Sure, Leisurecare, Methodist Insurance and Provincial.  ---------------------------------------------------- HOW IT ALL ADDS UP: THE AVERAGE COST (POUNDS)  ---------------------------------------------------- Engagement ring               549 Wedding rings                 243 Bride's outfit                676 Other clothes                 771 Photography and video         493 Flowers                       224 Transport                     211 Stationery                    143 Catering and food           1,392 Drinks                        504 Cake                          141 Hire of venue                 348 Second party                  567 Honeymoon                   1,893  ---------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                Pounds 8,155  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Wedding and Home magazine survey, March 1993  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

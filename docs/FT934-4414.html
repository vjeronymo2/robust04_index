			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Chrysler lifts quarterly dividend by one third Chrysler, the US car maker, boosted its quarterly dividend by a third in recognition of its return to profitability this year and recent upgrades from credit rating agencies. The company's dividend, payable on January 15, is being raised to 20 cents a share from 15 cents a share. This is the first increase since Chrysler slashed the quarterly payment from 30 cents to 15 cents in the second quarter of 1991. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, warned, though, that the company remained intent on further reducing its pension fund deficit and building cash reserves, suggesting a cautious approach to future dividend increases. 'We are pleased with our recent operating results and credit upgrades and wanted to share this success with our shareholders,' said Mr Eaton. Stronger cashflow enabled Chrysler to make contributions of Dollars 2.6bn to its pension fund in the first nine months, helping to reduce the Dollars 3.9bn deficit reported at the end of 1992. Lower US interest rates mean that the fund's liabilities will be revised upwards at the end of this year, though Chrysler said the scale of the deficit will be below last year's level.</p>

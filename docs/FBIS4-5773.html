			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa said Saturday [9 April] the new administration  will put top priority on economic reforms and deregulation.    Addressing the opening session of the Trilateral Commission,  Hosokawa contended that his government has laid down the ground  work for deregulation since it came to power last August.    The commission is formed by 330 former political and  business  leaders from Japan, the United States and Europe to set forth  proposals on problems of common interest. It is chaired by  former U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.    The current session, which opened at a Tokyo hotel on  Saturday, is the commission's 25th general meeting.    Hosokawa announced Friday he will step down to take  responsibility for a stalemate in the Diet over his personal  problems, including a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin,  the scandal-tainted trucking group.    Referring to foreign criticism that Japan's markets are  closed to imports, Hosokawa said Japan should take positive  action to open its markets, regarding such criticism as an  expression of hope for an economic transformation. He said  promoting economic reform not only benefits the Japanese people  but is also Japan's international obligation.</p>

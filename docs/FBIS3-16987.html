U.S. Diktat </F> Encourages Japanese-Chinese Rapprochement"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar -- Is Clinton familiar with  Bismarck's advice to avoid wars "on two fronts"? That we do not  know, but it is a fact that Washington's nerve centers,  seriously believing in a "unipolar" world following the collapse  of the USSR, have been intent on picking fights with both China  and Japan of late, consequently finding themselves on the brink  of cold war simultaneously with the largest state and the most  highly developed state in the Asian-Pacific region.    This was a striking feature of Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to  Beijing. Of course, there was no direct evidence of any  anti-American slant to the rapprochement that was apparent here,  nor was that a possibility. It is indicative, though, that at a  joint press conference by the two states' heads of government,  Hosokawa vigorously supported China in its resistance to U.S.  diktat that is being applied under the banner of "protection of  human rights." The Japanese premier described the U.S. attempt  to impose its "values" on the countries of the Asian continent  as a mistake.    There was much to be read between the lines in a number of  his other speeches during his three-day stay in China. He said,  for example, that Japan has looked again in depth at the lessons  of the past and intends to shape its relationship with the PRC  in the spirit of friendship and cooperation with a view to the  future. He marveled at China's economic achievements and the  confidence of the Chinese in their future.    The words contained in the speeches by the guest and his  hospitable hosts in favor of a fair economic order appeared to  be indirectly addressed to Washington politicians who are using  economic sanctions in an attempt to intimidate both Japan and  China (which now faces the threat of losing is status of  most-favored nation in trade with the United States). Is all  this going to result in a further weakening of U.S. prestige in  the region?    In these conditions, further rapprochement promises a great  deal for Beijing and Tokyo. Japan is already China's number one  partner both in terms of trade and in terms of investments.  Further access to Japanese technological achievements could be  a major instrument of modernization for this giant state. China  represents for Japan a boundless market that can considerably  alleviate the consequences of potential U.S. trade sanctions.    If there is a further deepening of bilateral cooperation,  these two Asian powers could become in the future a kind of  political-economic "pole" no less powerful than the United  States coupled with NATO.</p>

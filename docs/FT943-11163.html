			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Observer: On his death bet What fascinates New York commodity futures traders more than the consumer price index? The health or otherwise of celebrated movie stars and politicians, apparently. The hundred members of the Great Beyond have been winning and losing money for the past couple of years according to the timing of the various big-name appointments with St Peter. It works like this. Each trader pays Dollars 10 up front to join, and a Dollars 5 monthly membership fee thereafter. He or she gets allocated a celebrity by picking names from a hat. Whoever's celebrity dies next scoops the pool. To qualify, the famous persons - ranging from Mother Theresa to Gene Kelly - have to be over 50 and not too well. Excitement is running high at the moment because 'no one' has died for three months so there is about Dollars 2,500 in the kitty.</p>

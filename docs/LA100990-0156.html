			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LENNON FANS 'IMAGINE' HIM ON 50TH BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered today as his song  "Imagine" was played simultaneously by radio stations for 1 billion people in  130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.  </P> <P> "A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is  reality.  </P> <P> Happy birthday, John. The world is better today for sharing a time with you,"  his widow, Yoko Ono, said at a U.N. ceremony before the playing of "Imagine."  </P> <P> The slain former Beatle himself issued a call for harmony in a taped message  that served as an introduction to the music.  </P> <P> "We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. . . . Think of your children.  Do you want them to be killed or don't you? And that's the choice we have in  front of us. War or peace," said Lennon, whose son, Sean, turned 15 today.  </P> <P> In Hollywood, about 50 people -- some holding candles and others carrying  birthday balloons -- stood near Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame on Vine  Street near the Capitol Records Building and listened to the "Imagine"  broadcast at 7 a.m.  </P> <P> Peacenik Jerry Rubin planned to join other activists later in the day for a  1960s-style "Give Peace and Our Environment a Chance" celebration at the trendy  Spice nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard.  </P></p>

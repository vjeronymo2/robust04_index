			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Arafat, May 21, IRNA -- Head of the Iranian hajj  pilgrims, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri said here  Friday [20 May] that U.S. is trying to target Iran for fear of  the globalization of Islam.    Reyshahri, who was addressing a large group of hajj  pilgrims,  said whether the enemies like it or not, they should know that  the Almighty's promise is true and Islam will eventually fill  the earth.    He referred to prayer as a strong weapon against the enemies  and said today is a day that one should pray for deliverance  from the enemy, especially for the immediate annihilation of the  U.S. and its mercenaries.    Reyshahri added: "To whom (other than God) should we  complain  that we cannot disavow polytheists and cannot chant death to the  criminal U.S. which commits crimes against Islam and Muslims?"    He censured those responsible for banning holding of the  rally against disbelievers and said "pilgrims intended to voice  their disavowal of polytheists at the ka'ba but were not allowed.    "We would complain to Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his  reappearance) to take our revenge."    Reyshahri said the pilgrims' silence made people in even the  remotest parts of the world aware of the real facts.    Saudi authorities last Monday forced the Iranian pilgrims to  cancel the scheduled rally despite earlier promises to allow its  holding.</p>

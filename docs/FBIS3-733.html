The Mozambican finance  minister was reacting to remarks by Mozambique National  Resistance leader Afonso Dhlakama that the [figure indistinct]  meticals paid to a common soldier lags far behind the cost of  living.    Minister Comiche noted that, in terms of the agreement,  demobilized soldiers are to receive six months salary  corresponding to their rank and demobilization date on the basis  of the salary system in force in the Mozambican Government Army.  The finance minister also noted that, in addition to the six  months paid by the government, over the next 18 months  demobilized soldiers will receive subsidies made available by  the international community.    He added that in the plan for the reintegration of  demobilized soldiers, the lowest figure is (?72,000) meticals  and the highest 600,000 meticals.</p>

Mr Charat said the order followed his  recent request to Laotian PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon  to open the checkpoints seven days a week.    Laotian border immigration checkpoints with Thailand earlier  opened from Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m to 5 p.m. and closed  every Sunday, he said. This forced tourists from the Thai side  who crossed the border on Saturday to come back the same day.  Checkpoints which worked on Sunday would enable tourists to stay  in Laos on Saturday night and return to Thailand the next day,  he said.    Laos has international immigration checkpoints with Thailand  at Vientiane (opposite Nong Khai), Bokeo (opposite Chiang Khong  district of Chiang Rai province) and Pakse (opposite Ubon  Ratchathani province).    These international checkpoints were ordered from February  16  to open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and temporary checkpoints were to  open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a 50 baht charge per tourist, Mr  Charat said.</p>

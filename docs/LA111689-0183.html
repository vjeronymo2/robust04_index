			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hammer Disregards Speculation: Occidental Petroleum's 91-year-old chairman,  Armand Hammer, has dismissed rumors that the Los Angeles-based firm might  become a takeover target upon his retirement or death, a company spokesman  said. Such speculation had driven the stock up on reports of Hammer's  hospitalization for insertion of a heart pacemaker last week, and the stock  closed up $1.50 at $30.125 Wednesday. Separately, the spokesman confirmed that  Occidental rejected two offers for its 51% stake in beef processor IBP Inc.  earlier this year and has no plans to sell its stake. The Dow Jones  Professional Investor Report estimated that one offer was about $1 billion.  </P></p>

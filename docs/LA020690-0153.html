			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH'S 1ST ECONOMIC MESSAGE SEES EVEN MORE GOOD TIMES  </P> <P> President Bush, proclaiming the United States in "excellent economic health,"  sent his first economic report to Congress today. He promised to restrain  government spending and push for tax cuts to foster even more prosperity.  </P> <P> Bush said he will continue his fight to get Congress to reduce the capital  gains tax and pledged anew to fight protectionist trade barriers.  </P> <P> His message did not dwell on what many see as the biggest failures of the  Reagan years -- the record federal budget deficits and the huge trade  imbalances that transformed America from the largest creditor nation to the  largest debtor country.  </P> <P> Bush did pledge to deal with "inherited problems," but his formula for dealing  with the budget deficit tracked Reagan's approach, promising to oppose new  taxes while relying on economic growth and restraints in government spending to  erase the deficit by 1993.  </P> <P> Many private economists say the Administration's economic outlook for the next  five years is too optimistic.  </P> <P> The Administration foresees no recession, with the gross national product  expanding at annual rates of 3% or higher from 1991 through 1995. "Economic  expansions . . . do not die of old age. A recession is not likely in the near  term," the economic report states.  </P> <P> While stressing traditional Republican free-market themes, the 419-page, annual  "Economic Report of the President" avoided some of the more doctrinaire  positions on monetary policy and supply-side economics sounded during the  Reagan years.  </P> <P> Instead, Bush used the message, the first presented by his Administration, to  lay out generally mainstream economic goals such as the need for  growth-oriented policies and renewed efforts to bring the federal deficit under  control.  </P> <P> On taxes, Bush said: "One of my highest legislative priorities this year is to  reduce the capital gains tax rate. This tax reform would promote risk-taking  and entrepreneurship by lowering the cost of capital. . . . A capital gains tax  cut would stimulate saving and investment throughout the economy."  </P> <P> "The primary economic goal of my Administration is to achieve the highest  possible rate of sustainable economic growth," Bush said in the report. "Growth  is the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of prosperity for  our children, to uplifting those most in need and to maintaining America's  leadership in the world."  </P> <P> Bush reviewed the period since the end of the 1981-82 recession, a peacetime  record of seven years of expansion. In that time, more than 20 million jobs  have been created, driving the unemployment rate down to a level not seen since  the early 1970s.  </P> <P> "Our excellent economic health will allow us to build on the successes of the  1980s as we prepare for the next century," Bush said.  </P> <P> Bush declared that his top trade priority is successful completion of the  current 96-nation round of trade talks. The President is seeking to eliminate  farm subsidies and expand trading opportunities in banking, insurance and other  service industries in which American firms excel.  </P> <P> "We cannot remain competitive by avoiding competition. My Administration will  therefore continue to resist calls for protection and managed trade," he said.  </P> <P> Bush also rejected proposals for the federal government to promote an  "industrial policy" of picking winners and losers among emerging technologies,  declaring that "second-guessing the market is the way to raise government  spending and taxes, not living standards."  </P> <P> While sometimes critical of the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate policies  in his first year in office, the President praised the central bank for a "high  degree of policy credibility."  </P> <P> In a departure from the monetarist leanings of the Reagan Administration,  Bush's economic outlook warned against a reliance on "rigid monetary  targeting," the process promoted by certain economists in which the central  bank focuses solely on controlling the growth of the nation's money supply as  the way to keep inflation at bay.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Framers present divided picture - Franchising has proved popular with budding entrepreneurs over the last decade. But Chris Tighe looks at what can happen when times get tough Business is brisk for Fastframe franchisee Paul Bell; his limited edition prints of Nigel Mansell in his Formula I racing car have proved a big seller and he is kept busy framing customers' war medals, photographs and embroidery. Bell's bustling Wakefield shop, kitted out in signature red, blue and grey, is one of 68 Fastframe franchised outlets, from Aberdeen to Yeovil and Belfast, all offering a quick framing service from well-located main street premises. In the shops, it is business as usual. But behind the scenes, the Fastframe network, one of the franchising success stories of the 1980s, is in cataclysm. Indeed, according to founder Ian Johnson: 'This is probably every franchisor's nightmare come true'. Last month Johnson, a former franchisor of the year, called in receivers Price Waterhouse to Fastframe Franchises, a north-east England-based company whose franchise network comprises 180 outlets in the US, controlled by a head franchisee, as well as 68 in the UK and one each in France and Japan. Fastframe, which grew rapidly in the late 1980s, had been hit by the onset of recession within months of its 1990 peak, when its UK franchise network reached 90 outlets. The end of the consumer spending boom put the brakes on the expansion which had annually increased the franchisor's income stream and also hit some franchisees' turnover, with knock-on effects on royalty payments. Some franchisees failed to pay royalties at all and some went out of business, leaving Fastframe with expensive leasehold property. The receivers immediately closed down most of the 21 shops in Fastframe's wholly-owned West Regent Art Frames chain. But they continued support services to the franchisees and advertised the franchise business for sale. Listed among its attractions were the 68 UK-franchised outlets and 'royalty and marketing income, circa Pounds 800,000 per annum in UK alone'. Many franchisees however, saw things rather differently. 'Slavery went out with Wilberforce,' says Grenville Salt, a former RAF air traffic controller who is the Leeds Fastframe franchisee. 'The receiver can sell Fastframe but they won't sell my business in it. I don't consider myself part of this franchise any more.' Salt and more than 40 other UK franchisees, all members of the Independent Fastframe Franchisees Association, maintain they are no longer bound by the 10-year agreement they each signed with Fastframe because, they say, the parent has failed for some time to deliver promised support services. 'There have been so many and such serious breaches of the agreement that in effect the franchisor has repudiated it,' alleges solicitor John Nelson-Jones, a partner in Field Fisher Waterhouse, who has been engaged by the IFFA to argue its members' case with the receiver. 'We have the situation where, so far as the franchisees whom I represent are concerned, he has nothing to sell.' Most franchisees paid between Pounds 26,000 and Pounds 55,000 to be set up by Fastframe in their business. Unlike many networks, dependent on the franchisor for the products they sell, Fastframe shops buy picture framing materials direct from a list of approved suppliers - a degree of autonomy which doubtless enhanced franchisees' belief they already run truly independent businesses. The 12.5 per cent annual royalties cover use of the name and concept, the provision of corporate supplies like headed notepaper and wrappings, support and marketing. IFFA chairman Barbara Cartmel, the Eastbourne franchisee, declined to spell out their criticisms at this stage, but IFFA member Alex Strother, the Middlesbrough franchisee, summarised their objective in one word: 'Freedom'. Bell, a former Fastframe franchisee of the year, and runner up in last year's British Franchise Association franchisee of the year award, is among those not in the IFFA. Like many franchisees, he thinks the parent company's marketing performance fell short but believes established franchisees should not forget the crucial role the franchisor plays in setting them on the business ladder. 'The problem with franchising is there are a lot of people who want the proprietors' profit with the manager's responsibility,' he says. Johnson rejects the disillusioned franchisees' criticisms. 'It's very easy to be disgruntled when the company goes into receivership. They know the system now; we've taught them how to do it and operate it.' Franchisees trying to break away are understood to range from those running highly successful businesses to some for whom the 12.5 per cent royalty payment means the difference between survival and collapse. Many have paid their royalties in full; a handful, says receiver Ed James, owe Fastframe 'an awful lot of money'. When Fastframe went into receivership, it was already involved in a dispute with its head franchisee in the US. The UDI declaration by the majority of UK franchisees has, says James, inevitably frightened off prospective purchasers. If the franchisor ceases trading, the 68 franchisees look set to continue in business; but under what name? James considers those arguing they are no longer bound by their agreement should not continue using the Fastframe name but that others could do so. Bell, whose turnover is increasing, despite the recession, is confident about the future of his expanding business whatever happens to the parent company. The ability of franchisees to continue trading well, even after a franchisor collapses, is, says BFA director Brian Smart, one of franchising's strengths. Smart says Fastframe's problems underline the danger for franchisors of franchisees withholding royalties, termed 'management services fees' by the BFA. The franchisor, he says, must act forcibly to prevent this but ally that with providing services which will enable franchisees to boost trade and meet their commitment. The Fastframe case, he says, also demonstrates the need for the franchisor to communicate his continuing importance within the network to established franchisees. Johnson, now concentrating on his own printing business and the three Fastframe shops he owns in Newcastle, is non-committal at present about whether he would become a franchisor again. 'It's a bit like asking a boxer who's just lost a major bout if he'd go in and box again. You have to wait till the morning when the wounds start to heal.'</p>

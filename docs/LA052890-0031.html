			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA CHALLENGES COLORADO AIRPORT'S BAN ON AFTER-DUSK LANDINGS BY PRIVATE PLANES;  </P> <P> AERONAUTICS: ASPEN-PITKIN COUNTY OFFICIALS CALL THE CURFEW A SAFETY MEASURE.  THE FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS IT IS UNFAIR. FUNDING IS AT STAKE.  </P> <P> It's been a good many years now, but Rick Davis can't shake the chill he gets  when recalling that one particular descent into the Aspen-Pitkin County  Airport.  </P> <P> It was past dusk, and Davis, having threaded through a forest of snowcapped  peaks, was maneuvering his small plane down the curvy Roaring Fork Valley  toward the runway. Suddenly, the darkness thickened, and Davis could not  distinguish the mountains from the dancing shadows.  </P> <P> "I got a distorted perception of the terrain," he remembered. There was "this  terrible claustrophobic feeling, like everything was narrowing in on me."  </P> <P> Davis, now acting manager of the airport, touched down safely minutes later.  But many others meet a different fate. Pitkin County, a region of towering  peaks, plunging valleys and schizophrenic wind currents, is littered with the  rusting carcasses of planes whose pilots were outmatched by the unforgiving  conditions.  </P> <P> Pitkin County officials long ago barred private planes from landing in their  treacherous neck of the woods after dark. The curfew, they say, is a vital  safety shield both for inexperienced pilots and for residents in the flight  path as well.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration, however, doesn't see it that way. In a  mushrooming battle being watched by aeronautical groups nationwide, the FAA has  concluded that the curfew discriminates against general aviation pilots and has  ordered Pitkin County to do away with the restriction.  </P> <P> Federal officials say the curfew is unfair because it allows commercial  airlines to land until 11 p.m. while banning private planes 30 minutes after  sunset. Unless the landing time is equalized, Pitkin County will lose FAA  funding for future airport construction projects and may be sued for $11  million in federal money spent over the past 20 years, the agency has warned.  </P> <P> "What we want is for them to treat all aircraft alike," said Mitch Barker,  spokesman for the FAA's regional office in Seattle.  </P> <P> Conceding that they have a David-and-Goliath war on their hands, Piktin County  commissioners nonetheless are determined to persuade the FAA to make an  apparently unprecedented finding that safety considerations mandate a different  standard for different aircraft.  </P> <P> "We realize we're breaking some new ground, but we believe the FAA has erred in  assuming that this is a safe airport for any pilot, whether it's a doctor  flying in for vacation from Wichita or a commercial pilot with 10 years of  experience," Commissioner Wayne Ethridge said. "If you accept the FAA's logic,  you'd have to conclude that anyone who drives a car could drive in the Indy  500."  </P> <P> Because of its famed ski slopes, Aspen draws a steady flood of private pilots  vacationing with their families. Many of these so-called "flatlanders" are  unfamiliar with mountain navigation and unaware of the altitude's effect on the  performance of their aircraft, local pilots said.  </P> <P> Between 1980 and 1988, 22 plane crashes, claiming 20 lives, occurred in Aspen  or the immediate vicinity, according to the National Transportation Safety  Board. On April 27 of this year, a single-engine Cherokee carrying six  passengers slammed into the Continental Divide 11 miles from town. No one  survived. Nearly all of the wrecks involved general aviation craft.  </P> <P> "Maps of the accidents look like people have taken a pepper shaker and  sprinkled it all over the mountains," said John McBride, an Aspen businessman  and veteran pilot who is on the county's air-rescue team. "Probably 95% of  those accidents were caused by pilot error."  </P> <P> The FAA has been aware of the Aspen curfew for years, but took no action  against the county until receiving complaints from two organizations of general  aviation pilots -- the National Business Aircraft Assn., which represents  corporate aviation, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Assn. The curfew, these  groups told the FAA, is unfair.  </P> <P> "It's pure discrimination, and we won't take it," said E.H. Haupt, manager of  airport and environmental services for the NBAA in Washington. Haupt conceded  that Aspen "has an interesting approach" that is "not for a flatlander," but  argued that "our people are just as qualified as those on the commercial  carriers to get in there."  </P> <P> In a stern letter in March, the FAA warned Pitkin County to eliminate the  discriminatory curfew. If the county refused, it could say goodby to future FAA  funding and risk a lawsuit forcing repayment of millions used in recent years  for runway lighting, navigational aids and other improvements.  </P> <P> In response, Pitkin County officials are considering equalizing the curfew at  10 p.m. for both commercial and private planes. That prospect, however, has  angered Continental Express and United Express airlines, the two carriers that  service the ski town.  </P> <P> Aspen residents, meanwhile, have urged the commission to stand firm, with rock  musician Don Henley, who owns a home in town, reportedly coughing up money for  the fight. The support is not surprising. Many locals remember well the time a  plane plunked down in the midst of the Brush Creek subdivision, killing four  people. And few have forgotten that just last year a Federal Express pilot  crashed into the hillside a whisker away from the exclusive Red Mountain  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Many local aviators, noting that they avoid flying into Aspen at night, endorse  the curfew. Realtor and pilot Kent Kelly, however, says, "an imprudent pilot  can kill himself during the daylight hours just as easily (as at night), and  it's not the county commissioners' job to legislate against that possibility."  </P> <P> "I believe the curfew hurts tourism here, in addition to being blatantly  discriminatory," said Kelly, who accused the commissioners of using safety as a  smoke screen for their true intention -- to keep a lid on air traffic.  </P> <P> In the end, county officials predict the dispute may well wind up in court.  County Manager Reid Haughey realizes the odds of prevailing are poor, but  figures it's time somebody challenged the mighty FAA.  </P> <P> "This isn't Lawrence, Kan. What the FAA is protecting here is the legal right  of any private pilot to splatter himself on the side of the mountain," Haughey  said. "Well, we don't think much of that argument."  </P> <P> Times researcher Ann Rovin in Denver contributed to this story.  </P></p>

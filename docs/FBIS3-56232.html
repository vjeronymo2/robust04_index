He told Interfax that the meeting of chief negotiators that  ended in Riga Wednesday was "productive."    That meeting was delayed until Latvia apologized for the  incident of January 10 when Latvian territorial troops blocked  numerous buildings belonging to the Russian Army in the Latvian  capital and held two Russian generals handcuffed for hours  before releasing them by order of Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis.    In the words of Zotov, the provocation against the Russian  troops on the day when the Russian delegation stayed in Riga  unexpectedly facilitated the Russo-Latvian talks.    He said that a broad understanding was reached on the legal  status of the Russian radar station in the village of Skrunda  and an agreement on the deadline for its closure seems possible.    The Russian delegation which had insisted on keeping the  station under Russian control for six years agreed to reduce  that time to five years. The Latvian authorities had wanted the  station dismantled in three years.    Zotov added that Latvian Prime Minister Birkavs had also  noted the success of the talks when the two men met on January  12. Birkavs said then that the Latvian government would do its  best to prevent activities that could have a negative impact on  the bilateral relations and obstruct the talks between Russia  and Latvia.    The two men agreed that efforts must be redoubled to draft  the agreements and create a legal basis for normal development  of the Russo-Latvian relations.</p>

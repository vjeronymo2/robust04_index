			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Congress moves to end rail strike THE US Congress was yesterday working on emergency legislation to end a potentially crippling nationwide rail strike. The American Association of Railroads said the strike, which began yesterday morning, was affecting freight traffic across the country and that picketing was widespread. Congressional leaders, who hope to be able to send a bill to President George Bush by today, have been meeting administration officials and their staff into the early hours this week in an attempt to avert the stoppage, which is thought likely to cost about Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) a day in its initial stages. The strike, by 10 unions representing about 250,000 workers, comes after three years' effort to agree on wages, workers' health care costs and the size of work crews. The railways want to increase productivity by eliminating what they consider outdated and outmoded work rules. Mr Samuel Skinner, transportation secretary, warned that a prolonged stoppage would impair national defence and have a disastrous effect on the economy. If it continued, the strike would ultimately cost Dollars 1bn a day as more industries were forced to lay off workers, he said. The administration sought to head off the strike last May by establishing a three-man presidential emergency board to recommend a settlement. Similar boards have provided the basis for settlement in at least three strikes in the industry in the past decade. The board recommended pay rises averaging between 3 and 4 per cent a year over the next three years. However it also called for changes in work practices broadly in line with management demands and said workers should shoulder a higher proportion of health care costs, which the unions rejected. One option being discussed in talks between Congress and the administration was a 100-day 'cooling off' period. A day could make the difference Page 6 US bonds rally as strike bites Page 32</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Lib Dems attack 'politics of pique' The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Clarke of 'demonstrating the politics of pique'. Mr Malcolm Bruce, the party's treasury spokesman, said that Mr Clarke's decision to replace one tax increase with three 'demonstrates the enthusiasm with which the Tory party now increases taxes'. Mr Bruce said the gap in the Budget could have been filled by cutting spending on consultants and advertising. He said: 'This pain and anguish could have been avoided if you had only listened to the people in the first place.' Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, said the mini-Budget had 'replaced one anti-Scottish tax of VAT on fuel with two anti-Scottish taxes on petrol and on whisky'.</p>

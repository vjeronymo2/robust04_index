			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Since 14 May, Peter Weiss, first deputy chairman  of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [and chairman of  the Party of the Democratic Left, PDL] and Milan Ftacnik, [PDL]  deputy of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, have been  on a working visit to the U.S. capital. In an interview granted  to our Washington correspondent Peter Susko, they assessed their  agenda of yesterday, which was their first full working day, and  the results of talks they had with U.S. representatives.    [Begin recording] [Weiss] We met Senator Claiborne Pell,  chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, who has great  affinity for Slovakia. After the liberation, he was the first  U.S. consul to Slovakia. He has a reputation of being both a  defender and an advocate of Slovak interests. [passage omitted]  Pell's interest centered first and foremost on the position of  minorities and on their representation in the Slovak parliament.  [passage omitted]    [Ftacnik] The fact that Senator Pell received our delegation  testifies to the importance the U.S. side attaches to our  working trip to the United States of America. Of the other  meetings we have had, I would like to mention the meeting with  Department of State representatives in charge of the Slovak  Republic and our discussion with experts on Central and East  Europe on the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has transpired that  the representatives of the U.S. Administration realize the role  the Party of the Democratic Left is playing and could be playing  in Slovak politics even after the early parliamentary elections.  That is why they showed interest in our policies and positions  on the key issues of Slovak domestic and foreign policy. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Lenders warn on mortgage aid cuts Mortgage lenders are today stepping up their campaign against the prospect of cuts in government home-loan assistance for people on income support by identifying those who would be hit. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies and other lenders, says that the effect of cuts would be to increase mortgage arrears and repossessions. On the basis of speculation that the top limit for which a home loan would be eligible for the state payments might be cut from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 90,000, the lenders conclude that more than 200,000 mortgage-holders would run a higher risk of having their homes repossessed. It has already warned that if the government chooses one of the other options being considered - basing income-support payments on a 'standard' interest rate which is less than the mortgage interest due - then lenders will not keep to the deal agreed with the government almost three years ago to help solve the problem. It says this would lead to greater pressures on the social housing budget, affecting both the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations resumed this morning in Cairo. The objective of  these negotiations is to remove the obstacles that are hindering  the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza and  Jericho. Some progress has been made in the Civilian Affairs  Committee meetings, but the negotiations continue to go around  in an empty circle.    Responsible Palestinian sources said that the obstacles,  which are considered the responsibility of the Security Affairs  Committee, consist basically of a matter of phrasing because the  two delegations are currently writing up the general agreement.  This is why they have returned to the issues they had discussed  in the previous negotiations, whether in Taba or in Cairo.    The same sources said that the Civilian Affairs and Legal  Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later today.    The Palestinian sources noted that some progress has been  made in the meetings of the Civilian Affairs Committee.  Agreement has been reached over transferring the water  authority, as well as over the basic principles of  communications and radio frequencies for security and civilian  purposes.    The Palestinian and Israeli negotiators had agreed during  their negotiations in Taba within the framework of the Civilian  Affairs Committee to set up two Palestinian television stations.  MENA has learned that there are basic obstacles facing the  course of the Security and Legal Affairs Committees.    Regarding the Legal Affairs Committee, the Palestinian side  rejects the paper Israel submitted at the end of the last round  on the legal jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy  authorities, as well as the definition of who is Israeli and how  to apply the law on such a person if he commits a crime in the  Palestinian autonomy areas, and what happens if foreigners  commit crimes in these areas.    The sources added that if Israel does not accept the legal  jurisdiction of the Palestinian autonomy, this means that in  practical terms the Palestinian sovereignty over these areas  becomes null and void.    The Palestinian sources pointed out that with respect to the  Security Affairs Committee, the negotiations continue to revolve  in an empty circle of arguments and counter-arguments regarding  the security of the settlements, joint patrols on the lateral  roads, and the agricultural land around the settlements which  Israel wants to annex to these settlements under security  pretexts. This means that the Palestinians will abandon around  47 percent of their territories and their security  responsibilities between the autonomy areas in Gaza and Jericho  on the one hand, and Israel on the other.    Palestinian sources in the Security Affairs Committee have  described the negotiations as complicated. They address all  issues that are raised in every round.    According to the same sources, going back to these issues  forms part of the framework of formulating the general agreement.    The same Palestinian sources said that General Amnon Shahaq,  Israeli deputy chief of staff and head of the Israeli  delegation, was forced to leave Cairo yesterday evening for  Israel to inform Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres of the course of the negotiations  and the results they have reached so far. This comes before the  expected meeting on Thursday and Friday in Bucharest between  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres.    In another development, sources from the Palestinian  delegation denied that Israel has gone back on its promise to  release 5,000 of the 10,400 Palestinian detainees, as was  announced at the end of last week's round of negotiations.    Some sources had mentioned that Israel wants to release only  4,000 detainees instead of the 5,000.    The same sources believe that the Palestinian side is still  negotiating to release all the Palestinian detainees within a  general and comprehensive amnesty on Israel's part so that a  basis of mutual confidence between the Palestinian and the  Israeli people can be established.    The Palestinian sources mentioned that Israel is currently  refusing to release the Hamas detainees who carried out  operations against the Israeli authorities after signing the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September in  Washington. They also refuse to release those who have carried  out operations killing Israelis.    On the other hand, other diplomatic sources believe that the  announcement by Hamas that it is ready to recognize Israel on  condition that it withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip  removes all Israeli settlements, and that it hold real elections  for the Palestinians, comes after the three operations Hamas  carried out in Israel in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in Hebron.    These sources believe that these operations were a political  message to start political dialogue with Israel after Hamas has  realized the importance of taking part in the political process  from inside the Palestinian political institution, not from  outside.    The same sources said that this proves the honesty and  soundness of the PLO's political course.</p>

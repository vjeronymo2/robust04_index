			<p>BFN     [Text] Bacolod City -- A ranking New People's Army (NPA)  official has confirmed that priest-turned-rebel Frank Fernandez  has assumed leadership of the pro-Sison forces in Negros.    The rejectionist group of rebels under Arturo Tabara,  however, described the leadership of Fernandez as "fake" and  said it is not recognized by the NPA forces in Negros.    Fernandez is the secretary general of the National  Democratic  Front.    Estelito Dioquino, former NPA commander of Southern Negros,  claimed majority of the NPA forces in Negros are supporters of  the rejectionist group under Tabara, alias Victor del Mar,  Communist Party of the Philippines Visayas Commission chairman.</p>

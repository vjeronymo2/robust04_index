			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Bonn and Paris talk tactics CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, met in Bonn yesterday to prepare their positions for Friday's EC summit in Birmingham - and firmly rejected any suggestion of a 'two-speed' European Community, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. As officials in Bonn denied any part in preparation of plans for an inner-core fast track Community, the two heads of government insisted that they were still determined to gain ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European Union by all 12 member states - including Denmark and Britain. Mr Kohl is involved in a hectic round of preparatory talks for the summit, along with Mr Klaus Kinkel, who flew last night to Paris for a dinner with Mr Roland Dumas, his French counterpart, and Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister. Today Mr Kinkel will fly to Brussels for a working dinner with Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission. German officials are at pains to stress that all the official activity does not amount to a specific German 'initiative', but is rather part of a concerted effort by all member states to find common ground on a political declaration from the Birmingham summit, designed to reassure all their electorates about the Maastricht process. One element in that process is the German plan for increased enforcement of 'subsidiarity' in EC decision-making, as well as ideas for greater transparency in the whole EC process.</p>

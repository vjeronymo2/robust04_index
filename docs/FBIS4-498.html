			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Pretoria April 9 SAPA -- The National  Intelligence Service [NIS] on Saturday [9 April] strongly denied  a published report saying its members "might" be linked to the  sale of arms by electricity supply giant Eskom to the kwaZulu  Police. The WEEKEND STAR reported members of the NIS "might be  linked to Eskom's sale of arms to the kwaZulu Police. [passage  omitted]    But on Saturday the NIS said in a statement the Service  strongly denied it was in any way involved. It regretted the  publication of the report, especially after the reporter  concerned had been provided with the "correct facts". The NIS  was to refer the matter to the Media Council in light of the  newspaper's treatment of the Service, said the statement. It  added that because of the sensitivity concerning the  availability of weapons in South Africa, the NIS was also to  approach the Goldstone Commission in an attempt to establish if  there had been any bad faith (kwader trou) attempt to involve  the NIS in the matter.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE GREENING OF SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT TAKES ROOT  </P> <P> Dawna Knotts, a credit reporter for a San Diego mortgage company, had taken a  few small steps toward acting on her environmentalist ideals. The young, native  San Diegan regularly recycled her leftover food into fertilizer for her  back-yard garden, and quietly encouraged fellow workers to stop using Styrofoam  cups for their coffee.  </P> <P> But Knotts wanted to do more. So did Daniel Tarr, a 34-year-old glass artist in  El Cajon, who had tried and failed to find a place for his ecological and  political philosophies in Democratic and Republican circles.  </P> <P> Then, about two years ago, the Green movement emerged in San Diego. And today,  amid the Green of giddily ambitious college students, artists on the fringe,  never-say-die '60s activists and white-collar professionals, Knotts and Tarr  have found gentle strength for their convictions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Kind of a Loaner'  </P> <P> "I always argued for environmental causes, but never made too big of a stand. I  was always kind of a loner," said Knotts, 21. "The Greens opened my door."  </P> <P> Knotts and Tarr, like at least 100 other San Diegans, have found their niche in  Greenness. For them the local and the U.S. movement, born in 1984 of the strong  Green Party influence in Europe and fueled by a growing public awareness of  ecological issues, is not just another environmental sounding board.  </P> <P> So far, it has been a chance to plant trees in East San Diego, publish  brochures on local groceries' food quality and help develop a sewage-recycling  plant in Tijuana (and push the concept as a comprehensive water plan for San  Diego).  </P> <P> Later, it could mean developing a Greens TV news show and collecting support  for a 1990 state initiative that seeks to elect California politicians  </P> <P> by proportional representation rather than the current winner-take-all system.  </P> <P> And while it is not yet a registered political party in the United States, the  Green movement already has begun to stir talk of a Green national agenda and  potential Green influence on local and state elections.  </P> <P> "It's a mistake to say the Greens are just an ecology party. That's only part  of it," Tarr said. "We see ecological issues tied into other issues, like  economics. We see everything as being interconnected."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interconnection of Problems  </P> <P> The Green movement, San Diego Greens explain, examines the social, economic and  political aspects of ecological problems, and how social problems like poverty  relate to the environment. It is neither right nor left but forward, they say,  adding that it espouses philosophy and practices reality.  </P> <P> "That's what sets us apart," Tarr said, matter-of-factly. "We're different, and  that's where Greens hold the key to future politics."  </P> <P> Such definitions only vaguely answer the question, "Just who are the Greens?"  But Knotts, Tarr and other San Diego Greens may be better at showing than  telling.  </P> <P> At a Greens meeting last Tuesday, 13 people (of a dues-paying membership of  100), most young -- 20s to mid-30s -- and all Caucasian, gathered in a  makeshift garage near San Diego State University to discuss the weekly agenda.  Many took off their shoes, offered introductions and shared several moments of  silence (reflection, not prayer), while a friendly tomcat wandered in and out  of the meeting.  </P> <P> An open forum for thought and action is intrinsic to Green operations, members  say. In fact, decisions are made by consensus. "If someone has a serious,  fundamental philosophical problem with an issue, then he can actually block" a  majority opinion, Tarr said.  </P> <P> Steve Saint, a young free-lance writer, agreed to be the "facilitator" of the  meeting. Two others volunteered to take notes and keep time. Although  discussion was informal, Saint rigidly followed the agenda and the clock.  Afterward, upon a suggestion by a member, all stood, linked arms and offered  comments on the meeting.  </P> <P> Greens shun leadership, hierarchy and pigeonholing. Instead, members say, they  rotate key positions and seek diversity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Ideological Purity'  </P> <P> "There's no ideological purity to Green organization now, and that's one of the  things about it that's appealing," said Jerry Russell, a 33-year-old engineer  and newly elected member of the Rancho Bernardo planning board. His wife,  Janet, a former lab technician with degrees in chemistry and physics, also is a  Green.  </P> <P> "If we all thought alike, that probably would mean there was somebody telling  us what to think," Russell said. "And right now, there's nobody telling the  Greens what to think."  </P> <P> Greens are so disdainful of centralized power that a local committee will split  when its membership exceeds several dozen. Just a few weeks ago, members of the  original committee, the Greens of San Diego, splintered off to form the Ocean  Beach Greens. Another subdivision may occur in the near future, when Russell  and others try to form a North County Greens group.  </P> <P> Ocean Beach Greens "sympathize with" the Greens of San Diego, but take no  direction from them, said Pete Dustrud, a free-lance photographer and  co-founder of the former. The new group, with about 12 members so far, has  activities and ambitions of its own.  </P> <P> Two members have opened the Green Store, an independent clearinghouse for  information about the Greens and other political and environmental groups.  Dustrud publishes "All Together Green," a local journal. Members have begun  pushing for a recycling program in Ocean Beach, and participated in recent  Greenpeace demonstrations at the harbor over whale and dolphin killing. And  besides getting the word out about the Green movement and its issues, Ocean  Beach members are helping to coordinate a demonstration against the Exxon  Valdez when it docks here this month).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Future  </P> <P> Additionally, members are considering sponsoring a candidate for local  elections in the fall, Dustrud said. The idea is so new to the group that they  haven't identified which offices they may run for.  </P> <P> Individuals "will have to take the initiative, if they want to seek office,"  said Dustrud. "But we'd like to see a Green platform developed. We'd like to  get some people involved."  </P> <P> But while Ocean Beach Greens are considering running a candidate in immediate  elections, San Diego Greens have dismissed the idea, arguing that with  virtually no chance of winning, they would simply gain a reputation for losing.  Instead, San Diego Greens are mulling over the idea of screening the candidates  in upcoming fall elections and publicizing a list of those whom they support.  </P> <P> That potential problem may be evidence of a larger dilemma: how to form a  unified Green policy on major issues while maintaining independence and  diversity among local committees.  </P> <P> "The basic values are shared by all Greens," said Tarr, citing the four pillars  of the Green movement: ecological wisdom, economic justice, nonviolence and  grass-roots democracy. "But beyond that, there's a lot of room for different  ideas. In our group, the debate ranges from what's the ideal solution to what  is doable. We decide which position is most Green."  </P> <P> Local Greens, aware that their membership is mostly white and middle-class,  acknowledge that attracting diversity -- particularly ethnic minorities -- to  its membership will be a priority. But they maintain that their economic,  political and social issues, all with ecological roots, involve, and thus can  appeal to, everyone.  </P> <P> "There are things all of us have in common. All communities want to breathe  clean air, eat good food and drink clean water," Tarr said. "There must be a  lot of people who share these values who don't know where to convert their  energies."  </P> <P> Dustrud added: "Saving the Earth means we're going to need everybody. We need  all these different groups and all these ideas to come together.  </P> <P> "Because the whole world," he concluded, "needs the Greens."  </P></p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: McDonnell poised for market with Pounds 250m tag McDonnell Information Services, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services company, will float on the main market next month through a placing and intermediaries offer to raise a net Pounds 107.4m. Of the funds raised, Pounds 73m will be used to repay borrowings arising out of last year's management buy-out from McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group, and Pounds 34.4m will be used to redeem preference shares. The pathfinder document was published this morning. Impact day will be March 8; the latest time and date for receipt of applications is 10am on March 17 and dealings will begin on March 24. The flotation is expected to value the company at about Pounds 250m. The pathfinder shows the value of the management buy-out as Pounds 121m; the management team - consisting of certain directors and senior employees - invested a total of Pounds 963,269 for 15.5 per cent of the company's equity. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said this week that he would not be selling his stake in the company. On February 4 this year the company had cash balances and short-term deposits of Pounds 13m, having repaid borrowings of Pounds 8.4m, restructuring charges of Pounds 5.3m, and interest of Pounds 3.5m since the buy-out. MDIS generated operating profits of Pounds 22.3m in 1993 on revenues of Pounds 148.5m, compared with Pounds 19.1m on Pounds 158.6m the year before. Revenues have been shrinking as the company has moved away from hardware towards the more profitable software and services. Operating margins, however, have grown from 10.4 per cent to 15 per cent in the past three years. The flotation will be one of the largest in the information technology sector for some years. MDIS specialises in open or industry standard systems for niche markets, with growth potential including central and local government, the police and the emergency services. Last year it spent Pounds 17.6m - or 11.8 per cent of turnover - on research and development.</p>

The Musan mining complex, a leading production base of iron  headings, has lifted production to a high mark in February after  topping the January plan.    The complex hit the January target of iron headings three  days ahead of schedule. In the period, it removed overburden  more than double the amount in the same period toward the end of  last year and secured 1.2 million more tons of crude ore.    The Tokchon district coal mining complex surpassed the first  day's quota by far entering the new month. The complex  overfulfilled the plan for last month 2.4 percent in capital  tunelling, 20.9 percent in preparatory tunelling and 1.2 percent  in coal production.    The Sunchon district coal mining complex, the Pyongyang  thermal power complex, the Nakwon machine complex, the combined  general bureau of shoemaking industry and the Korea silk  association are boosting production from the first day of  February after surpassing their January targets.    The Pyongyang silk mill topped the January plan for silk  yarn  50 percent, strongly backing the silk textile producers in  increasing production.</p>

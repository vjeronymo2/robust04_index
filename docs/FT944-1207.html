			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Monsanto shares fall after it buys Merck unit Monsanto, the US chemicals company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.07bn for a specialty chemicals subsidiary of Merck which will have sales this year of only about Dollars 300m. Fears that Monsanto was paying too much sent its shares down Dollars 6 1/8 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. However, they rallied slightly to close at Dollars 68 7/8 , a loss of Dollars 4. The decline also reflected market concerns that the company was shifting its attention away from cutting costs. Monsanto said it would use cash and debt to buy Kelco, a company which makes stabilising and gelling agents for food and industrial products. The sale is the last in a series of planned disposals of non-core businesses announced by Merck in August. 'It's a great business, but the price is way too high,' said Mr Paul Raman, a chemicals analyst at S. G. Warburg in New York. Monsanto was paying about Dollars 150m too much for the company, or Dollars 1.50 a share, based on Kelco's estimated earnings before tax, interest and amortisation of Dollars 120m, he said. Monsanto said the transaction would be beneficial financially.</p>

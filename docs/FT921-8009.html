			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (5): It's all a gamble in Macao - Bets of all kinds: whether at the crowded races in Hong Kong or in the round-the-clock casinos of the neighbouring colony of Macao, the Cantonese show their love for money and taking risks. But few get rich, says Angus Foster THEY stop talking. There is time for one last drag on a cigarette which is then tossed below into the melee of shuffling feet, fast-food cartons and crumpled newspapers listing triangles of numbers. The crowd pours down another step, urged forward by latecomers who have sweated anxiously in front of betting booths, wishing the queue would hurry, watching the clock count down towards the off. 'Race Number 6 in 2 minutes' flashes across the giant electronic scoreboard listing its own triangle of numbers, the odds for the next race. Blinking at the bottom are totals betted on the race, win, place, tierce and quinella. The figure passes HKDollars 100m and the crowd cheers. This is Hong Kong racing: 50,000 people jammed into high rise stands in Happy Valley, the tight bends of the track illuminated by floodlights and the stadium, this amphitheatre of Mammon, dwarfed by surrounding tower blocks. The whole operation mixes avarice and enlightened despotism. Last year Hong Kong people gambled more than HKDollars 47bn on horses, equal to the GDP of Sri Lanka. Most of it is paid back as dividends. But few get rich. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, purveyor of the colonial monopoly for supplying this gambling opiate, donates the surplus to charity and makes it all seem respectable. The slick sophistication of the game, and the exceptional facilities, should make the Jockey Club in the 'home country' blush and provide strong arguments in favour of doing away with bookies. It is all slightly seedy, too. Leading trainers and jockeys, eulogised in the press, are regular visitors to the colony's courts, some playing lead roles and bit parts in sex scandals and race fixing jaunts. But all is forgotten come the next meeting when attention turns to the racing pages and jockey, horse, raceform and trainer are rolled into one, a blinking number, calling like Sirens from the giant scoreboard. Hong Kong's preoccupation with gambling is often sneered at: 'expats' feign contempt for a Cantonese love of money, forgetting they themselves are usually in Hong Kong for little else. But the contempt also masks envy. At the races or in the casinos of the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macao, it is the ability to go to the edge, to stare ruin in the face, to experience that level of risk, which is most admired. This is a human condition, not unique to Hong Kong or the southern Chinese. The difference is that in Hong Kong, an immigrant society facing the fears of 1997  - when all bets could be off  - life itself contains risks with which most would be uncomfortable. While this man gambles with his savings on the tables, that man is gambling with his marriage by emigrating to Canada for a foreign passport, leaving behind his wife and family. Or take that one, the young guy in a suit beside you in the street: maybe he is gambling with his career, chucking it in for a fast-buck job to try and get ahead in case, or before, things go wrong. And the rest? There is the hope. Like the mainland Chinese tourist who last year won close to Pounds 1m on a one-armed-bandit in Macao. Or the Hong Kong man who backed a triple for HKDollars 4m. There is always the hope. Macao also has a race track, gleaming new on Taipa island, the brain child of Taiwanese businessmen. They had the vision of beaming racing from Macao 'live' to Taiwan, another immigrant Chinese community, once its ban on gambling was lifted. But the project failed to attract enough punters from Hong Kong, so it was rescued by Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's gambling king, and his friends. Mr Ho could well afford it: he is reckoned to own about one quarter of STDM, the jealous guardian of Macau's gambling monopoly which pays more than HKDollars 2bn in taxes each year. The casinos stay open around the clock. At each table the faces are familiar, mainly working class Hong Kong people of varying ages. Families, here for an hour on a day out, mix with veteran gamblers who will be here tomorrow morning. Faces are lit by the hope, all eyes fixed on the card, ball or button. When a game is over, the eyes look up and meet, sharing in each other's communion. Macao was overtaken by history when its harbour silted up and the British moved 50 miles east across the Pearl River Delta to Hong Kong in 1841. The Portuguese stayed behind and Macao has kept a Mediterranean tempo. Amidst its walled villas and scented gardens, or standing among the crumbling Catholic cathedral, there are few echoes of Hong Kong's intensity and drive. Hong Kong views Macao rather like a relative who has fallen on hard times. Macao's plans for a new airport, port and industrial zones are seen as quaint but inconsequential, being dwarfed by Hong Kong's own projects. But both colonies face the same future. Macau is to be handed back to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, two years after Hong Kong. To them both, Peking has given the same specious of promises of 'a high degree of autonomy' in internal affairs. While the red Chinese flag flutters discreetly in Hong Kong, it drapes a casual arrogance in Macao. Except for a period of ugly tension during China's Cultural Revolution, relations with the Portuguese have been better than with Britain. China's wishes are rarely questioned in Macao. Every evening, the coterie of gamblers and tourists heads for home strapped-in aboard jetfoils, also courtesy of Mr Ho and his friends, which ply the 45-minute route to Hong Kong. The craft buzz across the South China Sea like sea planes unable to quite lift above the water. On board there is time for one more gamble. A salesgirl walks the lines of passengers and sells 'scratch and see' lottery tickets. She seems bored. Few people risk their cash on the way home. She is peddling the hope, offering one last fix before return to Hong Kong. There, life is less immediate than gambling, and it will take several years to know if the bets have paid off.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / NZ bank inquiry could kill Pounds 450m bid THE National Australia Bank will consider calling off its NZDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 478m) takeover bid for the Bank of New Zealand if there is a full public investigation of the bank, Mr Don Argus, NAB's chief executive said yesterday. He was responding to rising calls for an inquiry into the bank's operations and alleged secret deals between 1986 and 1991, when it had required taxpayer support. The Securities Commission is due to meet today to review its previous decision that there is no need for an investigation. Mr Argus said similar inquiries into Australian banks had been costly and debilitating and such an inquiry had the potential to severely damage BNZ's franchise in New Zealand. The campaign for an inquiry began late last year following the sacking of Mr Winston Peters, the former minister of Maori Affairs, who has become an arch critic of the government. He has since released a steady stream of leaked documents in parliament, alleging misdemeanors by the bank's directors and others. On Monday, Mr Lindsay Pyne, the BNZ's chief executive, said Mr Peters' allegations were 'unsubstantiated, opportunistic, and self serving' and that he had produced no new Evidence. Mr Pyne said alleged improper underwriting fees had been fully disclosed, improper lending was in fact proper, insider trading claims had been rejected by the Securities Commission, tax scams allegations had been rejected by the Inland Revenue, claims of falsified accounts were completely wrong, and altered audit report claims were 'sheer fantasy'. The New Zealand government recorded a deficit of NZDollars 2.53bn (Pounds 807m) in the year to June 30, compared with a forecast NZDollars 3.16bn, writes Terry Hall. Interest rates fell and the exchange rate firmed following yesterday's announcement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "State Duma Recommends"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday the State Duma adopted a decree  recommending that the government examine within five days the  question of the conditions for the functioning of the  agro-industrial complex in 1994 including the solution of the  problem of financing the economy's agrarian sector. These  measures should be implemented, the decree stresses, with a view  to creating the necessary conditions for building up the  production of agricultural raw material and food and ensuring  the stabilization and steady development of the agro-industrial  complex under market economy conditions.    At the same time the chamber refused even to examine the  statement prepared by the agrarian faction containing  subjective, arbitrary assessments of the present situation in  the agro-industrial complex and claiming that "the state of  collapse in agro-industrial production is the result of the  government's incorrect policy with regard to the agrarian sector  of the economy and the grossest errors and blunders in  financial, investment, and credit policy."</p>

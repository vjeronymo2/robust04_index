			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Louise Fleischer report: "Radical Liberals Picking Up </F> Voters"]    [Text] The government would lose a total of 16 seats if  there were an election now. Both the Christian People's Party  and the Center Democrats [CD] would disappear from the Folketing.    While both the CD and the Christian People's Party are  likely  to be completely erased from the Folketing, the Radical Liberals  would make marked gains if there were a Folketing election now.    The party would have 10 seats against its current 7. This is  shown by an opinion poll that Gallup has carried out for  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE.    "I believe that people have begun to form a picture of us as  a stable party. And there can be no doubt that our voters are  well satisfied that we are involved in government cooperation,"  Radical Liberal Folketing group chairman Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen  said. "The fact that we have three ministers who are very  visible and who are responsible for areas that are important to  Radical Liberals is probably also of significance. And the fact  that we are demonstrating our opposition to the Oresund bridge  may also have a role to play in this context.    ``While I do not think that individual issues persuade  people  to vote for the Radical Liberals, more than 50 percent of the  population think that the idea of that bridge is stupid,'' said  Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen, who himself is one of the bridge's most  determined opponents.    At present the Radical Liberals seem to be the only party to  have benefited from involvement in government. The government  looks as if it will lose a total of 16 seats. The Social  Democrats will lose 6 compared with the last election, while  neither the Christian People's Party nor the CD are able to  attract enough votes to stay above the threshold for  representation in the Folketing.    The Liberal Party has lost two seats since the last Gallup  poll in April, but the party is still on course for a major  success in comparison with the 1990 election. Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen would enter the Folketing with 49 seats behind  him.    Political index   Question: How would you vote if there were a Folketing election tomorrow?

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter (1): Why British industry fails to attract talent Sir, Following on from Crispin Hills's plea for industry to 'draw the best pupils' (Letters, April 20), the following facts may highlight the extent of the current problem. The EC-supported tripartite degree involves English, French and German students studying electronic engineering in all three countries, meaning they graduate as trilingual engineers - surely just the kind of people Britain needs. Yet of the six who graduated from Southampton University last year, five are now in engineering posts abroad, and the one who stayed in the UK has left engineering. And while most of the 160 graduates from the 10-year-old scheme have stayed in engineering, only three of these are now in the UK. In France and Germany, both the status and salaries of professional engineers are far higher than here, and the damning figures above should surprise nobody. Unless it makes comparable offers, British industry will never attract or keep the talent it needs. Jeremy Ledger, Dataquest Europe, Roussel House, Broadwater Park, Denham, Middx UB9 5HP</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUR NOTE ON BANDS  </P> <P> Your article "Warriors on a Musical Battlefield" by Aaron Curtiss focuses on  the defending division champion, Canyon High School Band.  </P> <P> Having attended the event, I found your article lacking in balance.  </P> <P> The article was obviously intended as local valley interest but failed to  mention that the event was hosted by the William S. Hart High School Band. I  watched the students from Hart High School spend the entire day in dedicated  efforts to host the event and then put on an exceptional marching demonstration  rivaling the competing bands' performances.  </P> <P> The Saugus High School Band also performed exceptionally well, but the only  mention of this band was contained in a quote, "If we beat Saugus, we'll be  happy."  </P> <P> You are obviously aware that student participants in a competition such as the  Rampage are striving to do their best and are excited by what our newspapers  publish concerning the event. A more balanced coverage involving all the valley  high schools would certainly have been appreciated.  </P> <P> JAMES I. CLARK  </P> <P> Saugus  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Ritsumeikan University will install a  high-performance synchrotron radiation [SR] facility, equipped  with superconducting magnets, at its new Science and Engineering  Faculty campus at Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture. The campus  will open in April. With the exception of Tokyo University,  which manufactured and owns a small-scale facility, this is the  first Japanese university to independently own an SR facility,  which can be used for the development of new materials and for  ultra-fine semiconductor processing. It is planned to open this  facility to the outside in order to promote joint research with  the industrial world, public research institutions, and such.  This has attracted attention as a bold venture aiming at the  improvement of the university research environment.    The size of the stored energy, which indicates the scale of  this facility, is 600 million electronvolts. Compared with the  large-scale SR facility (8 billion electronvolts) being  constructed by the Science and Technology Agency in Nishi Harima  District, Hyogo Prefecture, this facility is less than one-tenth  in size but, because it uses powerful superconducting magnets,  it will be able to put out powerful radiation relative to its  size. Construction of the research facility will be started  during this year and equipment developed by Sumitomo Heavy  Industries will be installed. It is planned that the facility  will be in operation in the spring of 1996.    Along with the transfer of the Science and Engineering  Faculty from the city of Kyoto, Ritsumeikan University plans to  install about 1,000 personal computers and workstations on the  new campus and make it an intelligent campus. Ritsumeikan  University will also start installing SR equipment on this  campus to set the stage for joint research by industry,  academia, and government. It has been pointed out that there is  a problem with the deterioration and superannuation of  university research facilities but Ritsumeikan University is  aiming at qualitative progress by renovating the education and  research environment through the introduction of "cutting edge"  research equipment.  <H5>  Synchrotron Radiation </H5>   When the orbit of electrons accelerated almost up to the  speed of light is deflected by magnets, bright linear radiation  is emitted. Since this is a bright radiation source with a wide  wavelength range, from visible light to X-rays, it can be used  to observe the inner structure of living organisms and  manufacture super-high density semiconductor elements.</p>

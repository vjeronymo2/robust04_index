			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fighting broke out yesterday in Cambodia between an  unidentified number of Khmer Rouge forces and forces of the  Cambodian Government at O Smach Camp, close to the Thai border  at Chong Chom Pass in Surin Province. As a result, a large  number of Cambodian civilians have crossed the border into  Thailand. The governor of Surin, Kopkun Thonglongya, spoke to  the Public Relations Department correspondent:    [Begin Kopkun recording] The fighting broke out at an early  hour yesterday and continued until 1100. As a result, we had to  suspend the opening of the border passes. What caused a big  concern for us was the influx of about 2,000 refugees from  Cambodia. Anyway, after the fighting died down, our military,  police, and civilian officials, as well as territorial defense  volunteers pushed the refugees back into Cambodia. None of them  are still in Thailand. This fighting happens every month.  There are exchanges of gunfire and our border villagers are  used to it by now. What we feared was that the Cambodians who  fled into Thailand might refuse to go back. We are also  concerned about stray shells which might hit our people, their  homes and property. If we can prevent the two things, then we  have nothing to worry about since we have nothing to do with  their fighting. [end recording]</p>

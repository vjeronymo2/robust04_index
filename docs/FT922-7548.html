			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Non-trading side lifts Alexanders ALEXANDERS Holdings, the largest Ford main dealer in Scotland, saw its pre-tax profit rise from Pounds 207,000 to Pounds 408,000 in the six months ended March 31 1992, as it was boosted by non-trading activities. Turnover fell to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 43.9m) and the operating profit was lower reflecting, said Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, who heads the group, the impact of continuing and seriously depressed conditions in the motor sector affecting both volume and margin. They were exacerbated by the disruption which accompanied the acquisition and refurbishment of the new facilities at Greenock and major refurbishment at Kirkintilloch. Non-trading activities lifting the profit were a surplus on proceeds of life policy Pounds 342,000 and surplus on sale of property Pounds 56,000, less compensation for loss of office Pounds 90,000 which is subject to shareholder approval at the next annual meeting. Earnings per share were 1.065p (0.381p). The directors expect to maintain the year's dividend at 1p.</p>

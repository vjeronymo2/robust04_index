			<p>BFN     [Text] In its session today, the Council of Ministers  issued a statement on remarks directed against Jordan by Israeli  officials. Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of information and  minister of state for cabinet affairs, made a statement whose  text reads as follows:    The Jordanian Government has followed the serious and sudden  stepping up of statements by Israeli officials, particularly the  Israeli prime minister and the foreign minister, against Jordan  and its government in light of the increasing acts of violence  in the occupied Arab territories and in Israel and the  intentional escalation in the official Israeli media in the wake  of these statements, including the issuance of warnings and  threats to Jordan that military action would be taken against  its security and sovereignty.    The Jordanian Government views these sudden statements with  surprise and disapprobation. These statements point an accusing  finger at Jordan under the pretext that it allowed a Hamas  spokesman to make statements from Jordan on the 'Afula and  Hadera operations.    This method, which has become more frequent than at any time  in the past, is nothing but an abortive attempt which  demonstrates the Israeli Government's inability to distribute  its responsibilities for dealing with the aggravating  conditions. It is an Israeli Government attempt to brand Jordan  with terrorism, tarnish its reputation, and undermine its  sincere desire and effective efforts to realize just, permanent,  and comprehensive peace in the region.    Jordan has endeavored on all levels to warn against the  dangers of violence that results from the continuation of the  Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the consequences of  its practices, represented by collective punishment of the  residents of the occupied territories and by daily curfews and  killings, something which escalates the circle of violence and  counterviolence, in addition to Israel's faltering stands in the  peace process, its attempts to evade substantive issues, its  practice of inventing excuses and indulging in detail, and its  denial of rights.    Needless to say, Jordan has no need to defend itself or its  record of not approving the option of violence or terrorism.  Neither does Jordan need anyone to remind it of terror's  consequential killing of innocents and civilians and disruption  of the peace process. Jordan has suffered much from terror and  paid a heavy price in blood and resources. Jordan has not and  never will let its territory be used as a springboard or  passageway for violence or planning it, proceeding from a  principled stand reflecting a concern for the lives of  innocents, human rights, democracy, and the peace process.    The Jordanian government has noticed that the Israeli prime  minister said that the Jordanian television showed an interview  with a spokesman for Hamas. No such interview was broadcast by  the Jordanian television -- neither after the 'Afula attack nor  after the Hadera attack. Indeed, it was the Israeli television  newscasts that featured such interviews.    While emphasizing its concern for and commitment to the  peace  process and its call for promoting the intensive and continuous  endeavors to realize the cherished peace, the Jordanian  government categorically rejects methods of intimidation and of  threats to use force. Based on its position which calls for  peace and as a worker for the realization of peace, for  stability in the region, and for an end to the conflict in it,  Jordan will not submit to methods of pressure, coercion, or  intimidation. Jordan calls for pooling all efforts and supports  all calls that have been issued for accelerating the peace  process and finding solutions for substantive issues. This will  extricate the region from the circle of violence and realize  peace, security, and stability for its peoples.    Having always abided by, respected, and implemented  unanimous  Arab decisions; and out of its respect for the will of the  Palestinian people in their free choice of the PLO as their  sole, legitimate representative, Jordan reaffirms that it deals  with the PLO in its capacity as the sole party authorized to  negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people and undertake its  responsibilities on Palestinian territory.    Jordan shall continue to deal with the PLO on this basis and  shall not allow Jordanian territory to give prominence to any  organizations contrary to this reality or influencing this  reality and weakening the PLO's ability to achieve the ambitions  and aspirations of the Palestinian people on Palestinian soil.</p>

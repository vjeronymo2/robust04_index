			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Qizhong (0491 0366 0022)] </F>   [Text] New York, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- A large-scale economic  and trade fair between China and the United States opened at 2  P.M. today at the Roosevelt Hotel in the business district of  New York City. More than 500 Chinese entrepreneurs and American  investors and traders took part in enthusiastic, friendly, and  excited talks on trade between the two countries and making  investments in China.    After just one hour, six agreements on large-scale  investment  and trade were concluded. Entrepreneurs of the two countries  were all smiles when they signed the agreements. The agreements  include the construction of a power station and a steel mill in  China, and the sale of computers, oil prospecting equipment,  meters, and instruments to China. The value of the agreements  exceeded $1 billion.    Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,  who came to the United States to attend the eighth session of  the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade, attended  the signing ceremony for the agreements.    Wu Yi delivered a speech at the signing ceremony. She said:  China's society is stable with fast economic growth and the  people's standard of living has been rising quickly, providing  favorable conditions for making investments in China by foreign  businessmen. She said: "From now to the year 2000, China will  import commodities with a total value of $1,000 billion. The  huge Chinese market is the best place for investments by all  farsighted entrepreneurs.    Taking part in the economic and trade fair were Chinese  entrepreneurs from 26 provinces and municipalities, and staff  members of eight ministries and commissions, and corporations  with branch offices in three [as received] foreign countries,  totaling more than 200 representatives. Earlier, they took part  in similar activities at a trade fair in Los Angeles from 11 to  16 April. The two sides signed 11 contracts worth $1.3 billion,  and several agreements.    Today's trade fair had the same enthusiastic atmosphere and  tendencies as the Los Angeles fair. Many U.S. businessmen flew  several thousand kilometers from as far away as Washington,  California, Texas, and Florida. (Carl Morgenthau), an investor  from Washington State, was especially interested in the Chinese  market. He said the purpose of his participation in the fair was  to better study China's market and investment environment, and  do his best to invest more American capital in China. (John  Flagg) of a manufacturing company in Ohio signed an agreement at  the fair with China's Qinghai Province today on cooperation in  producing tires. He said: "I am optimistic about the Chinese  market and I am 200 percent confident in the future of  cooperation with China."</p>

Montanelli has decided to  leave IL GIORNALE, which he founded 20 years ago, to try his  fortune with LA VOCE -- a glorious title created in 1903 by  Giovanni Prezzolini, another "anarcho-conservative" like  himself. "The rift between Berlusconi and me remains  irremediable," Montanelli told the editorial board. He added:  "Berlusconi has neither the courage nor the strength to dismiss  me, so I will decide when to leave." The immediate response  from Fininvest's president was: "I rule out the possibility  that the Montanelli that I know could have made any such  remarks."  <H5>  Soothing Remarks </H5>   Be that as it may, the team for the new paper -- which will  probably be based in via Manzoni, in the very center of Milan --  is ready, or almost. The art director will be Vittorio Corona,  another escapee from the Fininvest group, former domestic news  desk chief on Italia 1 and before that editor of KING, the  lively monthly owned by RAI [Italian State Radio and Television]  publications. Head of publicity will be Luigi Guastamacchia,  long head of the SPI [Italian Advertising Association] agency  (though negotiations are also under way with Publikompass). In  any case, its official presentation is now imminent: It will  take place 14 January at Rome's Ambasciatori Hotel.    Yesterday was a long day for Montanelli. His rapid luncheon  (at which the main course was tagliatelle) with Silvio  Berlusconi at the latter's Milan apartment on via Rovani, cannot  have been the best part of it. This is confirmed by the fact  that the meeting did not take place at Berlusconi's mansion  house at Arcore. Montanelli's dislike of courts and courtiers  is well known. Berlusconi's strained expression after the  meeting was more eloquent than his soothing remarks.    "Of course Montanelli is not leaving," he told journalists.  "I think we could say that there has been a lot of fuss about  nothing." But the prince of journalists himself made no  statements. Inevitably. Despite Berlusconi's forced optimism,  the meeting was apparently rather stormy. This, partly because  Montanelli is someone who loves making vitriolic remarks.    According to certain disclosures, Berlusconi apparently  began  by asking Montanelli to stay on as editor of IL GIORNALE until  the elections. This, as a sacrifice for the sake of the  conservative alignment on whose behalf Berlusconi is working.  Montanelli apparently did not reply directly. But he did  criticize him harshly for having attended IL GIORNALE's  editorial board meeting a couple of days ago. This move was  regarded as an attack on his prerogatives as editor. But above  all it was a gaffe that follows the criticisms leveled by editor  of Television Channel 4 news, Emilio Fede, speaking on the  Fininvest network.    The remarks, as reported by Montanelli to IL GIORNALE's  editorial board yesterday afternoon, sound like a slap in the  face to Berlusconi: "It was wrong of you to come to the meeting  here yesterday," Montanelli told Berlusconi. "This, first  because you gave to understand that the Mammi law can be  circumvented; and, second, because you split the editorial board  by making it understood that whoever sides with you will have  money, while those who side with me with have their  independence."

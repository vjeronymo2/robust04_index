			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Little Chef moves into Spain on Pounds 3m venture Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a Pounds 1.5m investment to put Little Chef roadside restaurants, the first of which opened yesterday, and Forte Travelodges on the Spanish map. The investment has been matched by Repsol, Spain's largest and partly privatised energy and chemicals group, in a joint venture worth Pounds 3m. The first Little Chef, built at a cost of Pounds 488,000 midway between Madrid and Seville, is on a long-haul route which carries French traffic bound for south-west Spain, the Algarve and north Africa. Forte said the opening of the Little Chef was 'in line with Forte's strategy to expand the brand in Europe' and would lead to a 'widespread network at Repsol service station sites along Spain's main highways'. Potentially there was scope for 50 sites, the company said. Forte plans to open a second Little Chef later this year on the Madrid to Barcelona highway, about 12km from Zaragoza. A Travelodge is due to be opened on the same site early next year. A third site has also been earmarked for development. Forte said the Little Chef menu had been adapted to cater for local palates, retaining only 60 per cent of the original UK offerings. The Spanish menu includes more fish dishes, gazpacho and churros (a crispy doughnut). Little Chef restaurants have been opened in Dublin and Cork. In the UK Forte operates 350 roadside restaurants, attracting 40m people a year. Repsol, which controls 75 per cent of the Spanish fuel market, has been gearing up for greater competition following its partial privatisation. Last year the government reduced its share in the company from 54 per cent to 41 per cent and is expected to cut it further to 20 per cent later this year.</p>

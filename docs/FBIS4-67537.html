			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by China Radio International reporter Chen Yong; </F> from the "Current Affairs" program--recorded]    [Text] China's economic reform has made tremendous progress  but the country is facing a resources shortage, environmental  pollution, and overpopulation. Vice Minister of the State  Planning Commission Chen Yaobang says future development will  pay more attention to sustainable development of the resources  and the environment. He says China's National Agenda 21 aims at  bringing industrial pollution under control by the year 2000.  The National Agenda 21 covers the economic development, natural  resources, environmental protection, agriculture, population,  and education. The plan is China's response to the World Agenda  21 endorsed by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. All  participating countries agreed to do their best to protect the  environment. Premier Li Peng attended the Earth Summit and  promised to implement the resolution on behalf of the Chinese  Government. Vice minister Chen Yaobang says China's National  Agenda 21 was approved by the State Council in March this year.    Chen Yaobang says China's National Agenda 21 considers the  country's actual conditions and the relationship between the  population, environment, and development in the next century.  Chen Yaobang says the plan is the guiding principle for the  nation's long and medium term social and economic plans. The  formulation of the National Agenda 21 has involved over 300  Chinese experts and has drawn the attention of the United  Nation's Development Program [UNDP]. The UNDP has worked with  the Chinese Government for making Agenda 21. Chen Yaobang says  Agenda 21 will be implemented in three phases. Sixty three  projects are included in the first phase of the plan. The  projects are aimed at obtaining international cooperation. Chen  Yaobang says the preferential project will give a boost to  China's sustainable development. He believes the implementation  can have some influence over global development. However, he  says the implementation is a huge amount of investment.    Chen Yaobang says the first stage of implementation needs  $3.7 billion. The Chinese Government will cover 60 percent of  the cost. The other 40 percent will be obtained through  international donations. China is to hold an international  donor conference in July to gain financial and technical  assistance.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Two Gulfstream models announced GULFSTREAM Aerospace of the US, builders of the market-leading G-IV business jet, yesterday announced two models that direct its development thrust squarely at the trans-Pacific market. The Gulfstream V will have a non-stop range of 6,300 nautical miles, giving it the capability of flying from New York to Tokyo or London to Singapore. Gulfstream's second announcement was the replacement of the G-IV with the G-IV-SP (Special Performance). The SP offers a 53 per cent improvement in payload range performance over the G-IV. Gulfstream emphasises that the SP is available now, while the G-V will be ready for delivery in 1996. Throughout next year, the company promises to sell the SP at the present price of a G-IV: Dollars 23.5m. It quotes the price of a G-V as Dollars 29.5m in 1993 dollars. This price is without cabin outfitting, which adds anything from Dollars 3m upwards to the price.</p>

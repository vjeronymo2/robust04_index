			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Merger creates fifth largest Swiss bank Banque Cantonale Vaudoise and Credit Foncier Vaudois, both controlled by the Swiss cantonal government of Vaud, have agreed to merge, creating Switzerland's fifth largest bank with assets of about SFr30bn (Dollars 23.4bn). Neither bank is in difficulty, but the Vaud government said the increasingly competitive Swiss banking environment made the move desirable. In recent months, the pace of consolidation in the Swiss banking sector has accelerated with the three big universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, each acquiring regional banks. Two cantonal banks in Geneva have recently merged, and BCV's own assets grew by a third to SFr18.8bn last year as a result of rescuing the Banque Vaudoise de Credit, a regional bank, in December. A large portion of the capital of BCV and CFV is held by the public. The Vaud government holds 52.3 per cent of the shares of BCV, the larger of the two and a universal bank, and 47 per cent of CFV, which specialises in mortgage finance. The transaction must be approved by the Vaud parliament and completion is not expected until the end of next year. BCV said no decision had been made on the terms of the exchange of shares. The merged bank, which would retain the BCV name, would cut its combined 150-strong branch network in half, causing the loss of 400 of the 2,400 workforce, the bank said. BCV has begun to expand internationally, opening a representative office in Singapore together with the Zurcher Kantonal Bank, Switzerland's fourth largest bank. OZ, the quoted options subsidiary of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has reported a SFr3.3m loss in the third quarter, bringing the loss for the nine months to SFr12.6m, compared with net income of SFr21m in the first nine months of last year. OZ said the weak Swiss stock market made necessary a high level of depreciation on securities held.</p>

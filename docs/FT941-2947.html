			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors Walter Hayes is joining the board of Dagenham Motors, the London and south-east of England Ford dealer group, as a non-executive director. Hayes, once-upon-a-time editor of the Sunday Dispatch, vice president of Ford Motor, deputy chairman of Ford of Europe and close confidant of Henry Ford II, retired from Ford in 1989, aged 65. Having written 'Henry', a biography of Henry Ford II, he returned to the Ford world in 1990 as a member of the board of Aston Martin, the UK luxury sports car maker, which he helped persuade Ford to take over in 1987. As executive chairman of Aston Martin from 1991 he has been instrumental in transforming the often-chequered fortunes of the sports car group with the development of a new range of sports cars, the Aston Martin DB7, which goes into production next month. Hayes, 70 in April, has just retired from the Aston Martin chairmanship but remains as a non-executive director.</p>

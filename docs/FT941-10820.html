			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Whips lobby Tory MPs to back de-regulation move The government's business managers have been lobbying Tory backbenchers to support its de-regulation initiative which seeks to give parliament sweeping new powers. On the eve of the bill's second reading a Tory whip said the government could have a difficult time overturning any Lords amendment watering down the bill, which would give ministers the power to amend or repeal laws without primary legislation. The whip said: 'Any attempt to amend this bill would destroy the initiative. There cannot be any U-turn.' Mrs Angela Rumbold MP, a strong supporter of the bill, conceded that a number of Tory backbenchers would need reassurances. She said: 'This bill does not go far enough quickly enough but it is a very important start.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, attacked the bill for trying to repeal primary legislation without going through the 'proper procedures'. The Institute of Directors called on MPs to reject any amendments to bills limiting the order-making powers proposed for ministers. Ms Ann Robinson, the institute's head of policy, said: 'It is ridiculous to argue about constitutional concerns. The fact is the constitutional balance as it stands is tipped in favour of regulation.' Ministers argue that the key to the bill is the powers it gives government to repeal regulation 'on an ongoing basis'. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday moved to make some of the banking accounting requirements of the Companies Act 1985 more flexible. The move, part of the de-regulation drive, will remove the definition of 'banking activities' and 'banking transactions' in one of the schedules to the act.</p>

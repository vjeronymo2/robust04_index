			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Unexpected debt repayment reduces PSBR to Pounds 19.2bn Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget planning was given a boost yesterday when the government announced an unexpected repayment of debt in October instead of the usual budget deficit. With the chancellor putting the final touches to his November 29 Budget, the Treasury and Central Statistical Office announced a public sector debt repayment of Pounds 558m last month, compared with City expectations of a public-sector borrowing requirement of about Pounds 1.1bn and September's deficit of Pounds 4.09bn. The October repayment was the first monthly budget surplus since January and reduced the cumulative PSBR to Pounds 19.2bn for the first seven months of the 1994-95 financial year from Pounds 19.7bn in the first six months. The deficit for April to October was Pounds 7.2bn less than the Pounds 26.4bn recorded in the first seven months of the past financial year and appears to leave the government well on course to undershoot the Treasury's summer forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95. The local authorities' borrowing requirement was estimated at close to zero last month. In the first seven months local authorities paid back about Pounds 800m of debt after net repayments of Pounds 1.8bn in the same period last year. Government receipts were swollen by Pounds 1.47bn of privatisation proceeds in October, mainly from the third tranche of the BT share sale. Privatisation proceeds totalled Pounds 3.8bn in the April-to-October period compared with Pounds 3.5bn at the same stage last year. Receipts in October were also boosted by unexpectedly strong inflows of corporation tax. These jumped to Pounds 5.51bn last month from Pounds 3.59bn in October last year and Pounds 4.08bn in October 1992, reflecting the beneficial impact of economic recovery on company profits. Total cash receipts were Pounds 20.3bn last month. They rose 8.5 per cent to Pounds 126.6bn in the first seven months of 1994-95 compared with the same 1993-94 period. Cash outlays were Pounds 20.2bn last month. The Pounds 148.1bn spending total in the first seven months was only 2 per cent higher than in April to October last year. Inland Revenue receipts in the seven months were 14 per cent higher than last year, while those of Customs and Excise were up 9.5 per cent and social security contributions were 11 per cent higher. On the spending side, net departmental outlays were up about 1.5 per cent in the seven months. According to Mr Kevin Darlington and Ms Helen MacFarlane, economists at brokers Hoare Govett, this low growth, reflecting low inflation and falling unemployment, should enable Mr Clarke to cut about Pounds 5bn from spending plans for this year. Analysts warned, however, against expectations of such a sharp downward revision of this year's PSBR forecast in the Budget. Government spending tends to gather pace as the financial year progresses. Although corporation tax inflows are strong, lower-than-expected inflation has depressed receipts from income tax and value added tax receipts below government expectations. This month's Treasury survey of independent forecasts showed an average expectation that the 1994-95 PSBR will be Pounds 32.6bn, falling to Pounds 24bn in 1995-96.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Further arrest in water inquiry ITALIAN police have detained Mr Ettore Fortuna, chairman of the country's mineral water industry association, on allegations of paying illegal political contributions. His arrest follows similar charges on Friday against Mr Bruno Mentasti, managing director of the popular San Pellegrino brand, and Mr Giuliano De Polo, chairman of San Benedetto, and the arrest this month of Mr Carlo Violati, the former chairman of the Ferrerelle brand. Mr Violati allegedly paid L200m (Pounds 87,000) to speed Health Ministry investigations into the quality of his company's water. The bubble burst for all four men after magistrates began interrogating Mr Giovanni Marone, the secretary of Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health minister. According to Mr Marone's testimony, which has been widely leaked, Mr Fortuna paid about L250m to facilitate the introduction of new European Community mineral water standards into Italy. The arrests reinforce allegations that the Health Ministry was one of the most lucrative sources of funds for Italian politicians. Mr De Lorenzo, who resigned in February after allegations of a jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, has since been told by magistrates he is under investigation for a string of alleged kickbacks and alleged illegal political contributions. Among those arrested so far following testimony from Mr Marone are a number of top drugs company executives and executives from some of Italy's biggest advertising and public relations companies. All are accused of paying kickbacks to the ministry to influence drugs policy or win business on Italy's big anti-Aids campaign. Mr Renato Marnetto, a former finance director of the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, is reported to have told magistrates that the company paid Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.3m) to the Libyan government to prevent the full nationalisation of its assets in the 1970s. The allegations, which come from normally reliable leaked testimony, claim the money was paid to Mr Abdessalam Jallud, second in command to Libya's leader, Colonel Muammer Gadaffi.</p>

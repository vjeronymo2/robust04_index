			<p>BFN     [Text] In Liberia, 1,532 armed men have so far been  demobilized and encamped in the disarmament process which began  last month. The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major  General John Inienger, disclosed this today in Lagos while  briefing airport correspondents on the latest developments in  Liberia. Pius Egbohon has a report:    [Begin Egbohon recording] Gen. Inienger said a number of  weapons and over 6,000 rounds of assorted ammunition had also  been recovered. He was, however, not happy with the slow pace  at which the factions were turning in their men for disarmament  and encampment. The ECOMOG field commander attributed this  situation to the lack of faith among the factions. He stated  that there was a high degree of distrust among the factions  culminating in a situation whereby each faction suspects the  other of having a hidden agenda. [passage indistinct]    Gen. Inienger said that apart from the low level of trust  prevalent among the factions, the internal rift within ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the  fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] of Charles Taylor had not  worked in favor of the peace process. He gave an assurance that  the problem would be resolved soon to ensure that the general  elections scheduled for 7 December this year became a reality.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yoram Kohen] </F>   [Text] A closure was imposed today on Jericho. Major  General Ilan Biran, commander of the Central Command, decided to  ban Israelis from entering the city until further notice. Our  Army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] was scheduled to hold a rally in  the city this evening and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was  worried about possible terror attacks. Earlier today Hamas  staged a few processions in the city. Yoram Kohen reports:    [Begin Kohen recording] Today's procession in Jericho was a  first test. Most participants came from outside the city, from  Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas leaders in the territories sent  hundreds of supporters to Jericho, seemingly to test the  patience of the Palestinian police commanders. A similar  demonstration was held recently in Gaza.    The Hamas rally started with a procession bearing  provocative  religious symbols, Koran books, and green flags, and marchers  proudly chanting: 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is our mentor. The  Palestinian police commanders explained their decision to allow  Hamas to hold the rally in Jericho's big mosque by saying that  theirs was a democratic society which did not shut people up,  perhaps out of a wish to avoid confrontations.    Such a concentration of Hamas members in the self-rule area  led Maj. Gen. Biran to take precautions. Consequently, he  banned Israelis from entering the city until further notice.

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 103 STILL ON HOLD  </P> <P> Let's tell it like it really is. The insurance rate conundrum in California  would not require Prop. 103 or any other type of voter revolt if our  legislators would simply require the DMV to "tie" vehicle registration to proof  of insurance.  </P> <P> If the DMV can track a smog check and require proof of the check before issuing  a car registration, certainly the same can be done for proof of insurance. This  would take all of those uninsured motorists off the road and would curb the  losses to the insurance carriers which, in turn, would lower our premiums.  </P> <P> DIANE GRAY  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SABOTAGING CAP TESTS  </P> <P> As the 1988-1989 school year wanes and many of us teachers weary of holding  summer-bound students in their seats, here are a few thoughts concerning the  California Assessment Program.  </P> <P> You published the high school senior CAP scores in reading and math (Metro,  April 26). A subsequent article about a group of Torrance High School seniors  who "sabotaged" the CAP test and caused the school scores to plunge was not  surprising (April 27). The CAP test, alone among the "required" tests, demands  a degree of motivation and cooperation toward a common goal that is not  fostered in the routine of schooling.  </P> <P> Other tests give explicit messages to the student. The Basic Competency Exam  has consequences; pass or you will not graduate. The California Test of Basic  Skills has visibility; the results appear on your permanent record card. The  PSAT and the SAT have perquisites; get a good score and you may qualify for a  scholarship and/or get into a good college.  </P> <P> The CAP test, on the other hand, is not an individual achievement test but a  group test. Students are not measured against their peers on a test that all  take similarly, but instead several versions of a test are handed out randomly,  and students are told to work hard, do well, so that the school will benefit.  </P> <P> This is a laudable goal, I believe, but if students are to believe it, then  where in the four previous years of high school have they been enjoined to  perform academically for the "honor" of the school? Of course there are  academic competitions between schools -- speech and debate tournaments, music  competitions, academic Olympiads, etc. -- but where else in their schooling are  they asked, as a group, to do pencil and paper work in order to uphold the  reputation of the school (as in the Torrance case) or to improve the reputation  of the school (as in the case in the school in which I teach)?  </P> <P> If we are going to ask American students to subordinate individual goals to the  welfare of the group on a group test, then we are going to have to teach  against a very stubborn grain indeed, the notion of individual reward.  </P> <P> The Torrance students are reflecting an awareness of a testing enterprise that  not only fails to reward them but contains implicit values that are not taught  or practiced for the most part in academic settings. They sent a negative  signal of a group potential that education and perhaps American society has  missed.  </P> <P> ELSIE HARBER  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

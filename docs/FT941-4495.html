			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / PM vows to search for peace: UK and Ireland say hopes of early Ulster breakthrough ended by Heathrow attack The British and Irish governments last night conceded that Wednesday night's IRA mortar attack at London's Heathrow airport has killed hopes of an early breakthrough in the search for peace in Northern Ireland. Both governments united in their condemnation of the attack - which led to calls yesterday for an inquiry into security operations at Heathrow - and insisted that they would not be knocked off course in attempts to reach a political settlement in the province. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, claimed that the IRA's latest action and the failure of Sinn Fein to react positively to the Downing Street declaration would not deter London and Dublin from pressing on. At Westminster, Mr Major told MPs the 'unjustifiable' IRA attack would make 'no difference whatsoever' to the search for peace. He emphasised that the declaration set out 'a series of principles upon which we hope and intend to try and build a permanent peace in Northern Ireland'. In the Dail, Mr Reynolds attacked the IRA action as 'criminal and politically naive'. Both London and Dublin privately accept that the political momentum which followed December's declaration has largely been lost. They are now resigned to an extended process aimed at establishing an agreed framework for progress involving the province's constitutional parties. Speaking after yesterday's Anglo-Irish conference in London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the Heathrow attack had shown the IRA could not make its case via the democratic process and once again had resorted to force. Sir Patrick stressed both governments were committed to continuing the so-called three-stranded political talks process and added: 'There is no limit to our patience because there is no limit to the advantages that success in that process will bring.' He emphasised, however, that the prize of prosperity and peace might lie 'at the end of a very long road but a road on which neither government is going to weary of travelling'. In a speech in London last night, Sir Patrick reinforced the government's 'business as usual' approach by concentrating on the issue of relationships between Northern Ireland and the republic - strand two of the talks process. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in one of the most downbeat assessments from Dublin on the chances of an end to IRA action, said that 'the credit is running very low, if not totally expired' on the part of those who had yet to make up their mind on the Downing Street declaration. He said: 'Perhaps they (the IRA) are giving a message to both governments that they are not going to participate.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said that the airport attack was a reminder that the causes of conflict remained. Mr Spring described as 'deplorable' reported remarks by Mr Adams that more 'spectaculars' like Heathrow were to be expected. Security probe, Page 7 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / SPD backs post-telecom sell-off The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) made a last-minute decision to back the sale of Germany's state-owned postal and telecommunications service, clearing the way for the country's largest privatisation. The SPD decision guarantees a two-thirds majority for the government in a vote today in the Bundestag to change Article 73 of the constitution which says that postal and telecommunications services are the exclusive responsibility of the state. Following the vote the present company which employs 670,000 people will be turned into three state-owned joint stock companies on January 1, 1995: Deutsche Telekom, Postdienst, the postal service, and Postbank, the banking arm. Telekom has said it wants to float 30 per cent of its equity on the stock market in 1996 to raise badly needed capital.</p>

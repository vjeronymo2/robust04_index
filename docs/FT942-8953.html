			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unbecoming anti-US slur Sir, In his cinema review, 'In the spirit of myth-making' (May 5), Nigel Andrews refers to a movie that was 'so good it did only medium business in the US', a country 'where many people have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or the Pope'. This kind of silly anti-American slur ill becomes a newspaper which is published for an international reader-ship. Alan Cope, 918 Osage Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15423, US</p>

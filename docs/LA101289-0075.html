			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE WEIGHS COMPETITION TO LAUNCH ARTS PROGRAM  </P> <P> Glendale officials are considering sponsoring an artists' competition to launch  a cultural renaissance that would bring artworks, festivals and other events to  the city.  </P> <P> The competition -- in which artists would be asked to submit ideas for a  sculpture, painting or other art forms to be displayed in a public place and  paid for at taxpayer expense -- was among several ideas proposed Monday in the  second of a two-part workshop on a proposed public arts program.  </P> <P> "Contests bring out the very best," Councilman Larry Zarian said after city  leaders, artists and developers wrestled for two hours over the idea of  promoting artistic endeavors in the city.  </P> <P> Councilman Carl Raggio said an open competition, inviting participation by  hundreds of artists in Southern California, "would send out a signal that  Glendale is interested in art."  </P> <P> Others at the study session took a strictly pragmatic approach to Glendale's  quest to establish a cultural arts identity.  </P> <P> "If you're really serious about getting art in Glendale, the first thing you've  got to do is get rid of the pigeons," said Aulden Schlatter, executive vice  president and general manager of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Schlatter fears that the hundreds of pesky birds that roost on rooftops along  Brand Boulevard, like their counterparts in other cities, could quickly lay  claim to any sculptures or other artworks.  </P> <P> While council members apparently agree that the city should have some form of  arts policy, they seem to disagree on who ultimately will decide what is art.  </P> <P> Raggio said he would like the city to form an arts advisory panel of experts.  "I don't feel competent to do this by myself," he said.  </P> <P> However, Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said she is skeptical of the idea of an  arts panel. "We've got to consider a lot of details before we jump in," she  said, adding that she prefers classical, traditional artworks.  </P> <P> Frank Fuller of the ELS Design Group of Berkeley, the city's consultant, said  he studied art programs in 15 cities and found that "all are quite different.  Conceptually, the programs are very easy. No one is against art. The problem is  practicality. Whose piece do you choose?"  </P> <P> Mayor Jerold Milner said that with or without an advisory panel, the  five-member council ultimately will decide what is art in Glendale. "We are  making decisions that will affect the quality of life for the next 100 years."  </P> <P> Officials have been talking for months about adopting a public arts policy that  would encourage private- and public-sponsored art forms and events.  </P> <P> For the first time this year, the City Council set aside $100,000 in the budget  to promote an arts program. The workshops, held last week and this week, were  geared to determine how best to spend the money.  </P> <P> A competition was proposed by Glendale artist Ron Pekar, one of a small group  of artists, architects, developers, consultants and curators who have been  meeting with council members to help draft a public arts policy.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, one or more suggestions from artists could be selected by a  special panel to receive public funding for creation and display, possibly in  the public service building to be constructed soon in the Civic Center.  </P> <P> An arts policy suggested by the city's Redevelopment Agency would require all  developers in the downtown area to incorporate artworks into their projects or  to contribute money to a downtown arts fund. The fund could then be used for  permanent and temporary exhibits; cultural events such as performances,  festivals and lectures, and cultural facilities, said Jeanne Armstrong,  redevelopment director.  </P> <P> Armstrong called artworks and cultural events "vital elements of a mature,  urban downtown." However, she recommended that the city enter a program  gradually by introducing temporary installation of artworks and sponsoring  special events rather than seeking a permanent, prominent piece that could be  controversial.  </P> <P> "There is always a question of using taxpayer money for art," Armstrong said.  "The community must like it."  </P> <P> City staff members are expected to incorporate council suggestions into a draft  arts policy to be brought back to the council within a few weeks.  </P></p>

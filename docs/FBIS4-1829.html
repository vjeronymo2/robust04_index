			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton is yet to impose trade  sanctions on Taiwan by invoking the Pelly amendment over the  island's failure in wildlife conservation. Board of Foreign  Trade Director General Hunag Jen-chao said Friday [1 April] that  Taiwan will have no way to avert trade sanctions from the U.S.  once President Clinton decides to proceed. Anyway, he said, the  result in damage cannot be determined until Washington announces  how such sanctions are to be enforced.    On the other hand, Economics Minister P.K. Chiang [Chiang  Ping-kun] said when he attends a ministerial meeting under the  General Agreement on Tariff and Trade in north Africa next week,  he will explain to other participating countries Taiwan's  accomplishments and resolve in protecting wildlife. Chiang  stressed it is unquestionable that the ROC [Republic of China]  Government and people are determined to protect endangered  species. He said the U.S. Government is moving to slap trade  sanctions on Taiwan merely because of slandering the island by  international conservation groups.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Sheehy defends proposals for police shake-up FIXED-TERM contracts for police officers would not be a question of trying to squeeze the public sector into a private-sector mould, Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of the government-appointed inquiry into police and pay responsibilities, said yesterday. The introduction of fixed terms - with officers appointed on initial 10-year contracts subsequently renewable every five years - is the committee's most controversial recommendation. Sir Patrick, chairman of BAT Industries, mounted a determined argument in favour of it when he addressed the Association of Chief Police Officers conference in Birmingham yesterday. In his speech he called on the government to 'move ahead with implementation of our proposals as rapidly as possible'. He said the present police tenure arrangements amounted to telling the taxpayer that, whatever the changing needs and circumstances, the service could do nothing to alter its staffing and skill profile in less than 30 or 40 years. He said: 'Surely this is unacceptable. The police service needs the opportunity to renew itself.' The committee made a series of recommendations which it believes would sweep away barriers to effective management. They would place a duty on managers to recruit carefully, plan ahead and introduce adequate career development and training arrangements. Sir Patrick defended the other most controversial proposal, to introduce performance-related pay. No organisation could afford to employ 'passengers or mere figureheads' and he said he made no apology for proposing that senior officers' pay should be particularly dependent on their responsibilities. Sir Patrick faced critical questioning from senior officers and local authority representatives at the conference. Mr Keith Povey, chief constable of Leicestershire, said the service had been attracting high-quality recruits and needed to continue doing so. He questioned how the recommendations for lower starting rates, loss of housing allowance, increasing the service requirement for full pensions from 30 years to 40 years, raising the retirement age to 60 and fixed-term contracts would improve recruitment. Mr Richard Wells, chief constable of South Yorkshire, said comments by Sir Patrick had implied that his proposals would be supported by progressive people in the police service. He added: 'There are progressive people in the police service who actually welcome change who might want to question some of your recommendations.'</p>

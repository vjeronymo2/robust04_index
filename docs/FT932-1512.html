			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pension refund helps reduce deficit at NSM NSM, the heavily-indebted international coal mining group, reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.95m for the year ended March 31. There were losses of Pounds 5.72m last time. The deficit was reduced after a Pounds 1.6m exceptional credit in the form of a refund received from the group pension scheme and a fall in the net interest charge from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 9.3m. After a series of small disposals, borrowings fell from Pounds 84m to Pounds 94m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 56m. Mr John Jermine, chief executive, said further sales by the end of the year should generate another Pounds 10m, while the disposal of exhausted coal sites and the air condition and distribution business could fetch about Pounds 20m by the end of 1995. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 7.88m (Pounds 89.2m) included Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 87.4m) in respect of purchased goodwill on businesses sold. Mr Jermine said he was confident there would be no more exceptional or extraordinary items having taken all the write-offs needed. Operating profit fell from Pounds 8.99m to Pounds 5.74m on reduced sales of Pounds 114m (Pounds 147m). The group was adversely affected by the decline in US operating profits to Dollars 2.1m (Pounds 1.4m) compared with Dollars 7.3m, reflecting continuing low levels of market demand and the failure of a new piece of production equipment at one of the company's deep mines. Operating profits from the UK sector fell from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.5m against the background of uncertainty created by the government's coal review. Mr Jermine attacked the government's coal privatisation plans as 'unworkable' and said NSM would not be making a bid for any of the four pits offered to the private sector. He welcomed the government's intention to abolish the 'arbitrary and punitive limit of 250,000 tonnes for private licences' but called for its immediate implementation instead of waiting for the industry to be privatised. There is no final dividend. Losses per share were 13.1p (earnings of 11p).</p>

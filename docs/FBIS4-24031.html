			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmad Salim by </F> Werner Bloch; place and date not given: "You in Europe Are Not  Perfect Either!"]    [Text] [Bloch] The representatives in the OAU are national  governments and not peoples. What specifically can you do if  some governments are not representing the interests of all their  ethnic groups?    [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the  arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers.  Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial  integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of  the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been  democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in  Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa,  democratization means two things: first, that power emanates  from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable  governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for  that.    Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that  Europe is not free from it either -- the term "ethnic cleansing"  was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is  little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and  violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and  sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect  either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on  everything good and pleasant.    As an international community, we must learn to learn from  each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the  tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the  ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop  such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our  society.    [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic  cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a  united economic area. How is this supposed to work among  countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the  attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states  in Europe is difficult?    [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the  other way round: If the need for cooperation among the  prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more  urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the  brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must  cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the  35th member country ratified the agreement on an African  economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of  dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have  done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We  need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things  -- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier  to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one  makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that  must change.    [Bloch] How?    [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to  improve  their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You  must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone  knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in  the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and  would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust  imbalance of the international market must make the West think.    No one denies that Africa has enormous resources --  minerals,  raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters.  People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future.  I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present.  The point is to use our resources in a sensible way.    [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as  the  continent of the future, not even as the continent of the  present....    [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English  proverb:  "You give a dog a bad name and you hang it." As long as Africa  is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating  continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each  other and cut each other's throats after military coups,  naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one  explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic  improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be  more understanding.    [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in  Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant?    [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the  Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in  supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively  understanding our problems. The best support develops if the  people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all  cliches.    [Bloch] And does such understanding exist?    [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy.  Today some people talk about "Afro-pessimism" and reproach  Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to  blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some  people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with  which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they  are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must  understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous  mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a  typically European phenomenon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Japan's Defense Agency  [DA] Director General Kazuo Aichi and South Korea's Yi Pyong-tae  agreed Tuesday [26 April] a diplomatic solution through talks is  the best way to convince North Korea to allow full international  inspections of its nuclear facilities, agency officials said  Tuesday.    The officials said Aichi and Yi, who met at Defense Agency  Headquarters in Tokyo, agreed that their respective countries,  along with the United States, will maintain close cooperation.    Aichi told Yi that Japan is studying the problem as "a  matter  for Japan itself" and if the United Nations Security Council  votes for sanctions against North Korea, Japan will "respond  responsibly within the bounds of the Constitution," they said.    It is the first time a South Korean defense minister has  visited Japan.    Aichi and Yi also agreed on exchange visits between training  fleets and to work toward early implementation of procedures to  prevent air accidents, officials said.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wants to  inspect the spent fuel core of North Korea's Yongbyon reactor  for evidence of whether any material has been diverted for  possible use in a covert nuclear weapons development program.    On Monday, North Korea said it wants IAEA inspectors to  monitor the refueling of its main nuclear reactor at the end of  the month.    But an IAEA source said the agency needs to further sound  out  Pyongyang on an inspection mission, noting North Korea has yet  to reply to the agency's inquiries.</p>

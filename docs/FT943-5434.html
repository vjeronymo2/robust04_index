			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates hold up - Annuities August has seen a relatively even split between companies which have decreased their annuity rates and those which have increased them. Key players to have moved downwards include Equitable Life, which dropped its rates by 4 per cent on August 11, and Stalwart Insurance which dropped by 2 per cent on August 8. The most recent movements, however, have taken a slight upward trend; companies to have increased their rates include Sun Alliance which moved up by 2 per cent on August 23, and Sun Life of Canada which increased its rates by 1 per cent on August 25. The continuing shifts make it hard to predict what might happen over the next few weeks, but those soon to retire should take comfort in knowing that rates remain very good. This is encouraging for people seeking an immediate income and who would prefer to buy an annuity now rather than wait for the possibility of better returns later in the year.

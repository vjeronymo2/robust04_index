			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Defeat of the Cassandras"; introductory paragraph </F> in boldface as published]    [Text] When polled by EXAME, the business elite  respond: the real is good, stability is not a dream, and the  economy is going to grow.    Attention, Cassandras: the following report is horrible news  for you. Because the inescapable conclusion is this: the mania  for thinking that things are going badly and tending to get even  worse is out of style. EXAME took the pulse of the elite of the  business world's elite--the 500 largest firms--on various  subjects: elections, the economy, and inflation. Out of the  total number of questionnaires sent out, 126 were returned for  tabulation. That is a highly representative sample in polls of  this kind. The results can be expressed in three words:  optimism, optimism, and optimism (see the table below). The  answers to the questionnaire sent to businessmen and executives  of the country's leading companies are a kind of confession of  faith. Faith in growth. Faith in stabilization. Faith in the  plan created around former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to  defeat inflation. True, their faith is not all that great when  the subject is the post-election scenario, but it would be an  exaggeration to say that they foresee the apocalypse if Lula is  elected.    "The economy will probably continue to grow regardless of  who  the next president is," says Stephen Kanitz, EXAME's consultant  and the man in charge of the poll. "What may happen is that the  rate of growth will be faster or slower depending on which  candidate is elected." Kanitz uses a number of main arguments to  back up that view. The first is that given their low level of  indebtedness, Brazilian firms are fully capable of maintaining a  cycle of prolonged growth. His second argument concerns the  emancipation that the private sector has won from the state.  "The businessmen have learned to turn around without the state,"  says Kanitz. "They no longer depend so much on Brasilia to make  their decisions for them." Finally, in the opinion of Kanitz,  the agreement signed with the bankers and the Real Plan take  care of two problems whose solution requires that the government  continue to play a crucial role: the foreign debt and the fight  against inflation.    Repressed demand--That kind of optimism is echoed by several  businessmen. One of them is Manoel Octavio Pereira Lopes, who is  a stockholder in and president of Alcatel, the  telecommunications giant. The firm he heads lost $30 million  last year. Despite that, its investment program for 1994--on the  order of $25 million--has continued unchanged. Pereira Lopes is  among those who feel that the economy will probably grow by  about 5 percent this year and then continue to expand next year  "thanks to the economic plan." There are also those who mention  other reasons in support of their optimism. "There is repressed  demand in the infrastructure area that has reached its limit,"  says Roberto Muller, president of the ABB [Asea Brown Boveri].  "It is inevitable that from now on, business in that area is  going to recover." In the opinion of Jose Marques, the firm's  vice president, that prediction has a good chance of coming  true. Reason: the possibility now opening up for partnerships  between private capital and the public sector in areas such as  electricity, which is the ABB's main field. That is also the  reason why the ABB has not altered its plan to invest $20  million to modernize its equipment and increase its productivity  this year.    As is natural in an economy as complex as Brazil's, there  are  different reactions in some sectors. Businessman Jacks  Rabinovich, for example, who is one of the owners of the Vicunha  textile group (and also owns an interest in businesses in the  world of finance and iron and steel), prefers to be cautious in  his predictions. Rabinovich believes that GDP [gross domestic  product] will rise and that the Real Plan will be a success, but  he detects a temporary cooling which he attributes to the  introduction of the real. "Store owners are buying with URV's  [units of real value], but they have to sell in real cruzeiros,"  he says. "That difference in currencies will end up causing a  harmful gap." In his opinion, the economy today is being pulled  by a few locomotives. The automobile industry, because of its  formidable influence on GDP, is chief of among them, he says.  "But I hope that with the arrival of the real, there will be a  more homogeneous development of business," he adds.  Incidentally, there is no lack of support for introduction of  the new currency. As the poll figures show, nearly 10 out of 10  businessmen and executives consider the Real Plan superior to  its predecessors. "At last we have a plan that respects  contracts, relies on the strength of the market, and dispenses  with arbitrary packages," says Paulo Ferreira, the Dow Group's  vice president for chemicals in Latin America.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poll Results*                                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Answer                                |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |By how much will the economy grow in 1994?                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Over 5 percent                        |12.1                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Between 3 and 4.9 percent             |62.2                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Between 1 and 2.9 percent             |24.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will not grow                         |1.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |If Lula wins, will the investment rate hold up?                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                                   |34.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Will wait and see                     |62.5                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In part                               |2.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Is economic stability near?                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yes                                   |79.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |No                                    |20.2                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Is the Real Plan better than the previous plans?                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Better                                |95.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Same                                  |4.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Who would make the best president?                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fernando Henrique Cardoso             |88.9                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maluf                                 |4.2                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brito                                 |4.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lula                                  |1.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Quercia                               |1.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* This is how businessmen and executives responded to EXAME's poll of the co-|  |untry's 500 largest private companies--in percentages.                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Premature departure--After being out of the country for two  years, Ferreira returned in April after Dow moved its Latin  American office here from Miami. He liked what he saw. "When I  left, it was the impeachment period, and people were exuding  skepticism," he says. "Now it is easy to see that the situation  has changed for the better and that society has matured a great  deal." In his opinion, that new maturity is one of the main  factors justifying optimism about the future. As far as a  permanent stabilization of the economy is concerned, Ferreira  warns that there are still some stages to go through. "What has  been done so far is the equivalent of clearing off the table.  Now it is necessary to set out the plates and provide the food."  Among the things that still need to be done, Ferreira draws  attention to measures making it possible to put the national  accounts in order. His views on that subject agree with those of  Rabinovich of Vicunha, Muller of the ABB, and Pereira Lopes of  Alcatel. The latter three stress that long-term stabilization  requires changes that must not perfunctory in any way. Chief  among them is a persevering attack on the state's obesity. That  plan has ended up being delayed by the fiasco of constitutional  revision. "No matter who forms the new administration, those  reforms cannot be postponed," says Pereira Lopes. "Society  demands it."    Because Fernando Henrique has become publicly identified  with  that reformist talk, it is easy to understand why, in this poll  by EXAME, he emerges as the candidate preferred by businessmen.  "While he was minister, he took stands corresponding to what the  country needs," says Ferreira. "The success of the economic plan  will be his best platform." Marques of the ABB adds an argument  in favor of Fernando Henrique, saying: "He has a solid presence  in the legislative branch. And the next administration is going  to need support in Congress to put through the pending reforms."  The fact that Fernando Henrique is not doing so well in the  polls does not seem to bother his supporters too much, at least  for the present. Rabinovich, for example, feels that "a lot of  water will flow under the bridge" between now and the elections.  "It is too early to make any predictions now, because  campaigning has not even started," he says.    Although clearly ahead among businessmen, candidate Fernando  Henrique also stirs some criticism. "He should have stayed on as  minister to carry out the plan," says Eugenio Staub, president  of Gradiente. Staub feels that his departure from the ministry  was premature, created an image of someone merely looking for  votes, and compromised his credibility. Even worse, Staub feels  that Fernando Henrique's actions as a candidate are distorting  his political personality. "The alliance with the PFL [Liberal  Front Party] is a contradiction with his past, as is his  participation in pilgrimages in honor of Father Cicero," he  says. Disappointed by those attitudes in someone he says is a  personal friend, Staub has declared his neutrality. He even  confesses to some liking for Lula's message. "Some of the things  he says are pertinent," he says. "The big problem is not  ideology but the question of whether Lula's team is competent to  administer a country like Brazil."    Volume of investments--There seems to be unanimous opinion  on  one thing, however. Although no one fears a cataclysm, there is  certainty regarding the impact that a possible victory by Lula  will have on the volume of investments in our country. Even  firms saying that they are inclined to make no changes in their  investment plans--examples being Vicunha, Dow, the ABB,  Gradiente, and Alcatel--call attention to the negative effects  that a victory by Lula will have on the inflow of capital from  abroad. "There are many choices in the international market,"  says Rabinovich, whose group this year will open a plant in  Natal that absorbed investments totaling $150 million. "It is  understandable that foreign investors should think twice before  investing in Brazil if Lula wins." Kanitz agrees. He has no  doubt that a victory by Fernando Henrique will be much more  welcome abroad than one by the PT [Workers Party] candidate.  Even Staub, who is not dying of love for the candidacy supported  by the alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] and the PFL, is not neglecting a few precautions. At this  time of the year, Gradiente should be drawing up its three-year  plan. But that project has been shelved until after the  elections. Staub justifies the postponement by recourse to  semantic subtleties. "It is not that we have decided to slam on  the brakes," he says. "It's just that we have taken our foot off  the accelerator."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Welcome Russian Initiative, Condemn French </F> Initiative, But..."]    [Text] The Russian initiative to reconvene the Madrid  conference on peace in the Middle East coincided with a French  initiative, represented by the French-Israeli military  cooperation pact, signed by the French defense minister not far  from the spot still dripping with the blood of the martyrs of  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron.    Although the Russian initiative appears to be positive and  to  be aimed at breaking the stalemate in the Arab-Israeli  negotiations, this initiative should not make us believe that  Russia, which attended the first Madrid conference under the  umbrella of the Soviet Union that was then passing away, can now  assume a leading role in events under its current circumstances,  which are no better than those prevailing when it attended the  first conference in Madrid.    As for the French initiative, it is not only very bad  because  of its timing, but also because of its contents, which activate  military relations with Israel--relations that have been nearly  severed since the aggression in 1967.    Contrary to the position expected from Paris, in light of  its  exclusion from negotiations and from its previous effective role  in reaching an agreement--the same as the case with Europe,  China, and Japan--we see France courting Tel Aviv and concluding  a military pact for research and development instead of seeking  to foster relations with the Arab parties to the negotiations,  which are besieged by Israeli intransigence and U.S. pressure.  This pact implies encouragement for Israel to continue the  expansionist, Zionist, and aggressive policy.    We view the Russian initiative positively, in spite of the  possible intentions and circumstances that serve Moscow's  objectives of seeking more Western assistance and restoring U.S.  political support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which has  begun to falter. As much as we are disturbed by the negative  French initiative, we know that the U.S. Administration is the  main party responsible for the crisis in the negotiations. It  is a result of the full and unlimited U.S. support for Israel  and because the United States prevents the international  community from carrying out any positive role in implementing  the resolutions of the international community or forcing Israel  to heed the UN resolutions on our rights in Palestine and the  Arab territories occupied after the 1967 aggression.    We, as well as the entire international community, know that  Washington monopolized the role of the sole power able to  influence international events in general and our negotiations  with Israel in particular. We also know that any failure or  slowness in these negotiations and any Zionist threat to world  security and peace in this region is the full responsibility of  the United States. In spite of this belief, which many people  share with us, we welcome the positive Russian initiative, and  condemn the negative French initiative launched at this delicate  time.</p>

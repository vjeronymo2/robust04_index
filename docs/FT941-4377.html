			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A narrowness of vision Sir, Given your evidence ('PM denies unions a voice on Bank's governing body', March 5) of Mr Gavin Laird's competence as a director of the Bank of England, the prime minister's refusal to reappoint him reveals a mean conception of government's role as guardian of our public institutions. To state that directors of the Bank are appointed because of their 'individual expertise' suggests, if it means anything, that only money-changers need apply. Expertise in the field of industrial relations can presumably be ignored. Furthermore the notion of Mr Laird 'representing other institutions' supposes a paper tiger which the TUC would itself be wise to shred. Mr Laird would be representing nothing but a widely held, and sadly ignored, desire for the sort of co-operation across commercial boundaries which the UK economy so badly needs. Functionality may be necessary, but is not a sufficient guideline for the running of public institutions like the Bank. This appointment may be a trifle in itself but it in fact points to an all too familiar narrowness of vision, the chief result of which has been the separation of the enterprise culture from many of those whom it was intended to serve. V N U Wood, managing director, McInroy &amp; Wood, 46 Court Street, Haddington, East Lothian EH41 3NP</p>

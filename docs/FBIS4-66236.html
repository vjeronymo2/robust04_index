			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Han Jiyun (7281 4949 0061) of the People's Bank </F> of China's Lianyungang Branch.: "An Analysis of the Impact of  China's `Return To GATT' On the Banking Industry." The first  paragraph in italics is a source-supplied note.]    [Text] "Return to GATT" will also have a positive  impact on China's banking industry and economic development. For  example, it will increase the foreign fund utilization channels,  enhance the industry's sense of competition, and will raise the  technological and management standards. It will also promote the  thorough reform of the financial system and the  internationalization and marketization of China's financial  system. However, we will not deal with those aspects in this  article.    The day of China's recovering its status as a GATT signatory  is drawing closer and closer. When that day comes, according to  the "market admission" principle, China's banking industry will  face serious challenges from foreign banks, especially banks  from the developed nations. This article is an attempt to  analyze this issue and to suggest some solutions.  <H5>  I. Specific Impact of "Returning To GATT" on China's Banking </H5> Industry    The "return to GATT" will have the following major impact on  China's banking industry:    1. It will diminish the regulation and control  functions of China's monetary policy.    The main goal of China's monetary policy is to stabilize  prices and promote economic growth. The central bank's tools for  implementing the monetary policy include deposit reserves,  discounting and rediscounting, lending and relending, total  credit loan control, and administrative measures. Since reform  and opening up, and depending on the needs of economic  development at different times, China has utilized the above  monetary policy tools to continuously regulate and control the  amount of currency input in order to maintain basic balance  between currency circulation and industrial and agricultural  productions and commodity circulation. Currently, China's  product prices are basically stable and the economy is growing  at a fairly rapid rate. This proves that our monetary policy is  basically sound and can function to regulate and control the  economy. But in the wake of the opening up of China's banking  industry, some trans-national banks will move in, and because of  their presence, when we try to implement a tight monetary  policy, some of them may continue to obtain funds from their  overseas branches and continue to make loans to their customers.  Their business will not be affected by, but may even jeopardize,  our tight money policy, and consequently we will not be able to  effectively utilize our monetary policy's regulatory mechanisms  to control the economy. In this sense, it will greatly diminish  the effectiveness of our familiar traditional monetary mechanism  where the central bank's tightening of the money supply will  always lead to the contraction of the domestic economy. This no  doubt will be a serious challenge to our traditional financial  system.    2. It will make the implementation of China's credit  policy even more difficult.    The principle behind China's credit fund management is  central planning, allocation of funds, actual loans based on  actual deposits, and ease of interbank lending and borrowing.  The emphasis of a credit loan policy built on these premises is  to maintain volume and structural balance. The goal is to  promote the benign fund cycle and improve economic efficiency in  all sectors and departments. Volume balance refers to the  compatibility between currency issuance and industrial and  agricultural production and product circulation. Structural  balance refers to guaranteeing the funds needed by the state's  key industries and cutting back on funds needed by ordinary  trades and businesses. Currently, China's specialized banks'  total credit is balanced and allocated centrally at the People's  Bank headquarters. This policy lends support to the realization  of our macroeconomic development goals and structural goals. It  gives expression to the country's so called preferential  development policy, which is a structurally biased policy that  supports certain industries and restricts others. This approach  may to some extent limit the specialized banks' automony and  flexibility, but for a country that has scarce funds and is  structurally unbalanced, it is a necessity. But foreign-funded  banks have a very different approach. They adopt the usual  international loan percentages and risk management methods.  Their loan percentage is based on the amount of deposits and  capital fund and is not controlled or constrained by volume and  structural balance. That is to say, their credit policy is very  liberalized. Therefore, how to coordinate the differences  between international practices and China's own credit structure  policy is another problem China's banking industry will be  facing.    3. China's existing foreign exchange control system  will face serious challenges.    China adopts a tight foreign exchange control policy. The  guiding principle of our exchange control is to "centralized  control and unify management." Based on this principle, the  state exchange control department has promulgated a series of  very strict exchange control policy and laws and regulations,  but to meet the needs of reform and opening up, the department  has begun to reform and adjust the exchange control system and  ease control somewhat. For example, we have implemented a  managed, variable exchange rate system; set up a foreign  exchange regulation market; and gradually eased the  administrative control of foreign exchange revenue and  expenditure and exchange remittances to and from the country. In  particular, beginning on 1 January of this year, the state has  adopted a managed, variable RMB exchange rate that is based on  market supply and demand. It was a major move in the  restructuring of the foreign exchange system and even for the  restructuring of the entire financial system. But under the new  system, administrative-type foreign exchange control measures  still play a very important role, and the entrance of  foreign-funded banks no doubt will pose a challenge to the  current foreign exchange management system. Therefore, we must  continue to pursue in-depth reform of the existing foreign  exchange management system to meet the needs of the opening up  of China's banking industry and international practices.    4. China's finanical institutions will face intense  competition.    Since the 1980's, competition in the international banking  industry has been intense. The developed nations utilize their  fund and technological advantages to take and maintain their  lead. It can be expected that in the future, most foreign-funded  banks that come to China will be financial institutions from the  developed nations and regions. They not only have substantial  financial strength and advanced technological means and  management methods, but they also have abundant knowledge about  and experience in international market competition. And if we  look at our own banks, our loan funds are controlled by the  state's credit policy, we are behind in technological and  management skills, and our services lack quality. We will be no  match for the foreign banks, and we will inevitably lose as we  try to compete for business. This situation has already happened  in Shenzhen and Xiamen and other SEZs. Because our financial  institutions lack initiative and versatility, and their services  lack quality, many businesses have already been taken away by  the foreign-funded or Sino-foreign joint venture banks. Take  foreign exchange settlement for example. We have already lost a  lot of business there, which is very worrisome.    5. It will make the management of the financial  institutions more difficult.    Exercising administrative control over the financial  institutions is an important part of the central bank's function  as a "government bank." Today, the control and supervision of  China's financial institutions extend mainly to the following:  The scope of business activities, assets and liabilities, credit  forms and tools, fund settlement, interest rates, cash input and  withdrawal, trust investment, financial market, and foreign  exchange businesses. Yet, because the restructuring of China's  financial system is very incomplete, even though the state is  very strict with its control and supervision of the financial  institutions, signs of some financial institutions violating  laws and regulations are still apparant everywhere despite  repeated prohibitions. Once foreign-funded banks begin to move  into this country en masse, the state's control will face even  more serious challenges. This is because based on today's method  of managing the foreign-funded financial institutions,  foreign-funded banks that set up branches in China must have $20  billion in capital. Although this guarantees that the  foreign-funded financial institutions will have the scope and  the business capability, we should also see that by the same  token, they will be huge trans-national bank groups with  advanced technologies and substantial business experience that  can make use of their global network to evade taxes, remit their  profits and capital, or engage in speculative operations. These  will make controlling the financial institutions much more  complicated and much more difficult.    6. Foreign-funded banks will ignore risks and engage in  "aggressive" operations.    No doubt, most foreign-funded banks that come to China will  be trans-national groups. Their assets are separated by  nationality and their business is all-encompassing; they profits  are substantial, which gives them tremendous ability to handle  risks. In comparison, China's financial institutions may have a  large, well-equipped network at home, and the headquarters and  branches are tightly-knit, but they are not global,  trans-national banks in any sense, and their business operations  are primarily domestic, and they have little to do with the  outside world. Therefore, from the asset standpoint, it makes  the Chinese banks' fund utilization more risky. If they run into  trouble and lose money, there is no way they can remedy the loss  via other channels or in other ways. When the foreign-funded  banks run into trouble and lose money, they can get help from  other profitable branch organizations in other countries or  regions. Meanwhile, they can also use the profits they make  elsewhere to engage in "aggressive" operations here. They can  use lower interest rate to dump funds here as a means to defeat  their competitors and achieve their high profit goal.  <H5>  II. Some Suggestions </H5>   Currently, more than 130 financial institutions from 29  nations have set up more than 240 representative offices in the  SEZs and 14 coastal open cities. Among them, 52 are  business-oriented organs. Their momentum far surpasses that of  Asia's "Four Small Dragons" in the early days. Once China  returns to GATT, this process will move even faster. To reduce  the impact of foreign-funded banks on China's banking industry  after our "return to GATT," to increase our ability to fight  them, and to stabilize our own socio-economic lives, we hereby  make the following suggestions:    1. Promptly change the financial policy and the  industry personnel's ideologies and concepts and make the  financial institutions more conscious about competition.    Ideologies and concepts play a critical role in people's  thinkings and in their activities to change society. If we use  the correct ideologies to guide their actual practices and  activities, we can succeed; otherwise we will fail. Thus,  under the new conditions, our financial decisions as well as  industry personnel must adopt the kind of thinking and concept  that is consistent with the socialist market economy and GATT.  We must pay attention to the real issue of opening up and  gradually liberalizing the banking industry as stipulated by  GATT and consciously put this issue before everything else. We  must plan and design our financial tasks meticulously and handle  every link of the financial tasks diligently, so as to raise the  financial institutions' consciousness about competition. We must  compete with the foreign-funded banks with courage and strategy  and raise our service standards amid competition to meet the  foreign banks' challenge.    2. Fully utilize GATT's exceptional provisions extended  to the developing nations to cushion the impact of the  foreign-funded banks on our banking industry.    According to the pertinent GATT principles and provisions,  developing nations enjoy certain preferential treatments, one of  which is the rule on protecting the threatened domestic  industries, and another is the extension of deadline for  radically opening up the banking industry. These will help us to  be better prepared and to improve our banking industry's ability  to resist the foreign assault. We should take full advantage of  these favorable regulations and go all out to raise our banking  industry's service standards, so that we can meet the needs of  international economic development as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, we must protect certain domains and regions where our  banking industry is still immature and allow foreign-funded  banks to enter into designated financial markets selectively to  let them launch their business in markets that will benefit us  the most. In this way, we can cushion some of the impact of the  foreign-funded banks and gain some time and initiative and in  turn help our banking industry link tracks with the  international banking industry in a steady way.    3. Promptly formulate laws to administer the  foreign-funded banks and strengthen their supervision    To acclerate the legislative process is an important means  to  guarantee effective administration of the foreign-funded banks.  Only through legislation can we systemize and standardize the  foreign bank management system and effectively protect our  rights from infringement. In addition, according to a GATT  "grandfather clause," "certain laws and regulations already  established prior to a signatory's participation in any  agreement should be honored," and this makes it essential for us  to speed up the formulation of laws to manage the foreign-funded  banks. We should promptly gather the finanical experts and  economists to study and discuss the matter and formulate the  laws on administering the foreign banks as soon as possible.  Those laws should mainly stipulate the foreign-funded banks'  types of business, sizes, and treatment. The emphasis should be  on the utilization of home currency, that is, to put tighter  restrictions on the utilization of home currency to ensure that  our banks can make full use of our home currency resources while  forcing the foreign banks to bring in their own funds to dull  their competitive edge and guarantee the leading role of our  financial institutions and the effective implementation of the  state's general and specific financial policies and promote the  coordinated and steady development of the nation's economy.    4. Accelerate the restructuring of China's finanical  system and set up a new financial system that is compatible with  the socialist market economy and international practices.    From the objective point of view, the above-mentioned  protective and restrictive measures are measures of expedience  that only treat the symptoms but cannot cure the disease. To  truly solve the problems, we must accelerate the pace of  financial reform and broaden and deepen the restructuring of the  financial system and set up a new system that is compatible with  the socialist market system and international practices.  Therefore, reshaping China's financial system in accordance with  the principles of the market economy and the integration of  global economic and finanical systems is the only way to  increase our banking industry's ability to fight off future  competition and to survive and develop. Today we must seize the  moment and reflect on and re-create various aspects of the  existing financial system, including improving the quality of  the personnel, separating business-oriented from policy-oriented  operations, loosening foreign exchange control, and modernizing  and internationalizing our business technologies and  administration. Only in this way can we raise our banking  industry's standard to enable us to compete with the banking  industry of any nation in the world and remain victorious.</p>

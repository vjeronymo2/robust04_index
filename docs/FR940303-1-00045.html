			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS expects to require that MDP be produced under an approved plant quality control program. Also, FSIS is considering a requirement that the plant quality control program provide the controls and information necessary to assure that MDP manufactured under such a program meets any requirements established and that it will enable establishment personnel and FSIS to monitor it for effectiveness. FSIS is focusing on methods that will minimize inter-lot variation by maintaining the uniformity of starting materials and controlling the handling and processing of starting materials and resulting product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it appears that this goal can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a program for quality control incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques and adheres to good manufacturing practice, FSIS contemplates requiring that an establishment conduct only limited analyses for protein quality and fat, and for MDP represented as containing not less than 14 percent protein and not more than 25 percent fat, to confirm that production is, in fact, under control. After it has been demonstrated that the quality control program is able to yield complying product, confirmatory analyses would be required only periodically, as long as the product is in compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS anticipates establishing basic parameters for the chemical analyses that must be performed to verify compliance with the requirements, e.g., defining production lots and sampling schedules, and the accepted methodology for performing analyses. FSIS wishes to receive comments on the parameters necessary for an adequate quality control program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tentative position: Handling requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Current regulatory requirements, including provisions for sanitation, operating procedures, and heat processing (9 CFR part 381, subpart H and I, and &sect;381.150), already provide the basic controls necessary to prevent spoilage and assure poultry product wholesomeness. However, because the mechanical deboning process presents greater opportunities for bacterial growth than traditional poultry product processing, FSIS is considering amending the poultry products inspection regulations to more specifically address the requirements for the various starting materials used for MDP and the resulting product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the data reviewed in the 1979 health and safety report indicate that MDP products generally are acceptable from a microbiological standpoint, the data also show that where bacterial loads tend to be higher, it can be attributed to the starting material used. This is not surprising as common starting materials for mechanical deboning are products that remain after the removal of a substantial portion of skeletal muscle or other tissue (e.g., skin) from poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses. As a result, the resistance of the exposed surface area to microbial penetration has been reduced and the ratio of the surface area to the volume of total product which is exposed to contaminating influences has been increased. Higher microbial counts in MDP have been associated with the time and conditions of holding such starting materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mechanically deboned poultry itself also presents opportunities for excessive microbiological growth because it consists of small particles which have a greater surface area than most poultry products and because during its preparation any microorganisms that are present are distributed throughout the product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials used to make the product and for the product itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

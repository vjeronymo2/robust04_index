What was the content  of the statement?    ['Asfur] The statement refers to the nature of the  atmosphere  prevailing at the negotiations. The atmosphere was  constructive, positive, and practical. The negotiations were  fruitful, and we achieved progress on three issues; namely,  civilian issues, security issues, and confidence building  measures. In fact, we have achieved progress, and both sides  are satisfied with it and hope it will open the way for major  progress next week.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Hasan, what are the outstanding issues of  disagreement?    ['Asfur] There are several issues over which we have not yet  reached any agreement, including some security and civilian  issues and confidence-building measures. We hope that next  week's negotiations will achieve more progress on these issues.    [Mu'addi] What about the Palestinian police? Have you  reached any agreement on it?    ['Asfur] No, we have not yet reached any agreement. The size  of this police force and the type of weapons it will use are  still under discussion.    [Mu'addi] What about efforts to release Palestinian  prisoners?    ['Asfur] There is serious and continuing discussion of this  issue, and I believe that matters are moving in the right  direction.    [Mu'addi] Have there been contacts since the press statement  about holding a summit meeting between Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next week?    ['Asfur] Negotiations will resume in Cairo next week on  Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, and we  hope a meeting will take place between President 'Arafat and  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin when both deem it necessary.    [Mu'addi] Do you believe that all issues will be discussed  next week?    ['Asfur] It is difficult to fix such a date, but we believe  that matters are moving in the right direction. We hope we will  reach an agreement within a short time, before the blessed 'Id  al-Fitr, that will please our people and both sides.</p>

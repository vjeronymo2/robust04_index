			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Abolishing the gas monopoly BRITISH GAS is one of Britain's more blatant monopolies. It has the exclusive right to sell gas to the vast majority of British households, it dominates the market for industrial gas, and it controls access to the country's main gas pipeline system. By the end of next month, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to decide whether British Gas's domestic monopoly is in the public interest. It will also, in practice, consider the case, rejected at privatisation, for breaking up the company. The first of these questions is discussed today, the second will be examined in a subsequent editorial. The case for abolishing the domestic monopoly is compelling. Competition would provide customers with choice, give British Gas a greater incentive to cut costs and lead to greater innovation. Electricity companies, for example, have expressed interest in entering the market and providing customers with joint gas and electricity packages - a move which could cut substantially administrative, customer service and billing costs. The introduction of competition would also bring nearer the day when regulation, which has been a source of such conflict in the gas industry, could be relaxed. Security of supply British Gas, however, is opposed to releasing its monopoly grip. It has a number of arguments. One is that security of gas supplies is better assured in a centrally-controlled system where one entity is responsible for keeping gas flowing. Another is that British Gas would be unable to maintain its social obligations if exposed to competition. These obligations include requirements to supply anyone who pays the bill and to charge all domestic customers the same unit price for gas wherever they live and however much gas they use. British Gas argues that such obligations are only possible because a third of its 18m customers bail out the other two-thirds to the tune of Pounds 250m a year. In a competitive market, rivals would simply cherry-pick the most profitable business, leaving British Gas with all the obligations. To anyone who has followed British Gas's long rearguard action against reduction of its monopoly, these are familiar arguments. They are concerns which need to be addressed but they are not reasons to hold back competition, so long as competition takes place on a level playing field. The experience of the multiple-supplier electricity system, which operates on much finer margins than gas because it cannot store power, shows that security of supply is possible in a competitive market. Similarly, experience in the telecommunications industry shows it is possible to maintain social obligations while introducing competition. Ponderous giant One way of preserving them would be to require rivals to contribute to British Gas's 'social costs' in proportion to their market shares. But it is also important to ask whether it is really necessary for one group of gas consumers to subsidise another. In the longer term, the best approach would be to phase such subsidies out. A further argument used to defend British Gas's monopoly is that customers have not done badly since the company was privatised in 1986. Gas prices have fallen by 20 per cent in real terms, while surveys show customers are satisfied. British Gas has indeed improved its operations under the discipline of private-sector ownership and regulatory pressure, but this is no reason for complacency. The company remains a ponderous giant, slow to respond to change and to bring down costs, particularly when compared to the electricity industry where competitive pressures are sharper. British Gas's management has set its sights on becoming a dynamic international, entrepreneurial company. It is still some way from achieving this transformation and so long as it remains protected from competition it will lack the best possible spur to do so. The company is right to argue for the interests of its shareholders with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, but properly handled, the abolition of the domestic monopoly need hold no terrors for British Gas.</p>

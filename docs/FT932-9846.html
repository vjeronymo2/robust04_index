			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs revolt on fishing measure DESPITE a revolt by Tory backbenchers the government secured a majority of 25 (283-258) in the Commons last night to defeat a Labour attempt to reject a fish conservation measure requiring British trawlers to stay in port for a specified number of days, Ivor Owen writes. Five Tory backbenchers joined with opposition MPs in voting against the government. They were Mr David Harris (St Ives), Mr Sebastian Coe (Falmouth and Camborne) and Mr Robert Hicks (South East Cornwall), Mr David Porter (Waveney) and Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East). About half a dozen other Tory backbenchers, mainly Euro-sceptics angered by the fact that the restrictions imposed on British fishermen would not apply to French and Spanish vessels, abstained. The government was helped by the absence of some MPs from Labour and the smaller parties. Mr David Curry, the fisheries minister, said the tie-up regulations would come into force in September and October. He promised that no further restrictions would be imposed on British fishermen until the government was satisfied that those in other EC countries were meeting their conservation targets. Mr Gavin Strang, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, attacked the government for failing to introduce a properly funded de-commissioning scheme. Senior Tory backbenchers will today renew calls for extra help for the shipping industry. Sir Giles Shaw, a member of the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, has proposed a change to the Finance Bill to give the shipping industry 100 per cent first-year capital allowances.</p>

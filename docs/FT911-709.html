			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Italian insurer advances 1.2% to L137.9bn RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS), Italy's second biggest private-sector insurer, which is controlled by Allianz of Germany, improved group net profits by 1.2 per cent to L137.9bn (Dollars 108.32m) last year, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Group premium income rose by 7.7 per cent to L5,849bn. Premiums at parent company level went up by 12.7 per cent to L2,844.7bn. As in 1989, RAS's results are deceptive in that they fail to reflect the steadily deteriorating underwriting position at many of Italy's big insurance companies owing to rising claims following a period of strong growth in the number of policies written, notably on the motor side. Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman, said underwriting losses rose to L180bn last year from around L130bn-L140bn in 1989. By contrast, underwriting used to be profitable as recently as the mid-1980s, but had deteriorated steadily since, he noted. 'In 1990, the Italian market was the worst in the world'. As in 1989, RAS had achieved its earnings through investment income, and especially one-off capital gains on its extensive investment and property portfolio. Consequently, the company would once again be making a substantial transfer of L53.2bn to extraordinary reserves, while keeping the dividend unchanged at L300 and L360 for ordinary and savings shares respectively. Mr Zanni said he hoped underwriting earnings would show improvement this year. San Paolo Finance, the investment banking arm of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, raised net profits by 97 per cent to L20.9bn last year.</p>

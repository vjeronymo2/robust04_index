			<p>BFN     [Text] In Niger, the government is going to call for the  lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the arrested deputies.  Moreover, the 50 people who were taken in for questioning in  Niamey have been released. However, the opposition leaders are  still in prison.    The National Movement for the Society of DevelopmenT, the  former single party, is quite determined to try to have them  released at any cost. Listen to what one of its leaders, Hama  Amadou, had to say on the subject. He spoke to Chantal Lorho:    [Begin recording] [Amadou] The various grassroot structures  are mobilizing and, really, if our leaders are not released,  there may be some really hot days over the next few days.    [Lorho] Does this mean that you are going to call for  demonstrations in the streets?    [Amadou] Absolutely.    [Lorho] Have you already set a precise calendar for your  actions?    [Amadou] Well, when the time comes, everyone will be  informed  about what will happen.    [Lorho] When will that be?    [Amadou] Very soon.    [Lorho] May I ask you why you are in Ouagadougou?    [Amadou] For a particular mission in the framework of the  party, but it has nothing to do with what the authorities in  Niamey are saying.    [Lorho] That is?    [Amadou, laughing] That I have fled and that I have gone to  recruit mercenaries.    [Lorho] Is this what the government in Niamey is saying?    [Amadou] Absolutely, and I find this totally ridiculous. We  have always carried out our actions within the framework of the  normal workings of democracy, not by recruiting mercenaries or  killing anyone. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hewitt ahead by 33% A SUBSTANTIAL increase in activity in the final quarter enabled Hewitt Group, the industrial ceramics and refractories maker, raise pre-tax profits by 33 per cent from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 832,000 in 1992. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 7.76m. Earnings per share grew from 11.4p to 14.8p, while a proposed final dividend of 1.75p makes a total for the year of 3p (2.5p). Mr David Heynes, chairman, said that after a relatively disappointing third quarter there was a sharp improvement as a result of the devaluation of sterling, together with certain customers increasing orders to rebuild their stock to normal levels. Considerable progress had been made at Hewitt's factories in Stoke-on-Trent and Triptis, Germany. The Triptis factory will become fully operational in mid-1993.</p>

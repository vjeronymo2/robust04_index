FMLN leader Juan  Ramon Medrano said that in addition to visiting New York the  delegation will meet with U.S. Government representatives in  Washington to request increased support for the completion of  the agreements' execution.    [Begin Medrano recording] The peace agreements have been  rescheduled to reaffirm the pledges made by the government and  FMLN. This is why the FMLN will travel to the United Nations and  the United States, where it will also request economic and  political support for the execution of the remaining agreements  and also for the 20 March electoral process. [end recording]    The FMLN delegation's trip was agreed upon after the  government's new pledges were disclosed.    [Begin Medrano recording] First, the National Police must be  dismantled, once and for all, by October 1994; second, the  National Civilian Police budget and resources must be improved  by decreasing the Army's, and we must pursue and step up the  land transference process which, had it not been blocked, would  have been completed by now.    We also pledged to support every aspect of the electoral  process; the elections must be as honest as possible, the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal must be modernized, and the  distribution of electoral cards must be stepped up, especially  in municipalities where Nationalist Republican Alliance and  National Coalition Party mayors have hindered the distribution  of electoral cards, which require birth certificates and  identification cards. The government has pledged to move faster  in all of these areas so the elections can truly reflect this  new period of concerted effort. [end recording]    At the meeting with the UN secretary general, the FMLN will  also discuss the climate surrounding the planning of the 20  March elections. It has been disclosed that effective  international verification will be requested to guarantee free  elections and prevent any attempts at fraud.</p>

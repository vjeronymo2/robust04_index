			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) As provided in the MOA, claims offices will recover from automobile insurers, while MTFs will recover from health benefits and medicare supplemental insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) As provided in the MOA, MTFs will obtain insurance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other relevant information from persons receiving inpatient and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outpatient treatment for injuries resulting from an accident. MTF personnel will also screen emergency room logs, clinic records, and patient admission information to identify accident cases. MTFs will refer these cases to claims offices in a timely manner, assist claims offices in obtaining medical records and cost computations, and route requests for medical records from injured parties and attorneys through the RJA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In return, claims offices will notify the MTFs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final disposition of cases referred, deposit money recovered under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to the operations and maintenance account of the MTF that provided the care (see &sect;536.231(d)), and report the amounts deposited to an MTF's account on a monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) As provided in the MOA, the head of each claims office may enter into a local Memorandum of Agreement with his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting Army MTF commander. Such agreements should cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, the degree of staffing each office will provide, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time frames for providing records or information. Such agreements may also provide for the MTF to assist the claims office's medical care recovery effort, either by giving back money deposited by the claims office into the MTF's Operations &amp; Maintenance fund to the claims office, or by providing personnel or other support. Any personnel provided or money returned to the claims office under such an agreement will only be used to support affirmative claims collection efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after 5 November 1990 and recovery is possible from both a health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits insurer and an automobile insurer, the MTF will first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempt to collect from the health insurer. If the MTF cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover the full value of the Government's claim from the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurer, the MTF will forward the claim file to the installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims office for collection from the automobile insurer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recovering and Depositing on Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.227  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Post demand procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Uninsured Motorists. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the tortfeasor is an uninsured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorist, affirmative claims personnel will assert a demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the tortfeasor, and will request suspension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tortfeasor's driving and registration privileges under a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility law if the tortfeasor does not pay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promptly. If collection from the tortfeasor is not feasible,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims personnel will pursue recovery from any State uninsured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorist's fund or, on a medical care claim, from the injured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party's uninsured motorist's coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Periodic review of pending claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injured party's attorney has agreed to assert the Government's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim, claims personnel will review the status of pending claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every 60 days and take follow-up action as appropriate. Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel should periodically contact the injured party's attorney to determine the status of pending cases, and should call or send follow-up letters to an insurer or tortfeasor who fails to respond to a demand or provides an unacceptable response. Follow-up action should be documented on the claims chronology sheet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjusting the amount asserted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The RJA should adjust the amount asserted on a claim as further treatment is provided. The RJA should delay settlement if it appears that extensive treatment is necessary or should consider this in negotiating a settlement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forwarding claims to higher authorities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The RJA or head of a claims office will terminate action or will act on requests for waiver or offers to compromise that are within his or her settlement authority (see &sect;536.216). If a higher settlement authority must act on the claim, the RJA will forward a completed worksheet to the area claims office (if that office has authority to take action) or to USARCS as appropriate. When time is of the essence in securing a settlement, an RJA may contact USARCS telephonically for authorization to waive or compromise a claim. Prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the RJA should contact USARCS for guidance on disposing of any claim which cannot be recovered in full, compromised, terminated or litigated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.229  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settling affirmative claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claims personnel will reflect the basis for any settlements other than payment in full in the claims file. Note that under some circumstances, settlement authority may not waive or compromise a claim that he or she would normally have authority to act on (see &sect;536.216(g)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

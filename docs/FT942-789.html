			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / The shake-up at the White House: 'Mack' falls as Clinton comes under fire The role of White House chief of staff is ill-defined, and different occupants have performed it in very different styles. One function they have shared, however, is to take the rap when a presidency seems to be going astray. 'It's a little bit like being in the Secret Service. Sometimes you take the bullet,' said Mr Jack Watson, who served President Jimmy Carter as chief of staff. Since Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty played with future President Bill Clinton at Miss Mary's kindergarten in Hope, Arkansas, his departure is being managed with more grace than is usual on such occasions; indeed, it was Mr McLarty himself who suggested that he be replaced by Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director. Nevertheless, the bullets are coming thick and fast in Mr Clinton's direction, and Mr McLarty must be hoping his departure will stop some of them. His lack of decisiveness in foreign policy continues to irk the US's allies and to worry US voters, even if administration officials argue, with some justification, that much of the apparent confusion is unavoidable in the uncertainties of the post-Cold War era. In economic affairs, too, Mr Clinton is getting little of the credit for the current recovery and much of the blame for the rise in interest rates. Overall, the percentage of those questioned in a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll who expressed confidence that Mr Clinton has the right personal qualities to be president has declined from 47 per cent when he took office to 30 per cent last week. The same poll showed only 37 per cent found him to be very or mostly honest - a better showing than Mr Ross Perot, the eccentric Texas billionaire politician, or than the news media, but worse than Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate. Mr McLarty joins the long list of Mr Clinton's old friends and fellow Arkansans who have become casualties of his administration's battles with itself and with Congress, often to be replaced by politicians more experienced in Washington's ways such as Mr Panetta. In outlining the reasons for the reshuffle, Mr Clinton listed a long legislative agenda that included health care reform, the crime bill, enactment of the Uruguay Round Gatt agreement, an overhaul of campaign finance and lobbying laws and a remake of the welfare system. It was Mr McLarty, however, who mentioned November's mid-term congressional elections, in which the president's Democratic party is staring at sweeping losses, as the key to his decision to step aside. Both Mr Clinton and his fellow Democrats need some legislative successes - especially an anti-crime bill and a reform of the health care system that is sweeping enough to justify claims of victory - to lay before a disaffected electorate if they are to avoid a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Republicans, possibly losing control of the Senate or even the House of Representatives. Mr Panetta's task as the new chief of staff is to bring a new discipline and focus to the White House as it tackles these issues. Whether he succeeds, however, will depend to a great extent on whether he can impart the same values to the president.</p>

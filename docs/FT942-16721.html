			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Gowrings recovers to Pounds 251,000 Sustained growth from its leisure and food services operations offset a downturn on the motor side and enabled Gowrings to turn round from a restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 82,000 to a Pounds 251,000 profit in 1993. Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 54m (Pounds 52m), while profit included exceptional credits of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 42,000) - mainly a surplus on disposal of fixed assets. Earnings per share were 2.29p (1.4p losses) and the final dividend is an unchanged 1p for a same-again total of 2p. Motor division profits fell to Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 406,000) as a result of lower manufacturer's discount and incentives and Pounds 99,000 of redundancy costs. The leisure side, however, lifted profits from Pounds 293,000 to Pounds 522,000, with good results from the BurgerKing restaurants and an improvement at Park Homes. The company said trading for the last quarter of 1993 was markedly better. This trend had been maintained in the first quarter of this year, with both the motor and leisure divisions showing an improvement over last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Congratulatory message" to officers and troops of the </F> Khmer Royal Armed Forces; dated 19 March -- read by announcer]    [Text] Since its inception, and despite the difficult  preliminary stage of organizing and building them, all units of  the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF], like all levels of our  administratiive structures, have united and worked to overcome  all kinds of obstacles to carry out their duties of defending  peace, national unity, territorial integrity, and the people's  security and stability. They have contributed immensely to the  restoration and development of the country and nation toward  peace and prosperity under the clear-sighted initiative of His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, our highly revered king.    Over the past few months, many KRAF officers and troops and  all levels of administrative officials have made great  sacrifices and achieved a lot in carrying out their duties, both  in the country and in remote areas along the common border in  the Phnum Chhat, Anlung Veng, and Palin regions.    As heads of the royal government and KRAF co-commanders, I,  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister, and  Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister, would like to express  sincere and warmest admiration for the patriotic spirit and the  brilliant achievements the officers and men of all KRAF units  and all levels of our administrative officials have made to  overcome and achieve in this noble cause. The royal government  and the KRAF co- commanders consider that the great sacrifices  recently made by the KRAF and our officials are a precious  contribution to the cause of peace, national unity, national  unification, and creating conditions for the restoration and  development of our country and nation and to end the disaster of  innocent people throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia.    We would like to bow and pay respect to the souls of  officers  and men who have courageously sacrificed their lives in carrying  out this noble duty and would like to express and share sad and  most regretful condolences with their families. We would also  like to affirm that your noble (?sacrifice) will be engraved in  the golden book of the nation's history.    We wish those who are hospitalized a quick recovery so that  they can return to their families and units.    Please accept the five Buddhist blessings of longevity,  social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment.    [Signed] Norodom Ranariddh, five-golden-star general    Hun Sen, five-golden-star general    [Dated] 19 March 1994</p>

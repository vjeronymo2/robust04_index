			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Debts soar among Russian enterprises RUSSIA'S enterprises had piled up Rbs1.43 trillion (million million) in debts to each other and to the banks by May 1, the central bank said yesterday. This sum is greater than the country's gross national product for the first quarter. Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, the bank's vice-chairman, said inter-enterprise debts were increasing at the rate of Rbs27.5bn a day. Talks are under way between the government, central bank and parliament on ways to solve this rapidly gathering crisis - including debt forgiveness and a bigger budget deficit. Yesterday, the government more than doubled teachers' and doctors' pay after they had threatened to strike for a 10-fold increase. The two groups are among the poorest in Russia, earning about Rbs700 a month (the minimum wage has just been increased to Rbs900). The government also announced plans to levy import taxes of 5-10 per cent to reduce the import bill. These will come into effect in August, and they follow a 13 per cent increase in first-quarter imports, compared with a year ago. That pushed the balance of payments deficit for the period to Dollars 2bn. Mr Pyotr Aven, foreign economic relations minister, told Interfax news agency that the government was also considering an extra 28 per cent VAT on imports. Meanwhile, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, central bank chairman, said the system of trade between the main republics of the former Soviet Union was increasingly breaking down.</p>

Denktas today received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's assistant envoy for Cyprus. John Paul Cavanaugh, UN  peace force adviser, and Necati Munir Ertekun, presidential  adviser, also attended the meeting, which is continuing through  lunch as well.    Denktas remarked before the meeting that the sides must  converge on a common point if a solution is to be reached in  Cyprus. We have not yet reached such a point and it is still  early for this, Denktas added. Reacting to recent Kliridhis  statements, the president explained that Kliridhis is defending  his own cause and this is natural. Denktas noted that the  Turkish Cypriots, in turn, defend their own just cause in their  own way and will continue to do so.    Asked if he is hopeful, Denktas said that in order for that  to happen, the two sides must first meet at the negotiating  table and bilateral talks must begin. In reply to another  question, Denktas reported that the Cyprus problem may be  discussed with Turkey at the beginning of February, and that an  assessment will be conducted with the government and the  Republican Assembly before that.    In his statement before the meeting, Feissel noted that Joe  Clark's arrival was postponed in an effort to schedule a  suitable time to meet with officials in Turkey, Greece, and  Cyprus.</p>

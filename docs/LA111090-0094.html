			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYLMAR CLAIMS TITLE AS BROOKINS ROMPS  </P> <P> Running back Tobaise Brookins gained 238 yards in 36 carries and scored three  fourth-quarter touchdowns as Sylmar High clinched the East Valley League title  with a 45-28 victory at Poly.  </P> <P> The game had been close until Brookins broke loose in the fourth quarter.  Sylmar (8-0, 6-0 in league play) led, 24-21, late in the third quarter with  Poly (6-3, 4-2) about to receive a Sylmar punt. But a clipping call charged on  a Poly lineman before the ball hit the ground gave the ball back to Sylmar.  Nine plays later, Brookins dashed for a 19-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> Sylmar then recovered a fumbled kickoff to set up Brookins' next score, a  two-yard run. ADAM BENSON  </P></p>

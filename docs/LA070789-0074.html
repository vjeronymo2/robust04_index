			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON;  </P> <P> EVERT SHOWN THE WAY OUT IN SEMIFINAL;  </P> <P> AFTER HER 6-2, 6-1 LOSS TO GRAF, A LAST WAVE FROM CENTRE COURT  </P> <P> At 12 minutes past 3 on a humid Thursday afternoon, Chris Evert sat in a green  chair at the side of Centre Court and looked around one last time.  </P> <P> She took off her wristband and packed it in her bag. Then she put her racket  inside, zipped up the bag, toweled herself off and slipped into a white jacket.  </P> <P> A curtsy, a wave and a wry smile to her family sitting in the stands, and Evert  was gone.  </P> <P> In 1 hour 8 minutes of tennis, an era passed at Wimbledon, where Evert is not  likely to play again.  </P> <P> It was a graceful, but not unexpected, exit for the 34-year-old Evert, ushered  forcefully off the grass courts by Steffi Graf, who scored a 6-2, 6-1 semifinal  victory.  </P> <P> Next for Graf, the preeminent force in women's tennis, is Martina Navratilova,  who has shared the era with Evert and may also share her fate in the final.  </P> <P> Navratilova fought a swirling wind and Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden in her  semifinal match before beating them both, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.  </P> <P> There will be another day for Navratilova at Wimbledon, but almost certainly  not for Evert. Afterward, she said she is 90% sure her Wimbledon career is  over.  </P> <P> "I would be shocked if I came back and played this tournament next year," Evert  said. "I don't know, it would take a transplant or something."  </P> <P> What kind of transplant?  </P> <P> "Here," Evert said, tapping her forehead.  </P> <P> Evert did not go out quietly against Graf, although the score indicated little  resistence. There were a few chances for Evert to make the score closer but not  to change the outcome.  </P> <P> Down a break in the first set, she held three break points for 2-4, but Graf  saved them all. At 0-1 in the second set, Evert missed another break point and  blew two more break points for 2-2.  </P> <P> After that, Graf offered no more opportunities. She held at 30 for 5-1 and aced  Evert on game point. In what was the last game of the match, Graf broke Evert  for the fifth and final time.  </P> <P> This was neither the kind of tennis Evert had played when younger, nor the kind  that Graf had seen early in their rivalry. Evert won their first six meetings,  but now Graf has won eight straight.  </P> <P> "For one thing, which was a little bit different, usually (in the past) she  knew what to do on the big points and she had more experience and everything,"  Graf said.  </P> <P> "(But) today there were a lot of close games, and I was down a couple of break  points and I always managed to get those points. That's where her strength  usually was and what has become more or less my strength now."  </P> <P> On the second match point, Evert double-faulted. That is not the best way to  end 18 years at Wimbledon, but Evert certainly enjoyed many other moments.  </P> <P> She won the title three times -- in 1974, 1976 and 1981. From Evert's first  match in 1972, a three-set victory over Valerie Ziegenfuss, to her defeat  Thursday, Evert's Wimbledon record is 96-15.  </P> <P> In 18 years at Wimbledon, Evert reached the final 10 times. Graf made sure that  Evert had only a small chance of getting there again.  </P> <P> "She's so quick and she's so strong, and obviously that's why she's No. 1,"  Evert said. "She was just a lot better than I was today -- today and every  day."  </P> <P> There may be no more days for Evert to send eerily efficient two-fisted  backhands into the deepest corner of grass on Centre Court. Maybe that's why  she waved as she did while she walked away. It was not something Evert usually  does. It seemed to be a wave goodby.  </P> <P> Billie Jean King once told Evert that she had made a conscious effort to do  something special to savor the moment of her last match on the most famous  court in tennis, and Evert seemed to be imitating the symbol of the era before  hers.  </P> <P> "A lot of things were going through my head," Evert said. "It could be my last  time, you know, on Centre Court. And just that, you know -- Centre Court is the  greatest court in the world, and I'll always remember it.  </P> <P> "I think that the older I got, the more it meant to me to play on Centre Court  and to play Wimbledon. You know, when you're young, I always knew in the back  of my mind I had time on my side.  </P> <P> "But I think the last few years, I think I've really kind of looked around a  little bit more and realized that isn't going to be around me for much longer.  You know, it's not in my future plans. And sometimes you appreciate things a  little more when you get older."  </P> <P> Navratilova, two years younger than Evert, hasn't played Graf since losing to  her in last year's Wimbledon final. In getting there again, Navratilova had  little trouble with the unseeded Lindqvist after winning the first-set  tiebreaker.  </P> <P> A change of tactics helped. Navratilova stopped chipping service returns on her  backhand and began swinging through the ball.  </P> <P> Lindqvist, the first Swedish woman to play in a Wimbledon semifinal, led the  tiebreaker, 5-4, but lost her serve twice, and Navratilova closed it out with a  service winner.  </P> <P> Navratilova, seeded second, lost only two points on her serve in the second  set, and both were on double faults.  </P> <P> Actually, maybe the biggest problem Navratilova had during the match was  swallowing. Saliva stuck in her throat and caused her a few anxious moments.  </P> <P> "I was just breathing and it went down the wrong hole," Navratilova said. "My  stomach was a mess, tears running down my face, I thought, 'What else can  happen to me on Centre Court?'  </P> <P> "I've been through it all. I've been hit in the head by a ball, I've whiffed a  ball, my shirt fell off. I was just walking and all of a sudden I can't  breathe. I was just a mess."  </P> <P> Navratilova said it's difficult for her to think about a Wimbledon without  Evert.  </P> <P> Beginning in 1976, Navratilova and Evert have played nine matches at Wimbledon,  and Navratilova won seven times. They met in five finals, and Navratilova won  them all.  </P> <P> "I can't really fathom that because we have been going at it for so long that a  piece of me would be gone with her that's tucked away, that only she and I  share," Navratilova said. "That will always be there though, regardless of  whether she's playing or not."  </P> <P> For Evert, there was a feeling of relief at having lived up to her fourth  seeding, as well as the realization that there could be no disgrace in losing  to the top-seeded player.  </P> <P> "I thought after the match, after a couple of those rallies, 'Boy, if I was 10  years younger,' " Evert said.  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> The top two U.S. doubles teams won their quarterfinal matches and headed toward  a possible showdown in the final. The No. 1-seeded team of Rick Leach and Jim  Pugh defeated Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann of Australia, 3-6, 7-5, 4-6,  6-1, 6-3. Second-seeded Ken Flach and Robert Seguso beat Pieter Aldrich and  Danie Visser of South Africa, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. . . . Next for Leach  and Pugh are Javier Frana of Argentina and Leonardo Lavalle of Mexico. Flach  and Seguso will play the third-seeded team of John Fitzgerald of Australia and  Anders Jarryd of Sweden. "We're staying mentally stable because it's all fresh  for us," Leach said. "We really haven't been through this before." Leach and  Pugh lost in the round of 16 last year.  </P></p>

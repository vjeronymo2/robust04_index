			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets: Fewer pots of gold in media land - London Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, had a disappointing week. He found out that, for the first time in ten years as head of the Hollywood studio, he would receive no annual bonus, mostly because EuroDisney's losses in 1993 have hurt the US parent. In 1992 he picked up Dollars 6.7m for services to Disney's profits. He was not the only media magnate to have a depressing start to 1994. On the other side of the pond Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the smaller but perfectly formed LWT, has been trying to cobble together a band of brothers to repel Granada's boarding party. The complex negotiations involved trying to tie together LWT, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, and Anglia in a loose federation until a further change in the media rules allowed a full merger. Unfortunately the pantomime horse proved rather too difficult to stitch together and LWT is vulnerable to Granada's bid. Sir Christopher will fight on the company's record and the argument that, as a pure television company, LWT's shares will be more highly rated than Granada's in the continuing media hype. Yet the sector has already been re-rated and fund managers may find the profit on their LWT holdings hard to resist. The shares ended the week up 60p to 666p. Anglia, still widely rumoured to be in the sights of Lord Hollick's MAI, also rose 44p to 472p. Intrigue over the future of ITV companies was given another twist by the announcement that the government is to review the rules which restrict the cross ownership between newspaper groups and television companies. While the results may not be know until the autumn, the market was still speculating that the Mirror and Telegraph Groups, Associated and United Newspapers, Pearson (owners of the Financial Times), Reed, the Guardian and Uncle Tom Cobbley are all about to buy television companies. Small wonder then that media shares have maintained their Absolutely Fabulous ratings. Overall, the market had a turbulent time. The FT-SE 100 index fell heavily at the start of the week on worries that interest rate cuts might be delayed. Gilts also fared badly with losses of 1 1/2 points in the first two days. Yet worries over Christmas sales volumes, following Dixons results on Thursday, reignited interest rate hopes. The company had not managed to sell as many video games as in 1992, prompting fears that it had not been a merry Christmas. Gilts bounced  5/8 of a point on Friday and the FT-SE 100 finished up 27.6 points on the week. Dixons, however, fell 41p to 244p and dragged the sector with it. There was also suspicion that shenanigans in the futures market, which is based on the 100 index, were responsible for some of the volatility in blue chip shares. By contrast second-line stocks, tracked by the FT-SE Mid 250 index, had a fine week rising 121.2 points. Paul Walton, strategist at James Capel, says that between September 1992, when sterling left the ERM, and September 1993, smaller stocks outperformed blue chip shares substantially. That was mainly because interest rate cuts and expectations of a UK recovery helped smaller cyclical manufacturing companies more than large drug companies or food retailers. In the last quarter of 1993, the pattern reversed as overseas buyers took a shine to big UK stocks. Walton believes the equity market will continue to do well in the year's first half and that smaller companies will take the lead. Defining a company took a new turn this week as the revised FT-SE Actuaries classifications were introduced. In general they were welcomed as a sensible rationalisation of the system, as the structure of the market has changed substantially since the last revision more than 20 years ago. Some small investment impacts had been expected. James Capel says that the roping together of the various utilities - accounting for 14.5 per cent of the market by value - will make fund managers' recent concentration on these stocks obvious and they may thus adjust their holdings downwards. Utilities have underperformed the market over the past month, but it is hard to determine whether that is because of the new classifications or other effects. What has been clear, at least to those who work in the City, is the debate over who should cover which shares in the new system. Changes may well give rise to confusion when fund managers vote on which analysts are doing well in the annual opinion polls. Since such matters count towards annual bonuses, the issue has attracted more than a little interest. Another focus of attention was Eurotunnel, which reached agreement with its banks on further fundraising. That clears the the way for the company's second rights issue since digging started. And, with the shares rallying strongly in the enthusiasm before the tunnel's opening in May, the issue, due before then, may get away at a surprisingly high price. Eurotunnel ended the week at 636p, up 26p. Brightness in the crude oil price also brought a little winter cheer to the oil sector. Hopes that Opec would agree to cut production at the end of January helped the sector, with BP up 12p to 372p. Exploration companies, more exposed to the oil price, fared even better with Enterprise up 21p at 469p. It was also a happy new year for Ladbroke, which had been favoured in several newspapers tips of the year columns. On Friday, Cyril Stein, who stepped down as the company's executive chairman at the end of last year, announced that he was also relinquishing his post as a non-executive director. The shares rose 14p on the day to 194p, which seems a slightly mean reward for a generation's work. But as Michael Eisner would ruefully agree, you are not in the leisure business for fun.</p>

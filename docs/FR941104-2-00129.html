			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An expanded contract is defined as a contract which has become enlarged during the current fiscal year, through the assumption of additional programs previously operated by the BIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Determining CSF Need for Ongoing/Existing Contracts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CSF for ongoing and existing contracts will be determined using the following criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. All TPA contracted programs in FY 1994 and continued in FY 1995, including contracted programs moved to TPA in FY 1995, such as New Tribes, HIP, and Road Maintenance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Direct program funding increases due to inflation adjustments and general budget increases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. TPA programs started or expanded in FY 1995 that are a result of a change in priorities from other already contracted programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. CSF differentials associated with tribally operated schools that receive indirect costs through the application of the administrative cost grant formula. These differentials are to be calculated in accordance with the criteria prescribed in the Choctaw decision dated September 18, 1992, issued by the Contracting Officer, Eastern Area Office. Tribes that received differential funding under this category in FY 1994 are eligible to receive funding from this account in FY 1995. Tribes that did not receive differential funding under this category in FY 1994 are eligible for funding from the ISD fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. CSF will be distributed to the Office of Self-Governance for a portion of the funding needs for new Self-Governance compacts. The FY 1995 level of funding provided to the Office of Self-Governance will be at the same level the tribes were funded by the area office(s) in FY 1994. The level of FY 1995 CSF provided to the Office of Self-Governance for any new compacts will be reduced to the extent that CSF requirements are being met by the Area Office(s) for continued/residual 638 contracting activity. All additional CSF requirements will be met from the ISD fund in accordance with the criteria established below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Funds available for Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) programs or reprogrammed from ICWA to other programs will be considered ongoing for the purpose of payment of contract support costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The FY 1995 Appropriation Act does not authorize the use of CSF to pay prior year shortfalls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Programs funded from sources other than those listed above that were contracted in FY 1994 and are to be contracted in FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Determining CSF Need for New and Expanded Contracts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CSF for new and expanded contracts will be determined using the following criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. All contracts initially entered into in FY 1995 that transfer the operation of a program that was operated by the BIA in the previous fiscal year to the tribe, and does not fall under the definitions described in numbers 3 and 6 above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. All expansions of existing contracts that call for the tribe to assume more or additional programs previously operated by the BIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. CSF differentials associated with a grant school operated by the tribe that did not receive differential funding for the school in FY 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. New and expanded program assumptions under Self-Governance compacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Hilda A.

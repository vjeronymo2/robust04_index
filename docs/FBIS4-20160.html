			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Henrique Cymerman and Oriol Domingo report: "Jordi Pujol </F> Demands Turnaround in Autonomy as Condition for CiU's Supporting  Government"]    [Excerpt] Tel Aviv/Barcelona -- Premier Jordi Pujol  explained yesterday that "Convergence and Union's support for  the government requires that, in addition to the conditions of  combating corruption -- which is a condition which the Spanish  Socialist Workers Party sets itself and which requires  convincing conduct by the government -- and of maintaining a  policy which favors the productive economy, there be fulfilled  the condition of a real impetus to autonomy, which is a matter  of absolute priority for which I set no deadlines but which must  not be delayed."    The Catalan premier gave these explanations in Tel Aviv  during a two-day stay on the occasion of the European basketball  final, of which he took advantage in order to maintain economic  and political contacts.  <H5>  Warning </H5>   After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin,  Pujol told journalists at the Spanish Embassy that he "feels a  need to point out" that the support for the government has been  constant and thoroughgoing, and that an effective change has  been achieved in economic policy, but as far as the turnaround  in autonomy is concerned, "the results are very limited, and I  would not like any member of the government to believe that the  autonomy sphere is something secondary."

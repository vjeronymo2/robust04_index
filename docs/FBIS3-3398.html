			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Jiangshan (1776 3068 0810) and Gao Shuhua </F> (7559 3219 5478)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- At the Beijing  International Hotel this morning, Sun Weiben, chairman of the  Heilongjiang Provincial People's Congress [PPC] Standing  Committee, and Lu Chuanzan, chairman of the Hebei PPC Standing  Committee, answered Chinese and foreign reporters' questions on  issues concerning local people's congresses.    Commenting on difficulties in supervising "local  governments,  courts, and procuratorates," Sun Weiben said that the biggest  problems are people's concepts, understandings, and habits. On  the one hand, people's congresses have to develop their skills  in executing their supervisory tasks; on the other hand, "local  governments, courts, and procuratorates" need an adjusting and  accepting process for such supervision. He said that at present  they are gradually resolving the problems.    Chinese and foreign reporters were concerned what powers  local people's congresses have and how they use them. Lu  Chuanzan provided a four-part answer to a reporter's question.  He said: First, the Hebei PPC has made major progress in  legislative work. As of the end of 1993, the Hebei PPC and its  standing committee have formulated and approved 92 local laws  and regulations; have made 19 legal resolutions and decisions;  and have approved 6 autonomous regulations for autonomous  counties. The total number was 117. Second, the PPC exercises  its supervisory power over "local governments, courts, and  procuratorates," mainly by hearing and deliberating their work  reports, and by organizing deputies to inspect and examine the  enforcement of laws and regulations, and to evaluate their work  performance. Third, the PPC discusses and decides major issues  affecting its various administrative areas. Fourth, the PPC  chooses, appoints, and dismisses leaders of local state organs  according to law.    A reporter asked: What issues has local legislation  emphasized? Sun Weiben answered: Between 1979 and 1993, the  Heilongjiang PPC has formulated 98 local laws and regulations,  mainly relating to economic tasks. The number of economic laws  and regulations accounted for 60 percent of the total number of  formulated regulations. Besides, our legislative work has also  stressed promoting scientific and technological progresses and  achievements. The general requirement is that our local  legislation on economic tasks should basically enhance the  establishment of a socialist market economy.    A reporter, interested in Sun Weiben's concurrently holding  posts as secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party  Committee and chairman of the Heilongjiang PPC, asked him how he  handled the relations between the two posts. Sun Weiben said:  The two posts, in principle, do not conflict with each other.  Both the party's guiding principle and the people's congress's  work objectives aim at the same end. As the party committee and  the executive organs differ in their natures and work styles,  their functions are not interchangeable. The provincial party  committee supervises "local governments, courts, and  procuratorates," mainly by implementing political and  ideological principles; whereas the PPC mainly supervises the  enforcement of laws and regulations and work performance of  "local governments, courts, and procuratorates."</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (18): Cost-cutting path to profitability - Forestry industry The dark days seem to be over in Swedish forestry, but it is no thanks to the market. The country's leading pulp and paper groups have forged a path back to profitability, despite the widespread overcapacity which continues to afflict the industry and a two-year downward spiral in prices. Any hope that the sharp depreciation of the krona would bring rapid gains has already been dispelled. A combination of cost-cutting, lower interest rates and a strong dollar have brought the turnround which the market has failed to provide. They explain why Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, will be back in profit this year after last year's SKr1.36bn loss and why SCA, Sweden's second-biggest forestry group, is looking for profits of SKr1.1bn after a SKr451m surplus in 1992. MoDo, the third-largest company, will improve its result after last year's SKr1.7bn loss, but a deficit of about SKr600m is still anticipated. Mr Jan Remrod, director-general of the Swedish pulp and paper association, acknowledges the general turnround, but says profitability is still not satisfactory. Pointing to combined industry profits of SKr12bn in 1989 - this year the figure is more likely to be in the SKr1bn-2bn range - he notes 'there is still a long way to go.' Cost-cutting has been the single biggest factor in the revival. Stora estimates it will have cut costs by SKr4bn in two years by the end of this year. Most of the sum derives from staff reductions, but there has also been a SKr1bn benefit from lower wood prices. Similar factors have driven down MoDo's costs base by SKr1.5bn since 1990. Additional help has come from the strong dollar, which has brought two benefits. It has decreased the flow of North American exports to Europe, while also enabling Swedish producers to increase their exports to non-European markets. Vastly improved as the Swedish competitive position now is, there are several reasons why 1993 has turned out to be a more disappointing year than was anticipated. The main factors have been the recession in key European markets and the continuing collapse in hard currency prices, which has eroded many of the anticipated devaluation gains. Another reason for the disappointment is that some of the big Swedish groups have a high percentage of production based in 'hard currency' countries such as France and Germany, following an acquisitions binge in the late 1980s. This has made devaluation a disadvantage rather than an advantage in these areas. Stora, for example, has 20 per cent of its production based in Germany, 8 per cent in France and 5 per cent in Belgium. The sharp contrast between the improvement being experienced in Sweden and difficulties being faced on the continent was highlighted by MoDo, when it indicated at the nine-month stage that Swedish operating profit had risen by SKr814m to SKr890m, while operating losses in France doubled to SKr369m from SKr183m. The Swedish forestry sector has responded to the situation in a number of ways. First, there has been an effort to compensate for the depressed state of the European market by lifting exports to other areas. In percentage terms the development is striking, even though the EC remains by far Sweden's most important export market, accounting for 76 per cent of total exports. In the first 10 months, deliveries to the EC fell 0.3 per cent to 4.49m tonnes, while exports to other markets rose 20.7 per cent to 1.43m tonnes. Secondly, forestry groups have virtually suspended investment in new capacity: where they have invested it has been to improve product quality and for environmental reasons. Finally, towards the end of the year there was a concerted effort to lift prices. Stora led the way, announcing increases for a range of products including pulp, newsprint, fine paper, and coated magazine paper (LWC). It calculates that every 5 per cent average rise in prices adds SKr1.4bn to the bottom line. A 5 per cent increase in volumes, meanwhile, only adds SKr500m. The key question for 1994 is whether the price rises will stick. In some cases, the reasons for believing that they will have less to do with market factors, than with financial ones. In pulp, for example, prices have fallen so far, that virtually all mills are now operating with negative cash flow. Numerous observers express cautious optimism that prices have already stopped falling and they even suggest they have started to rise again for products such as newsprint and LWC. 'There are many signs that we have seen the worst,' says Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, president of Stora. If the judgment is correct, it will increase the momentum of the recovery that already looks set to make 1994 a better year for the Swedish forestry industry than 1993. Yet, caution remains simply because it is still unclear how Europe's economy will perform next year. Besides, the scope for further cost-cutting is limited, and pressures are building up for higher wood prices and wages. Swedish forestry groups are determined to resist such demands, arguing that competitive gains have too easily been squandered in the past. In any case, they stress they need to retain financial muscle to respond to challenges such as recycling. It is partly to meet these challenges that SCA and MoDo both announced hefty rights issues in 1993 and, gratifyingly, found them fully subscribed. It may also explain why the Swedish government announced a significant restructuring of its own interests in the sector as a prelude to its biggest privatisation to date. The aim is to merge Assi, Doman and Ncb early next year to create Sweden's fourth-largest forestry group and one of the top 10 in Europe. Following this, a 49 per cent stake in the combined company will be sold, mainly to the Swedish public, with targeted receipts of between SKr5bn and SKr8bn.</p>

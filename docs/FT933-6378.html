			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Prices ease as Germans stand firm on interest rates EUROPEAN government bond markets eased following Germany's decision to leave its key rates unchanged yesterday. However, the falls reflected token selling rather than investor panic. The general view among investors was that the German Bundesbank would cut rates; whether it does so now or at the next council meeting in two weeks' time is academic. However, Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, argued that yesterday may have been the last chance before November for a cut in German rates. The Bundesbank has said it would not ease if money supply was high. The money supply number for August is likely to be inflated by the heavy foreign exchange intervention seen earlier in the month. Thereafter, there could be delays in policy decisions until Mr Hans Tietmeyer has taken over as the new Bundesbank head. UK economists had anticipated a quarter-point cut in the discount rate, and on Wednesday there were reports that leading German economists expected a half-point reduction. However, suspicion developed early yesterday that the Bundesbank might stand firm. Market-makers had taken a more cautious line than before the last council meeting and, as yesterday's meeting dragged on, more and more traders adjusted their books and pushed government bond markets lower. By the time a decision was announced - just before 1pm London time - the consensus had shifted and positions were fully hedged. Bund futures for September on Liffe closed only 11 basis points lower, at 97.44, with turnover of only 82,000 contracts, no higher than average. FRENCH debt prices sagged around midday, but recovered later and the yield on 10-year French paper remained some 5 basis points below its German counterpart. Some economists argued that Germany's decision to leave rates unchanged was a gesture of support for France. The refusal to shift monetary policy at the end of July intensified the heavy French franc selling and led, a few days later, to the crisis within the ERM. To ease yesterday when the French currency had a margin of more than than 30 centimes over its ERM limits could have been construed as a political snub. The Bank of France left its 6.75 per cent intervention rate unchanged at yesterday's securities repurchase tender. Investors, preferring the low inflation prospects signalled by the long end of the yield curve rather than the rate prospects reflected by the short end, bought 10-year maturities. In spite of a slide in the currency, OAT futures traded on the Matif rose 4 basis points to 122.98 by the official close. The contract traded lower after official dealing. In London, long-dated government bonds slipped slightly before recovering later to close flat on balance. Long gilt futures for September were  9/32 off at one stage, but closed marginally weaker. US TREASURY prices posted sharp gains at the long end yesterday, pushing the 30-year yield close to 6 per cent. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 102 1/32 , yielding 6.099 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was only slightly firmer, up  1/16 at 100 3/32 , to yield 3.809 per cent. The day's economic news - an 8,000 increase in weekly initial jobless claims  -had little impact on market sentiment. Consequently, prices only edged higher at the opening, and the only area of activity in the morning was from buyers picking up securities as part of interest-rate swap business, and from holders of mortgage-backed securities. Prices were also supported in early trading by the lack of supply. In the afternoon, however, the long end took off amid reports of heavy buying by commodity and mutual funds, short covering by dealers, and strong futures-related demand. There was also speculation that the Brazilian government was buying bonds to back its debt plan.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (6): Adjusting to modern needs - Politics 'DOES this mean a split in the coalition?' reporters asked Thai government leaders barely a week after the new cabinet had been announced on September 29. The context of the question was unimportant. It happened to be about one party's decision to make public its ministers' assets, a move not emulated by the other four parties. But it could have been about the proposal to elect provincial governors, or any other subject being debated as the new government prepared its policy statement for parliament. Thai politics had returned to normal. The public would complain about the bickering and self-promotion among members of parliament. The urban electorate would complain about vote-buying in the countryside. Academics and other intellectuals would complain about superficial policy debates and decision-making. And economists would complain of 'rent-seeking' - corruption in various guises - and unwise interventions in commodity markets. The urban elite and expatriates would regret the departure of Mr Anand Panyarachun, twice the caretaker prime minister. Activists would pester the government to investigate the fate of about 200 people who went missing during the military clamp-down on pro-democracy demonstrators in May. But property and stock market speculators celebrated the prospect of a return to the bullish markets that they had enjoyed before the Gulf War and the February 23, 1991 coup. Some of this enthusiasm was dampened with the eruption of a share manipulation scandal in mid-November that sent the stock market index tumbling. Nevertheless, Thailand's messy politics no longer entirely destroy confidence. Its open government and freedom of speech, with all their disadvantages, are often seen as attractions for investors. Recent history shows that despite its weaknesses, the political system is adjusting to the modern needs of an increasingly sophisticated society. The September 13 general election was the second this year. The first, on March 22, brought to the premiership Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, leader of last year's coup. The military's claim at the time of the coup that they had no intention of retaining power for themselves was discredited and mass demonstrations in May led to a bloody military suppression that ultimately forced Gen Suchinda out of power. Following the intervention of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Thai government was once again in the hands of Mr Anand Panyarachun, the independent-minded businessman and former diplomat who was first appointed after last year's coup. This time, Mr Anand set about reducing the power of the military through legislation and a reshuffle of the top brass before handing over to an elected government. For the time being, the military are back in their barracks. At some future date, their return to politics cannot be ruled out, but the trend of the past decades is for this to be increasingly difficult. The results of the September 13 general election have to be interpreted with care because they indicate mixed and often conflicting tendencies. One outcome was the emergence of the Democrat Party as the largest in Parliament. The Democrats are probably the closest in Thailand to a genuine political party because they rely less on the domination of individuals. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat leader and new prime minister, is considered to be honest. His modest lifestyle contrasts with that of many of his parliamentary colleagues. Mr Chuan eschews the trappings of power of his predecessors, accepting a modest police escort but preferring his personal Toyota to his official Mercedes. Mr Chuan and his coalition partners have appointed several unelected ministers to oversee the economy, a move partly in response to recognition that parliament lacks individuals with skills in economic management. Many believe that these ministers will stand in the next election, further strengthening electoral politics. The welcome that Mr Chuan received also reflects a growing concern with the more corrupt side of parliamentary politics. Corruption was used as an excuse for the military's overthrow of the Chatichai Choonhavan government in last year's coup and even though it was not the military's real motive, it was one reason why public criticism of the coup in the capital was initially muted. The debate over the public declaration of ministers' assets reflects the growing concern with corruption. The law already requires ministers to report their assets to the Counter Corruption Commission. One party, Palang Dharma, which has placed particular emphasis on clean politics, has made its ministers' assets reports public. Coalition partners have described the Palang Dharma move as a publicity gimmick. Corruption remains a concern partly because the Thai system still relies largely on patronage and influence, with little emphasis on policy issues. The modern, urban, middle classes that played such a dominant role in the overthrow of the military in May want an open parliamentary system that concentrates on reasoned decision-making. They realise, paradoxically, that their achievement has actually been to swing the balance towards the rural electorate whose criteria for choosing MPs are not approved in the cities. Despite a minor shift by voters that brought to power the parties involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations in May, the September 13 election appears to have seen as much if not more vote-buying than its predecessors. Rural voters are so alienated from Thailand's centralised state machinery that they often have to rely on the skills of manipulators and influence peddlers if the villages are to gain a share of the country's resources. A candidate's skill and generosity in handing out money at election time can be a measure of his ability to peddle influence, and to use the networks of personal patronage to bring asphalted roads, electricity and water to the villages. Political patronage comes in many forms, and sometimes it is associated with violence. One Thai academic privately describes the country's rural MPs as 'hoodlums in suits'. As with so much of Thai politics, however, the colourful summary does not accurately reflect the complex reality. Others argue that rural voters are acting rationally when they accept money or even vote for candidates supported by the local godfathers. The only way to reduce the unappetising aspects of electoral politics is reform, to give local government more power, resources and accountability, according to this argument. It is an argument that is beginning to gain acceptance; most parties promised during the September election campaign to reform local government. Coalition parties are divided, however, on whether to start at the village or district level, or to begin with directly elected provincial governors to replace officials currently appointed almost in colonial fashion by the Interior Ministry in Bangkok. The Palang Dharma party of Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang, which took a more radical anti-military line in the May protests, wants early elections for provincial governors. Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, New Aspiration Party leader, interior minister, and former army chief - and also a staunch opponent of the military group that seized power last year - argues that other reforms need to be introduced first. His critics accuse him of breaking an election promise and of capitulating to interior ministry officials. Such splits can always destroy a coalition government, sometimes almost without warning. But the costs of an election campaign are now so high that the MPs are likely to avoid a swift dissolution of parliament. They have already seen two elections this year and Mr Chuan's cool temperament and honesty could avert disruptive excesses.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ THE NEW THAI PARLIAMENT  ------------------------------------------------------------------                          Leader                            Seats Coalition parties:  Democrat                Chuan Leekpai                        79  New Aspiration          Gen Chavalit Yongchaiyudh            51  Palang Dharma           Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang            47  Social Action           Montri Pongpanitch                   22  Solidarity              Uthai Pimpchaichon                    8  ------------------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL                                                        207  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Opposition parties:  Chart Thai              Pramarn Adireksarn                   77  Chart Pattana           Gen Chatichai Choonhavan             60  Seritham                Arthit Urairat                        8  Muanchon                Pol Capt Chalerm Yubamroong           4  Prachakorn Thai         Samak Sundaravej                      3  Rassadorn               Chaipak Siriwat                       1  ------------------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL                                                        153  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

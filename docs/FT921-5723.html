			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Keeping it in the family Four out of 10 family-owned businesses in France went out of family control or failed in the decade up to 1990, according to a survey* by 3i, the development capital group. Fifty-eight per cent of the businesses which were in existence in 1980 were still in family hands 10 years later but 25 per cent were no longer family-controlled and 17 per cent had ceased trading. The researchers tracked 2,460 businesses with turnover of at least FFr20m (Pounds 2.03m) in 1980. The loss of family control was most marked among companies involved in manufacturing and construction but less common in the food, commerce and service sectors. Seven out of 10 owner-managers questioned in 1990 said they wanted to hand their company on to the next generation within the next 10 years by which time 83 per cent of the managers would be more than 70 years old. This wish may prove optimistic, however. Only 25 per cent of the businesses surveyed had passed control on to the next generation in the decade up to 1990. (The remaining 33 per cent still in family hands were controlled by the same generation in command at the start of the decade.) Owner-managers believed the principal advantages of family control were stronger motivation and the ability to respond quickly to events. However a quarter thought a shortage of funds meant family control was a brake on growth. Twenty-three per cent of business owners envisaged selling up to another company; 5 per cent contemplated selling to their own employees by way of a management buy-out and 3 per cent had thought of permitting a buy-in by outside managers. *Les Entreprises Familiales en France.

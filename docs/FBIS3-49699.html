Defense planning and spending  need to be more open and in line with NATO standards, and under  stronger civilian control. Defense Ministry and Army Command  links, cut in 1989, need to be repaired.    In future, Hungarian soldiers will participate in  peace-keeping operations not just as observers, and there will  be independent subunits for humanitarian assistance and tackling  disasters. Various subunits will be picked to cooperate with  NATO troops. Small-scale joint exercises are expected in the  second half of this year.    Hungary's air defense and airspace observation should also  be  converted to NATO formats, airplanes being fitted with  friend-or-foe identification systems and ground radars  overhauled so as to be able to communicate with NATO planes.    Two Hungarian military planners will soon go to NATO's  Brussels headquarters. Kiss hopes the Ministry can cover extra  costs from involvement in the new NATO program out of budget  reserves.</p>

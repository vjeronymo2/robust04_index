			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Observer: Not on, old boy Journalists assembling to hear president of the board of trade Michael Heseltine hold forth at the South Africa-Britain Trade Association official lunch in Johannesburg next Tuesday were initially told they would have to pay for the privilege - unless they are the fortunate recipients of 12 free tickets set aside for hacks. 'Can't afford to pay for more,' said an organiser firmly. When it was suggested that such mean-spiritedness was not only ungenerous but also might be less than beneficial for UK trading interests, the organisers relented. Maybe guests at next year's Queen's birthday party in Pretoria will be asked to pay for their pink gins.</p>

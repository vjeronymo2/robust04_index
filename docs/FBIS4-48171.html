			<p>BFN     [Text] The rector of the University of the Western Cape,  Professor Jakes Gerwel, is to resign from the university to head  President Nelson Mandela's Office. The appointment, which has  not yet been announced officially, was confirmed by ANC sources  today. Prof. Gerwel will provide a link between Mr. Mandela and  the outside world and will probably also keep a record of  cabinet meetings. He is to take the place of the present  director general of the president's department, Mr. Dave  Steward, who will now work for Deputy President F. W. de Klerk.</p>

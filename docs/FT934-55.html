			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Poland Astonishing though it may seem, Poland has been the best performing European bourse of 1993. The market, which re-opened in 1991 after a break of 52 years, has risen more than 11-fold this year. Even in US dollar terms, the WIG index has increased six times. Despite the re-election of a mainly communist government, western stockbrokers have been waxing lyrical about the emergence of Europe's first tiger economy. Investors have plunged into the Polish market since the summer, buying 20 per cent of its shares. Poland's economy remains fragile but recent trends are encouraging. Industrial production, which has dropped 40 per cent from its peak, will perhaps have grown 4 per cent this year, making Poland one of the fastest growing European economies. That growth rate may rise to 7 per cent by the second half of the decade. Inflation has been tamed, if not suppressed. The budget deficit shames many a western European government. The private sector accounts for more than half of Poland's output. Poland's low labour costs and skilled workforce make it an attractive manufacturing base. The Polish stock market remains immature and minuscule: the 22 listed companies have a value of only Dollars 2bn - the size of a small FT-SE 100 company. The market is also prone to the volatility and illiquidity fears that plague any emerging market. But who said Europe was sclerotic?</p>

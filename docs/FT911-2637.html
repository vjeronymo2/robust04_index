			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK Company News: Tace to buy out minority in Goring arm TACE, the environmental control equipment group where a revolt by institutions removed founder chairman Mr Jock Mackenzie, is proposing to buy out the minority holding in its Goring Kerr subsidiary. The offer is expected to be roughly six Tace shares for every five held by the owners of the outstanding 49 per cent in Kerr. This assumes that the relationship between the two share prices is similar to Friday's close of 147p for Tace and 176p for Goring Kerr. Mr David Wilson, Tace's finance director, said it was intended that the holders of Kerr shares would be no worse off. The proposals would also take account of Kerr's slightly higher dividend yield. The benefits of bringing the two together included overhead cuts, the full use of tax allowances which would have saved Pounds 800,000 last year, the removal of obstacles to fund raising and a better use of group cash. Mr Wilson said he hoped the reconstruction would not be held up by the 'shennanigans' of Norwich Union, which has a 5 per cent stake. He said the UK mutual insurance group was the main backer of Mr Michael Beckett's candidacy for the chairmanship. Mr Beckett resigned on Wednesday from the board, which had preferred Sir David Nicholson. The board had hoped that the institutions would have been placated by the departure of Mr Mackenzie, who with his family still has a 23 per cent stake, and the cutting of central costs.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Amsterdam Oce-van der Grinten, the office equipment maker, will kick off the Dutch second-quarter reporting season on Friday when it publishes results for the three months to May 31, writes Ronald van de Krol. The figures are expected to underline the company's return to the path of stronger growth first detected in the fourth quarter of last year and confirmed in the first quarter of this year, when net profit jumped by more than 60 per cent. In the latest quarter, Oce is again expected to show a marked rise in net profit compared with the particularly weak second quarter of 1993, when results plummeted by 47 per cent. The beleaguered stock exchange will be hoping Oce-van der Grinten's higher trend will be matched by better results from other Dutch companies reporting second-half figures over the next four weeks. The bourse has been dragged lower so far this summer by the decline in worldwide equity markets and has given up all the gains recorded early in 1994. It is particularly weak because of the steady fall in the value of the dollar, a factor that tends to augur badly for the profits of many Dutch companies. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

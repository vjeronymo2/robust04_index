			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China may get later WTO entry - US and EU push Beijing to adopt a more constructive negotiating stance The US and the EU are prepared to consider delaying the deadline for China's planned entry as a founder member of the new World Trade Organisation, provided Beijing agrees to negotiate more constructively. The apparent change of mind has been prompted by the growing belief in Washington and Brussels that China's negotiations to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are progressing too slowly to be concluded by the end of this year, as scheduled. China has long insisted that it wants to be a founder member of the WTO, due to be established at the start of next year. Under internationally agreed rules, China would only qualify for that status if it already belonged to Gatt when the WTO came into being. US and European willingness to consider such a course reflects their determination to underline the importance they attach to China's WTO entry, despite their unhappiness at what they consider Beijing's inflexible negotiating stance. The Clinton administration remains committed in public to the January deadline. But it is understood that Ms Charlene Barshefksky, deputy US trade representative, mentioned the possibility of an extension last month in talks with Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister. The question is likely to be raised again by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, in 10 days' time, when he is due to meet Ms Wu at a conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Jakarta. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, is also said to be ready to offer the possibility of an extension when he visits Beijing next week. But EU officials say he will do so only if it becomes clear that there are solid practical reasons why China's talks with the Gatt cannot be completed on time. They say Sir Leon is prepared to consider deferring China's WTO entry until as late as May or June. The US and the EU are both pressing China to improve its membership proposal, notably by agreeing to cut tariffs further, curb state monopolies and open markets wider. A US report, released by the Economic Strategy Institute, says China's accession is the biggest international economic issue faced by the US and is 'a unique window of opportunity to influence China's economic and trade policies'. Mr Greg Mastel, author of 'China and the WTO', warns: 'Once we commit ourselves, even in principle, to give China WTO status, we lose what leverage we have.' See Feature</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan  (NASDA) has completed a repair on the arc-heater wind tunnel (at  the National Aerospace Laboratory in Chofu, Tokyo) which is to  be used for testing various materials at the ultrahigh  temperature of 1700C in the development of the Japanese  version of the space shuttle, among other things. Sumitomo Heavy  Industries, Ltd., installed the arc heater, one of the main  features of the wind tunnel, and announced its official delivery  on 29 September. The total amount of the order to Sumitomo Heavy  Industries was &yen;420 million.    The purpose of the arc-heater wind tunnel is to simulate the  surface temperature of an object when it re-enters the earth's  atmosphere and to test the durability of the object under the  exotic thermal environment. Since the construction of the  arc-heater wind tunnel by NASDA at the National Aerospace  Laboratory in 1982, the wind tunnel had used a U.S.-made arc  heater in performing various tests.    However, the U.S.-made arc heater had some limitations in  terms of the shape and size of the objects being tested, and it  was plagued with the problems associated with wear and tear in  recent years, which prompted the present renovation. The  renovated wind tunnel can be used to test various materials for  the unmanned winged space vehicle, ``HOPE (H-II Orbital  Plane),'' among other things, at a surface temperature of  1700C.    The maximum input power of the arc-heater Sumitomo Heavy  Industries delivered is 750 kW (as compared with the previous  equipment's maximum input power of 450 kW). The main body is  divided into 39 segments in order to achieve an appropriate  heating and cooling balance. Thanks to the segmented structure,  the heating efficiency is improved by more than 50 percent.</p>

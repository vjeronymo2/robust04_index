			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: Knight error The Sun newspaper, in calling for the resignation of the 'Eton-educated twit who runs the Bank of England' yesterday, fell into a common trap. 'Sir' Robin Leigh-Pemberton is actually plain Mr and has not been knighted. On past form retiring governors of the Bank of England leapfrog mere knights and are rewarded with peerages. Given the prime minister's keenness to reform the honours system it will be interesting to see whether this convention survives when Leigh-Pemberton steps down.</p>

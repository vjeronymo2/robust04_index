He is currently detained at Zhangzhou City Public Security  Bureau Custody House. His relatives and religious friends in  the United States revealed the above-mentioned information to  reporters from this newspaper. They hope that international  human rights organizations can help, and they have urged the  mainland to improve its human rights conditions.    According to information, 58-year-old Pan Yiyuan is a  devoted  Christian. After retiring from Zhangzhou Agricultural Bank, he  devoted all his energy to carrying out Family Church activities  with his mother, Xu Birui. On the morning of 2 March, seven  policemen entered Pan Yiyuan's home and took some books on the  Christian faith, tapes, "service books," "Pan Yiyuan's rebirth  testimony," private letters, pictures, and a diary (this was  proved by the "list of items in custody" issued by the public  security bureau). After the search, they told Pan Yiyuan to  report to the public security bureau on the same afternoon, but  when he arrived there they told him that he was under arrest for  carrying out underground religious activities.    Among the charges laid against him are: First, not joining  the "three autonomy's" church but disseminating words  confronting the "three autonomy's" church; second, reading and  keeping Christian books printed overseas, as well as tapes  preaching religion; third, maintaining links with Christians  outside the country (in fact they are his relatives); fourth,  maintaining links with Christians inside the country and  disseminating words of grievance. Afterwards, Pan Yiyuan's wife  received from Zhangzhou City Public Security Bureau a "notice to  the family members of the person being detained and  investigated," but she has not been allowed to see Pan Yiyuan up  to now.    The house of Xu Birui, Pan Yiyuan's 83-year-old mother, was  also searched on the same day. Although the authorities did not  detain her, they ordered her to report her religious activities  to the public security bureau between 1400 and 1700 every day.</p>

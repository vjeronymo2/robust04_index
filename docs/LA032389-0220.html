			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 LOS ANGELES TIMES ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> CROSSROADS AND PALISADES EACH PLACE 2;  </P> <P> KINGS AND QUEENS OF THE COURT  </P> <P> Palisades and Crossroads, among the strongest teams in the area, each have two  selections on The Times' All-Westside high school girls basketball team.  </P> <P> Both went undefeated to win their league championships, Palisades in the Los  Angeles City 4-A Metro League and Crossroads for the sixth straight year in the  Delphic League. Most of the Delphic teams competed at the 1-A level in the  CIF-Southern Section playoffs; the Roadrunners played at the 2-A level.  </P> <P> Palisades is represented by point guard Valerie Agee and guard Tamara Battle,  Crossroads by guard Jamila Banks and point guard Faye Stapleton.  </P> <P> Other all-stars are forward-center Melissa Punch of Culver City, point guard  Judy R. Nakashima of Venice, guard-forward Terry Ginoza of University, guard  Lisa Cohen of Los Angeles Westlake, center Nicole Harper of Marlborough and  Princess Murray, who played point guard, forward and center for Fairfax.  </P> <P> Repeaters from last year are Agee, Banks and Cohen, who was named All-Westside  for the third consecutive year.  </P> <P> Capsule descriptions of each player:  </P> <P> Agee -- She wanted the ball when the game was on the line. She averaged 24  points, 12 rebounds and eight assists -- all team-high marks for the Dolphins.  </P> <P> Banks -- The most valuable player in the Delphic League, she averaged 20.2  points and 10 rebounds and had 45 blocks and 62 steals to lead the Roadrunners  in all four categories.  </P> <P> Battle -- The Metro League's most valuable player, she averaged 16.4 points,  eight rebounds and two steals.  </P> <P> Cohen -- Once again, she did almost everything for the Westlake Wildcats, the  undefeated champions of the Sunshine League, and was her league's most valuable  player after sharing the honor in 1988. She averaged 16.7 points, seven  rebounds, 2.7 assists, 4.4 steals and 1.7 blocked shots.  </P> <P> Ginoza -- She shared most valuable player honors with Nakashima in the Western  League, having averaged 18 points, six rebounds and four assists and shooting  80% from the free throw line.  </P> <P> Harper -- Marlborough Coach Ann DeBoe called her a "super inside player," and  opposing coaches agreed. She averaged 16 rebounds and 13 points.  </P> <P> Murray -- Played anywhere on the court, and her averages reflect her  effectiveness: 14.3 points, eight rebounds, 3.6 steals and 2.8 assists.  </P> <P> Nakashima -- She and Ginoza were the Western League's most valuable players.  Her averages: 15.3 points, 3.4 steals, 3.7 assists and 4.3 rebounds. That's a  lot of rebounding for a 5-foot, 2-inch point guard.  </P> <P> Punch -- The All-Ocean League player gave Culver City its punch. She averaged  17.7 points and 9.5 rebounds.  </P> <P> Stapleton -- Crossroads Coach Larry Weiner said that his All-Delphic League  player is "an outstanding point guard who controls the tempo of the game" and  that her defense "is extremely good." She didn't score much (six points a  game), but she averaged six assists, which meant that she was responsible for  18 points a game.  </P> <P> Honorable mention:  </P> <P> Brentwood -- Stephanie Collins.  </P> <P> Crossroads -- Amy Gandin.  </P> <P> Hamilton -- Daphne Vaughn, Micaly Fields.  </P> <P> Marymount -- Rachel Kane, Abby Kane, Bridget O'Keefe.  </P> <P> Notre Dame -- Raquel Hollier.  </P> <P> University -- Shaney Fink.  </P> <P> Venice -- Jonelle McKie.  </P> <P> Westlake -- Carol Koh.  </P> <P> Westchester -- Robin Hudson.  </P> <P> Windward -- Jenny Johnson, Kim Aran.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989 ALL-STARS  </P> <P> The all-star boys and girls teams, each consisting of 10 members, their coaches  and parents will be guests of The Times at 9 a.m. Sunday, April 2, at the  annual Times High School Basketball Awards Brunch where all-stars teams from 12  circulation areas will be honored at the Anaheim Hilton. The featured speaker  will be George Yardley, a former All-American at Stanford University, who went  on to become the first player ever to score more than 2,000 points in an NBA  season. The players and the coaches of the year from each area will be  announced.  </P> <P> The teams were chosen on the basis of a poll of area coaches, who are asked to  fill out ballots nominating their own players and opponents, plus the  observations of college scouts and sportswriters. Each player will recieve the  traditional Times golden basketball plaque and award certificate.  </P> <P> GIRLS PREP TEAM  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Milissa Punch  </P> <P> School: Culver City  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Average: 17.7  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Judy R.

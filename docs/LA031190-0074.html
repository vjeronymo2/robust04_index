			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: WATCHING A STAR AT TENNIS TOURNEY  </P> <P> The seasoned tournament-goers wore straw hats. I sat there and let the desert  sun beat on me like a Chinese gong. My friend Jean Erck, who feels that I need  my horizons widened, had asked me to go to the Virginia Slims Indian Wells  tennis matches with her. I did and had an interesting afternoon watching the  tennis players return balls that I didn't even see.  </P> <P> Jean comes from a tennis family. Her husband, Marty, played, she plays, and she  has two sons who are standouts. Marty Jr. is ranked No. 14 in Southern  California.  </P> <P> In tennis, there is the same high premium on style as there is in golf. I have  followed golf players around Riviera Country Club at the Los Angeles Open ever  since I could walk. You are supposed only to breathe, and that very shallowly,  so you don't break the concentration of the players.  </P> <P> Same thing at the tennis tournament. The entire stadium sat in seemly silence  except for an occasional spatter of applause when a player made an impossible  shot, or a mass intake of breath at a missed shot.  </P> <P> For my first tennis tournament, I was lucky enough to see Martina Navratilova.  She has won in the regal center court at Wimbledon eight times, and is  determined to make it nine. She has won three Virginia Slims tournaments this  year. Nine wins at Wimbledon would make tennis history. We saw her play Helena  Sukova and win.  </P> <P> The referees stand or sit in little square boxes and yell one-word  announcements like "Fault," "Ball," and a number of other things. I nodded  wisely at each call, although most of the calls sounded as if the caller had  been unexpectedly pinched. The crowd was with Martina so, of course, I did  exactly what everyone else did, clap and sigh. But I was just a beat behind  everyone else.  </P> <P> A confection for the spectators in the midst of all that heavy-duty play was a  doubles match, Billie Jean King on one side with Sonny Bono and recently  retired Chris Evert with Danny Sullivan, an Indianapolis race driver, on the  other.  </P> <P> The four players were miked, so the crowd could hear their remarks, and the  japes they tossed at each other. Bono did well, considering that he was playing  with two of the world's former women champions. So did Sullivan.  </P> <P> At the end of the Navratilova-Sukova match, Martina was given a check by the  Kraft-General Foods World Tennis Tour.  </P> <P> When she received the check, she said Andrea Jaeger, a fine player in the '80s  who had dropped out because of injuries, had set up a foundation to help very  young players financially. She is calling it Kid Stuff. Martina was giving the  check to Kid Stuff.  </P> <P> Martina said: "She is following in the footsteps of Billie Jean King, who  established a tennis foundation for kids." Martina, too, has a foundation for  young players.  </P> <P> The eight-time Wimbledon winner has a number of dogs. The lucky pooch who  travels with her is a toy fox terrier named K.D. The rest of the pack stays  home in Aspen. The small dog was sitting in the lap of a friend of  Navratilova's. K.D. seemed to know a good deal more about tennis than I did.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH ANGERED BY BUILDING DELAY;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: A MORATORIUM IS PLACED ON NEW CONSTRUCTION AROUND THE STONEWOOD  SHOPPING CENTER. A GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH SEES A BIAS ISSUE.  </P> <P> The City Council has placed a 45-day moratorium on new construction around  Stonewood Shopping Center, angering members of a group that wants to build a  new church in the area.  </P> <P> Planning officials said the moratorium is needed so the city can fashion a plan  to ensure that new area development will be compatible with the mall. The  moratorium was unanimously approved Tuesday.  </P> <P> Downey officials view Stonewood, which is being expanded and enclosed, as key  to revitalizing the city's main commercial district along Firestone Boulevard.  They want to attract more new stores, restaurants and possibly a multiscreen  cinema near the mall.  </P> <P> Hughes/Lyon Downey, a Newport Beach-based developer that owns Stonewood, has  proposed building another shopping center on about 11 acres of land it has yet  to buy east of Lakewood Boulevard, across Firestone Boulevard from the  Stonewood mall.  </P> <P> But officials of St. George Greek Orthodox Church hope to build a new church in  the same area. Church officials, who hold a two-year option to buy a 2.5-acre  parcel, said the city's proposed development and the moratorium are  discriminatory.  </P> <P> "One of the major purposes is to prevent the community from proceeding with  this church development," said Nicholas J. Kallins, a church attorney and  member. The parish holds services in another Downey church.  </P> <P> Mayor Randall R. Barb denied that the city is trying to prevent construction of  a Greek Orthodox church.  </P> <P> "We want to be careful that we do a good job in planning for the future," Barb  said. "This is a land-use issue. This is not an issue of the right to worship."  </P> <P> The moratorium covers 37 acres directly to the south and west of the mall, an  area that includes several vacant properties. City planners would like to  develop a master plan for the area. Some recommendations for such a plan will  be presented to the council in a public hearing at the end of the 45-day  moratorium, City Planner Ron Yoshiki said. The council could then extend the  moratorium.  </P> <P> In September, the church received a two-year option to buy the 2.5-acre  property in the moratorium area for about $2 million, church president Gus  Georgakopoulos said. The property includes a tire shop that fronts Firestone  Boulevard, a private school, a vacant office building and about an acre of  vacant land.  </P> <P> The church would be built on the vacant land, and the office building would be  used as a community center. The church is paying about $4,000 a month in rent  on the office building, which the congregation has been unable to occupy  because it does not have a city permit.  </P> <P> The church applied for a conditional permit to use the building and to move  forward with building the new church. But the application was rejected last  week by the Downey Planning Commission, which decided that the site in the  primarily commercial area was not suitable for a church, Yoshiki said. An  appeal is pending.  </P> <P> Representatives of Hughes/Lyon have also been meeting with city officials on  the proposed shopping center, Hughes/Lyon spokesman John C. Pentz said.  </P> <P> The area is in a city redevelopment zone, but the city does not have eminent  domain powers to force property owners to sell holdings in the zone. The City  Council approved the redevelopment zone in 1987, but the council heeded the  protests of local residents and businessmen and did not give its Redevelopment  Agency condemnation powers.  </P> <P> Hughes has contacted some but not all of the people who own property where the  shopping center would be built, said Pentz, who added that he has spoken with  church officials but has not begun structured negotiations.  </P> <P> "From what I've heard, they have an inflated (idea) of what they think the  property's worth," Pentz said.  </P> <P> St. George officials said they would sell the property for the right price,  about $3 million. That is $1 million more than the church will pay for the  property if it exercises its option, Georgakopoulos said.  </P></p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tiphook meeting not just preoccupied with directors' pay Sir, As a shareholder present at Tiphook's annual general meeting, it was good to see the FT ('Bankruptcy threat to Tiphook's Montague', September 16) report it less sensationally than other newspapers. However, you still emphasised controversial matters like the chief executive's personal finances and directors' remuneration. These are quite pertinent but not the whole story. The board affirmed that trading was improving and that its bankers remained supportive. That a director of Ian Clubb's calibre has agreed to become chairman and expressed his full commitment to the company's new future as Central Transport Rental Group is also encouraging. But when an AGM becomes a media circus of whipped-up emotions, objectivity is lost. It became hard to ask basic questions on Tiphook's future. Mounting hysteria could also adversely influence its customers and creditors. The press are often shareholders' best allies in the drive to improve boardroom disclosure and accountability. Such a purpose must try to set companies on a better path, not create additional problems for those facing high risks. Edmond Jackson, Chenies, Butlers Dene Road, Woldingham, Surrey CR3 7HH</p>

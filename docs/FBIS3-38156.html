			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Karelias] </F>   [Excerpts] Andreas Papandreou yesterday appeared in a mood  of self-criticism about his government's "weaknesses" and the  "imprudence" of government leaders and he thus forestalled the  expected criticism from many party cadres.    At the same time, Mr. Papandreou expressed optimism about  the  government course and attempted to prove wrong those who are  trying, as he put it, "to prove that nothing has changed after  the elections."    The prime minister made his first analytical address after  the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] victory before the  party's Central Committee (which dissolved itself in view of the  party congress which will be held 14-17 April). He expressed  concern over the showdowns in the upcoming elections [for  European Parliament deputies and local communal authorities] and  admitted that the dynamics favor the small parties and this is  why he put emphasis on the need for the party's reconstruction  and for a congress that should be open to society.    Discussing the first months of PASOK's rule in the country,  Mr. Papandreou:     -  Admitted that the government machinery has  weaknesses, that there are coordination problems as well as  different views between government departments and state  organizations. However, he maintained that "the account is more  than positive."    -  Maintained that, although it is still very  early, "the people can clearly see that a new leaf is turning  over for the country," that "the type of administration is  changing radically," that "there is a government of democratic  practice and openness as well as of new style and  character."    -  Enumerated the first government activities:  institutional change in justice, establishment of urban  transportation organization, tax reforms, fairer distribution of  [tax] burdens, big reforms in the administration and local  self-government, gradual reinstatement of those who were  oppressed, safeguarding of confidentiality in  telecommunications, establishment of independent organization  for the management of state supplies, enactment of a merit  system in the public sector and in hiring for public service,  and sensitivity toward inequalities, unemployment, and  corruption. [passage omitted]    Mr. Papandreou made a brief reference to national issues and  foreign policy:     -  He talked about a "new era" in relations  with the United States.    -  He attributed Turkey's provocations to  "its tragic economic situation" and "to the struggle of the  Kurds for autonomy." He also announced that in the next few  weeks the cabine? will make decisions on "a multifaceted  defense, economic, cultural, and social shield of the  country."    -  He said that the Cyprus issue is the cornerstone of  our national strategy and reiterated the doctrine of "joint  decisionmaking" and of a "unified defense area." On the Skopje  issue, he contented himself with the phrase "we are trying to  pass rough dangerous straits." [passage omitted]</p>

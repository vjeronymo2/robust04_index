			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bridgestone reveals plans for senior management shake-up BRIDGESTONE, Japan's largest tyremaker, yesterday announced a senior management shake-up, with the promotion of the chief executive of its US operations to run the group. Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki, Bridgestone's executive vice-president in charge of its Bridgestone/Firestone operations in North America, will become the group's president. Mr Akira Yeiri, the current president, is resigning but will remain an adviser to the company. Japan has not witnessed the dramatic upheaval in senior management which has hit large US companies in the past few months, with the departure of several senior executives from leading companies such as General Motors, IBM and American Express. However, the Bridgestone change is part of a more evolutionary change in senior management in Japanese corporations brought on by two years of falling profits at most companies. The tyremaker's shake-up follows similar changes recently at Sanyo, the electronics group, Cannon, the camera and copier manufacturer, and Honda, the carmaker. Mr Kaizaki, chairman and chief executive of Bridgestone/Firestone, is widely credited with taking tough action to turn around its US plants, which were incurring heavy losses after Bridgestone acquired them, for Dollars 2.6bn, in 1988. Since then, Bridgestone has invested about Dollars 1bn to modernise the US plants. Mr Kaizaki, 59, joined Bridgestone in 1962. He has spent most of his career outside the mainstream tyre business running the group's chemical and industrial products division. He moved to the US in 1991 to take over the US operations. The company did not announce a successor.</p>

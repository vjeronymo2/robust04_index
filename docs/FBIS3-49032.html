			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Jean Cot, who was the guest of our 1300  bulletin, live from Zagreb, denounced the humiliations inflicted  upon the Blue Helmet UN soldiers on the ground. The UN  Protection Forces commander in chief also said that his troops  are ready for a potential offensive intervention, should the  United Nations give the green light, of course:    [Begin Cot recording] My freedom of action is more  restricted  than I would like; this will come as no surprise to you, because  I am not here to wage a war, for instance.    I think, however, that we can do two things. First, we  should be firmer in our attitude toward the Bosnian Serbs in  particular, since they are the ones who are hampering our  freedom of action most at the moment. I was able to verify this  during the long week I spent there. Also -- and this is the  message I am striving to put across -- we should exert pressure  in Geneva, including on our negotiators.    To me, it seems impossible that, on the one hand, we should  behave like nice mediators and have polite conversations with  the political and military officials of former Yugoslavia while,  on the other hand, our force on the ground is being subjected to  increasing pressure and even humiliation. Therefore, I cannot  emphasize enough to Geneva -- and I would also like to put this  message across to New York -- that we must probably put the  brakes on, and we cannot be nice in Geneva while we suffer on  the ground.    We retaliate every time our rules allow us to do so, that is  to say, every time we face a direct attack, believe me. As a  result, we do not suffer. You will, however, understand that  when the lives of some 3 million men and women in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are at stake, we have to swallow our pride,  which is sometimes difficult. However, I do not think we should  swallow our honor. Where do you draw the line between both,  where is the threshold? I will decide. [end recording]</p>

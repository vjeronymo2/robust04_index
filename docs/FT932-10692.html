			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: BP's transatlantic affair American investors who believed the BP story had their faith sorely tested last year. Yet despite the dividend cut, the departure of its aggressive US-style chairman and a limp share price performance, US holdings of BP's stock grew from 8 per cent to 23 per cent in 1992. In large part this reflected BP's relative attraction, using US cash flow valuations. Even now BP sells on around 4.5 times its cash flow, while comparable US companies such as Chevron and Arco sell for a multiple of about 6 and Exxon and Shell around 7. Sophisticated investors who adjust for the cost of servicing debt will doubtless argue that this overstates the attraction. Even they concede that BP is still at a 10 per cent discount to its competition. That should be some comfort to those who fear that US profit taking could do for the BP share price what it did for Glaxo. Further underpinning came from yesterday's results, which showed that the company's cost cutting programme was starting to produce results without much help from dismal refining and chemicals markets. By setting his face against a rights issue Mr David Simon, the chief executive, seems determined to keep the company's feet to the fire. Stability has returned and further cost savings may come in areas such as refining and marketing, but BP's solid core of debt remains. It seems clear that some form of additional risk capital will be needed once the company is ready to go back on to the offensive. A rights issue still seems most likely, and by 1995-96 the scars from the dividend cut may have healed. Meanwhile those UK investors who believe the recovery story will have to cast aside their traditional yield prop if they want to go along for the walk.</p>

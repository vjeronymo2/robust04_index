			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tajik </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tajikistan would adhere to the ways of economic  reforms and was steadily searching for the ways of overcoming  the crisis as soon as possible, said Abdujalil Samadov, the head  of the government of the Republic, at a news conference that was  held for local and foreign journalists in Dushanbe, today.    The news conference was devoted to the results of the  nine-day visit of Samadov to the Russian Federation, Germany,  Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States.    Tajikistan can not resolve the difficult issues of  restoration of the national economy and ensuring the steady  activity of its branches alone.    Samadov said that the main aim of his visit to these  countries was to familiarize the officials of these countries  with the real situation of the Republic. The international  financial organizations, businessmen, and entrepreneurs do  understand our difficulties and demands very well and they are  ready to invest in order to implement the specific difficulties.  However, they give priority to stabilization of the political  situation in Tajikistan. The important thing is that foreign  entrepreneurs support the program of economic reforms submitted  by our Republic.    Abdujalil Samadov added that important events would take  place in the country in the current year. These are, first of  all, the nationwide referendum on the form of the state  administration, the free Parliamentary elections, and the  leadership of the country, nationwide discussion and adoption of  the new Constitution.    Similarly, the leadership of the Republic pays much  attention  to the talks with the representatives of the opposition. The  aim of these talks is to stabilize the political and economic  situation and to ensure the peaceful life of all inhabitants of  the country and to concentrate all the sound forces.    The head of the government expressed his satisfaction that  the Russian Federation and neighboring Uzbekistan are rendering  great assistance to the Republic as before. Today, we must  decisively state that the fruitful work of every citizen of the  Republic is important to resolve our problems.    The chairman of the Council of Ministers was asked numerous  questions related to the various spheres of the life of the  country, entry of the republic to the ruble zone, and the ways  of settling reciprocal payments. The head of the government  informed that the work is under way in this field. All the  issues will be positively resolved in the coming months, and  there should be no doubts about that, he stressed. It is a  difficult task in Tajikistan to involve all the people able to  work in useful social labor. It will be necessary to construct  new plants for that. According to Abdujalil Samadov the most  important task of the day is to provide the agriculture of the  Republic with fuel and seeds, because the provision of the  population with food depends on the solution of this problem.  It was decided to use all the loans that will be given to  Tajikistan by the Russian Federation [words indistinct] Samadov  said.    Other economic and political issues were touched upon in the  course of the new conference.</p>

This was said by a Federation Council deputy, a leader  of the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, Yuriy Boldyrev, at a press  conference in St. Petersburg on Friday.    The Federation Council did not raise the issue on violation  of the Constitution by the president since 54 percent of the  Federation Council's deputies are also employees of other  legislative bodies, Deputy Boldyrev suggested.    According to Deputy Boldyrev, the freeing of Former Vice  President Rutskoy and Former Parliament's Speaker Khasbulatov  from the Lefortovo prison was in the interests of the  president's team. Boldyrev suggested that while in prison they  had been regarded as victims and that it would be much more  difficult for them to maintain their authority when free.    Deputy Boldyrev condemned the State Duma's resolution on  economic amnesty. He said no amnesty was needed to free people  whose actions were today not considered criminal. The  appropriate provision in the Criminal Code would be sufficient  for this, he added.    "Those who abused their powers are now also freed due to the  economic amnesty," Deputy Boldyrev said. He stressed that the  amnesty would not lay the foundation for civil accord.</p>

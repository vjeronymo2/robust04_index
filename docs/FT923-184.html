			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Joxe urges bigger French role in Nato: Defence minister wants Paris to abandon 'empty chair' policy FRANCE should abandon the 'empty chair' policy it has long practised at Nato military meetings, Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, suggested yesterday. This is the first time a French defence minister has said in public that he would like to attend Nato ministerial meetings in the way that France's foreign minister has always done. Mr Joxe's comments came as Nato prepared to launch its new rapid reaction force, in which France will not participate, in Germany on Friday. It is expected to have about 250,000 troops available to it, two to three times the number envisaged when plans were first drawn up last year. But there is continuing discussion about the role it might play, if any, in conflicts outside the boundaries of the member countries of Nato. Mr Joxe told a European defence seminar that he hoped 'France in the future could participate more than it has in the past in politico-military discussions' in Nato. But for this to happen, Nato would have to undergo 'real change', and there was no chance of France again placing its forces under what Mr Joxe described as the alliance's outmoded integrated military command. He cited with approval the example of Spain, which stayed outside Nato's integrated peace-time command when it joined the alliance in the late 1970s, although its defence minister usually sits in on meetings of Nato's defence planning committee and nuclear planning group. The fact that Mr Joxe cleared yesterday's speech with the Elysee indicates he is having some success in shifting President Francois Mitterrand in a more pro-atlanticist direction. France's decision to take part in working out Nato's new 'strategic concept' last autumn was a step towards greater military involvement in Nato, Mr Joxe noted yesterday. When, shortly after that review, Nato inaugurated its 'Co-operation Council' with eastern Europe last December, Mr Joxe expressed frustration at being virtually the only defence chief in Europe - east and west - not to attend. At the same time, Mr Joxe took up the hint, dropped by Mr Mitterrand last year, that France might be ready to enter discussions with its European partners on future nuclear strategy. This could involve 'a widening of the nuclear guarantee,' he said. On conventional forces, the French defence minister said the planned 'Euro-corps', to be composed of 35,000 French and German troops by 1995, was 'an opportunity and not a threat' to other countries and to Nato. Speaking at the same seminar, Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said arrangements putting the planned Euro-corps under Nato command in time of emergency should be settled by December. Nato officials said yesterday that the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Force (ARRC), still in embryonic form, involves 12 Nato countries and will be able to draw on up to 10 divisions. However, no more than four divisions  -a force of between 60,000 and 90,000 men - would actually be deployed in response to a crisis. Under the first blueprint approved by defence ministers in April last year the corps, under British command, was to consist of two UK divisions, a multinational airmobile division and another division for southern Europe. The US made clear at that time its willingness to add a US-based heavy division. Forces assigned to the ARRC are now expected to include a German division, an Italian division with Portuguese participation, and separate Greek and Turkish divisions. Spain, while not formally part of Nato's military structure, is also making a division available. Nato officials emphasised that final details had not been settled. One allied officer said Greece and Turkey had engaged in 'competitive poker' over their contributions, and it was still uncertain what these would entail. Greeks and Turks are also due to join Italian forces in a combined Multinational Division South. This is one of two divisions which will be under permanent Nato command in peacetime. The other, the airmobile Multinational Division Central, comprises British, German, Dutch and Belgian troops. All the forces are due to be operational in 1995.</p>

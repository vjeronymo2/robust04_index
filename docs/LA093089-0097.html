			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER CAN STILL INSPIRE SEAHAWKS;  </P> <P> TAILBACK'S SPEECH LEADS TO CLUB'S FIRST VICTORY OF SEASON  </P> <P> The Seattle Seahawks' locker room got strangely quiet as Curt Warner started to  address a players-only meeting last week.  </P> <P> The softspoken tailback was angry because his teammates had played poorly in  losing their first two games of the season. Warner said the team had been torn  apart by contract disputes and dissension.  </P> <P> After quoting from the Bible, Warner said his teammates needed to redefine  their goals.  </P> <P> "We have our radios on, but we're not tuned to the same station," Warner said.  </P> <P> The Seahawks then went out and beat the New England Patriots, 24-3, last Sunday  for their first victory.  </P> <P> Did Warner's speech inspire Seattle?  </P> <P> "I think his speech did a lot," safety Nesby Glasgow said. "A lot of times when  you have team meetings it's the same old rhetoric: 'You've got to go out and  play hard.' The one thing Curt did was to make us all focus on what needs to be  done."  </P> <P> Glasgow said he was stunned by Warner's outburst.  </P> <P> "I was somewhat surprised, but once he got to talking, I think everybody felt  it was coming from his heart. When you have a guy who's usually quiet like Curt  stand up and talk the way he did, it was inspiring."  </P> <P> What motivated Warner's outburst?  </P> <P> "I wasn't really thinking about whether or not it was going to be  inspirational," Warner said. "It was something I wanted to say because I was  mainly talking to myself, as well as the other guys on the team, about what we  need to think when we go out and play."  </P> <P> Warner didn't just talk, he also played his best game of the season, rushing  for a team-high 65 yards. And he did it with a swollen knee.  </P> <P> After undergoing arthroscopic surgery to remove cartilage from his right knee  Aug. 7, Warner has flourished. He's the ninth-leading rusher in the American  Football Conference going into Sunday's game against the Raiders at the  Coliseum.  </P> <P> Warner rushed for 1,449 yards to lead the AFC in his rookie season, 1983. But  in 1984, he tore ligaments in his right knee in the season opener.  </P> <P> He underwent reconstructive surgery and was in a cast for eight weeks. After a  year of extensive rehabilitation, Warner returned and was named the NFL  comeback player of the year, rushing for 1,094 yards in 1985. He set a team  record by rushing for 1,481 yards in 1986.  </P> <P> But last season, it happened again -- he reinjured his right knee. Although  this injury wasn't as severe as the first one, it was depressing.  </P> <P> "It was hard to deal with at first," Warner said. "But . . . I just thanked the  good Lord that he didn't take it all away from me. I could have turned it a bit  more and messed up some ligaments. Then you have to ask yourself if you're  going to play again."  </P> <P> Warner's slashing, pounding running style has taken a severe toll during his  six-year NFL career.  </P> <P> "I was like a kamikaze when I first came into the league," Warner said. "I was  crazy. It's not that I can't do the same things, but those hits take a toll  after a while."  </P> <P> The toll has included two knee surgeries and three ankle operations to remove  bone spurs.  </P> <P> Warner played with the ankle injury last season, and his rushing average fell  to 3.9 yards a carry, his worst in three seasons.  </P> <P> There were reports that former team president Mike McCormack tried to trade  Warner after last season.  </P> <P> "The explosiveness that characterized Warner's style is all but gone," wrote  columnist Art Thiel of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "One major knee surgery  and an ambulance full of smaller hurts have reduced Warner's bursts to  hesitations. The Seahawks are upset enough to consider a trade."  </P> <P> Tom Flores, who succeeded McCormack last February, has no plans to trade  Warner.  </P> <P> "He's still not the Curt that he was before," Flores said. "But he's certainly  a force."  </P> <P> Like Raider tailback Marcus Allen, who has been supplanted by Bo Jackson,  Warner has been replaced by fullback John L. Williams, who was second to Eric  Dickerson in total yardage in the AFC last season.  </P> <P> Does it bother Warner that he isn't the focus of Seattle's rushing attack?  </P> <P> "I'll be honest and say that it bothered me at first because I had carried a  lot of the load before," Warner said. "But I look at it this way: John L. can  carry the load, too. I don't get upset about it anymore."  </P> <P> Still, the Seahawk rushing attack was non-existant in the first two games.  Seattle, which never led in its first 10 quarters this season, had to pass to  get back into the games.  </P> <P> But Seattle's rushing attack excelled last week.  </P> <P> In addition to Warner's 65 yards, Williams rushed for 64 yards and caught five  passes for 71 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Curt Warner was the star of the Seahawks in his first four years with the team.  </P> <P> He had his own TV show and more endorsements than any other Seahawk. But fame  was fleeting.  </P> <P> "I didn't like doing the TV show," Warner said. "I just don't want to be in  front of a camera like that. When you're getting beat week in and week out and  you have to go do a TV show, it's not a whole lot of fun -- and I didn't enjoy  it. I was under fire."  </P></p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: I'd opt for Schwarzenegger Sir, Helen Chadwick is 'witty', says your correspondent, Antony Thorncroft (Arts: 'In praise of a joyful return to the basics', July 23/24). A woman who urinates in the snow and calls it art . . . is 'witty'? Call me old-fashioned, call me blinkered, repressed, or unimaginative, but I don't regard urinating in snow as witty, nor is it art. It is most probably a public health risk, or the act of someone with limited bladder control. If you disagree with me then please attempt your own witticism at the desk of your local constabulary and let me know of the resulting critical acclaim. Sorry, Mr Thorncroft, but to borrow from the Financial Times' cartoonist, Banx, if this is your idea of culture then 'excuse me while I reach for my Arnold Schwarzenegger videos'. David Coleman, 13 Greyhound Road, London W6 8NH</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELOCATING UCLA LAB SCHOOL  </P> <P> I have read all the recent articles on the proposed move of UCLA's Corrine A.  Seeds University Elementary School to Santa Monica, including the Chancellor  Charles Young's reply (letter, May 22).  </P> <P> The chancellor is using fancy words and funny rationale, it seems to me, just  to try to get his hands on more land to build more buildings on UCLA's campus,  all at taxpayers' expense. And probably at UES' expense, too.  </P> <P> What I want to know is, are taxpayers going to have foot a multimillion-dollar  bill to build a new school building for UES in the city of Santa Monica, which  already has a declining school-age population and empty classrooms?  </P> <P> MARY LEWIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

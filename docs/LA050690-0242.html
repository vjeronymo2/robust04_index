			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO SATISFACTION FOR INFORMANT IN CAPITOL STING;  </P> <P> CORRUPTION: MAN WHO WENT UNDERCOVER FOR THE FBI IS UNHAPPY WITH THE PACE OF  PROSECUTIONS. HE ALSO SAYS LEGISLATURE STILL HASN'T CLEANED UP ITS ACT.  </P> <P> It has been 20 months since the FBI raided the state Capitol and brought an end  to its undercover political corruption probe, and Marv Levin is running out of  patience.  </P> <P> A private businessman who became a crucial government informant for more than  three years in the elaborate federal sting operation, Levin says he is  frustrated by the slow pace of prosecutions. And he is even more annoyed with  the Legislature itself for what he sees as its failure to get its own house  quickly in order.  </P> <P> "I see the (legislative) games become more sophisticated," Levin told The Times  in an interview that ended a year and a half of silence. "The old boys' network  is alive and well, just doing things a little differently now." New ethics  reform moving through the Legislature is a step in the right direction, he  said, but only a step.  </P> <P> Levin, who is 55 and not in the best of health, said he had hoped the system  would change and that he is speaking out now because voters need to be told  that it hasn't.  </P> <P> He also believes the time has finally arrived when he can safely call attention  to himself. He feels he has earned a brief moment in the light to explain how  he risked financial ruin to help set right a political system that often favors  those with the biggest checkbooks.  </P> <P> It was Levin who helped the FBI write special-interest bills that would  supposedly help a bogus company open a plant near Sacramento. It was Levin who  advised undercover investigators posing as Southern businessmen on the  intricacies of moving those bills through the Legislature.  </P> <P> And it was Levin, wearing a concealed recording device, who acted as the  go-between with legislative aides who saw to it that the measures were passed.  </P> <P> More than six years after he began assisting the FBI -- and long after his  direct role in the sting had ended -- he still wears an electronic pager given  to him by the agents. The federal agents still beep occasionally.  </P> <P> Throughout the undercover operation, Levin feared that the disclosure that he  was a paid informant for the FBI could damage him and destroy the $600-million  Lighthouse Marina project that he and his partners are developing on the  Sacramento River. And once his role did become public four years later, he  found that instead of being hailed as a hero, his personal integrity was being  questioned.  </P> <P> Many people believed "that you can't be involved in something like this unless  you're a crook yourself," Levin explained.  </P> <P> At one critical moment in 1988, it took a letter of commendation from the FBI  to allay the suspicions of local government officials who were reviewing the  marina development.  </P> <P> Terry L. Knowles, who headed the FBI's Sacramento office, wrote in Levin's  defense: "The personal sacrifice and time spent by you without consideration  for your own personal well-being should serve as an example to the community."  The marina was approved by West Sacramento officials.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, looking back at events, Levin wonders whether going undercover  was worth the risk -- to his business, to his health, to his family. At one  point, he even worried that some of those who were snared in the sting might  try to exact their revenge on his children.  </P> <P> "This has taken an enormous toll on me personally," Levin said.  </P> <P> "I've had (legislative) members who wouldn't see me any more," he said. "There  are several I thought of as friends, as acquaintances, who refuse to deal with  me."  </P> <P> The federal investigation has already led to the conviction on political  corruption charges of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who recently was  sentenced to 6 1/2 years in federal prison. The probe has also resulted in  similar charges being filed against State Board of Equalization member Paul  Carpenter and a Montoya aide, and guilty pleas from a Republican legislative  aide, a county sheriff and the sheriff's one-time top deputy.  </P> <P> Levin describes himself as a reluctant participant in the federal investigation  of political corruption.  </P> <P> In 1984, he even approached a Republican assemblyman he knew, hoping that the  lawmaker would agree to take his place in assisting federal agents. The  legislator had long complained that something needed to be done about  corruption. But he refused to help, Levin said.  </P> <P> Later, the federal investigators brought in their own replacement, a one-time  United Nations official from New York who had been convicted of fraud and was  hoping to win a presidential pardon by acting as an undercover operative in the  Sacramento investigation.  </P> <P> "I thought, 'I'm out of it. I'm so happy,' " Levin said. "He was very  distinguished-looking. He wore glasses. He was well dressed. He had all the  things I didn't have. He smelled of wealth. . . . This was someone who really  looked and played the part."  </P> <P> Levin hoped that he would be able to stay in the background, playing a strictly  advisory role for the FBI while the New Yorker would be the one to make the  direct contacts and secretly record his conversations.  </P> <P> But ultimately the federal authorities decided they could not use the outsider  because his criminal record could prove to be a problem when prosecutors took  their cases to court, according to Levin. (This and other details of Levin's  account were confirmed by sources familiar with the investigation.)  </P> <P> Levin had a number of contacts in the Legislature because of his past jobs as a  consultant-lobbyist with a nonprofit small business development corporation and  as an official with the state office of small business development.  </P> <P> "I wanted to get the sting going, but I really didn't want to be part of it,"  Levin said.  </P> <P> Finally, the agent in charge of the FBI probe -- a friend whose son had  sometimes played in a neighborhood park with Levin's children -- said that the  only way for the investigation to succeed was if Levin would agree to go  undercover.  </P> <P> "He said, 'If you don't do it, we can't go forward. There is no alternative,' "  Levin said. "He hit me between the eyes. 'You're the one bitching about our not  doing anything. Others have refused (to cooperate). Are you going to do the  same?' "  </P> <P> With considerable trepidation, Levin agreed to go ahead.  </P> <P> It wasn't the first time that Levin had agreed to wear a wire for the local  office of the FBI. A few years before the Capitol sting, Levin had told local  FBI agents about a fishy business deal that had been offered to him involving  an official of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He ended  up with an FBI tape recorder stuffed inside a new pair of $200 cowboy boots he  had bought for the occasion.  </P> <P> When the federal authorities began the preliminary work on the sting in 1984,  the FBI paid Levin $1,800 a month for almost a year, while he was pretending to  be a consultant for Gulf Shrimp Fisheries Inc. of Mobile, Ala. The phony  company was supposedly seeking state help in setting up a shrimp processing  plant near Sacramento.  </P> <P> The federal investigators supplied Levin with a set of fake correspondence from  John E. (Jack) Gordon -- on paper, the president of Gulf Shrimp, but in reality  an undercover FBI agent. On one of the letters to Levin, intended to be flashed  at legislative staff members and legislators if the authenticity of the company  was questioned, Gordon scrawled a handwritten note to Levin: "You could make  some money too!"  </P> <P> Levin helped the phony firm secure a $100,000 loan from a nonprofit agency  headed by a former legislative aide, Darryl O. Freeman.  </P> <P> Then Levin, who had once been a lobbyist and consultant for the California  Rural Small Business Development Corp., helped the agents craft a narrow bill  that would supposedly benefit Gulf Shrimp, but not any other company.  </P> <P> To help move the sting bill, carried by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los  Angeles), through the Senate, Levin turned to an old acquaintance, legislative  aide John Shahabian. Levin introduced Shahabian to Gulf Shrimp's "Jack Gordon."  Shahabian told Gordon that it would cost $20,000 to win passage of the shrimp  bill -- money that went into the campaign coffers of Carpenter, then a state  senator. The measure passed in 1986 but was vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian,  who had been tipped off about the FBI sting.  </P> <P> A year later, Levin aided federal investigators in an effort to turn Shahabian  into an undercover informant.  </P> <P> Levin said the FBI brought in a two-man "psych team" to help figure out the  best way to approach Shahabian. Levin said the bureau's human behavior experts  believed that Shahabian's close ties to his family made it likely he would  agree to cooperate.  </P> <P> Frightened by the prospect of going to prison, Shahabian agreed to help the  federal probe with a second sting bill, and for more than a year, he too led a  double life as an undercover operative.  </P> <P> Levin said he has some regrets about bringing Shahabian into the sting.  Although the former legislative aide was granted immunity from prosecution  because of his cooperation with the FBI, he eventually lost his Senate job.  </P> <P> But Levin is also convinced he did the right thing, despite the misgivings.  </P> <P> During one particularly low moment in 1987 -- just before the FBI persuaded  Shahabian to cooperate -- Levin wrote a long letter to the agent he had  befriended almost a decade before. "I became involved because I was enraged  with a political system that had one standard for money and power and another  for everyone else," Levin wrote. "I still don't personally think that what  happens as a result of your effort will cause substantive change. However, I  don't think I have a right to complain unless I am willing to act for change  when given the opportunity."  </P> <P> A year later, Levin had become a kind of fugitive, taking a cruise to escape a  burst of press attention after the FBI raid.  </P> <P> From aboard ship, his pulse racing and his blood pressure high, he wrote his  friend at the FBI: "The reason so few people step forward to help is that the  price of helping is very high. . . . Would I do it again? Probably, although I  don't know whether I could physically take it. I would do it because one has to  believe in something and stand up for your beliefs."  </P></p>

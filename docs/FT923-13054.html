			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings slide at two US broking houses FIRST SIGNS of a slowdown in business on Wall Street appeared yesterday when two of the biggest broking houses, Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber, both reported second-quarter earnings that were strong but below the record levels achieved in the first three months of the year. Merrill posted net income of Dollars 227.7m in the April-June period, up 24 per cent on a year ago, but well below the record Dollars 277.5m of the first quarter of 1992. PaineWebber's second-quarter profits were Dollars 45.7m, up on the Dollars 33.7m a year ago but down 38 per cent from the first quarter. Although the broking industry remains healthy, the inability of companies to match the record first quarter reflects a decline in equity underwriting business, especially in initial public offerings (IPOs), and a drop in trading profits, due mainly to the recent poor performance of domestic and international stock markets. Recent sales of stock funds have shrunk compared with record first-quarter levels as stuttering stock prices have made equities less attractive. The July 2 cut in interest rates, however, may persuade more investors to switch to stocks from low-yielding short-term instruments. At Merrill, investment banking remained the best-performing division, with revenues rising 27 per cent in the quarter to a record Dollars 399m. Strong bond underwriting and a substantial pick-up in M&amp;A advisory business helped offset the slack IPO market. Revenues from principal trading, particularly of government and municipal securities, corporate bonds and swaps, were buoyant at Dollars 552m, but lower than the Dollars 574m earned in the first three months. Asset management and custodial fees rose slightly to Dollars 217m. It was a similar picture at PaineWebber. Revenues from broking commissions, principal trading, investment banking and asset management all remained strong but below record first-quarter levels.</p>

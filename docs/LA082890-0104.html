			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Mixed: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 7.49%, down from 7.55% last week. Another $9.2  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.48%,  up from 7.45% last week.  </P> <P> The rates were the lowest for three-month bills since they sold for 7.41% on  Aug. 13. It was the highest for six-month bills since they averaged 7.52% on  July 16. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors:  7.74% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,810.70, and  7.88% for a six-month bill selling for $9,621.80. The discount rate reflects  the price discount received when government securities are purchased at less  than face value.  </P></p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ashanti gets the gold bug ASHANTI GOLDFIELDS Corporation of Ghana will employ the proceeds of a complex USDollars 140m syndicated loan signed yesterday to become the world's leading user of bacteria to produce gold. The naturally-occuring bacteria, Thiobacillus ferro-oxidans, will release 300,000 troy ounces of gold a year by munching away at difficult (or refractory) ore which otherwise would have to be treated by expensive roasting or pressure oxidation. The project is part of a USDollars 305m, three-year expansion programme that will take Ashanti's gold output above 1m ounces a year in 1995 and place it among the world's top ten producers. Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti's managing director, said yesterday in London that his company always had the ability to innovate and 'now we are at the cutting edge of both gold production technology and financial engineering'. Ashanti Ashanti will use a bio-leaching process developed by Gencor of South Africa. Ore is ground into a powder which is mixed with water in tanks into which the bacteria are introduced. Mr Jonah said the capital and operating costs of bio-leaching were much lower than for pressure oxidation, which was also seriously considered, but just as much gold was recovered. The process was more environmentally-friendly because it did not release sulphur and also fixed the arsenic in the ore in a stable form. Minproc of Australia had been awarded the Dollars 105m engineering contract and Mr Jonah said it was ahead of schedule. It took the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, a year to structure the loan, which may be drawn in either US dollars or gold. IFC will provide Dollars 40m of the total and the remaining Dollars 100m is syndicated with nine international banks. There is also a separate, ten-year facility to enable Ashanti to hedge 30 to 50 per cent of its annual gold output against fluctuations in gold prices. IFC will execute these transactions directly with Ashanti and hedge itself with market counterparties. Ashanti, 55 per cent-owned by the Ghana government and 45 per cent by Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate, produced 640,000 ounces of gold in the year to end-September and aims to produce 700,000 in this financial year.</p>

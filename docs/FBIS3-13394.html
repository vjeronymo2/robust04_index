			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 12 Mar (MENA)--Informed Palestinian sources  have disclosed that intensive contacts are now under way between  the PLO leaders in Tunis and officials in Cairo, Oslo,  Washington, and Moscow to prepare a scenario for the PLO's  return to the peace talks with Israel.    Under these arrangements, a Security Council resolution on  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque that will meet the Palestinian minimum  demands will be issued. This will be followed by a declaration  from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat that the PLO is ready to return to  the negotiations, provided Israel will be committed to  implementing the clauses of the Security Council resolution with  guarantees from both the United States and Russia.    The second step will be the arrival in Tunis of a  quadripartite Egyptian-Norwegian-U.S.-Russian delegation. The  delegation will include Egyptian Foreign Ministry under  secretary Nabil Fahmi, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Terry  Larsen [name as received], U.S. Middle East peace coordinator  Dennis Ross, and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov.  They will meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, fly to  Tel Aviv to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, then  return once again to Tunis to meet with 'Arafat to lay down the  final formula for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations. Following the meeting, 'Arafat will announce the  PLO's approval to join the talks to be held in Washington.    The Palestinian sources further disclosed that the PLO  leadership in the past three days has come under enormous  pressure from various parties, so much so that it was hard for  'Arafat to catch his breath in between the various calls he  received from Arab and international quarters. 'Arafat received  two calls from U.S. Coordinator Dennis Ross and another call  from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. According to  the same sources, these calls centered on the Security Council  resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The United States  wants the Palestinians not to insist on adding a special  paragraph in the resolution referring to East Jerusalem as an  occupied territory. Faced with the Palestinians' insistence on  their position, the United States told the PLO that it would  state reservations about this paragraph or would abstain from  voting, since the Security Council members will vote on the  resolution paragraph by paragraph. Washington has told the PLO  that it does not object to the remaining paragraphs or clauses  in the draft resolution.    The third step envisages a meeting in Washington between  Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], director of the PLO's Economic  Department; and Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director  General to discuss the security measures that need to be taken  in the occupied territories as well as other issues related to  the Palestinian police that will take over immediately after the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This will  be followed by a meeting in Washington between Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres and Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, PLO  Executive Committee member.    The fourth and last step under this scenario, as seen by  observers, will be a summit meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in  Washington in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton.    'Arafat received a message from Christopher yesterday in  which he proposed a timetable for resuming the self-rule talks  according to what he termed a package deal under which the PLO  would announce its return to the negotiations. In return, the  United States would back a paragraph in the Security Council  resolution on guaranteeing the protection and safety of  Palestinians in the occupied territories and abstain from voting  on a paragraph related to the status of East Jerusalem.    Christopher proposed to send U.S. Middle East coordinator  Dennis Ross and his team to both Tunis and Israel soon to  consult with 'Arafat and the Israeli officials, provided the two  sides pledge not to raise any new conditions regarding the  resumption of talks. Christopher also proposed that the PLO send  a high-level representative to Washington to meet with Israeli  representatives to hold negotiations, provided these  representatives are authorized to negotiate over the security  matters that surfaced following the Hebron massacre.  Christopher proposed a meeting between Abu-Mazin and Peres in  Washington on 18 March to resume the talks and reach an  agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles. Such an agreement would be signed by 'Arafat and  Rabin.    In his reply to Christopher, 'Arafat accepted his proposals  in principle so as to expedite a Security Council resolution and  reach an understanding between the two sides over measures for  protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories.  'Arafat accepted Christopher's invitation to Palestinian  negotiators to meet with their Israeli counterparts in  Washington the day after tomorrow, Monday, to endorse the  understanding that the Palestinians will reach with Ross during  his forthcoming trip to Tunis. 'Arafat stressed that these  measures must precede the resumption of the talks, which would  begin with a meeting between Peres and Abu-Mazin. 'Arafat also  hoped that the United States would not abstain from voting on  some clauses of the Security Council resolutions, since this  would conflict with the policy of the United States, which has  previously recognized East Jerusalem as part of the occupied  territories.</p>

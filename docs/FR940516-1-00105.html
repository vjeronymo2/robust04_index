			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is currently aware of at least one type of equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in EPA's view, might need to be evaluated through such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. Unlike CARB, EPA is not allowing all currently produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-stroke snowthrowers to meet standards applicable to engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in handheld equipment. In approving its regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California accepted arguments that nonhandheld 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snowthrowers should be allowed an exemption from the nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards to meet emission standards for handheld engines. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's view, at least two factors could have formed a basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this decision: First, snowthrowers are operated in the winter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which means that they do not significantly impact ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonattainment and thus need not be subject to stringent control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aimed at improving ambient air quality; and second, at least some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the lightweight 2-stroke snowthrowers that were exempted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld standards appear to be designed to be picked up while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in operation (for example, to clear porch steps), implying that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of a 4-stroke engine would significantly limit critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance features.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the first of these factors raises questions regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need to control emissions at all from products that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly only used in the winter, regardless of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification as handheld or nonhandheld, those questions must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be weighed against the need to address CO emissions, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to protect the health of equipment operators. The second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor reveals potential problems with CARB's definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``handheld.'' Specifically, CARB's action with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> snowthrowers raises questions regarding other ``fringe'' products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that it would be appropriate to classify as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld equipment lightweight snowthrowers under 14 kg which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no more than two wheels and which would either be carried or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported during operation. All other snowthrowers would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as nonhandheld and required to meet the standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were generally applicable to engines used in nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. EPA solicits comment on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under EPA's proposed definitions, lawnmowers will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified as nonhandheld equipment and thus engines used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawnmowers must meet the more stringent nonhandheld emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Manufacturers of 2-stroke lawnmower engines have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised concerns over their economic survival if required to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld standards, based on their doubt that cost-effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology now exists to bring their 2-stroke engines into timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. EPA requests comment on the ability of 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawnmower engine manufacturers to meet the nonhandheld standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact such a requirement would have on such manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for relief for such manufacturers, and the impact such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief might have on the environmental benefits of this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA further requests comment on the following options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing relief to 2-stroke lawnmower engine manufacturers: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provide an extended effective date, such as 1998, for 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawnmower engines to meet the nonhandheld standards; (2) allow 2-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stroke lawnmower engines to meet the handheld engine standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the effective date of the second phase of small SI engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations; (3) cap the number of 2-stroke lawnmowers allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify to the handheld standards to the number sold in the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proposal is published or promulgated until the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of the second phase of small SI engine regulations; or (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow a declining percentage of 2-stroke lawnmower engines to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the handheld standards, such as 100 percent in 1996, 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent in 1997, 50 percent in 1998, and 25 percent in 1999, so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that by the year 2000, all 2-stroke lawnmower engines sold would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the nonhandheld emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

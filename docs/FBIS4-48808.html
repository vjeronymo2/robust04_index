			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>   [Text] As we file this report, the city of Cuito is under  intense fire. Several people have been killed and others  wounded. We are unable to give the number of victims because of  the intensity of clashes and shelling. Yet, it is known between  last night and dawn today, National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola rebels had already fired more than 300  shells of various caliber at the martyred city. As usual, the  civil defense, the National Police, and the Angolan Armed Forces  have halted the destructive wrath of the men from Jamba. We  expect to give other details in our next report.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Union Intl nears deal on 3-year funding UNION INTERNATIONAL, the financially troubled trading arm of the Vestey Group, one of the UK's largest private companies, said it has reached agreement in principle with its bankers on the terms of a three-year funding facility. Union, which includes the Dewhurst butchers chain among its subsidiaries, had been faced with the possibility of administration if it failed to agree a rescheduling of loans totalling about Pounds 350m. The group has been in discussion for several months with more than 70 international bankers. They have agreed to continue existing facilities as an interim measure while details of the short-term financing arrangement are being finalised. 'A lot of the spade work on that has been established. The fundamentals of it have been agreed,' said Mr Tim Vestey, general manager of Vestey. Mr Vestey last month handed over as Union's chief executive to Mr Terry Robinson, formerly an executive director of Lonrho. The group had earlier appointed Schroders as financial advisers as part of a set of proposals to satisfy the banks that it had a viable business plan. In return for the banks' support, the group has had forego dividend payments on three of Union's cumulative preference stock units. Based on the last dividend paid on the 10m shares, payment would have amounted to about Pounds 500,000 per year, Mr Vestey said. The Vestey family and associated trusts own about 10 per cent of the preference stocks. Union is unlikely to publish its 1991 results until the three-year funding facility has been agreed. Without agreement it is likely that its accounts would be qualified.</p>

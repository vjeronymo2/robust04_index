			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMODITIES;  </P> <P> HOG STOCKS MOVING DESPITE BAD WEATHER; PRICES SKID  </P> <P> Prices of pork futures collapsed Monday in a disappointed reaction to  indications that wintry conditions in the Midwest had not slowed the movement  of hogs to packing houses.  </P> <P> In other markets, orange juice futures continued to decline, grain and soybean  futures fell sharply, precious metals advanced and energy futures weakened.  </P> <P> On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hog futures finished 0.50 cent to 1.42  cents lower, with the contract for delivery in February at 42.70 cents a pound.  Most contracts for future delivery of frozen pork bellies plummeted the  permitted daily limit of 2 cents, with February settling at 38.82 cents a  pound.  </P> <P> Cattle futures fared much better. Live cattle settled 0.40 cent lower to 0.10  cent higher, with February at 75.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.20 cent  lower to 0.40 cent higher, with March at 84.47 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Expectations for a cold weather slump in hog marketings turned out to be a bust  for speculators who had bid pork futures up sharply on Friday.  </P> <P> Instead of a decline, packers reported that hog marketings over the weekend and  Monday were higher than both week-ago and year-ago levels. The hog flow in Iowa  and southern Minnesota, for example, totaled 120,000 head Monday, compared to  110,000 a week earlier and 95,000 a year ago.  </P> <P> Spot market prices for hogs plunged by as much as 3 cents a pound, and the  futures market followed suit with pork belly contracts leading the way.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reluctant to Sell  </P> <P> "That's what happens when you don't get enough of a storm," said Tom O'Hare, a  livestock market analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The plunging pork prices led to some weakness in the cattle market, but many  cattle traders were reluctant to sell before Wednesday's national cattle  inventory report from the Agriculture Department.  </P> <P> That report is expected to show the nation's cattle herd as of Jan. 1 at its  lowest level since 1960, said Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with  Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.  </P> <P> Weather-related selling also hit orange juice futures on the New York Cotton  Exchange.  </P> <P> Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 4 to 4.6 cents lower, with March at  $1.354 a pound, as fears of a freeze in the Florida citrus groves continued to  ease.  </P> <P> Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, resuming a  trend that had been interrupted in Friday's session by unwarranted fears of a  radiation leak in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Wheat and oat futures also closed lower.  </P> <P> Grain futures gave back all the gains posted Friday, when a late rally was  sparked by reports that the Soviet Union had ordered the evacuation of 20  Ukrainian villages in an agricultural area contaminated with radiation from the  1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.  </P> <P> The mere mention of the Chernobyl incident apparently was enough to prompt  heavy buying of U.S. grain futures Friday. But the realization that there had  been no new radiation leakage was a key factor in Monday's selloff, analysts  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Precious Metals Rally  </P> <P> Wheat settled 0.75 cent to 4.50 cents lower, with March at $4.2575 a bushel;  corn was 4.75 to 6 cents lower, with March at $2.665 a bushel; oats were 4 to  4.75 cents lower, with March at $2.145 a bushel, and soybeans were 12 to 16.25  cents lower, with March at $7.5425 a bushel.  </P> <P> Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's Commodity Exchange in active  late buying after being down for most of the session.  </P> <P> Gold settled 40 to 90 cents higher, with April at $396.90 an ounce; silver was  6 to 6.5 cents higher, with February at $5.897 an ounce.  </P> <P> Most energy futures retreated in mostly technical selling on the New York  Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 to 23 cents lower, with March at  $17.38 a barrel; heating oil was 0.31 cent lower to 0.05 cent higher, with  March at 50.36 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.51 cent lower to  0.01 cent higher, with March at 48.74 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 12  </P></p>

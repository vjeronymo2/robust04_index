			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Possession limits for the above referenced species are twice the daily bag limits. Shooting hours would be from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset. There would be no open season for sandhill cranes, rails and snipe on the White Mountain Apache lands under this proposal. A number of special regulations apply to tribal and non-tribal hunters, which may be obtained from the White Mountain Apache Tribe Game and Fish Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations requested by the tribe for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons are as conservative as those established last year, and the Service proposes to approve them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Colorado River Indian Tribes, Colorado River Indian Reservation, Parker, Arizona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in Arizona and California. The tribes own almost all lands on the reservation, and they have full wildlife management authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In their 1994&hyph;95 proposal, dated May 17, 1994, the Colorado River Indian Tribes are requesting split dove seasons with regulations as follows. The early season is proposed to begin on September 1 and end on September 11, 1994, with the bag limits being ten (10) mourning or ten (10) white wing doves either singly or in the aggregate. The late season for doves is proposed to open on November 21, 1994, and close on January 8, 1995, with the bag limit being ten (10) mourning doves. The possession limit would be twice the daily bag limit. Shooting hours would be from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset, and other special tribally set regulations would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Colorado River Indian Tribes are also proposing split duck hunting seasons, the first running from October 14, 1994, through November 10, 1994, and the second running from December 9, 1994, through January 8, 1995. The Tribes are proposing the same dates for coots and common moorhens. The daily bag limit for ducks, including mergansers, would be 4, which would include no more than 2 redheads, 2 pintails, 1 canvasback or 1 Mexican duck. The possession limit would be twice the daily bag limit, after the first day. The daily bag limit for coots and common moorhens would be 25, singly or in the aggregate. The possession limit for coots and common moorhens would be twice the daily bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For geese, the Colorado River Indian Tribes has proposed a season of October 22, 1994, through January 22, 1995. The daily bag and possession limits for geese would be 5, which would include no more than 3 white geese (snow and/or Ross and blue geese) and not more than 2 dark geese (Canada geese).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations described here, based upon past seasons, the anticipated harvest is estimated to be less than 400 ducks and 100 geese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A valid Colorado River Indian Reservation hunting permit is required before taking wildlife and to be in possession while hunting. As in the past, the regulations would apply both to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tribal and non-tribal hunters. The Service is proposing to approve the Colorado River Indian Tribes regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, Wisconsin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1985, various bands of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians have exercised judicially recognized off-reservation hunting rights for migratory birds in Wisconsin. The specific regulations were established by the Service in consultation with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC, which represents the various bands). Beginning in 1986, a tribal season on ceded lands in the western portion of the State's Upper Peninsula was developed in coordination with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the Service has approved special regulations for tribal members in both Michigan and Wisconsin since the 1986&hyph;87, hunting season. In 1987, the GLIFWC requested and the Service approved special regulations to permit tribal members to hunt on ceded lands in Minnesota, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. The States of Michigan and Wisconsin concurred with the regulations, although Wisconsin has raised some concerns each year. Minnesota did not concur with the regulations, stressing that the State would not recognize Chippewa Indian hunting rights in Minnesota's treaty area until a court with jurisdiction over the State acknowledges and defines the extent of these rights. The Service acknowledged the State's concern, but pointed out that the United States Government has recognized the Indian hunting rights decided in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Voigt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case, and that acceptable hunting regulations have been negotiated successfully in both Michigan and Wisconsin even though the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Voigt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision did not specifically address ceded land outside Wisconsin. The Service believes this is appropriate because the treaties in question cover ceded lands in Michigan (and Minnesota), as well as in Wisconsin. Consequently, in view of the above, the Service has approved special regulations since the 1987&hyph;88 hunting season on ceded lands in all three States. In fact, this recognition of the principle of reserved treaty rights for band members to hunt and fish was pivotal in a decision by the Service to approve a special season for the 1836 ceded area in Michigan for the 1991&hyph;92 migratory bird hunting seasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, certain GLIFWC member bands have brought suit to resolve the issue of hunting, fishing and gathering rights in the Minnesota ceded areas covered under the 1837 and 1854 treaties. The Federal Government has intervened in support of the bands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Dalgety snaps up Sooner Snacks DALGETY, the UK foods group, yesterday announced that it had bought Sooner Snacks, the UK subsidiary of Borden of the US, in a further rationalisation of the branded snacks market. Dalgety is paying Pounds 30m for Sooner's share capital and will repay Pounds 14m of inter-company loans. The acquisition will increase Dalgety's share of the overall snacks market to just under 20 per cent when it combines Borden's products with Golden Wonder, its leading brand. Mr Maurice Warren, Dalgety's chief executive, said the company would be able to use Borden's fleet of delivery vans to increase Dalgety's share of impulse sales in the pubs, clubs and garages market. Borden, which has interests ranging from food to adhesives, has seen fierce competition in its domestic market on the snacks side, although it has stepped up efforts to protect its number two position in the salty snacks market recently. The company claimed that the sale of the UK unit had no impact on its commitment to North America, and that its thrust into the Germany, Hungarian and central European markets would continue. The sale is a further commitment to the foods industry after years of involvement with volatile activities like commodity trading. It is now concentrating on snacks, petfoods, food ingredients and agri-business. Sooner had sales of Pounds 57m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m in the year to December 1990. Manufacturing in Scunthorpe, it has brands like Nik Naks, Ghostbusters, Groovers as well as traditional crisps. Mr Warren said Dalgety was still looking to expand with acquisitions in continental Europe but that when a company like Sooner was for sale it was too good an opportunity to forego. 'Its portfolio of snack and crisp brands, its wide distribution in the impulse sector and its van sales force complement the commercial and management strengths of Golden Wonder,' he said.</p>

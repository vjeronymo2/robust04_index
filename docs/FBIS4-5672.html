			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe, a primary force in the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), on Wednesday [13 April] stepped up his  campaign to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.  At a meeting Wednesday [13 April], Watanabe's faction agreed to  lobby LDP members to endorse him as the successor to Hosokawa,  who announced last Friday he would resign, faction sources said.    Watanabe also rejected a request for face-to-face talks with  LDP President Yohei Kono, who vowed Tuesday to seek the  premiership to maintain party unity, the sources said.    Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime candidate for  the premiership after a feud within the ruling coalition  threatened to split the government, weakening the chances of  front-runner Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named to  succeed Hosokawa. But on Tuesday, the ruling coalition, which  was on the verge of collapse, moved to maintain the current  framework of the government, once again strengthening Hata's  hand.    A senior member of Watanabe's faction said, however, there  is  still a glimmer of hope for Watanabe being named prime minister  because the ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds  within the shaky alliance and band together to support Hata.    On Wednesday, new party Sakigake [Harbinger], a component of  the coalition, voiced its opposition with the process of  selecting a new premier and boycotted a crucial meeting, giving  impetus once again to Watanabe's ambitions to lead a new  government.    Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary,  told a news conference that coalition parties should conclude  discussion on possible realignment of political forces before  choosing the next prime minister.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the coalition's  two core forces that are at odds with Sakigake, have expressed  interest in Watanabe as the next leader of a new coalition  government due to his political savvy and influence, political  sources said.    They said Watanabe may form a new party if he rallies enough  support from within the LDP.    A senior LDP official said, "It is good if Watanabe runs in  the election (as the LDP's unified candidate) and the LDP is  able to regain power, but if he is a candidate within the party,  it means Kono should resign as party president."</p>

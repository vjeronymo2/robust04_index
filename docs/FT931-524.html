			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Co-operation lifts Russian aero industry - The fruits of international links A NEW spirit of international co-operation in the Russian aerospace industry bears its most elaborate fruit today when the first airliner to be jointly built by Russian and US companies is rolled out in Moscow. The Ilyushin IL-96M is Russia's challenge to the new generation of long-haul wide-body airliners from the European Airbus consortium and Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US. Powered by four US-built Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and fitted with advanced US fly-by-wire technology and digital flight navigation equipment, the IL-96M will be able to carry up to 311 passengers in three classes non-stop on routes of up to 7,000 nautical miles. When it enters service around 1995 it will be competing against the Airbus A340, the Boeing 777 and 767, and the McDonnell Douglas MD11. 'We have worked with 18 American firms on this project. That's why it is truly a Russian-American plane,' says Mr Genrikh Novozhilov, Ilyushin's general designer. The long-haul aircraft is to be produced in Voronezh, in southern Russia. The partners in the venture are expected to try to sell it to hard-currency paying customers for about Dollars 75m, 25-30 per cent less than similar aircraft from the west. Mr Novozhilov says the US and Russian partners have received requests for options on 30 aircraft from potential customers, including Russian International Airlines, Aeroflot's international division. The IL-96M is not the only recent product of Russian aerospace collaboration with the west. Tupolev has equipped its TU-204 mid-range 200-seater twin jet airliner with Rolls-Royce engines to compete against the Boeing 757, and has targeted China, India and the Middle East as well as the former Soviet Union as potential markets. Another Russian manufacturer, Yakovlev, is working with US suppliers to modernise its business and commuter aircraft. Although the world commercial aerospace industry is undergoing a prolonged decline, western manufacturers believe Russia offers strong long-term potential. In its latest study of the industry, Boeing says despite short-term political and economic uncertainties, Russia offers not only a potentially large market but 'substantial' aircraft manufacturing capability. Boeing estimates that the former Soviet market will require 2,000 new jets for internal services and 250 aircraft for international routes during the next 18 years. 'The technological potential is tremendous and the capacity is out of this world, but the financial situation is very tight and the structure of the Russian industry is complex and confused,' says Mr Jurgen Schrempp, president of Deutsche Aerospace, which has been scouting for co-operation opportunities in Russia. Mr Schrempp sees Russian manufacturers eventually co-operating on large scale projects, including the development of a 600-800 seat super jumbo or a next generation supersonic airliner. Both Tupolev and Ilyushin, which have their own designs for a high capacity aircraft, are candidates for such a venture. Mr Louis Gallois, the head of Aerospatiale of France, signed a wide-ranging protocol with Russian manufacturers in Moscow this month earmarking six potential projects for co-operation. They included the development of the Mil MI-38 multi-purpose helicopter, the proposed Tupolev TU-334 medium-range airliner, liquid propulsion boosters for the European Ariane space rocket, co-operation with the Franco-Italian ATR regional aircraft group as well as collaboration in super jumbos and supersonic aircraft. But financing and the industry's current structure remain big problems. Faced with an abrupt reduction in state subsidies, Aviastar, which builds the Antonov AN124 cargo aircraft and the TU-204 airliner, has begun to manufacture furniture and tractors to generate cash. Apart from Aviastar's financial difficulties, common to the entire industry, there is also friction between the manufacturer and the Tupolev design bureau. The division between design bureaus and manufacturing facilities, which never mattered under the centralised control of a single aviation ministry now dissolved, has frustrated western partners. Aerospatiale, for example, has experienced such difficulties with the MI-38 helicopter. Mr Novozhilov says he plans to create an inter-state corporation, merging his bureau with the factories which make Ilyushin aircraft, including one in Tashkent, the capital of newly independent Uzbekistan. 'This will deal with everything, from design to serial production to after-sales service,' he says. There are some misgivings in Russia over the trend toward collaboration. Mr Novozhilov believes that Aerospatiale's proposal to Yakovlev to help manufacture and sell Franco-Italian ATR regional turboprops is one example of a western company 'striving to break up' Russia's aerospace industry by taking advantage of its difficulties. With the IL-114, he argues Ilyushin already has its own equivalent of the ATR, and warns that the different design bureaus and Russian manufacturers are pursuing a dangerous policy of 'each man for himself'. The Russian state has promised to focus support on industries it considers worth saving. There is no doubt that aerospace is one of them, but an industrial policy has yet to emerge.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World Reaction): UK savours links with 'Univ man' MR Bill Clinton's time spent beneath the dreaming spires of Oxford may not, by itself, be enough to turn Washington into Camelot when he moves into the White House. However, Britain yesterday was hailing the prospect that its 'special relationship' with the US could be given an additional polish as a result of Mr Clinton's Oxonian connections. The Foreign Office yesterday underlined that Mr Clinton - who was a Rhodes Scholar - would be the first US president to have studied at Oxford. 'There will be a sentimental attachment,' a Foreign Office spokesman said. 'But they (the Clinton administration) will be trying to do their best for America, just as we are trying to do the best for ourselves.' Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, took a break from worrying about a US-European trade war to welcome the prospect of working 'very well' with the new president. Prime Minister John Major is likely to meet Mr Clinton during a planned trip to the US before the end of the year. Dons at the 13th century University college, where Mr Clinton studied in 1968-1969, issued a message of congratulation. The Master and fellows said they were 'delighted' at the election of a 'Univ man' to the US presidency. The college has endured months of harassment from the media.</p>

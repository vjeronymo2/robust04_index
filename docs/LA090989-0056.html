			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA;  </P> <P> SDSU NEGOTIATES RENT REDUCTION  </P> <P> The San Diego Stadium Authority Board has approved a reduction in rental terms  with San Diego State for football games at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> The changes, approved by the board Thursday and sent to the City Council for  its consideration, could save SDSU about $14,000 this year, said Jim Herrick,  SDSU assistant athletic director for finance.  </P> <P> Herrick said the agreement is expected to cut in half a rent increase scheduled  to take effect this year under provisions of a 10-year lease that expires in  1993. He said without the reduction, the school would have expected to pay  about $130,000 in rent for its seven 1989 home games.  </P> <P> Herrick said agreement was also reached in three other areas: The authority  agreed to exempt preferred seating donations from its rental fees and limit its  share of cable television revenue, and the school agreed to a reduced seating  configuration.  </P> <P> SDSU requested the rent reduction after the Chargers renegotiated provisions of  their lease last year, said Jack McGrory, assistant city manager. The SDSU  athletic department has been hurt the past two fiscal years by falling  attendance at home football games and a rising deficit.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reasonable Routes to Terminals and Other Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reasonable access to terminals and other facilities was discussed by fifteen commenters, including twelve shippers and carriers, one State, one Federal entity, and one local agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine commenters representing shippers and carriers of fuels and farm supplies recommended more flexibility be provided for their products in designating route restrictions because many of their deliveries are local and unplanned. Seven of these commenters, mostly representing short-haul, irregular route carriers, recommended they be exempted from the proposed limits on reasonable access deviations, because they could impose a financial burden on them. The FHWA declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA was specific on providing the States and Indian tribes with the flexibility to accommodate local and special interests which may be unique to an area's geographic or commercial situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three government agencies recommended a larger maximum deviation distance, whereas three carriers recommended a shorter maximum deviation. In response to these comments, the FHWA amended &sect;397.71(b)(7) by replacing the proposed requirement that such routes or deviations not exceed twice the distance of the most direct route with a requirement that States or Indian tribes which establish or provide for reasonable access to and from designated routes use the shortest practicable route based upon consideration of 13 factors listed in paragraph (b)(9) of that section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters recommended clarification of the applicability of reasonable access and through routing provisions to local deliveries. The FHWA revised the reasonable access provisions to also apply to pickup and deliveries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Through Routing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Through routing issues were discussed by twenty-seven commenters, including nineteen shippers and carriers, three Federal agencies, three States, one Indian tribe, and one citizens' action group. Fifteen commenters recommended a decrease in the maximum deviation distance and two commenters favored an increase to as much as twice the distance of the most direct route. Four commenters recommended elimination of percentage-based permissible routing deviations and suggested that consideration of the factors would be adequate. Three commenters also indicated that it was inappropriate to use an arbitrary percentage to determine the length of permissible deviations when such a percentage has no correlation to safety. Four commenters recommended clarifying how the maximum deviation limitation would be applied to each designated routing encountered during a trip or to the sum of all deviations contained in an entire trip. Seven commenters recommended clarifying the difference between through routing and reasonable routes to terminals and other facilities, and when the separate regulations are applicable. Several of the commenters recommended that deviations from through routing should only be implemented when the deviation is safer than the through route or at least as safe and not an unreasonable burden on commerce. The FHWA has revised the section on through routing to consider public safety and economic burden (rather than use only percentages and mileage measurements). The revised section provides a relationship between route deviations and public safety and requires that new routing designations have substantially lower relative risk than the current routing. When the relative risk of the routing deviation is not substantially lower, the potential economic effect becomes a significant factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PAIR FLEE IRAN ONLY TO FIND 'HOTEL ASTORIA'  </P> <P> "The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" (at the Monica 4-Plex) takes us into the  daily lives of a group of Iranian refugees stranded in a small, drab Istanbul  pension. Wracked by uncertainty after having risked their lives escaping from  "Khomeini's hell," they fluctuate between hope and despair while living in  constant fear.  </P> <P> Time and again, they are awakened in the middle of the night by Turkish  authorities intent on checking their passports (most of which are false). They  worry about dwindling finances as they anxiously await word on their latest  visa application. Theirs is a heartbreaking predicament, shot through with  cruel ironies.  </P> <P> Drawing upon his own experiences as a temporary exile in Turkey, Iranian  writer-director Reza Alameh Zadeh, now living in Holland, singles out a married  couple among the dozen refugees at the Hotel Astoria. In their 30s, they are  attractive and well-educated (they had been teachers). Their efforts to get to  the Netherlands, where the husband's brother has lived for 11 years, quickly  turns into a nightmare.  </P> <P> It's fortunate that Zadeh, a better writer than director, is dealing with such  strong material and that Shohreh Aghadashloo, who plays the wife, and Moshen  Marzban, as her husband, are such accomplished actors. There's little style or  drive to the film, but it eventually catches fire when we realize how concerned  we've become with their fate. The film may be awkward, but it is numbingly  credible. And as bleak and harrowing as it is, it is also suffused with warmth  because the Hotel Astoria's guests are kind and supportive of each other, and  they occasionally even receive the kindness of strangers.  </P> <P> Along with its central performances, "The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" has  among its pluses a spare yet dramatic score by Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh, who was  a noted film composer in Iran, and clean, carefully lit camera work by Charles  Burnett, an outstanding local independent film maker whose credits include the  script and photography for "Killer of Sheep" and his own feature "Bless Their  Little Hearts."  </P> <P> "The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" (Times-rated Mature for adult themes) was  produced by Rafigh Pooya, innovative operator of the now-closed Fox  International Theater in Venice.  </P> <P> 'THE GUESTS OF THE HOTEL ASTORIA'  </P> <P> A Take 7 Productions presentation.

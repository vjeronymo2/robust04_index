			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Out for blood Sir, I wonder if the MPs of both main parties currently baying for the blood of Lloyd's 'insiders' (that is, members) for the losses of many 'outside' Names have noticed the losses being reported by insurance companies, with the shares of Royal, for instance, falling from 490p to around 180p in the last year or so and passing its dividend? Would it not be consistent to set the lynch mob on the company 'insiders' (ie management) for the losses of 'outside' shareholders? Or would that be seen to be so idiotic as to be without political capital? H L Benjamin, 22 Shrewsbury House, Cheyne Walk, London SW3</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> AMENDMENT OKD FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors on Tuesday approved an amendment to the city's  Growth Management Initiative for placement on the June ballot.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, the amendment would exempt, in the Civic Center Master  Plan area, building projects that received approval before Nov. 7, 1989.  </P> <P> It would also allow a simple majority vote -- instead of the two-thirds now  required -- for board passage of certain exceptions to the ordinance. Finally,  it would clarify the initiative's language regarding construction in the city's  Northwest Enterprise Zone.  </P> <P> The 10-year initiative, passed in March, limits annual residential construction  to 250 units and major commercial construction to 25,000 square feet.  </P> <P> In a separate action, the board also approved a pre-application process in  which new building applications will be accepted from Feb. 20 through March 30.  City staff members had stopped accepting applications while officials worked  out plans to handle applications submitted before the initiative was passed.  </P></p>

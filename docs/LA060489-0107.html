			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER  </P> <P> By Train Through China  </P> <P> by Paul Theroux  </P> <P> (Ivy Books: $4.95)  </P> <P> Paul Theroux spent the better part of a year (1986-87) traveling through China  by train asking people questions about such subjects as the Cultural Revolution  that even six years previously would have been considered worse than bad  manners. "My children saw the Red Guards humiliate me," a professor says over  dinner. Now that travel abroad is permitted, the professor continues, "Can you  blame them for choosing to stay in Minnesota?"  </P> <P> Theroux captures the sights and sounds along his ride as well as sentiments  that are more forthcoming today: the spittoons placed in restaurants to  discourage spitting, the officials who search his luggage specifically for  pornography ("considered vastly more dangerous than political propaganda").  </P> <P> While reviewer Jim Mann found Theroux's political analysis "simplistic," he  called "Riding the Iron Rooster" "an epic account of China. . . . (This)  talented writer has captured in one sprawling, extraordinary book all the  craziness, the contradictions, the mixture of hope and despair, the wild swings  between control and utter chaos."  </P></p>

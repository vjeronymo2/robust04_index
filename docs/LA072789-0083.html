			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. QUERYING 10 AUSTRIANS ABOUT BLOCH  </P> <P> U.S. investigators have asked Austrian officials and political figures,  including Foreign Minister Alois Mock, to supply information about the  activities of Felix S. Bloch from 1981 to 1987, when he served in Vienna,  Austrian officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> U.S. authorities, they said, have given the names of 10 people to Interior  Minister Hans Loeschnak along with a request that they be asked to describe  their relations with Bloch. They were asked specifically to describe the type  of questions he asked in social settings.  </P> <P> All 10 are believed to have been in contact with Bloch, who is under suspicion  in Washington of spying for the Soviet Union when he was the No. 2 U.S.  diplomat in Vienna.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Good Job'  </P> <P> "These were all top people in government," a senior official in the Foreign  Ministry said. "All it shows is that Mr. Bloch did a very good job in his six  years here."  </P> <P> It is not clear how the request fits into the investigation of Bloch's possible  involvement in espionage activities. Bloch has not been charged with any  offense, but he has been suspended from his duties in the State Department  pending the outcome of the investigation by the FBI and the State Department.  </P> <P> "The U.S. side has asked 10 people to make an account of their relations with  Bloch," a spokesman for Mock said. "Of course, it is in our interest to  cooperate with that request."  </P> <P> But Interior Minister Loeschnak has not yet committed the Austrian government  to giving the information to the Americans. He described it as an "internal  matter."  </P> <P> The Vienna newspaper Die Presse named six officials it said were on the  American list, including Conservative Party leader Mock, a longtime personal  friend of Bloch, and Socialist Party parliamentary leader Heinz Fisher.  </P> <P> Others were Peter Jankowitsch, the Socialist Party foreign policy spokesman;  Heinrich Neissler, a former Cabinet minister; Manfred Scheich, a Foreign  Ministry official who serves as liaison with the European Economic Community,  and Eva Nowotny, a foreign policy adviser to the chancellor, the head of  government.  </P> <P> The largely sensationalist Austrian press has been having a field day with the  Bloch affair, linking the diplomat with practically every controversial event  of the past decade, ranging from the 1985 sale of artillery to Iran to the  controversy over President Kurt Waldheim, who is barred from the United States  for his alleged role in Nazi war crimes in World War II.  </P> <P> The Kronen Zeitung referred to a report, substantiated in part by Austrian  government officials, that Bloch had a long relationship with an unidentified  Viennese woman.  </P> <P> The "spy's girlfriend," Kronen Zeitung said, has been vacationing in Egypt and  will be interviewed upon her return to Austria.  </P> <P> The headline over the story said: "FBI Asks Austrians for Help; Spy's Viennese  Girlfriend Escapes to Egypt."  </P> <P> Senior Austrian officials were informed of the Bloch investigation by U.S.  Ambassador Henry A. Grunwald two weeks before it became public. Some Austrian  officials said they were frustrated because the U.S. authorities have neither  brought charges against Bloch nor cleared him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'So Many Doubts'  </P> <P> "The only evidence we have on our side," one official said, "is that a U.S.  ambassador walks in and says that something nasty is going on. If a U.S.  ambassador says something like that, you expect something to happen. Now the  whole thing seems very much in the dark. There are so many doubts about whether  (Bloch) is guilty or not. The uncertainty has damaged the credibility of both  the United States and Austria."  </P> <P> After recent statements here by former U.S. Ambassador Helene von Damm that  depicted Vienna as a hotbed of espionage, Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk decided to  fight back with a statement to the press.  </P> <P> "Sure," he said, "historically Vienna is a popular place for spies. But New  York has many more."  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Rexrodt outlines EU presidency plans Germany will seek to extend its own campaign for international competitiveness to the whole of the European Union this year, including promotion of more flexibility in labour markets, and a concerted push for deregulation. That was the strategy outlined yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, for the forthcoming six-month German presidency of the EU. He set out a five-point economic programme focused primarily on free-market policies to stimulate growth and counter unemployment, including a controversial proposal for an independent team of business experts to test all EU regulations for unnecessary burdens on companies and consumers. The idea for an independent working group, sharply criticised by Mr Jacques Delors, European commission president, is the main plank of Mr Rexrodt's deregulation initiative intended to slim the Brussels bureaucracy. At the same time he is proposing a concerted push to implement the EU action plan for job creation and growth, concentrating on promoting more flexibility in labour markets, and improved tax incentives for job creation. He promised a push to remove national barriers to a single energy market in the 12 member states, both for gas and electricity, intended to give consumers and distributors access to competitive energy sources. He proposed steps to speed the creation of an integrated information network in the EU, reducing legal barriers to the exchange of data and information, and encouragement for private initiatives to extend information networks on the basis of private financing. The fifth element in his presidency strategy is to provide greater market opening for the states of central and eastern Europe. That would include the conclusion of free trade agreements with the Baltic republics during the second half of the year, and a Europe agreement with Slovenia. Mr Rexrodt said that formal EU membership negotiations with Poland and Hungary, the two central European states to submit formal applications, could only begin once the EU itself had agreed on the next round of institutional reforms scheduled for 1996. In the meantime, further market-opening measures were needed, and restraint on the part of the EU in instituting anti-dumping and other protection measures against the central and east Europeans. Mr Rexrodt's strategy is one element of a concerted German presidency programme still being finalised by the various German ministries, before Bonn takes over the EU presidency on July 1. The six-month period will involve the installation of a new European parliament and the approval of a new European Commission, including a redistribution of Commission portfolios - all matters of acute political sensitivity. Apart from the economic strategy, the presidency will focus on developing common foreign and security policies, and preparing the ground for the 1996 inter-governmental conference on institutional reform.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / New scripts for Bush and Clinton: The end of the cold war has recast the foreign policy debate in this year's US presidential campaign Foreign policy has a way of inserting itself into presidential elections. The confrontation with Iraq and the tragedy in what was Yugoslavia may have been boiling for months, but neither had quite thrust themselves into the forefront of an election supposedly to be determined principally on domestic issues. Yet, when either George Bush or Bill Clinton wakes up on the morning of November 4, the loser may well find the names of both countries written in the political obituaries. This was not in the pre-ordained script. In the good old days of the cold war, the playing of the foreign policy card in presidential elections was predictable. The Republican candidate would accuse his Democratic opponent of being soft on communism, weak on defence and, if pushed to the partisan extreme, would point out that US participation in this century's three big wars (two global and Vietnam) was initiated by Democratic presidents. The Democrat would preach the virtues of an enlightened approach to the rest of the world, based on humanitarian values, shared international responsibilities and a leaner military establishment. Republicans used to hold the United Nations in contempt and the Democrats half-heartedly would extol it. There have been variations on the basic theme, mostly from the Democrats. In 1960 John Kennedy sought to be 'tougher' than Richard Nixon over Cuba and China, and in 1964 Lyndon Johnson got away with portraying Barry Goldwater as a nuclear adventurist (which was not difficult). Jimmy Carter's successful campaign of 1976 was probably the closest to the Democratic norm, but he was swamped four years later by his own Iranian albatross and by Ronald Reagan's equally classical Republican slogan of 'peace through strength'. This was enough to carry George Bush to victory in 1988 even though the 'evil empire' had become quite emollient. It still features in his speeches today. There are two quantum differences this year. First, the cold war is dead and buried alongside the corpse of the Soviet Union, presenting a different set of challenges to the presentation of foreign policy by the two candidates. Second, as recent events merely confirmed, Mr Clinton does not fit the Democratic type; indeed, he sometimes seems to have lifted a lot, with nuances, from the Republican handbook. The Clinton logic is to accept that the cold war is over, not to quibble over why, but instead to try and solve new problems. Anthony Lake, his foreign policy adviser, says: 'At a moment when history has turned, experience is not necessarily the first qualification.' The Bush premise is to explain why it was won, his role in the victory and to argue that the experience gained is too invaluable to discard in still tricky times, exemplified by Iraq and Bosnia. This could make for a fascinating general dialectic if the country was listening. As Mr Bush likes to point out with scorn, the Democratic nominee devoted precisely 143 words - or one minute - of his 54-minute acceptance speech to his convention to foreign policy. But Mr Clinton is probably closer to the public ear than is Mr Bush, insulated in the White House cocoon. The president will make much of his Gulf war victory when he speaks to his convention in Houston next week and is wheeling out Mr Reagan for an opening night keynote address on foreign policy. But Mr Bush's own advisers concede that things have changed to the point that military involvement between now and election day, especially in a Balkan quagmire that few understand, might produce little political profit. That credit, the argument goes, was used up by the Gulf war and could only be restored by the removal, by whatever mysterious hand, of Saddam Hussein. Still, Mr Bush would be politically dumb not to capitalise on the fact that only in foreign policy is he considered the more competent. If he can catch Mr Clinton with his formal inexperience showing, he might be on to something. Gerald Ford's silly mistake in the 1976 debate, when he asserted there was no Soviet military subjection of Poland, knocked his campaign off track for a fateful couple of weeks. The problem is that many of Mr Clinton's positions differ little from his own. Mr Clinton has always supported financial aid to Russia, even when his party wanted it switched to US cities. He might be a little tougher on China, a little gentler on Israel and, again recently, a little bolder on Bosnia, but mostly he has supported whatever Mr Bush has said, including over the latest confrontation with Saddam Hussein. More than this, as in domestic policy, the Clinton foreign team has been phenomenally quick with its responses, so that no allegation appears on the evening news without an appropriate answer. When accused by the White House of being 'reckless' for advocating selective, UN-sanctioned bombing to relieve Sarajevo, there was Mr Clinton instantly citing an administration source (Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, no less) for having said exactly the same thing. He now has Mr Bush himself to adduce in evidence. When charged with equivocal support for the Gulf war, the immediate counter was that Mr Bush's 'coddling' of the Iraqi president in the 1980s had not done much good either. This does make for entertaining verbal chess, demonstrating at least that Mr Clinton is no Michael Dukakis, who had no foreign policy at all. But it hardly amounts to the presentation of an alternative vision to set against the Bush record, and it does not take account of the advantages from foreign policy that any incumbent president can bring to bear on a domestic electorate. Some of them may be more apparent than real, but in Mr Bush's case this year these potentially include: The Middle East. The axiomatic Republican target is to get 30 per cent of the traditionally Democratic Jewish vote. Mr Clinton has been most solicitous towards Jewish constituencies, not least by keeping the Rev Jesse Jackson at arm's length, as well as by standing four-square behind Israel even when Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister. But that still looks thin compared with some of the achievements of the Bush administration. Not for political nothing is Mr Yitzhak Rabin coming here this week, with peace talks resuming in Washington on August 24. It is likely that the Arab and Palestinian representatives would prefer a continuation of the Bush approach to the uncertainties of a new US administration. Eastern Europe. There are, according to the 1990 census, 9.4m Americans of Polish ancestry, 3.5m Czechs and Slovaks, 2.9m Russians, 1.6m Hungarians, 810,000 Lithuanians and 740,000 Ukrainians. Many are working-class Reagan Democrats and many approve of Mr Bush's role in facilitating the transition of their countries of origin to democracy. The Poles will take particular note of the endorsement Mr Bush received in Warsaw last month from President Lech Walesa. Hispanics. More than 17m Americans speak Spanish as a first language. The Cubans, concentrated in Florida, wholeheartedly approved of Mr Bush's refusal to shake hands with Fidel Castro in Rio in June. The US-Mexican business community supports the North American Free Trade Agreement, of which Mr Clinton is increasingly critical, and may be influential in getting out what is normally a low but Democratic-leaning Hispanic vote. Western Europe. Mr Bush may try to call in some Euro-chips. He virtually endorsed John Major before the UK elections, while previous German chancellors have publicly preferred a Republican. But no post-Thatcher European leader has much of a following in the US and Lady Thatcher's recent column in The New York Times on Bosnia was not complimentary to Mr Bush. Mr Clinton, neither an isolationist nor a protectionist, is also, for Europe, probably the least threatening Democratic candidate in years. But the political calculations must also be placed in a broader context. Whatever Mr Bush and Mr Clinton say and hope, neither has succeeded yet in laying out what might be described as anything other than the chapter headings for their new world orders. The sceptical foreign policy establishment view was very well put recently by Winston Lord, the former US ambassador to China and chairman of a recent commission sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to examine the US place in a changing world. 'Leaders and aspiring leaders have taken two actions with respect to foreign policy - run away or run it down. We see no coherent vision at home or abroad to guide us towards the next century - not from the executive and not from Congress, not from the president and not from his opponents,' he said. Certainly neither talks much about the perennial issue of US military presence overseas, though both accept it will be cut, more deeply by Mr Clinton. Both support Nato as an article of faith, though they differ on the edges of its role, and neither has broached the balance of the security treaty with Japan. Mr Bush says Mr Clinton has already relegated the US to the status of a second-class power, but the president has himself disowned the Pentagon strategic blueprint which sought to preserve US military hegemony. Both support the UN, with Mr Clinton recommending that Japan and Germany be admitted to the Security Council. Other foreign policy experts complain that the Republican administration after 12 years in power has finally run out of steam and ideas, as witnessed at the Munich summit and again by its recent hesitancy on both the Balkan and Iraqi counts. James Baker, the secretary of state, may be good at 'fixing things' but he is presumably about to move back to manage the troubled re-election campaign, itself, as Mr Clinton points out, a reflection of Mr Bush's current priorities. Mr Baker also has his critics. They cite his invisibility immediately after the Kuwait invasion and his long disinterest in Yugoslavia and in the Uruguay Round trade talks, in both cases only belatedly re-awakened. They point to a lack of US clarity towards the faltering process of European integration with the new democracies to its east. Mr Clinton sums it up by describing an administration which has become 'rudderless and reactive'. Neither candidate disagrees with the general proposition that for the US to retain its pre-eminence, it must revitalise itself at home. But differences over how best to accomplish this brings the election debate full circle to where it started - with foreign policy on the margins and both candidates saying 'trust me'. The debate was certainly more distinct when the cold war was raging and, if push comes to shove in either the Balkans or Iraq, it may become more distinct again.</p>

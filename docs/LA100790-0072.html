			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'WHAT'S ORGANIC' PUZZLES FARMERS, CONSUMERS  </P> <P> The poster on Christine and Dale Johnson's kitchen wall reads, "Our Veggies  Don't Do Drugs."  </P> <P> A jar on the kitchen table holds wasp eggs, future natural predators to be used  instead of pesticides against the tomato hornworm -- "a nasty critter, a  voracious eater," Christine Johnson said.  </P> <P> The Johnsons run an organic farm, growing peppers, squash, kale, cherry  tomatoes, eggplant, lettuce and other produce on their 65 acres on the eastern  shore of Chesapeake Bay.  </P> <P> Many people tell opinion surveys they are willing to pay more for organic food,  grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides or insecticides.  </P> <P> But growers, retailers, consumer groups and environmentalists say the organic  food industry has been handicapped by the lack of consistent national standards  to answer the question: What is organic food?  </P> <P> "I think the consumer has the right to the assurance that the organic label  means something," Christine Johnson said. "The consumer can often be deceived  (and) possibly pay more for a product that's no better than another."  </P> <P> Twenty-two states -- including California -- have regulations defining organic  farming. They all follow the same basic idea, but no two are identical. In  other states organic farms are certified by private organizations, applying  their own standards.  </P> <P> "Organic agriculture is a funny word. Organic by definition in Webster's would  just be carbon-based," said Joseph Dunsmoor, founder of the organic food  distributor Organic Farms in Beltsville, Md. "You can say organic agriculture  means you don't use farm chemicals. It's a whole lot more than that."  </P> <P> But what?  </P> <P> This year Congress is taking a stab at an answer. The House and Senate both  approved programs for nationwide organic farming standards as part of the 1990  farm bill.  </P> <P> The conference committee that will resolve differences between the two bills is  waiting for approval of the budget deal so it knows how much money has to be  cut from farm-support programs, but the organic provisions are expected to  survive.  </P> <P> "Organically produced food defies simple definition," the Senate Agriculture  Committee said when it adopted its version. So a complicated definition was  offered.  </P> <P> "Organic food is food produced using sustainable production methods that rely  primarily on natural materials," the committee began. There are exceptions --  some synthetic chemicals traditionally accepted in organic farming, and a few  natural substances so toxic they are banned.  </P> <P> Those exceptions are to be spelled out in a list drawn up by a National Organic  Standards Board, to be made up of organic farmers, wholesalers and retailers,  consumer representatives and environmentalists.  </P> <P> Rules for raising organic meat and poultry are even more confusing than for  vegetables. It's left to the standards board to figure out what livestock  medications, vaccines and parasiticides are to be legal for organic farmers.  </P> <P> Within two years, shoppers should be seeing U.S. government-certified organic  chickens, tomatoes and bell peppers in the stores.  </P> <P> The legislation allows for state and private organizations to do the inspection  and certification, so long as they follow the national standards. States also  would be permitted to enact stricter standards, if they wished, but could not  block imports of nationally certified organic food from other states.  </P> <P> The organic-farming provisions were backed vigorously by lobbyists from  environmental groups, who say overuse of chemical pesticides, fungicides and  fertilizers is polluting streams and endangering farm workers.  </P> <P> Chemical manufacturers reject any suggestion their products are unsafe, but  approve the idea of nationwide standards for organic agriculture, said  Christopher Klose, spokesman for the National Agricultural Chemicals Assn.  </P> <P> The small but growing organic farm industry also supported the plan for  nationwide standards and labeling.  </P> <P> "For both the consumer and the grower, there are going to be multiple benefits.  It makes marketing much easier," said Marty Rice, co-director of the Maryland  Organic Food and Farming Assn., which was founded last year.  </P> <P> Dale Johnson, driving boxes of organic kale in from his fields in a white  pickup, said he hoped the government-approved organic labels will boost the  market for organic foods.  </P> <P> "People say they want it and are willing to pay more for it, but that hasn't  translated into a bigger market on the East Coast," he said.  </P> <P> Supermarkets, however, report falling interest in organic foods.  </P> <P> "A lot of consumers will buy it one time for the novelty, but the repeat sales  don't seem to be there," said Nancy Yanish, director of agricultural relations  for the Food Marking Institute in Washington. "If consumers want it,  supermarkets will be glad to sell it."  </P> <P> Two major grocery chains in the Washington area, Giant and Safeway, once had  organic produce sections in some of their stores. Both dropped the idea in the  last year after disappointing sales.  </P> <P> The trade weekly Supermarket News reported similar experiences nationwide,  asking in an article last May, "Is organic produce withering on the vine?"  </P> <P> Organic farm organizations, however, report their production up by as much as  40% over last year. Stores specializing in natural and organic foods seem to be  doing fairly well, even if organic sales in regular supermarkets are slumping.  </P> <P> "In the last five years we've gone from a fad to a clear market niche," said  Bob Scowcroft, executive director of the California Certified Organic Farmers.  "The establishment of national standards will allow our growers to compete  fairly in all 50 states."  </P></p>

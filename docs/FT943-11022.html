			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small fry audit to go The rules exempting small companies from audits will come into effect on August 11 now that regulations have been laid before Parliament. Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, described the move as a 'major step in the government's drive to free business from unnecessary burdens'. The new rules abolish the need for an audit for all companies with annual sales below Pounds 90,000. Companies with sales between this figure and Pounds 350,000 will be able to file a simpler so-called 'compilation report'. Qualifying companies whose directors have yet to approve accounts on that date will be able to take advantage of the new rules.</p>

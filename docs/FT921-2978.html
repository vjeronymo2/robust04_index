			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hachette and Rizzoli to end collaboration deal TWO of the most powerful players in European publishing, Hachette of France and Rizzoli of Italy, are to end their five-year-old collaborative agreement. Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine and was recently hit by the collapse of La Cinq, the French television station that it controlled, announced several months ago it was considering ending its involvement with Rizzoli. The Italian group, which publishes Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's leading newspapers, has decided to end the involvement, too. This will involve a share swap - Hachette owns 8.1 per cent of Rizzoli which, in turn, holds 9.2 per cent of the French company's press subsidiary - and some form of cash payment to Hachette. The move comes as Hachette, still scarred by the La Cinq debacle, is embroiled in an elaborate plan to merge with Matra, the French electronics and transport group, also owned and managed by the Lagardere family. Both companies are chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere who announced the proposed merger earlier this year. Hachette and Rizzoli may also review their joint holdings in several individual titles.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290, for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional funding for market development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is $1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860 for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000 will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 12526, March 17, 1994) and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994 fiscal year for the program began January 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 932 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Olives, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 932 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 932_OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Shanghai Hitachi Household Appliances Co., which will be  capitalized at 2.1 billion yen, will start production in April.    The Hitachi group will hold 60 percent of equity shares and  local firms the remainder.    The new firm plans to manufacture 80,000 air conditioners in  the initial business year. Annual production capacity will be  expanded to 250,000 units in the 1995 business year and 300,000  in 1996, Hitachi officials said.    Currently, only 2 to 5 percent of urban households own air  conditioners. But the market has been increasing roughly 13  percent each year.    Japanese electric home appliance companies like Sharp Corp.,  Sanyo Electric Co. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. have  already started up in China.</p>

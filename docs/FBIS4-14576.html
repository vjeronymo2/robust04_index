			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Popov report under the "Visits" rubric: "Is the </F> Russian Market Economy Necessary for U.S. Security?"]    [Text] The U.S. business delegation which arrived in  Moscow on Monday is surely the most high-powered ever to come  here. It is headed by Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown and  consists of leading figures from the largest U.S. corporations  and concerns, the export-import bank, and other associations and  institutions. The purpose of the trip is to carry out an  on-the-spot study of Russia's economic position and determine  potential for the further development of economic ties between  the two countries.    The U.S. visitors confirmed this intention during a round  table meeting of representatives of Russia and the United States  held at the Slavyanskaya hotel yesterday. The significance that  the Russian side attaches to the visit is shown by its  representatives at the meeting: Aleksandr Shokhin, Oleg  Soskovets, Oleg Davydov, Yuriy Shafranik, Sergey Dubinin, and  Yuriy Petrov.    President Clinton, who announced the mission in Moscow back  in January, bade the delegation farewell by saying that the  Russian market economy is vitally necessary to the economic  security of the United States and the whole world. In his  opening address at the meeting, R. Brown stressed that the U.S.  side intends to overcome all the barriers standing in the way of  the development of Russo-U.S. trade and private enterprise.  U.S. entrepreneurs, he said, prepared for this mission with  great enthusiasm and were extremely keen to visit Russia. They  represent the broadest U.S. business circles -- a fact which  suggests that we have great potential for expanding mutual  relations in commerce and trade, investments, and so forth. At  the same time he expressed the hope that the Russian state will  take appropriate steps to ensure a basis conducive to the entry  of foreign investments.    Perhaps this is the ultimate task of the visit by such a  high-powered delegation. That was the main theme in the U.S.  representatives' comments during the discussion of the items on  the agenda which has now begun: the economic reform, trade, and  foreign investments.</p>

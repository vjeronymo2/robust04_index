			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press office of the Russian Navy has denied a  report in a Japanese newspaper [TOKYO SHIMBUN on 16 January].  The report says that the Pacific Fleet has sold to North Korea  four submarines which, after repair, will join the DPRK naval  forces. The press office of the Russian Navy said that a  contract had indeed been signed for the sale of 12 obsolete  diesel submarines with a Japanese firm. However, at present  these submarines are in a condition which rules out their being  used for combat purposes. Moreover, Russian experts will be  monitoring the complete dismantling of the submarines.</p>

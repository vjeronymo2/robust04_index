			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Database boost for exporters - In A Nutshell The clamour surrounding 1992 and the opening of the single European market has died down, but export initiatives are being launched by a growing number of business support organisations. The East London Small Business Centre*, an enterprise agency, has established an export service for businesses in Tower Hamlets, following the success of eight local firms at a menswear fashion fair in Paris. The centre will create a database of products that could be exported by local firms, many in the clothing industry. *76 Wentworth Street, London E1 7SE. Tel. 071 377 8821.</p>

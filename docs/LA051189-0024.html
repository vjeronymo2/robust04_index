			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM?  </P> <P> I have just finished reading "Alcohol on Trial" (by Joni Blackman, May 4). A  more appropriate title would have been "Alcoholic on Trial." I have never in my  life felt such anger toward a person I've never met. The Thorps claim that they  never heard that alcohol could harm an unborn child. Candy Thorp has already  had two children. How did she think those unborn infants got their food supply?  Did she ever go to a doctor? A competent obstetrician will always tell an  expectant woman what she should and should not eat or drink.  </P> <P> If she herself got stinking drunk on a half of a fifth of liquor, wouldn't  common sense tell her what that much liquor would do to an unborn baby? Or her  husband -- 66 years old and not once in all those years had he heard that  alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can hurt an unborn child? I find it  impossible to believe that these two people were ignorant of that fact.  </P> <P> It is obvious that they are suing the James B. Beam Distillery because they do  not want to own responsibility for what they did to their own son.  </P> <P> A person is responsible for her own behavior, drunk or not. She should be the  one on trial and I pray that the courts have the good sense to take that poor  little boy away from them for good. They have done enough damage to him.  </P> <P> JoANN JACKSON, Culver City  </P></p>

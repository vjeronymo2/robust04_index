Chargazia confirmed that an investigation is underway in the  Zugdidi district and outlying areas. The investigation is being  directed by the republic's Deputy Procurator-General Anzor  Baluashvili.    Deputy Chairman of the Provisional Committee for Emergencies  in Western Georgia Vakhtang Kvaratskhelia told ITAR-TASS that  the investigative committee left Zugdidi today for the  neighboring Tsalendzhikhi district, where it will visit two  villages, Nakipu and Dzhagira. It was in this district that the  rumor started of Gamsakhurdia's death and burial in one of the  above-mentioned villages.    Kvaratskheliya himself proposes that "Zviad Gamsakhurdia's  death did not occur in one of the districts of western Georgia,  but beyond the republic's borders".</p>

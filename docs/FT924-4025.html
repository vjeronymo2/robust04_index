			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Industrialist appointed gamekeeper: Robert Rice meets the next head of the monopolies commission MR Graeme Odgers, chief executive of Alfred McAlpine, the contractor, is to be the next chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. He will take over in April from Sir Sydney Lipworth who has been chairman since the beginning of 1988. Mr Odgers, 58, will be the first non-lawyer to head the commission. His appointment was seen yesterday as a mark of the determination of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to bring a stronger industrial perspective to bear on competition issues. 'The secretary of state was looking for someone with a strong industrial and commercial background with a perspective closer to his views on competition,' Mr Odgers commented yesterday. As well as taking a cut in salary from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 87,620, Mr Odgers will have to give up his directorships of Dalgety, the food group, and National &amp; Provincial Building Society. He will become a part-time member of the commission on January 4 and take up his four-year, full-time appointment on April 19. Mr Odgers brings a variety of experience to the job having worked in government, the private sector and, significantly, in a privatised industry. He began his career as a management and financial consultant before moving in 1974 to the DTI as an industrial adviser. After a period as head of the DTI's industrial development unit, he joined GEC as an associate director before moving on to become group managing director of Tarmac in 1983. After appointment as a part-time director of British Telecommunications in 1984 he became deputy chairman and chief financial officer in 1986 and group managing director a year later. He moved to Alfred McAlpine in May 1990. He thus has experience of running a monopoly at BT and considerable knowledge of construction - a sector repeatedly under scrutiny by the competition authorities in the 1980s. 'It's vital that the MMC handles all cases on an even-handed basis, without bias, taking all relevant factors into account. Having said that how an individual investigation is handled will clearly be affected by the approach taken by the panel assigned to it.' Mr Odgers said he believed very strongly that the economy thrived best in a private-sector environment where rigorous competition applied. Since privatisation, BT had 'literally been transformed', he said. There was a significant element of monopoly in all the privatised industries at the moment, he said, hence the need for regulation. But as competition came into those industries, the need for regulation would diminish. 'Competition is vital, otherwise there is a natural tendency to abuse a dominant position,' he said. 'But, equally you have to be careful not to break down the industry into too small units so it can't compete internationally. So I will take a pragmatic view of the effects of competition both in domestic markets and internationally'. Mr Odgers is credited with having turned McAlpine round in the past two years by pursuing a 'bottom-up, high wire' strategy under which high quality standards are agreed between the centre of a group and its individual operations.</p>

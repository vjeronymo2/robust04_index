The following is related footage:    [Begin recording] [Pak Yong-su] There is an old-saying that  fire should be controlled by fire. We do not want war but will  never shun your side's insisting on a war. We are also ready to  react [taehang]. However, Mr. Song, your side has to deeply  consider the dear price of the war. Seoul is not far from here.  If a war breaks out, it will be a sea of fire. Mr. Song, it  will probably be difficult for you to survive.    [Song Yong-tae] What are you talking about?    [Pak] Wait, therefore...    [Song] Then, do you think we will just sit back?    [Pak] Regarding this, you have to deeply consider things.    [Song] Are you declaring a war?    [Pak] I am telling you that your side declared a war. Are  you listening? Did you take a nap?    [Song] What? Respond to war with war?    [Pak] That's right. Clearly.    [Song] Why do you talk about war at the place of talks?    [Pak] Because your side declared a war. [end recording]</p>

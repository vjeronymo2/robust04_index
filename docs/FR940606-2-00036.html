			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II. The Proposed Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Refund Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 10 Notice to the crude oil subpart V proceeding that is the subject of the present determination. As noted above, $870,000 of an alleged crude oil violation is covered by this proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $174,000, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined products.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  14 DOE &para; 85,475 (1986) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mountain Fuel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, a covered product is any product that was either covered by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760, or if the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Great Salt Lake Minerals &amp; Chem. Corp., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  23 DOE &para; 88,118, at 88,305 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price controls.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15 DOE &para; 85,495, at 88,893&hyph;96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., Berry Holding Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  16 DOE &para; 85,405, at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., New York Petroleum, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  18 DOE at 88,701&hyph;03.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report by the Office of Hearings and Appeals to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, reprinted in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para; 90,507 (1986). Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds under subpart V.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mid-America Dairyman, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Herrington, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp.

Any party that has previously submitted a refund application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another application. That previously filed application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 F.R. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed within this deadline at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants that filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.g., Seneca Oil Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  21 DOE &para; 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.

The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It Is Therefore Ordered That: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Dane Energy Company pursuant to the Consent Order executed on April 8, 1993 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13693 Filed 6&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

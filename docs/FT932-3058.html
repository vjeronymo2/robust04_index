			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / People: Kleinwort's wolf man turns on L America Old Etonian Roger Palmer, whose private wolf pack has often had more publicity than his share tips, has hung up his hat after five years as Kleinwort Benson's chief investment strategist. Palmer, 46, a former partner of Grieveson Grant before it was taken over by KB, has been picked to head his firm's move into the market for emerging Latin American securities. Whilst almost all of the major North American brokers are active in this market, it is a relatively new departure for a London broker. However, Palmer says that it takes as long to fly to Buenos Aires from New York as it does from London, and KB is keen to capitalise on its corporate finance connections in the region. It is one of the co-lead managers of the partial privatisation of YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company. Albert Edwards, 32, Palmer's deputy for the last four years, takes over as global investment strategist. After three years at the Bank of England, he moved to Bank of America's Investment Management arm, before joining KB in 1988. Palmer is the latest global investment strategist to switch jobs. Lisa Hosking, a member of Warburg's number-one-rated team, moved to CSFB a year ago, and James Capel's Alastair Ross Goobey left to head Postel.</p>

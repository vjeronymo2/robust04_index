			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] On Thursday in the Saeima there was much  discussion of the Latvian-Russian talks. At a news conference,  Egils Levits, Latvian Way faction deputy and justice minister,  described the situation:    [Begin Levits recording] I think it is a considerable  achievement for Latvian diplomacy that in the given  circumstances we have brought it about that by 31 August the  Russian Army will withdraw from Latvia; that Russia has stuck  firmly to this date in this way; that we are to be given back  the two new buildings at the Skrunda radar station, which they  have to vacate for us as soon as the treaty is signed; that we  have kept up this pressure, and I could remind you that our  southern neighbor, Lithuania, two years ago caved in and had to  pay for it with the zero option -- so that all military  personnel could stay in Lithuania. I do not see this as an  achievement for the government, because it is not a government  delegation, it is a Saeima delegation, and therefore, the  co-authors of this achievement are also the LNNK [Latvian  National Independence Movement] -- including Aleksandrs  Kirsteins, the leader of the LNNK faction, who took part in  these talks all the time. A co-author in this achievement is  Deputy Juris Sinka of the Fatherland and Freedom, who took part  in these talks all the time and in no sense deviated from the  common standpoint of the delegation, and also in relation to our  partner in the talks, Russia, subscribed to the common position,  and therefore I do not ascribe this achievement only to the  government, the Latvian Way, or the Peasants' Union, but I also  congratulate the LNNK and the Fatherland and Freedom. [end  recording]    [Announcer] In his turn, Aleksandrs Kirsteins, the head of  the LNNK faction, emphasized at a news conference that the  Russian Army is being withdrawn from Latvia not because of  agreements on paper but thanks to a whole complex of regulations  and agreements with the United States, the G7, the European  Union countries, the United Nations, and the CSCE. As Kirsteins  said, as long ago as 1992, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev announced that at the end of 1994 the troops will be  withdrawn from the Baltic countries if the issue of some  strategic bases was resolved.</p>

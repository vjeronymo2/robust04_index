			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Charodeyev report: "Strict Visa Regulations No </F> Obstacle to Chinese Criminals"]    [Text] The first Russian-Chinese consultations on consular  questions in Beijing highly rated the joint actions of the two  countries' law enforcement organs: It has become safe again to  travel on the Beijing-Moscow train. IZVESTIYA was informed of  this by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the Foreign Ministry  Information and Press Department.    According to Chinese special services data, over 70  gangsters  have been arrested. At least 140 violations of the law have  been detected, including fights, robberies, rape, and  hostage-taking on trains, as well as criminal offenses in Moscow.    The Chinese criminals decided to head for Russia and Hungary  posing as businessmen and students. But few reached Budapest,  they settled mainly in Siberia and the Far East.    The criminals' calculations proved correct. Because the  Chinese victimized "their own," they did not attract the Russian  militia's attention for a long time. Finally, after receiving  the signal from China, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs  sent a snatch squad onto the Beijing-Moscow train. The first  four bandits were seized first and the militia arrested the  others later.    Karasin reported that Moscow had spoken up for the Russian  citizens detained in the PRC as "hostages." Russia's claims to  the former USSR's property in 11 Chinese cities were also  discussed.    An entry and exit visa procedure was introduced in January  for Russians and Chinese holding general civilian foreign  passports. But in recent months variant interpretations by the  sides have emerged regarding the range of people who are also  entitled to receive free multiple visas for official trips. It  has been agreed to settle this question as well.</p>

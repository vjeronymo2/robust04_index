			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Cover for directors granted relief - Insurance Insurance bought by companies to protect directors and employees against the cost of legal actions arising in the course of their work will no longer be taxed as a benefit in kind, the Inland Revenue announced yesterday. The proposals, which are expected to come into effect from April at an annual cost of about Pounds 40m, are likely to be welcomed by many companies. The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers had lobbied for tax relief on such directors' and officers' liability and professional indemnity insurance policies. The association argued these policies were a necessary business expense and, as litigation against company directors becomes more common, were increasingly important. The proposals would remove the charge to tax on employees when employers pay for employees' liability insurance or meet work-related uninsured liabilities. They would also give relief for employees' expenditure on liability insurance and work-related uninsured liabilities. Uninsured liabilities will only be allowed relief when they could have been insured against.</p>

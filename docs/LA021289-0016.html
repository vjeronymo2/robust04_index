			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HEAVEN CAN'T WAIT  </P> <P> NBC Entertainment prez Brandon Tartikoff turned the promotion down, so the  network's daytime programming veep, Brian Frons, took it: Frons will play God  on an episode of "Santa Barbara" to air Feb. 21.  </P> <P> The scenario: Cowboy Sonny Sprocket (played by Lane Davies) is about to marry  opportunist Gina Timmons (Robin Mattson) when he's gunned down by a hit man  (Abe Vigoda). Sprocket has an out-of-body experience, lands in heaven and runs  into, among others, the Almighty Himself.  </P> <P> The TV monitors there bear GBC (God's Broadcasting Co.) logos with peacocks and  halos; there are even copies of Celestial Variety laying around.  </P> <P> Head writer Chuck Pratt said Tartikoff was the first choice of the producers  ("God (should) be a network executive and heaven would be a system of owned and  operated clouds"). Tartikoff reportedly had scheduling problems -- his office  said he had no comment -- and Frons, 32, got the nod.  </P> <P> He'll get scale -- $500 -- for his day's work. Sue Facter  </P></p>

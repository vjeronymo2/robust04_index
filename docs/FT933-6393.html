			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: BASF dives 51% in second quarter PROFITS at BASF, the German chemicals group, fell by 51 per cent in the second quarter of this year to DM245m (Dollars 142.4m). This matched the 50 per cent fall in the first quarter. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman, said the third quarter should not show any further fall from the year before. However, he noted that last year's third quarter had been 'very unsatisfactory'. The fall in profits came on a 6 per cent drop in sales to DM10.39m. Mr Strube said business was still characterised by 'low demand combined with a surplus of supply, resulting in unrelenting pressure on prices'. In the first half of the year, he said, BASF had been continuously in loss at the operating level in plastics and fibres, and also in magnetic tapes. Mr Strube said 'the principal cause of the drop in sales was the soft demand in Germany and other European countries'. By contrast, some businesses in North and South America had done better than last year. The magnetic tape business remained difficult, he said. Prices in the first half of the year were 10 per cent lower than last year, and the company had shut down production at sites in the US, France and Germany. 'We expect BASF Magnetics to make a loss again in 1993, but we are aiming to break even in 1994', he said. In pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, he said, business has suffered significantly from state intervention. 'I need only mention the German Health Care Reform Act and the EC agricultural policy reforms,' he said. The group's drug sales in Germany were down 13 per cent in the half-year, as the result of lower prices in former East Germany and lower volume in West Germany. Mr Strube said that by the end of 1993, BASF would have shed nearly 20,000 jobs since 1989, partly through divesting businesses. In 1994, he said, the group planned to shed more than 4,000 jobs, the majority in Germany. 'An increase in personnel costs in Germany is not acceptable in the next few years, as the revaluation of the D-Mark has further accentuated the existing cost disadvantages in international competition,' he declared. In the first half, group sales were down 7 per cent from DM23.6bn to DM22.0bn. Group profit before tax was DM483m, compared with DM972m. Sales of plastics and fibres were down 12 per cent at DM4.83bn, in dyestuffs down 5 per cent at DM3.75bn and in chemicals 5 per cent at DM2.73bn. Sales in agricultural products were down 13 per cent at DM2.47bn, and in oil and gas were up 4 per cent at DM2.31bn. European sales were down 11 per cent at DM13.35bn. Sales in North America were up 3 per cent at DM4.29bn. Sales in Asia, Australia and Africa were down 6 per cent at DM2.03bn, and in Latin America up 9 per cent at DM1.17bn.</p>

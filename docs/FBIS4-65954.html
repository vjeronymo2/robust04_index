			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Government's Rating Is Rising -- </F> But Still Low"]    [Text] The general voter assessment of the four-party  government under leadership of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is still  very reserved. However, the fall in the government's rating has  been replaced by a rise.    Since 1946 the Gallup Institute has conducted a running  popularity rating of the government at regular intervals to  assess electorate opinion of the cabinet sitting at that time.  The latest poll in this long series has just been completed. In  the period from 26 April through 2 May, Gallup conducted  telephone interviews with a representative sample of voters,  comprising 1,002 individuals over age 18.    Gallup asked the following question: Do you think the  government has done "well," "rather well," or "not well" during  the period it has existed?    Each response was calculated into a score, with a reply of  "well" assigned the value + 2, the reply "rather well" given  + 1, and "not well" a value of - 2. This latest survey, which  was conducted at the end of April and the beginning of May,  accordingly resulted in a score of - 10. This is a slight  improvement in relation to the previous survey, which was done  in December 1993. Then the government's rating was - 27.    In the small table below are seen the poll results for the  current four-party government. For purposes of comparison, also  included are the results from the surveys Gallup conducted on  the last nonsocialist government, the Conservative-Liberal  coalition.    The large table [not reproduced here] shows the scores since  Hilmar Baunsgaard's Radical Liberal-Liberal-Conservative  government at the end of the sixties. As seen from the figures,  the dramatic fall in the government's rating has stopped for  this time. The question is whether this result is a first  indication of that reward that the government is expecting from  the voters in the wake of the economic upturn or whether it is  more a matter of the four-party coalition's rating having become  mired in the negative part of the scale.

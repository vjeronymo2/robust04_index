			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song received a letter from the participants in  the international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and  friendship held in New Delhi.    The letter dated April 10 says:    "The seminar stressed that the idea of independence, peace  and friendship elucidated by the chuche idea is a universal idea  embodying the intrinsic nature of independent people and the  common desire of the people in our time to live a happy life,  loving and helping each other in a free and peaceful world  without domination and subjugation, aggression and war.    "The participants in the seminar called for strengthening  the  unity of the people and actively mobilizing them in the building  of a new society on the principle of the chuche idea that to  strengthen the driving force of the revolution and enhance its  role is a fundamental guarantee for the building of an  independent new society."    The letter says they are greatly encouraged by the proud  looks and indomitable spirit of the Korean people who are firmly  defending the man-centred socialism with the might of  singlehearted unity under the wise guidance of President Kim  Il-song, under the difficult conditions created by the  intensified anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaign of the  imperialists and reactionaries.    It stresses that they, together with the progressive people  of the world advocating independence, express firm solidarity  with the Korean people in the struggle to defend the dignity of  the nation and the gains of socialism and extend full support to  the Korean people in the noble cause of reunifying the country  independently and peacefully on the basis of the ten-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the country put forward by President Kim  Il-song.    The letter sincerely wishes President Kim Il-song good  health  and a long life.</p>

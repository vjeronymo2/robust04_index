			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Paying the bill for German unity FT-SE Index: 2,498.2 (+26.9) The G7 wrangle has been billed as a battle between German monetary rectitude and US profligacy - with virtue winning on points. Judging by the arguments with which the fiveGerman economic institutes yesterday attacked the case for higher interest rates, German rectitude is not what it used to be. High inflation by itself would help slow economic growth, they said, and a further tightening of monetary policy was therefore unnecessary. When economists with feebler currencies put such arguments, the German economic establishment met them with a horse-laugh. No more. With wage settlements running at 6 to 7 per cent, and likely year-end inflation around 5 per cent, the historic German trade-off between rising prices andeconomic growth seems to have shifted. Germany's original partners in the narrow band of the ERM mostly have relative inflation targets, not absolute ones. The Netherlands perhaps apart, they are as happy at 4 1/2 per cent inflation as at 3 per cent, so long as Germany is at 5. The German voter's preference for paying the unity bill in higher prices rather than higher taxes gives the ERM a dragging anchor at the expense of higher European inflation and, in time, lower bond prices. Part of this is doubtless already in the price; the next movein German bond yields could even be downwards. But if Germany really is developing a higher tolerance for inflation, such a drop might not last. UK investors wondering if convergence with German inflation levels means a long term shift into bonds and out of equities still have much to ponder.</p>

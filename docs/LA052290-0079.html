			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIBBS IS EXPECTED TO BE ASKED TO RESIGN  </P> <P> Hal Cribbs, executive secretary of the California Fish and Game Commission,  said Monday that he will announce today whether he will resign or force the  commission to fire him.  </P> <P> Either way, it appears doubtful that Cribbs, 53, executive secretary since  1979, will survive on the commission -- as he did when it moved to oust him in  1987 for "meddling in legislative affairs," according to commissioner Albert  Taucher of Long Beach.  </P> <P> The five commissioners, who are appointed to staggered six-year terms by the  governor, have been criticized since the release in January of the Little  Hoover Commission's report on the operation of the commission and the  Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> After last Friday's monthly meeting at San Luis Obispo, Commission President  Bob Bryant of Yuba City and commissioner Everett McCracken of Carmichael  unofficially asked Cribbs for his resignation.  </P> <P> "All they told me was . . . the intent was to improve relationships with the  Department (of Fish and Game) and the Legislature," Cribbs said.  </P> <P> If he refuses to resign, the commission would have to call a special, public  meeting to review his performance before firing him.  </P> <P> Taucher was president in 1987 when the commission judged that Cribbs "was  writing some bills and feeding information to certain legislators that was  (privileged) information."  </P> <P> However, several sportsmen's organizations came to Cribbs' defense, and the  commission backed down. Taucher said Cribbs agreed to restrict his activities  to commission business.  </P> <P> "About a year ago, it became evident that he was still meddling in legislative  affairs," Taucher said. "And when the Little Hoover Commission came out with  what they did, and (with) the kinds of things the Legislature has been doing to  us, it became apparent that Cribbs had to go."  </P> <P> McCracken said pending legislation would sharply reduce the commission's  influence. When he asked certain legislators about it, he said he was told:  "You're not the problem. The problem is Mr. Cribbs."  </P> <P> Cribbs said: "Since 1987 . . . everything that I have provided across the  street (at the State Capitol) or been involved with across the street has been  with the knowledge of at least Mr. Taucher and the president of the  commission."  </P></p>

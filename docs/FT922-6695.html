			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Argentina approves gas privatisation ARGENTINA'S congress has approved controversial legislation allowing privatisation of the state-owned natural gas monopoly. The government may now go ahead with its stalled plans to break up the company, Gas del Estado, and sell its transport and distribution networks to private investors in an operation expected to raise about Dollars 2.7bn. The Gas del Estado (GDE) sale will be one of Argentina's largest privatisations, following the sale in 1990 and 1991 of its telephone network and airline. The government intends to sell off almost all federally-owned companies by the end of 1992. YPF, the national oil company, is being prepared for privatisation in 1993. The legislation was held up for months by provincial politicians representing gas producing regions. Government officials say they expect to announce a call to tender by September and award individual business units to investors by December, three months later than planned. The legislation splits GDE's trunk pipelines into two companies covering the north and south of the country.</p>

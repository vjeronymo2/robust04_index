			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Major fights split on Europe: Government hopes for treaty ratification may rest on 'subsidiarity' deal MR JOHN MAJOR faced renewed divisions within his cabinet over European integration yesterday amid signs that the government's hopes for ratification of the Maastricht treaty now rest on an EC-wide agreement to devolve more authority from Brussels. As the government sought vainly to re-establish a semblance of unity around its European policy, ministers said that a declaration underwriting the principle of 'subsidiarity' could be signed at the Edinburgh summit in December. The declaration, which would be attached to the Maastricht agreement, would give substance to the brief reference in the treaty on the need to decentralise decision-making. Mr Major, who will press the idea in separate meetings on Wednesday with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, and Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, hopes the commitment will reassure enough Tory waverers to allow him to press ahead with ratification. The ministers said that the need to persuade Denmark to reverse its No vote to Maastricht and the mood of public opinion throughout the Community should persuade EC leaders at next month's emergency summit in Birmingham to give the British presidency a mandate to draft such a declaration. But the scale of Mr Major's task in filling the policy vacuum left by sterling's enforced departure from the exchange rate mechanism was underlined by the discordant notes sounded again yesterday by ministers and senior Tory MPs. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, appeared to accept that Britain's reluctance to set a time-frame for sterling's return to the ERM could prompt an inner-core of countries based around Germany and France to establish a fast-track to monetary union. But, speaking on ITV's Walden programme, Mr Howard insisted that 'British interests' would be paramount in deciding the government's stance. He added: 'If others choose to go at a different pace and choose to put in place arrangements which are not suitable to us . . . we must take our decisions on the basis of what is best for the British people.' Those comments, along with a statement that sterling's re-entry to the ERM would be considered only after the mechanism had been reformed, jarred with enthusiastically pro-European statements by two other ministers. Mr John Gummer, the agriculture secretary, told BBC Radio: 'There is no future for Britain in some sideline. We are in the centre of Europe and we intend to stay there.' Disputing Mr Howard's comment that the suspension of ERM membership offered opportunities for Britain, Mr Gummer said that the real issue was whether the government wanted to be buffeted by the effect of strong economies and currencies with no say in the decisions shaping events. That view was echoed by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe, who said that failure to ratify Maastricht would be a 'humiliation' for Britain. But Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative backbench MPs, was among a succession of senior Tories ready to cast doubt on support for both Maastricht and the ERM. With other opinion polls showing the strength of feeling against European integration, there were also calls from a number of MPs for the government to 'get a grip' on its strategy.

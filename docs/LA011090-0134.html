			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SRI LANKA PORT HUMS AGAIN -- FOR HOW LONG?;  </P> <P> SHIPPING: COLOMBO WAS CRIPPLED FROM JUNE TO AUGUST AS WORKERS OBEYED A STRIKE  CALL BY THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION FRONT. THE REGIME SEES BUSINESS AS USUAL IN  1990.  </P> <P> Colombo Port, traditionally one of the busiest in South Asia, is again buzzing  with activity after having been paralyzed this summer by rebel-inspired  strikes.  </P> <P> Officials are pressing ahead with ambitious expansion plans and cutting the  fees they charge shippers to revitalize the port and support Sri Lanka's  war-ravaged economy.  </P> <P> But shipping analysts worry that the government's efforts may not be enough to  reassure merchants, who prefer to do business in calmer places.  </P> <P> The port was crippled from June to August, as workers obeyed a strike call by  the People's Liberation Front. In that period, many foreign ships bypassed  Colombo, and export shipments vital to Sri Lanka's economy were delayed.  </P> <P> But the strikes petered out by September, and port work has returned to normal,  said Vas Gunawardene, chairman of the Ports Authority.  </P> <P> He said two new shipping lines plying through Colombo, coupled with Sri Lanka's  deregulation of export shipments, should boost the port's business.  </P> <P> Gunawardene also said he had traveled overseas recently to reassure clients  that the port facilities are reliable. His job was made difficult by the  escalating political violence in Sri Lanka that has claimed the lives of  foreign business people as well as hundreds of Sri Lankans.  </P> <P> Aside from its conflicts with the People's Liberation Front, the government is  locked in a fierce struggle with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for  control of Tamil-dominated areas of the country.  </P> <P> "There were many apprehensions about the situation here," Gunawardene said.  "Shipping companies were worried about the continuity of stability. I was able  to allay their fears."  </P> <P> Gunawardene predicted Colombo's cargo handling would fall by 8,000 containers  this year, from the 1988 figure of 638,000. But he said volume would pick up in  1990.  </P> <P> "Business next year is expected to improve, and in the year 2000 we are aiming  for 1.4 million containers."  </P> <P> He added that a third container berth would be built in Colombo by 1992 to  increase capacity.  </P> <P> Tommy Ellawala, chairman of the private Sri Lanka Shippers Council, added that  the port's activities were expected to increase because the government  announced Dec. 1 that Sri Lankan exporters can use any shipping line.  </P> <P> Exporters had previously been compelled to give preference to the state-owned  Ceylon Shipping Corp., a policy criticized by foreign shipping lines.  </P> <P> Port officials said Contiship, which runs a world service through New Zealand  and Australia, began using Colombo's port last month. They said the Soviet  Union's Blacksea Shipping Co., which carries tea and rubber, would start  operating here this month.  </P> <P> Gunawardene also said various port charges were cut by 50% this month to  attract more ships.  </P> <P> However, shipping analysts said that the port remains vulnerable to rebel  strikes and that the government's forecasts of rising business may be too  optimistic.  </P> <P> Government officials said rebel activity has diminished since the leader of the  People's Liberation Front, Rohana Wijeweera, was killed here Nov. 13. But the  fighting continues.  </P> <P> One shipping expert, who declined to be identified, said: "For the moment, the  port is working OK. But if strikes occur once again, Colombo would have a more  difficult time retaining its image as an efficient and productive port."  </P> <P> Mahinda Ratnayake, general manager of Ceylon Shipping Lines, said the volume of  export cargo is unlikely to increase in the near future.  </P> <P> "More ships could come, but they will share the same cake," he said, adding  that export tonnage had been flat in the past few years.  </P> <P> Colombo's port was dealt a heavy blow when the American President Lines shifted  its trans-shipment center from Colombo to Fujirah in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "That was a large slice of the business: 80,000 containers a year," Gunawardene  said.  </P> <P> Ratnayake, whose Ceylon Shipping Lines is APL's local agent, said the APL  pulled out because of the labor unrest in Colombo Port and because Fujirah had  other cost advantages.  </P></p>

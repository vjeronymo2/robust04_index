On the black market, one must pay as much as 40,000 yuan  (about $4,600) for one. Moreover, "back door" channels must be  used to get this mobile phone as soon as possible.    But such hurdles aren't stopping a growing number of people  from planning to buy a mobile telephone, a symbol of affluence  and status.    According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of  Posts  and Telecommunications, by the end of last year China had  638,000 mobile telephone users, 2.7 times the number in 1992.    Sources in the ministry say that in 1993 alone, the number  of  mobile phone subscribers grew by 461,000.    The ministry, encouraged by spectacular expansion of the  whole postal and telecoms network, has revised its  previously-outlined development targets for mobile telephone  service.    According to the new targets, the number of mobile phone  users will rise to between 900,000 and 1 million by 1995,  instead of the previously projected 500,000. This figure will  jump to between 4.5 million and million by the end of the  century.    The explosive growth in mobile telephone services, spurred  by  the country's rapid economic growth, has created much excitement  among overseas manufacturers. They know that about 90 percent  of China's mobile phones and related equipment are imported.    The market is now dominated by products made by such  telecoms  giants as Motorola Inc of the United States, and NEC Corp and  Mitsubishi of Japan.    To meet this burgeoning demand the ministry is encouraging  local telecoms administrations to expand their mobile phone  networks.    In Beijing, the mobile telephone system is being expanded  markedly a process that should be completed in June.    An official with the Beijing Telecommunications  Administration said the plan is to accommodate an additional  60,000 subscribers and extend coverage to suburban counties. To  accomplish this, a mobile phone switching system will be  installed and 16 base stations will be built.    By the end of last year, Beijing had 31,563 mobile phone  users, compared with about 11,000 the year before.    Meanwhile, the ministry has also urged local authorities to  set up regional "roaming services" for mobile phone users.  "Roaming service" allows a mobile phone subscriber from one  region to use a cellular phone when travelling to other regions.    Some provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have  established such services in major cities and towns.    Zhejiang in East China is the only province to have a  complete mobile phone network. Its system serves over 60,000  users in all of its 74 counties and cities.    According to the People's Postal and Telecommunications  News,  by mid-February automatic roaming service will be available in  the Yangtze River Delta region.</p>

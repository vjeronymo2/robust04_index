			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MYSTICAL OBJECTS, SACRED PLACES' ON DISPLAY  </P> <P> Whether the world seems like too much to handle or not quite enough,  spirituality is one of the devices that allows us to adjust it to a tolerable  volume. Investing the unseen with palpable power and organizing consciousness  into a coherent, manageable system, the idea that the universe is governed by  forces greater than those possessed by man has been central to every major  civilization in history. Just how compelling an idea it is can be seen in the  fact that the sacred relics of various cultures -- Stonehenge, Easter Island,  the Mayan ruins at Palenque -- continue to resonate with a mystery and magic  that's made them a reference point in much contemporary art.  </P> <P> In "Mystical Objects, Sacred Places," an exhibition on view through Nov. 26 at  Security Pacific's Gallery at the Plaza, 11 American artists attempt to tap  into humankind's psychic past via modern artworks exploring ancient spiritual  systems. It's a moving idea for a show, and "Mystical Objects" takes on added  poignancy in its' struggle to be heard in the bustling lobby of a corporate  high rise. It's hard to imagine a setting less conducive to the kind of  reflection this work attempts to engender, but a valiant effort is made, and  some of the work is solid enough to transcend the setting.  </P> <P> It's not surprising that the strongest work in the show is also the most  simple. The central theme here is so rich and grand that to be ostentatiously  "creative" would be gilding the lily. Consequently, the straight photography by  Marilyn Bridges, Macduff Everton and Grey Crawford walks off with top honors.  </P> <P> New Jersey artist Bridges is a pilot-photographer who takes stunning aerial  shots of sites that have held people in thrall for centuries -- Greek temples,  the Pyramids at Giza, Stonehenge. She also includes a shot of the Manhatten  skyline's Chrysler Building, suggesting that all us networking maniacs are  living among the ruins of tomorrow. Everton shoots lusciously colored panoramic  landscapes illuminated with an eerie light that lends them a supernatural  quality, while Crawford's black and white images focus on holy sites and  hieroglyphs. A shot of a disturbing stone formation in England looks as though  it might've been the setting for the Peter Weir film "Picnic at Hanging Rock."  </P> <P> Richard Felix, Ian Green and Charles Pebworth explore the belief systems of the  Indian cultures of the American Southwest. Green's mixed media pieces,  artificially aged to resemble scavenged relics, read as sad memento mori to the  tragic history of the American Indian rather than the simple dignity of their  religious beliefs. Felix's mixed media valentines to the spirit of the  Southwest -- sometimes constructed in the manner of Japanese screens -- are too  tricky by half; his work feels busy and craftsy. Pebworth's small, impeccably  crafted totems made of metal and semi-precious stones are so beautiful they go  beyond being about religious fetishism -- they become the thing itself.  </P> <P> Patterned after the homages to imploding consciousness perfected by Joseph  Cornell, Janice Lowry makes glassed in wooden memory boxes jammed with the  collected ephemera of a lifetime -- antique toys, cut-outs, and souvenirs. Jo  Whalley photographs old santos figures positioned in the foreground of haunted  landscapes, and reminds us with these battered relics of Catholicism that  suffering is central to many spiritual traditions. The lurid landscapes of  George Green (they put one in mind of work by Green's fellow Texan John  Alexander) employ the bright colors and symbols associated with Mexican folk  art to create a malevolent view of nature; in Green's world of hysterical  anthropomorphism, the flora and fauna is strangling and over-ripe. Also on view  is work by Christopher Tanner who paints on animal bones, and photographs by  Laura Parker that involve fragments of ancient relics arranged on a backdrop of  sand.  </P> <P> All told, "Mystical Objects" does a good job of drawing our attention to the  feelings of pity, fear and awe that are central to many spiritual systems,  however, the emotion of ecstasy -- the big pay-off in many religions -- is in  surprisingly short supply here.  </P></p>

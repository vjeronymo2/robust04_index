			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 29 January, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], discussed  with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa the issue of how to  proceed with the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  in the future, in consideration of the Japan-U.S. summit talks  to be held on 11 February.    It is considered that regarding the macroeconomic policy as  well as individual priority sectors, "a well-balanced accord  will be indispensable" at the summit talks (as stated by a  senior MITI official). Hosokawa and Kumagai seem to have  confirmed the plan of working out a macroeconomic policy, about  which the United States has expressed strong concern, which in  turn may lead to overall success at the framework talks.    On the other hand, concerning individual sectors, Prime  Minister Hosokawa and MITI Minister Kumagai have once again  confirmed the stance of rejecting the U.S. demand for setting  numerical targets.</p>

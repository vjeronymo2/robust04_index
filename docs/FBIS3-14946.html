He described as "perfectly correct" his party's support to  last Wednesday's package. This included a resolution on  political and economic amnesty, amnesty in connection with the  adoption of the new constitution, a memorandum of concord and a  resolution to rescind the Duma resolution on setting up a  commission of inquiry into last October's uprising.    Shakhray said it was impossible to pass a legal judgment on  the October events in Moscow because this could be passed only  on criminal cases rather than "acts of civil war". He said the  winner was alone in a position to enforce his legal judgment  through government structures.    At the same time, he expressed regret that the uprising  leaders had been released so soon by the Prosecutor General  Office [PGO].    Shakhray said the State Duma must issue a statement saying  "no one is allowed" to take advantage of the amnesty to incite  people for renewed violence.    Shakhray said the faction's position had enlisted support  from PRUC's regional branches.    He said Yeltsin's representatives knew about a forthcoming  resolution and the balance of forces in parliament let alone  attended the session a day before the resolution was approved  [sentence as received]. Shakhray said this was an indication of  lack of coordination on the federal level between actions taken  by administration, government, parliamentary and PGO officials  with each side left to act on its own.    Shakhray expressed regret over Prosecutor General Aleksey  Kazannik's resignation. In his view, the PGO was not dragged  into politics under Kazannik but there is a threat that this may  happen following his departure.</p>

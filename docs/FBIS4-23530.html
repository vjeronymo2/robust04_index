			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Call for Housing Action -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English  considers "the housing challenge" in an editorial on page 12 of  its 8 June edition. "The surge in urban land invasions is a  head-on challenge to politicians to get down to the real work of  redressing the legacy of apartheid," the editorial begins. "It  is time for the rhetoric to get real and for specific  allocations of land to be added to the endless figures of  housing promises." Without such action, the editorial asserts,  homeless people will continue their land occupations. It must  be remembered, the paper argues, that the homeless are "first  and foremost victims of our racial past." The editorial  concludes by arguing that although the homeless "have an  obligation to give the new government a chance to live up to its  promises," it is nonetheless wrong "to victimise those whose  illegal presence is a fait accompli. Nothing constructive is  served by demolishing and confiscating flimsy shelters and  interfering with freedom of movement. And quite the wrong  message is sent to ordinary people on both sides of the  conflict."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Suggestion of "Serviced Squatter Sites" -- The editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 8 June also  considers the "crisis" caused by Johannesburg City Council's  decision to tear down shacks of illegal squatters. "The council  was wrong to tear down even makeshift homes in a spell of  freezing weather, and it deserves censure. Yet the reasons  behind its haste need to be examined." Noting that there are  "costly consequences" to the illegal occupation of land, the  editorial goes on to point out that if the squatters are  "allowed to stay, the orderly provision of housing may become  impossible." The editorial concludes by calling on Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging Premier Tokyo Sexwale and other  authorities to consider the possibility of "serviced squatter  sites" that, while not "proper housing," would still provide  squatters with "freehold title, running water, sewerage,  stormwater drains and tarred bus routes. People living there  can aspire to improving their accommodation, through their own  efforts or with the help of government's vast programme to  provide solid, permanent homes."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   "Jackboot Tactics" Condemned -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English, in an editorial on page 6 on 8 June, also criticizes  the destruction of squatter shacks in Johannesburg. "The local  authorities are normally in a difficult position when faced with  the sudden occupation of land. But what is unacceptable is  their insensitivity. Instead of breaking down shacks and  letting families with children sleep outside in the cold, they  should be looking for solutions....It certainly does not well  for the local authority to use jackboot tactics of demolition to  discourage illegal occupancy."</p>

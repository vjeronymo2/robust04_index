			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING STRATEGIES  </P> <P>  -- Keeping the basic layout. We were lucky to have a scheme that already  placed storage, cooking, eating and cleaning areas where we wanted them.  </P> <P> We knocked down no walls and moved no pipes or major wiring.  </P> <P>  -- No contractor's fees. We scouted out our own workmen, checked their  references and backed our own judgment on who'd do competent and reliable work.  For each task, we found at least three possible crews to allow for mismatches  in schedules.  </P> <P>  -- Buying materials ourselves, we obtained 'professional' discounts by having  our workmen phone in our orders. We used our own van for hauling, paying no  delivery fees. Most suppliers agreed to accept returns of unused merchandise,  so we placed our orders early to secure items that might become discontinued or  out of stock. (Sometimes we had to pay a small restocking fee.)  </P> <P>  -- Putting new veneer, doors and hardware on our existing cabinets. Hollow  core doors were also about a third cheaper than solid ones and less heavy.  </P> <P>  -- Replacing only appliances that couldn't be repaired. We kept our  dishwasher, cooktop and refrigerator. We also kept the existing mini-blinds and  two lighting fixtures. Evelyn Lager  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Blenheim upbeat on Pounds 50m BLENHEIM GROUP, the exhib-ition organiser, yesterday forecast an 'excellent' year to come after announcing slightly higher than expected profits. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 49.7m in the 16 months to December 31. The 12 months to August 31 1991 achieved Pounds 37.3m. The company decided not to adopt accounting standard FRS 3 because of a change in the financial year end. Turnover of Pounds 239.1m (Pounds 122.2m) included Pounds 13.5m from Batimat, the biannual French building supply exhibition held in November 1991. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said gross and operating profit margins fell slightly, partly because few large events were held in the last few months. The company was also affected by higher than expected inflation in Germany. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 11.7m covered losses on the disposal and closure of the Belgian and Swiss companies. About 90 per cent of profits come from outside the UK. Because the company uses year-end exchange rates, sterling's fall in value led to a Pounds 4m exchange gain. However, this was balanced by a large increase in debtors. Average exchange rates would be adopted from this year. Earnings were 36.9p (24.1p), while a final dividend of 3p makes a 12p (7.83p) total. COMMENT Not too much should be read into these figures, which are inconclusive because of the change in year end. But the company's optimistic statements, and the fact the shares are tightly held so can over-react, pushed the shares up 6p to 605p. The figures did contain some pointers. A Pounds 3.5m pre-tax profit from trade magazines and catalogues was promising. The episodes in Belgium and Switzerland were not, although shareholders will be relieved Blenheim realised its mistake quickly. For the coming year, comparisons will remain difficult because of the timing of biannual events. Analysts will want to see if Blenheim can maintain its margins and push through some price rises. With last year's currency gains salted away in case times get tougher, the company should meet forecasts of Pounds 47m this time. A rating of 18 times looks demanding for a company still to prove it can maintain momentum now it is maturing.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 5.2m purchase for Olives Property Olives Property is continuing its restructuring with a further acquisition and a rights issue. The company yesterday announced it had agreed to buy a portfolio of properties from Burford Holdings for Pounds 5.2m, of which Pounds 4.2m will be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The five retail warehouse and retail properties in the north west of England, which are all let, produce a total rental income of Pounds 471,650 a year, representing a net initial yield of 8.8 per cent. Total rental income, before the acquisition, was running at Pounds 1.86m a year, said Mr Tony Grant, Olive's chairman and joint chief executive. In May, the company completed a Pounds 10.3m rights issue with which it acquired Huby Estates, a property investment concern in the north of England, and Zincshire, a privately owned property investment company with properties in Swindon and west London. The latest buy will increase retail warehousing as a proportion of Olive's portfolio from 3 per cent to 14 per cent. Net portfolio worth after the acquisition will be Pounds 25m. Olives recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 224,404 on turnover of Pounds 753,558 for the six months to June 30. Net assets increased from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 15.5m, principally because of the rights issue. Meanwhile, Olives announced it had appointed Mr Geoffrey Lawson to its board as a non-executive director. Mr Lawson has extensive experience in the property sector.</p>

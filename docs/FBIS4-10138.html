			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April at the United Nations, Cuba reaffirmed  that there is no better way to promote, maintain, and  consolidate peace than by encouraging development and giving  such development stability worldwide. Abelardo Moreno, Cuban  representative on the special committee on UN peacekeeping  operations, warned that if that fundamental element was not  taken into account, with or without a Cold War, with or without  an East-West confrontation, conflicts would continue to  proliferate and become increasingly dangerous.    Moreno predicted: Then, the United Nations will continue to  be drawn into an upward-spiraling tendency to resort to weapons  and militarism that will erode its credibility and ruin the  philosophy that gave rise to the United Nations itself. He  reflected: Those who believed the end of the Cold War was the  universal cure-all for solving problems accumulated over  centuries forgot that erecting solid foundations for development  and promoting economic and social progress for all constitute  the very raison d'etre for the collective security system  provided for in the UN Charter.</p>

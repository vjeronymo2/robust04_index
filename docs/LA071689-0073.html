			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Sacramento disc jockey accused of making anti-gay jokes on the air has  apologized after being reprimanded by his bosses. Pat Garrett of radio station  KWOD offended many homosexuals last month when he complained that his  girlfriend had left him for a man named Bruce, who was probably "a limp-wristed  queer" or "faggot." Calling the remarks "verbal gay bashing," gay leaders  gathered 350 signatures on a petition calling for a boycott of the station and  its advertisers. The station's management agreed to publish an apology in the  gay media and to establish a policy prohibiting anti-gay remarks on the air.  </P></p>

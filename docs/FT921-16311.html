			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A costly bonus share dividend MY WIFE has recently submitted a claim for repayment of tax paid in the year to April 5 1991. Her income is derived from dividends and interest; the largest item is dividends on BP ordinary shares which she takes as shares rather than cash. The tax inspector has ruled that dividends taken in this form do not qualify for tax repayment, although the gross amount of the dividend has been used in computing my wife's income, consequently taking her above the allowance limit. Can you advise me if the inspector is correct? Yes, by virtue of Section 249(4)(b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. It is a pity that your wife did not ask about the tax consequences before she decided to elect to take her BP dividends in the form of bonus shares. The law on this point has remained unchanged since 1975 (the 1988 Act was a consolidation of the existing legislation). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

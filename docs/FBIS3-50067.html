			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 21 January (TANJUG) -- After talks with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today, Zoran Djindjic, the  main candidate of the Democratic Party (DS) and the president of  the DS executive board, said that they had talked about a  government of national unity. After nearly an hour of talks  with the Serbian president, Djindjic said that no party could at  this moment take the responsibility for forming the government,  and particularly not, as he stressed, the party that had so far  formed all Serbian governments. He said that they did not  discuss the post of the prime minister, but added that it had  been stressed during the talks that he had to be "a man of  consensus."    The DS believes that the new government's program has to be  different from all those we have had so far, Djindjic said.  According to him, the Serbian president said that the future  government's composition will not be determined by party  allegiance.    Commenting on his impressions of the talks with the Serbian  president, Djindjic emphasized that the government would be some  kind of a government of national unity, which should have an  all-party support and a nonpartisan program.    The DS stance is that the president of the new Serbian  National Assembly should be an opposition deputy, and we hope  that this will be the case, Djindjic said. He added that the  president of Serbia "has a somewhat different opinion."  According to Djindjic, the Serbian president said that the  Socialist Party of Serbia, as the strongest party, had the right  to the post of the president of the Serbian Assembly, while the  opposition parties could have the posts of deputy presidents.  The DS insists that "the parties [as received] have  indisputable control of the finance, media, and internal  affairs," Djindjic said.    "If we are not in the position to control for 24 hours a day  the banks, state media, and the police, and in particular the  struggle against crime, there is no point in talking about a new  government and a new coalition," Djindjic stressed. Djindjic  believes that the new government will not be formed in the next  two weeks.    After Djindjic, Vuk Draskovic went in for talks with  President Milosevic. Before that, he briefly said to reporters:  "I have come to meet him and to talk."</p>

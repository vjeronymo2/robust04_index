			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Burnt by over-exposure in the Sun - Norwich Union has been fined Pounds 50,000 by Lautro Financial services, it must be said, are not like floor wax. The fact that four out of five housewives agree is not likely to persuade viewers to purchase a complex financial product which may require investment over half a lifetime. Because the losses from choosing the wrong product can be great, there are firm rules for what financial services firms can and cannot tell the public about their products. Last week, Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, slapped a Pounds 50,000 fine on Norwich Union for misleading advertising - along with a bill for Pounds 15,000 in costs - underscoring the seriousness with which breaches of advertising codes are viewed. The fine was the first ever imposed by Lautro under powers it received last autumn. The offending ad was a four-page pull-out in the Sun newspaper in April 1991. Lautro's main objection was that the advertisement looked just like the Sun's editorial pages, and so gave the impression that it was a journalist's account of a new product. Furthermore, the ad, promoting a 15-year savings product, implied that premium payments would remain constant when, in fact, they would rise by 20 per cent per year for the first five years in order to give the right investment returns. The ad also offended by suggesting that the illustrated investment returns were conservatively estimated and were likely to be far larger in practice. Although such breaches are worrying, they are rare. According to Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, instances of misleading advertising have fallen over the past two years. Indeed, only one of the eight or nine disciplinary cases still before Lautro involves misleading advertising. Most of the others concern companies' failure to control their so-called 'tied agents'. These are sales agents who are self-employed but who agree to sell the products of one company exclusively. Significantly, Norwich Union's ad was not placed by the company itself, but by one of its tied agents. The agent, a company called 'SunCare' was a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, the financial services broker, and was set up for the sole purposes of running the advertisement. The company has since ceased operations. Companies are becoming aware of the high cost of misleading advertising and steer clear of it, Jebens said. While Norwich Union has earned the first fine, others have had to bear the cost of rewriting their advertising, notifying clients of advertising errors and in some cases, they have been forced to refund customers. The regulation simply says that advertising must be 'fair, clear and not misleading'. But that rule is backed up by guidelines which ban the design of ads which are identical to a newspaper's editorial copy. Other rules forbid companies from playing down certain information - such as a 'health warning' that past investment performance is no indication of future returns. But while regulators may have stamped out the worst excesses in published advertising, they have been far less successful in controlling the informal, verbal advertising that goes on in private between a potential customer and a commissioned sales agent. 'That's where the real sales pitch goes on,' said Jean Eaglesham, money policy manager at the Consumers' Association. CA has sent actors posing as potential customers to gauge how much misleading advertising goes on in private. A recent CA survey of 40 mortgage lenders found that all 'were selling endowment policies very hard and were giving inaccurate information to consumers.' For instance, the sales agents - employees of banks and building societies - told buyers that endowment insurance policies were guaranteed to pay off a mortgage upon maturity when in fact, they are not. 'I don't really know what you can do about that,' Eaglesham said. 'It really needs radical reform of the commission system.' The commission system, under which sales agents are allowed to keep a portion of the premium payments from new customers, encourages a hard sell, critics say. The life industry has adamantly opposed any reform of the commission system, saying it would be a disincentive to sales agents and that people who need insurance simply would not be encouraged to buy it. Jebens admits that there is some merit in that view. 'Remuneration systems are partly at fault here,' he said, 'but there's not a lot you can do about it'. Commission, he says, is a commercial matter and cannot be subject to regulation. But Eaglesham argues that until misleading advertising transmitted by word of mouth is made as costly as that delivered in print, there is little incentive for companies to stop. Indeed, SunCare, Norwich Union's sales agent, signed up 4,500 new customers with its ad in the Sun - and earned a commission on every one.</p>

Col. Than Tun, deputy chief of military  intelligence, said six leaders of the National League for Democracy were  arrested. In Myanmar's May 27 national election, its first free voting in three  decades, the league won 392 of 485 contested seats, but the military has  ignored its demands to transfer power.  </P></p>

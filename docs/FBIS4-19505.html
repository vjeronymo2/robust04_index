			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League To Run Alone in Lombard </F> Administrative Elections"]    [Text] (ANSA) Milan, April 18 -- The Lombard League will  not seek alliances with anyone in the June 12 administrative  elections to be held in several municipalities of the Lombardy  region, a top party official announced Monday [18 April].    "We take it for granted that we'll be running alone in some  municipalities at the administrative elections," said Luigi  Negri, national secretary of the Lombard League, the regional  branch of the Northern League.    The decision would thus rule out presenting joint candidates  with Forza Italia, the Northern League's ally in the March 27-28  general elections.    Municipalities scheduled to go to the polls include Como,  Sesto San Giovanni, Abbiategrasso, Melegnano, Cernusco sul  Naviglio and Rho.</p>

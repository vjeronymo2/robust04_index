			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLLUTION, WATER DIVERSION THREATEN EVERGLADES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: SCIENTISTS BELIEVE FLORIDA'S PARK CAN BE SAVED. BUT FOR SOME RARE  NATIVE ANIMALS, IT MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE.  </P> <P> After parking her van on the side of a paved road that cuts across Everglades  National Park, Sue Haley hopped out and headed off through the waist-high saw  grass toward an alligator hole in a small stand of cypress trees 300 yards  away. About halfway there she stopped.  </P> <P> "See this water?" she asked. Looking down toward her rubber-booted feet, Haley  aimed a finger at the spongy carpet of algae on which she walked, the green  tangles of carnivorous bladderwort plant and the minnows swimming around her  toes. The clear, still water crested just above her ankles.  </P> <P> "Normally," said Haley, 31, a park ranger here for eight years, "the water  would be almost up to my knees at this time of year. But last summer we had  drought, no water has been released into the park at all this year, and already  -- early in November -- animals are congregating around water holes in order to  find food.  </P> <P> "It gets so frustrating," she added. "What the Everglades needs is lots of  support and respect for water as a finite resource. But we take it for granted.  And there just isn't enough water to (develop) South Florida . . . and save  this park too."  </P> <P> The seasonal change from wet to dry is always a critical time in the  Everglades, testing the survival capabilities of scores of unique plants and  animals that live here in a delicate web unlike any other on Earth. Over the  winter, alligators, raccoons, herons, mosquito fish and a wide variety of other  links in the food chain will gather at water holes to play out a timeless,  elemental drama of life and death.  </P> <P> But this year the park itself is fighting to survive. The Everglades, under  siege from pollution, an invasion of exotic species of plants and animals,  urban development and unnatural water levels regulated by computer, teeters on  the edge of what former park Supt. Mike Finley called "ecosystem collapse."  </P> <P> Most scientists believe that with a more natural water distribution pattern and  less interference from people, the Everglades can be saved. But for some rare  native animals, it may already be too late. The Everglades snail kite is  disappearing, the population of endangered Florida panthers has dropped to  about 30 and the number of wading birds in the park has declined to 10% of  1930s levels.  </P> <P> "Our prediction is that we're going to see no successful wading bird nesting in  the park this year," said Everglades researcher John Ogden. "With wood storks,  egrets, and white ibis, the situation is in crisis."  </P> <P> The Everglades is also beset with serious problems of contamination caused by  agricultural runoff rich in nutrients. Those nutrients have fueled a  proliferation of plants such as cattails, which for years have been spreading  at the rate of five acres a day, choking off naturally occurring species.  </P> <P> Mercury is also a threat. This summer, anglers were warned not to eat bass and  catfish caught in the park, and just last month an autopsy on a Florida panther  revealed enough mercury to kill a human.  </P> <P> The 2,200 square miles of freshwater marshland that make up Everglades National  Park occupy almost the entire tip of the Florida peninsula, but they are a mere  one-tenth of a vast wetlands system that begins at Lake Kissimmee in the center  of the state and includes Lake Okeechobee as well as millions of acres of  drained and diked land that now produces sugar cane, tomatoes and beans.  </P> <P> Flanked by some 4.5 million residents of Florida's east and west coasts, no  federal preserve is closer to a major urban area and, according to the  Wilderness Society, no park is closer to extinction. Saving it is now the  responsibility of Robert S. Chandler, who in December succeeds Finley as  superintendent.  </P> <P> Chandler, 53, is a 30-year veteran of the National Parks Service who comes here  after six years as superintendent of Olympic National Park in Washington. From  1978 to 1983 he held the top job at Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation  Area.  </P> <P> With the Everglades facing increasing pressure from oil companies who want to  drill in adjacent offshore waters, as well as a host of complex water delivery  issues, Chandler knows what he's up against. "The park is in real trouble;  that's reality," he said. "But this is not the time to simply throw up our  hands."  </P> <P> The crisis that grips the Everglades did not come about overnight. For several  decades attacks on the wetlands went almost unnoticed, provoking no public  outcry in the same way that, for example, a plan to level the landscape of  Yosemite or fill in the Grand Canyon surely would. The Everglades, after all,  looks like an immense swamp, is a forbidding expanse of grass and scrub trees,  is hot and desolate, crawls with dangerous reptiles and is the perfect breeding  ground for blood-thirsty mosquitoes that will later blow into Miami and annoy  people to slap-happy distraction.  </P> <P> But it is also a river -- a "river of grass" in environmentalist Marjory  Stoneman Douglas' words -- that runs 6 inches deep, 50 miles wide and flows  gently southward for 120 miles, from Lake Okeechobee in the center of the state  to the peninsula's tip. Overlaying the Biscayne Aquifer, the Everglades also is  the source of drinking water for 90% of South Florida.  </P> <P> The Everglades' problems are myriad, but they all begin -- and end -- with  water. Soon after the park was established in 1947, the demand for flood  control and more dry land for homes and farms outside its borders led to the  construction of 1,500 miles of levees and canals that crisscross the Everglades  and block the free flow of water.  </P> <P> Now, decisions about who gets water -- how much and when -- are made not by  nature but by hydrologists working for the state. And when those decisions run  contrary to the natural nesting cycles of birds, or the seasonal food needs of  fish, for example, wildlife suffers.  </P> <P> "What we've got is a robot Everglades which doesn't work as well as it did when  nature controlled it," said Joe Podgor of Friends of the Everglades, a public  interest group begun by Douglas 20 years ago. "We've made a mess of it, and now  we've got to put the system back the way God made it.'  </P> <P> That won't be easy. While militant environmentalists like Podgor suggest  breaking down levees and filling in canals to restore the Everglades, that is  unlikely to happen. More probable is a system of water control that is driven  more by rainfall than by the desires of powerful farming interests and coastal  residents who favor green lawns.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some extraordinary signs have emerged indicating just how dire the  situation is. In October, 1988, the U.S. attorney in Miami, Dexter Lehtinen,  filed a lawsuit charging that state regulatory agencies had "breached the  public trust" by allowing polluted water from adjacent agricultural areas to  flow into the Everglades. The suit asks a federal judge to monitor the agencies  that are supposed to be protecting the park.  </P> <P> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which for more than 20 years dug the canals  and installed the floodgates that now define South Florida, has also begun  studies on how to regulate the flow of water into the park so that it more  closely mirrors the natural cycle of wet and dry.  </P> <P> And, in a measure considered vital to the preservation of wading birds and the  Florida panther, a bill before Congress would add 107,000 acres to the park at  its northeast corner. Chandler says working for passage of that bill "is one of  the first things on my agenda."  </P> <P> No one seriously suggests that Everglades National Park is dead yet. But  according to Friends of the Everglades' Podgor: "It is on life-support, like a  patient with an IV drip, hanging on the end of the line.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to come to grips with the water budget, and live within  our means," he said. "In 20 years, the Glades could turn into a field of  cattails, and Lake Okeechobee could be a slime pit.  </P> <P> "The good news may be that things are so bad that even the most simple-minded  among us -- and I mean elected officials -- can see the problems clearly. The  answer is to put the system back so that it works the natural way. If not,  we'll not only lose the Everglades, but we won't have anything to drink."  </P></p>

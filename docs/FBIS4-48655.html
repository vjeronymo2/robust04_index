			<p>BFN     [Text] Since 0600 this morning, the Rwanda Patriotic Front  [RPF] has begun observing a two-day truce. This is being done  to enable the UN special envoy, who is in our country, to hold  discussions with both sides concerning the UN mission to be  deployed here. It is within the framework of facilitating this  mission that the RPF has declared a total truce. The RPF is in  favor of the truce, but the RPF's observance depends on its  observance by the Rwandan Army.</p>

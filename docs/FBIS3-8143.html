Entz, who attended an assembly of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement (MKDH), pointed out discrepancies in  statements by Premier Vladimir Meciar who speaks about his  intention to conclude a peace agreement with Hungary on the one  hand, but warns against the danger of Hungarian capital in  southern Slovakia on the other hand.    Entz said that improvement in Hungarian-Slovak relations was  hampered mainly by the unwillingness of the Slovak Government  and political parties to discuss common problems and to solve  the status of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia.    He also met with Slovak President Michal Kovac with whom he  shares "many" views, as he put it. He praised Kovac's open  support for some demands of the Hungarian minority the  fulfillment of which was also recommended by the Council of  Europe when it was admitting Slovakia as its member last June.    Kovac supports the Hungarians' demands for bilingual sign  posts to be placed in communities with a mixed population and  the use of Hungarian female surnames without the Slovak suffix  -ova.</p>

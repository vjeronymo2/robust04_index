			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Kliridhis Not Bluffing"] </F>   [Text] There is no reason to believe President Glavkos  Kliridhis is bluffing in threatening to resign if the UN  Security Council calls for talks to continue on the  confidence-building measures. Many things have happened in the  last few weeks to make Kliridhis' position difficult, even  through we are not accustomed to politicians, and especially  presidents, resigning over such, an admittedly, delicate matter.  Then again, his resignation threat was probably the most  effective way of emphasizing his objections to the continuation  of discussions on the confidence-building measures, which he  considers dead and buried.    Therein lies the president's miscalculation, for which he is  prepared to give up his job. After the UN Secretary-General's  report, which unequivocally blamed [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf  Denktas for the failure to reach an agreement, Kliridhis assumed  that the confidence-building measure chapter would be consigned  to the dustbin of history, where so many other UN initiatives  have ended up. Yet there had been warnings to the contrary.  First, there was the Vienna meeting, at which U.S. and UN  representatives met Denktas and a Turkish Foreign Ministry  official in a last-ditch attempt to salvage the initiative.  Second, in his report to the Security Council, the  Secretary-General included the continuation of  confidence-building measure discussions as one of five options,  despite the earlier failure.    It became obvious that neither the United Nations nor the  United States and Britain were prepared to abandon a whole  year's work on the confidence-building measures, especially as  they believed the few differences that prevented progress were  not insurmountable. In the circumstances, it was unrealistic to  expect the UN to abandon the measures and accept that a year's  work had gone to waste, irrespective of Butrus- Ghali's report.  And once Denktas had supposedly agreed to the main  sticking-point, access to Varosha, there was no way the UN, the  U.S. and Britain would abandon the process. To add insult to  injury, the European Union observer's report on Cyprus, released  earlier this week, also supported the continuation of  discussions. In other words, all those countries and  organisations that Kliridhis was relying on to condemn Denktas  intransigence are, in no uncertain terms, backing the  confidence-building measure process.    For an experienced politician like the president to declare  the confidence-building measure talks dead, was more a case of  wishful thinking then mistaken evaluation. Matters were made  worse last week when the National Council unanimously agreed  that the Greek Cypriot side would not agree to discuss the  confidence-building measures again; and unanimous decisions are  binding. Kliridhis had on the one hand committed himself to the  UN on the confidence-building measures, and last week committed  himself to not discussing them again. This explains his threat  to resign. Admittedly, he made a serious miscalculation  regarding the UN's and the United States' ability to bring  Denktas round to their way of thinking. He did after all say  before discussions had even begun that he did not expect the  Turkish Cypriot side to accept the measures.    Then again, Kliridhis has good reason to feel aggrieved at  the way things have gone. Unlike Denktas, he had cooperated  constructively with the UN. Yet now the UN is helping the  obstructionist get off the hook. It would seem that taking a  hard line and being a difficult customer pay off in the end.  Even so, the UN has no real grounds to believe Denktas will  keep his word and go all the way on the confidence-building  measures even if it has received assurances on the Varosha issue  and discussion resume. Who can guarantee Denktas won't throw a  spanner in the works once again? The preparedness of the UN,  the United States and Britain to credit Denktas with good  intentions defies logic and experience.    Kliridhis obviously feels his position has become untenable.  But the UN and the countries involved cannot afford to let him  carry out his threat, because that would be the end of the  confidence-building measures. A new president, if things come  to that pass, would not have any obligation to accept the  confidence-building measures, in which case a year's efforts  would go to waste. Perhaps the Secretary-General's other option  of allowing a period of reflection for all concerned is in the  circumstances the best suggestion for now.</p>

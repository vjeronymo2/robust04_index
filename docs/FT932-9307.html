			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Management: Baby Bell's bad behaviour - In the week that Fiat adopted its new ethics code, Martin Dickson explains why business morality is a big issue on both sides of the Atlantic They were nicknamed 'the perverts' conventions'. They were wild, lewd business parties thrown in Florida in the 1980s by employees of Nynex, the 'Baby Bell' company serving the northeastern US, and they led to a serious crisis inside the group and a wholesale review of its business ethics. Nynex's painful experience, spelt out by William Ferguson, the chairman, at a recent New York conference on business ethics, gives an insight into three questions at the centre of the current debate over business conduct on both sides of the Atlantic. Why are so many companies focusing on the issue now? Is this just a fad, best ignored in the win-by-all-means pursuit of profits? And if not, how can businesses best avoid ethical lapses? There is no question that ethics has been receiving more executive attention in the last few months. An international survey published last year by the Conference Board, the business issues group which organised the New York conference, found that corporate ethics codes, 'once regarded as a reactive phenomenon to deflect cyclical outburst of public distrust of business institutions. . . now enjoy a broad base of support within individual companies'. In the UK, ethics has been much debated in the wake of British Airways' 'dirty tricks' campaign against rival Virgin Atlantic. And in Italy, the giant Fiat group this week spelt out new guidelines for employees who have to deal with government officials, political parties and civil servants. The move is widely expected to be followed by other big Italian companies, notably the Eni energy and chemicals concern which has been implicated in allegations of corruption and kickbacks on public-sector contracts. In the US, ethics is one of the most popular courses at the Harvard Business School, while New York's Columbia University Business School has made the issue one of four core principles meant to permeate all its courses. The trend owes something to the backlash against the 'greed is good' morality which characterised the takeover boom of the 1980s. However, more practical business considerations also come into play: The increased attention given to business news in the US media. Big stories often appear on the front page of US general interest papers, rather than hidden away in a financial section. That means much greater potential for bad publicity, with the attendant loss of business and staff morale. Nynex's experience demonstrates the power of the general press and the damage it can inflict. When in 1988 the company discovered that a handful of executives were inviting businessmen who supplied goods to the company to sleazy Florida parties, it quietly sacked or disciplined the perpetrators, hoping this would end what it believed was an 'isolated incident'. However, says Ferguson, the New York press pounced on the story. Nynex employees who read about the parties found themselves facing 'a crisis of confidence and trust in one another. . . Even senior managers sitting across a conference table started to wonder if it was happening in the other person's shop'. The increasingly global nature of industry. This means that many US companies are expanding or selling abroad for the first time, forcing them to focus on business practices in other countries which would not be acceptable at home. Legal changes in the US. The US Sentencing Commission - a body established by Congress in 1984 to tackle criticism of light sentences for white-collar crime - established tough new guidelines in November 1991 for corporate offences such as fraud and bribery. The guidelines allow an extremely wide range of sentences for the same crime, depending on the degree of culpability the courts assign to the corporation. A company's fine will be greatly reduced if it can show it has 'an effective programme to prevent and detect violations of the law' - in other words, a strong ethics framework. The effect on profits. Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of a well-implemented code is that it may boost the bottom line - particularly in the rapidly changing working environment of the 1990s - though this assertion is impossible to prove statistically. Companies are placing a growing emphasis on the quality of their goods and services, by focusing on customer satisfaction and closer relations with suppliers. These trends carry with them implied ethical contracts between the parties involved. Simultaneously, the flattening of corporate organisations and the devolution of responsibility down the line to workers in an attempt to speed decision-making also involves ethical considerations. Newly 'empowered' workers need to have a proper sense of right and wrong if they are to make quick, correct judgments. Says Nynex's Ferguson: 'We are not interested in ethics because we are trying to create an 'ethics society' or sub-culture at Nynex. Instead, we are trying to make ethical behaviour an everyday norm. . . because, basically, we believe ethics makes good business sense.' How did Nynex recover from its ethics crisis? It first appointed outside experts to see where it needed improvement, and then established a new framework for business conduct. It created an office of ethics at its headquarters, run by a senior executive with direct access to the chairman and responsible to the board's audit committee. Similar offices were established in each of its leading business units, with 'hotlines' for people to report misconduct. About 90 per cent of calls, however, have been requests for information, clarification or assistance with human resource matters; only 10 per cent have been about alleged violations. Nynex also drew up a single code of business conduct to replace the differing codes in force in separate units. It then began company-wide training in business ethics, which initially met with a sceptical response. 'Many executives started out feeling too much was being made out of an isolated incident which didn't involve them,' says Ferguson. 'Most managers saw 'bottom-line, hard business issues' as priorities - and ethics didn't make that shortlist.' However, as training progressed the participants began to discover there were many grey areas in their work that needed clarification. 'For example, what if an employee finds a competitor's proposal, left behind on the seat of the commuter train?' Ferguson says that 'once you start working on so-called 'soft' issues like ethics, you find out that they are a lot harder than you thought.' But he adds that 'unless you can change the 'soft' things about your business, you're not going to be terribly successful in getting at the 'hard' things you face. In fact, these two areas are intimately related to each other. The problem is that most people don't think they are.' Besides his own law, Ferguson offers four main lessons from Nynex's experience. First, there is a large difference between 'compliance' with ethics codes and a genuine commitment to them. Second, face-to-face communication is helpful in getting people to accept ethics codes. 'Counter the doubters and sceptics - and that's most people - by forcing them to engage in a sustained dialogue about how ethics affects their conduct.' Third, make sure ethics is part of a continuing commitment, not just 'programme of the month'. Finally, leadership on ethics begins at the top. 'The role model that managers set for their employees, knowingly or otherwise, is the most important weapon in the ethics arsenal.'</p>

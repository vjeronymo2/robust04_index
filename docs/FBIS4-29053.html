			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukuoka, June 14 KYODO -- Police Tuesday [14 June]  recaptured and took into custody three more Chinese suspected of  being illegal immigrants who fled the Fukuoka Immigration Bureau  on Sunday.    The three are among the 26 Chinese minors who fled the  bureau  en masse, of whom a total of 22 have been recaptured, police  said. The 26, including two girls, were taken into custody on  may 18 after they were found hiding in a warehouse in Fukuoka,  western Japan, with more than 100 adult Chinese, who were all  arrested on suspicion of illegally entering Japan.    The immigration officials also found 22,000 yen in cash  hidden in a cigarette box left on a shelf in one of the  detention center rooms. The officials suspect the money is what  is left of the 30,000 yen which one of the Chinese took when  fleeing the center.    A senior immigration official earlier said the escape began  Sunday evening when one of the Chinese asked for hot water.  When a bureau official opened the door, 10 Chinese minors  jumped on him and two other immigration officials, handcuffed  them and stole about 30,000 yen from a drawer before escaping,  the official said.</p>

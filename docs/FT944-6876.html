			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Report on durability of consumer goods Consumer goods should be made to last longer rather than being sent for recycling when they are no longer required, says a report by an economic think-tank published today, Deborah Hargreaves writes. The New Economics Foundation says longer-lasting products would be much more beneficial to the environment than recycling, which the report's author criticises as inadequate and a 'third-rate' option. Mr Tim Cooper, the author, says more than 6m large kitchen appliances, 3m vacuum cleaners and 2m cars are discarded in Britain each year. He criticises the current emphasis on recycling, noting that recycling itself uses energy and adds to pollution. Mr Cooper says that recycling is preferable to landfill, but should be ranked third after waste reduction which involves building longer-lasting products, and re-using products and their components. The report claims that companies could gain a beneficial marketing edge by producing more durable goods. It also advocates significantly longer guarantees for products and a shift in taxes from labour to energy and raw materials. Beyond Recycling: The Longer Life Option. New Economics Foundation, Vine Court, 112-116 Whitechapel Road, London E1 1JE. Pounds 10.</p>

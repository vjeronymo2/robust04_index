			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The World Tourism Organization voted to shelve the issue of Palestinian  membership until 1991. Delegates to the organization's general assembly in  Paris approved by a 40-34 vote a U.S. motion to postpone any decision on the  issue. Other members of the 107-member organization were either absent or  abstained. There was no immediate reaction from Palestine Liberation  Organization officials. Since the PLO declared a state of Palestine last  November, publicly renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel, it has tried to  gain entry to two other U.N. agencies -- the World Health Organization and the  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Both agencies also voted to  shelve the requests.  </P></p>

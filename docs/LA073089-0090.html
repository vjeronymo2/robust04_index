			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP FACES: GRIFFITH MOVES OUT OF THE COUNTRY SCENE;  </P> <P> GRIFFITH'S SWITCH  </P> <P> Nanci Griffith is crossing over from country to pop.  </P> <P> Don't fret -- you won't mistake this for a Dolly Parton "Here You Come Again"  move any more than you'd mistake the bookish, homespun Texan for the glitzy  owner of Dollywood.  </P> <P> But the folkish singer-songwriter's upcoming "Storms" album (due in August)  will be handled by MCA Records' Universal City-based pop department after her  last three albums were marketed through the company's Nashville-based country  division. But for the soft-spoken artist, the switch is more one of terminology  than of style.  </P> <P> "I don't care what I'm called as long as I'm called," said Griffith, 35,  looking something like a younger sister of Shelley Duvall as she sat in an MCA  office.  </P> <P> "I've always been marketed as pop in Europe," she continued. "That's my biggest  market. Plus, country radio and I are allergic to each other, and there was a  lot of pressure to have hits.  </P> <P> "I sell records, I stay in the black. I was selling more albums than some of  MCA's artists who had No. 1 hits on country radio. But I got my hands slapped  for not having hits. If it's not working and it's causing me a headache, then I  want out, which is what happened.  </P> <P> "To be fair to country radio, I don't listen to it, so why should I have ever  expected them to listen to me?," said the singer, who moved to Nashville from  Austin three years ago. "Barbara Mandrell is not my idea of a good time."  </P> <P> In truth, there's not much difference between the new "pop" album and the old  "country" records.  </P> <P> Griffith still weaves sharp-eyed character studies and short stories in a style  inspired by such Southern prose writers as Larry McMurtry and Eudora Welty.  They've caught the attention of Bruce Springsteen, who has recorded a duet with  Patti Scialfa of Griffith's "Gulf Coast Highway" for possible inclusion on  Scialfa's upcoming debut album.  </P> <P> Still, "Storms" reflects changes taking place in Griffith's life that go beyond  a switch in marketing strategy.  </P> <P> "1988 was a hard year, personally, for me," Griffith said, noting that the  grueling tour schedule she has kept up for virtually her whole adult life has  begun to take its toll.  </P> <P> "I've been saying for five or six years that I want to try some character  acting and I want to spend more time on my prose," said Griffith, who has  written two unpublished novels. "And I can't do that on the road."  </P> <P> Character acting?  </P> <P> "I'm open to anything," she said. "I'm at that age where I can do a lot of  characters. I'm getting little lines in my face."

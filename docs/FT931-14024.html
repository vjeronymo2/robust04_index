			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Hatton at 'centre of the web' in land deal MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool Council, was paid almost Pounds 120,000 to help push through a corrupt Pounds 1.8m land deal, Mold Crown Court was told yesterday. Mr Hatton was alleged to have been at 'the centre of the web' in a plot to cheat the council by dishonestly using highly confidential information. Mr Hatton; former councillors Mr John Nelson and Ms Hannah Folan; and two businessmen, Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, all deny charges of conspiring to defraud Liverpool City Council. Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said Settleside, Mr Hatton's public relations company, received an average of almost Pounds 30,000 a year from Mr Stewart over a four-year period. He said Ms Folan passed to Mr Hatton the confidential information that a 20-acre site in the city was to be offered for commercial development. He claimed Mr Hatton, who ceased to be a councillor in 1987, told Mr Stewart, head of a development company, that the land was to be made available for retail purposes. Mr Rawley also alleged that the council committee which Ms Folan chaired had given Mr Stewart an option to buy the land against the advice of council officials that it should be offered for tender. Mr Stewart's company, Rogerson Developments, paid Settleside regular sums for 'public relations and research', said Mr Rawley. He told the jury: 'What we are suggesting is that the payments going to Mr Hatton, of just under Pounds 30,000 a year, were for the influence he could bring to bear on Ms Folan.' Mr Rawley said Mr Hatton's diaries contained entries at the time of the deal showing there was regular contact between Mr Hatton and Ms Folan, and between Mr Hatton and Mr Stewart. The trial continues today.</p>

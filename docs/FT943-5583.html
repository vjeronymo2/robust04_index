			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (29): Indonesia points the way - Asia Pacific is a bright spot for the industry The past few years have been tough ones for the aerospace industry. The commercial market has been languishing, with airlines forced to cut back on aircraft deliveries due to lower-than-anticipated passenger growth. The end of the cold war has led to wholesale cuts in defence expenditure - and in the purchase of military aircraft. The bright spot among the gloom has been the Asia Pacific region. Aerospace executives realised long ago that the region was the area of growth: according to latest forecasts by Boeing, Asian airlines are expected to acquire up to 3,000 aircraft, valued at Dollars 245bn, between now and 2010. It is expected that, by the end of the century, Asia will surpass the US as the world's largest commercial jet market. At the same time, many countries in the region - particularly in south-east Asia - are strengthening their defence forces and making big expenditures on military aircraft. 'This region is the salvation of our industry,' said a Singapore-based aerospace executive. 'If an aerospace company is not selling into this region, then its future has to be bleak.' Countries in the region have realised that their increased purchasing power has given them considerable influence over the world's aerospace companies. Many countries have ambitions to develop their own aerospace industries. Purchases - whether of commercial or military aircraft - are linked increasingly to technology transfer and so-called 'offset' arrangements, which guarantee that purchasing countries can participate in various stages of aircraft manufacture. A recent report by the US general accounting office, carried out for the Congressional committee on science, space and technology, found that, though countries in Asia are likely to be dependent on western aeronautics technology for some years, the region is developing a strong industry which could pose future problems for US manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. 'Once acquired, these technologies can be honed and improved upon,' says the report. 'Consequently, what starts as a subcontract to produce latches on cargo doors, for instance, develops over time to fuselage, wing and avionics manufacturing.' Indonesia's Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) is the only company in south-east Asia at present producing its own aircraft. It already manufactures the CN235 transport aircraft in co-operation with Casa of Spain. Later this year, the 70-seat CN250 is due to be rolled out of IPTN's giant complex at Bandung, on Java. The CN250 will be the first commercial aircraft to be designed and built entirely in Indonesia. The Indonesian economy is rapidly expanding. The country, the world's third most populous, stretching across an area wider than the US coast to coast, has a growing appetite for aircraft. Mr Bacharuddin Habibie, Indonesia's minister of research and technology and the driving force behind the growth of IPTN, is known in the aerospace industry as 'Mr Offset'. Mr Habibie, who has many critics, both within and outside Indonesia, for the way he has poured millions into high-technology projects, has established a wide range of collaborative agreements with foreign companies, and is demanding increasing amounts of technology transfer. He is also determined to take on the western companies. 'I have tried to sell IPTN aircraft in the US,' says Mr Habibie. 'The US says it's an open market, but it has so many built-in regulations that I can never sell an aircraft there. This is why I have to set up a company in the US to produce, assemble and sell our aircraft there.' Both Malaysia and Thailand are rapidly upgrading their aerospace industries. Increasing amounts of commercial aircraft repair and maintenance can now be carried out in either Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. Again, both countries have insisted that, if they are going to buy commercial and military aircraft, aerospace companies must, in return, establish local training and manufacturing centres. Recently McDonnell Douglas entered into a wide-ranging agreement to help Malaysia develop its aerospace industry. Last year, Malaysia placed orders for eight F/A-18D fighter jets from the US company, as part of its modernisation programme. Malaysia has also reached collaborative manufacturing, maintenance and technology-transfer agreements with the Russians as a result of purchasing 18 MiG-29s. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has been stressing the need to develop an aerospace industry. Malaysia plans to manufacture initially two small two-seater aircraft and a 14-seater amphibious aircraft. 'These are undoubtedly small beginnings,' says Dr Mahathir, 'but in a century's time we may have our Boeing and McDonnell Douglas counterpart. . . A beginning has to be made.' Singapore was the first country in south-east Asia to develop an aerospace industry. More than 50 companies are involved in what is now a highly sophisticated aerospace sector. According to the government's economic development board (EDB), the aerospace industry grew by 6.2 per cent last year with a total output of SDollars 1.25bn (Dollars 800m). The facilities provided at Changi - consistently rated as one of the world's most efficient airports - plus the availability of a highly skilled workforce - have been essential elements in making Singapore into one of the key aircraft overhaul and maintenance centres in the Asia Pacific region. While Singapore does not have ambitions to produce its own aircraft, it has achieved some notable manufacturing successes. For example, Airbus A320 cabin doors, A340 engine mounts and landing-gear doors for the new Boeing 777 are now manufactured on the island. However, Singapore faces constraints on manpower and space. Many airlines and aerospace companies locating regional operations in Indonesia, Malaysia or China, where wages are considerably lower. Moreover, competition does not come only from the region. 'European companies are very, very hungry and are slashing prices to rock-bottom,' says an executive at one of Singapore's biggest aerospace companies. 'At the end of the day, it will be a case of who can give the best in price, turnaround time and quality.' Singapore's industrial planners have a dual response to the challenges their aerospace industry faces. One way to combat the competition is to go into increasingly sophisticated high-tech areas of the industry. The other is to go regional - forming joint ventures with other countries and companies, particularly in labour-intensive areas. Such ventures have already been formed in India. Late last year, Singapore Engineering, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, took a 10 per cent stake in a Dollars 63m aircraft repair and maintenance facility in China. Not only does this give the Singapore company the advantage of being able to recruit workers at less than two thirds the rates in the island republic; it will also give Singapore important access to the world's fastest growing aerospace market.</p>

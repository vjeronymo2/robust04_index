			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> TAX HEARING DELAYED  </P> <P> After hours of late-night testimony from dozens of residents, the West  Hollywood City Council delayed a public hearing on a proposed business-license  tax until Feb. 20.  </P> <P> More than 100 small-business owners and residents appeared at the meeting  Monday night to oppose the long-expected tax.  </P> <P> The proposed tax would be levied annually based on business classification and  estimated gross receipts. Under a proposed gross revenue structure, businesses  earning $100,000 a year would pay $48. The tax would be determined on a  graduated scale, and businesses with gross receipts of more than $10 million  would pay as much as $14,000.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the proposed tax would be used for capital improvement projects,  such as parking structures and a new fire station, said City Manager Paul  Brotzman.  </P> <P> The West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is opposing the tax, and has marshaled  neighborhood groups to fight it.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Adrian Hadland] </F>   [Text] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region  officials claim that incidents of bureaucratic sabotage by  employees of the Transvaal Provincial Administration [TPA] are  hampering efforts to set up the new provincial government.    A PWV region source said the offices of newly elected  legislators were encountering "deliberate resistance", including  the loss of documents and ignored requests for equipment and  information from TPA department officials in Pretoria.    "We thought at first it was just a few incompetent people,  but the loss of strategic documents and problems in specific  areas lead us to believe this is sabotage," the source said.    TPA officials, however, claim provincial premiers and  legislators have been appointing dozens of new people to posts  not sanctioned by the Commission for Administration. They  contend the filling of new posts must follow procedures laid  down in the public service's personnel administration system.  This involves a work study investigation to evaluate the post  and its place in the grading system as well as minimum  qualifications for applicants.    TPA officials felt that while they were keen to support and  assist the new provincial government as apolitical public  servants, they could not agree to demands from people who had  not been formally placed in the official structures of the  public service as laid down in legislation. "Even premiers do  not have the authority just to appoint people."    Commission for Provincial Government chairman Thozamile  Botha  said mechanisms were being established that would better  integrate public servants with newly appointed provincial  officers and legislators.    Strategic management teams were being established in all  provincial departments to help bridge the gulf between the old  and new administrations. These teams would assist in  communications between departmental tiers, improve access to  information and deal with employee grievances and uncertainties.    A TPA official said, however, that new structures could not  be set up outside the present official structures.    The PWV source said the culture of secrecy still  predominating in the public service, together with uncertainty  over authority structures, had contributed to the problems.  "Nobody knows who's the boss or how seriously they should take  requests from people they have never heard of. Mostly we have  to rely on goodwill, and this is not always forthcoming."    Access to demographic and research information had proven  particularly difficult. This was having a significant effect on  the province's ability to get started, the source said.</p>

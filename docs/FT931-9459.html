			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The Chancellor and the future Governor of the Bank of England have made plain they see little room for further interest rate cuts. The markets are disinclined to believe either. Yesterday's unusually explicit statement from Mr Lamont was brushed aside by an equity market rising in anticipation of lower rates. A rise in the short sterling future was an unambiguous sign of the market betting on easier money to come. With inflation falling to the lowest level since 1967 - and the government's lengthening record of U-turns in mind - that looks a rational response. The inflation figures suggest exceptionally weak demand across the economy. Import and producer prices are rising but retailers would rather swallow lower margins than pass the cost on to consumers. Next week's slew of economic statistics will show why, as unemployment pushes through three million. Given Mr Major's problems with the coal industry and the Maastricht treaty, keeping rebellious Tory MPs sweet on the economy will be top priority. The odds must be on another cut in rates around the time of the budget. But sterling gained almost two pfennigs from its low against the D-Mark yesterday. Unless the foreign exchange market was alone in taking notice of Mr Lamont, that can only be because the market senses recovery without inflation. That would support sterling in the same way as the dollar is now strong. If the sentiment can be sustained, the government will have room to cut rates again.</p>

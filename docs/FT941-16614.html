			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: An unspoilt getaway - Gordon Robison visits Asir, a Saudi tourist region devoid of tourists Imagine a remote region of heavily forested mountains and valleys; of villages untouched by tourism where much of the traditional architecture has been preserved and is in everyday use; where camels and wild monkeys are common sights. Imagine, too, that this remote region is served by an immaculately maintained network of uncongested roads, highways and airports and that it offers both food and accommodation to suit any budget with standards of hygiene and medical care that any European would envy. There is such a place; the Asir mountains of western Saudi Arabia. The problem is that Saudi restrictions mean that unless you work in Saudi Arabia, or have business there, or are a Saudi (or citizen of another Gulf state), you almost certainly cannot visit this region. Thus Asir may enjoy the strange distinction of being the world's best-developed tourist region that you (probably) cannot visit. You will have to hope that things change. For several years Saudia, Saudi Arabia's national airline, has been promoting Asir as a tourist destination for the internal market. Several of the region's main hotels offer weekend packages and a few tour operators have arranged itineraries covering several of the region's cities. The Asir mountains are part of a much longer chain stretching north to Jordan and south through Yemen. To the west they drop sharply away to the Red Sea. To the east they trail off into a series of hills and plateaus which eventually disappear into the desert. It is a region where the roads hug the sides of tree-covered mountains as one moves between villages where the culture is closer to that of Yemen than to the cosmopolitan port of Jeddah or the Bedouin traditions of Riyadh. In winter Asir belies the popular image of Arabia as a place of ferocious, never-ending summers. The mountains can be subject to heavy rains and often spend months locked in thick but highly local fogs. Most activity in Asir centres on the provincial capital of Abha, which until 1922 was the capital of a small independent kingdom. In that year Asir was conquered by Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdel Rahman Al-Saud (usually called Ibn Saud in the west), the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Abha later became a base for Abdul Asiz's attacks on the Hejaz, north of Asir where Mecca and Medina are located. Abha is a small, functional town with only one real point of interest. This is the Shada Palace; it was built in 1927 and served for two generations as the regional seat of government. Since 1987 it has been open to the public as a museum of Asiri culture. The palace is a three-storey mud brick building with a sitting area on the roof. Many such buildings can be seen along almost any road through the Asir countryside, although in the centre of Abha the palace itself has become an architectural anomaly. Aside from the scenery and the architecture, one of Asir's main selling points is altitude. At just over 2,200 metres, Abha provides respite for those weary of summer's sweltering heat in Jeddah or Riyadh. Another prime attraction is Asir national park, designed for the Saudis by a team from the US national park service. The protected area encompassed by the park is enormous, taking in thousands of square kilometres of land in and around the Asir mountains and stretching west to the Red Sea. The park's facilities are well-laid out, although visiting them is not straight-forward. Take the visitor's centre, a series of displays on the park's plants, animals, geography and culture located in a building adjacent to Abha's ring road. The building is in beautifully landscaped gardens where it blends easily with the surrounding mountains. The centre includes an observation deck overlooking the valley just below. Wild monkeys native to the region can often be seen in the grounds. But first you have to get into the centre. It is open only on summer evenings and entrance is restricted to families. In Saudi Arabia this means 'couples' and 'unaccompanied women,' with or without children. Males wanting to view the exhibits and lacking a female and/or juvenile escort must obtain a permit. In winter, everyone needs a permit. A far easier way to approach the park is via the tours and packages offered by the Abha Inter-Continental Hotel. Even if you are staying in the youth hostel (they are open only to men), a trip to the hotel for a look at the massive lobby is a must. Originally built as a palace for one of Saudi Arabia's numerous princes, the hotel sits in the heart of the park, near the summit of Jebel Sawdah, at 3,115m the highest point in the country. Anomalously, Asir is a tourist region devoid of tourists. As a result, it remains largely unknown to the outside world.</p>

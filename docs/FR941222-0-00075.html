			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provision allowing ALJs to issue decisions from the bench is perhaps even more objectionable. First of all, the threat to the quality of ALJ decisions posed by dispensing with briefing will only be compounded by the absence of a written ALJ decision. In essence, the Judge will have just heard oral arguments, which were constructed without benefit of time for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. The judge will thereupon render a decision, without an independent opportunity for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. In our view, such a process is not a recipe for excellence_or even quality_in decision-making. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of bench decisions, moreover, is bound to compound the Board's difficulties in the federal courts. In recent years, reviewing courts have shown an increasing propensity to remand cases to the Board (or simply to reverse the Board outright) on grounds that the Board has not adequately articulated the basis for its decision. Our colleagues nonetheless wish to implement a rule that can only exacerbate this problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the new rule recognizes, ALJ bench decisions are not exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which provides that all decisions ``shall include a statement of *&blank;*&blank;* findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefore,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  5 U.S.C. Section 557(c) (1988) (emphasis added). Just as the most competent of counsel will have difficulty constructing a cogent oral argument on the spot, so, too will even the ablest of ALJs have difficulty covering all the basis required by the APA in a bench decision_especially one rendered without the benefit of written briefs. The question whether the Judge's oral decision complies with the APA will thus, as noted in comments on the proposed rule, <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  provide fertile ground for litigation before the circuit courts as well as the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Comment of Jeffrey C. McGuiness (Labor Policy Association) at 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, we are not convinced that resorting to bench decisions will result in any net savings of time_the driving force behind this provision. Litigation over the adequacy of the Judge's oral findings is almost certain to add time at both the Board and court levels. Indeed, the mere opportunity to litigate this procedural issue may result in the appeal of cases that would not otherwise be taken up_for instance, Section 8(a)(3) cases that turn largely on the Judge's factual findings. Moreover, where the Judge has indeed failed to make all the proper findings, the Board will have to attempt, where possible, to supply the missing ingredients itself, or else remand the case for further findings_both time-consuming processes. Further remands will be doubt occur at the circuit court level when the court disagrees with the Board's determination regarding the adequacy of the findings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, litigation over the ``adequacy'' issue, and the necessity for remands in some cases, will add time to the process. In our view, this additional time will likely be greater than the time saved by dispensing with a written decision. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  Whereas a remand will likely result in a minimum of several months of delay, requiring a written decision (after the filing of briefs) should add at most several weeks to the decision time in a ``simple'' case_a period that can be kept to a minimum by encouraging ALJs to set short briefing schedules in appropriate cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See also Comment of Jeffrey C. McGuiness (Labor Policy Association) at 3&hyph;4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, we do not share our colleagues' apparent belief that remands can be avoided by carefully culling out only relatively simple cases. The rule, of course, does not confine use of the procedure to any particular kind of case. Even if ALJs attempt to abide by the ``suggestions'' put forth by the Board, there will undoubtedly be cases where the prediction is not borne out. A case that appears ``simple'' may turn out not to be so simple after all. This is particularly true, given the absence of discovery. The fact that the ALJ knows little about the case until the evidence unfolds at trial increases the risk that a case that appears at first blush to require only a straightforward credibility determination or the application of a well-settled principle of law may, upon reflection, turn out to involve much more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

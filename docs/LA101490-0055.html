			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC SPECIAL;  </P> <P>  PAUL SIMON "THE RHYTHM OF THE SAINTS" WARNER BROS.  </P> <P> It's still a little hard to get used to the idea of Paul Simon music as beat  music, but that's exactly what "Saints" is -- his usual elliptical reveries and  sad-mouthed regrets having been built this time from the ground up on a rock  bottom of complex Brazilian rhythms. And they do kick.  </P> <P> The very first song, "The Obvious Child," opens with a bold, cadence-like  phalanx of drums, and though the meters get smoother and quieter over the  course of the album, they never really let up. It's driving stuff that just  might make you get up and dance.  </P> <P> Or lay down and nap. Because at the same time the album carries a distinctly  dream-like quality -- thanks not only to Simon writing his most  impressionistic, least linear batch of songs to date, but to the languid  quality of its melodic sense that offsets the busyness of the rhythm quite  beautifully.  </P> <P> Though it obviously shares many qualities with its four-year-old predecessor,  "Graceland" -- including some of the same South African elements alongside new  West African and Brazilian ones -- this album may be harder for the public to  get a handle on. Celebrative musical strains on the level of "You Can Call Me  Al" are far fewer on this gentler, spookier effort.  </P> <P> The increased dillution between different geographic locales parallels the  increased dillution of Simon's lyricism. You get the sense that this charming  but emotionally elusive character welcomes all this ethnomusicology in part as  something else to hide behind. Some of these songs -- burdened with incidents  and details, but rarely declarations -- are textbook examples of how to write  about being lonely without saying anything so obvious, or brave.  </P> <P> If Simon is hiding, though, he's doing it brilliantly. After this equally  engaging followup, "Graceland" seems less like an experiment and more like the  beginnings of a new language that combines several old or even ancient ones --  the village spirit dance, the West Village folk Angst. And if he requires a  Brazilian drum corps to provide some of the expressiveness his lyrics mask, all  the better for us. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

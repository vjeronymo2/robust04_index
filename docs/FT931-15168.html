			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Another depressing London development plan Sir, It was depressing to read that the City Corporation is once again preparing to compromise London's diminishing built heritage, for a paltry 300,000 pieces of more than somewhat devalued silver ('Road in City to be sold', January 12). The last such occasion that professionally concerned me was the City Corporation's sale to the London Docklands Development corporation of the unique late 19th and early 20th century group of industrial buildings at St George's Wharf, Deptford, which was then destroyed (in advance of possible spot-listing) to make way for an unnecessarily elaborate feeder road and a currently weed-encrusted 'development opportunity'. Now Bucklersbury is likely to be similarly ripped up to make way for some seedy 'arcade' (doubtless to be filled by unlettable retail premises) running through what Prince Charles has rightly referred to as a 1930s 'wireless set', although, in the current climate, about the only way Lord Palumbo will be able to fund its construction will be by emptying his own pockets] We should expect a better standard of care for our heritage from what is virtually the only efficient UK local authority. Brian H Gill, 261 Grove Street, Deptford Wharf, London SE8 3PZ</p>

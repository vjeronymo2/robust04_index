			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Full Bulgarian debt rescheduling in view A DECISION by the Paris Club of sovereign creditors to reschedule Bulgaria's Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.04bn) debt is likely to pave the way for a complete rescheduling of its Dollars 8.5bn debt to the London Club of commercial creditors, according to Mr Todor Vulchev, head of the Bulgarian National Bank. But the Bulgarian government will not yet ask for cancellation of any of its debt. The debt to the Paris Club is to be rescheduled over 10 years, with a six-year grace period. Also, negotiations aimed at trying to arrange new terms for repaying Dollars 8.6bn are under way with Deutsche Bank, leading a consortium of commercial creditor banks. All payments of interest and principal were suspended by the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank in March 1990. Western banks immediately imposed a moratorium on fresh credits until the Bulgarian government guaranteed further payments. A lack of new credits led to sharp falls in industrial production, down by 10 per cent in 1990. Mr Atanas Paparizov, Bulgaria's foreign economic relations minister, said at the weekend he expected GDP to fall by 30 per cent by year-end. However, he remained adamant that Bulgaria 'will not favour the private banks to the detriment of the official creditors. We will not repay private banks from government guarantee credits and medium-term credits. We will have to pay these banks on the basis of a growth in GDP and exports.'</p>

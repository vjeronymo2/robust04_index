			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT GRIDLOCK  </P> <P> I would like to add another voice about the negative treatment afforded  international passengers from abroad using the Tom Bradley terminal at Los  Angeles International Airport. Jeane M. Nutt of Pasadena in her letter, "First  Impressions" (Jan. 15), commented that there is no free luggage-cart service or  currency-change facilities in the luggage area. Just as important is the lack  of restrooms, telephones or benches for the elderly while waiting for customs  and immigration clearance.  </P> <P> CARL MISCHKA  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

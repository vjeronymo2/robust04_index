			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Dzhappuyev, Kabardino-Balkar Republic State </F> Statistical Committee chairman: "Food Product Price Increases in  First Quarter 1994"]    [Text] In the first quarter of 1994 prices for goods and  services rose by 33.4 percent, including a 30.3 percent increase  in the price of goods, and 85.9 percent for services. For food  products the price index was 134.3 percent, with figures of  113.8 percent in January, 107.5 percent in February and 109.8  percent in March.    During the current year there have been increases in January  in the regulated prices of bread and beef and twice (in January  and March) for milk, yogurt and curds. As a result of this the  price of milk has increased by a factor of five since the  beginning of the year, and stood at R400 [rubles] in March, as  compared to R80 in January. The price of beef increased by a  factor of 2.5 (R2,000 compared to R1,600 [sic]) and the price of  bread by a factor of 1.5 (R180 per loaf compared to R120).  During the first quarter the prices of certain food products in  the regular retail trade network and at markets were virtually  equal, as the cost of a one kilogram of sausage purchased from  the retail trade network increased by 58.5 percent (R5,195  compared to R3,278), and by 50 percent (R6,000 compared to  R4,000) at the collective farm market. The corresponding figures  for butter were 59.7 percent (R4,200, R2,630) and 26.7 percent  (R3,800, R3,000), for hard cheese -- 61.4 percent (R3,550,  R2,200) and 60.7 percent (R4,500, R2,800).    Due to a decline in stockpiles of vegetables in the regular  trade network and at markets there has been a fairly significant  increase in vegetable prices. For example, the price of one  kilogram of cabbage increased by a factor of 1.7 in the regular  trade network (R300, R180) and by a factor of 2.2. at kolkhoz  markets (R1,000, R450). The corresponding price increase for  onions was by 25.4 percent (R627, R500) and by 44.4 percent  (R1,300, R900).    As a result of significant infusions of sugar, vegetable oil  and eggs into the republic's trade network the prices of these  items at kolkhoz markets have begun to drop. Since the beginning  of the year the price of vegetable oil has come down by 16.7  percent (R1,000 per kilogram, as compared to R1,200), the price  of sugar has dropped by 14.3 percent (R600, R700), and chicken  eggs are now 25 percent cheaper (R900 for 10 eggs, as compared  to R1,200).    As of 29 March 1994 the prices of basic food products  remained quite high in the capitals of republics, krays and  oblasts in the Northern Caucasus, as is clear from the following  figures (all prices are in rubles per kilogram or liter):    Item          Nalchik    Krasnodar    Stavropol    Rostov-on-Don    Makhachkala    Vladikavkaz    Cherkessk    Maykop   Regular Trade Network   Beef          2,000      2,014        2,200        1,814            2,200          2,500          2,700        1,778   Pork          2,475      2,071        2,800        1,817            ---            2,200          ---          2,040   Chicken       3,105      2,011        3,080        2,867            3,000          3,700          2,648        2,170   Sausage,      5,195      4,991        4,370        4,448            4,315          4,350          4,985        4,385  first  quality   Butter        4,950      3,738        4,000        3,830            4,013          3,600          4,322        3,872   Vegetable     779        780          870          794              1,250          1,100          1,062        977  oil   Margarine     2,000      1,660        2,000        1,750            1,867          2,467          2,034        1,686   Milk          400        520          400          476              555            150            550          481   High-fat      240        557          484          524              573            290            580          486  yogurt   Sour cream    2,600      1,741        1,990        1,845            2,578          1,525          2,000        2,187   Chicken       885        746          810          864              1,200          983            830          847  eggs, 10   Granulated    651        556          580          594              700            683            625          609  sugar   Salt          98         78           200          126              175            150            200          40   Bread,        240        313          333          288              366            60             347          338  first and  second  quality   Vodka         3,280      4,350        5,080        3,653            4,747          1,790          4,150        4,397   Potatoes      260        208          220          260              400            275            193          218   Kolkhoz Markets   Beef          2,500      2,800        3,800        3,000            2,700          2,500          2,750        2,600   Pork          2,800      3,000        4,000        3,500            ---            2,500          3,700        3,000   Chicken       5,333      3,100        4,000        3,500            4,500          5,500          4,000        3,500   Vegetable     1,000      800          900          700              1,500          1,200          1,000        700  oil   Milk          833        450          330          500              800            700            500          330   Sour cream    4,000      4,000        2,700        3,000            5,000          3,300          ---          3,000   Curds         1,500      1,500        1,000        1,500            2,500          ---            ---          1,500   Eggs          900        700          900          800              1,000          917            800          900   Potatoes      400        250          250          250              400            350            225          250   Cabbage       1,000      800          800          700              850            467            700          800   Onions        1,300      1,800        1,300        1,300            1,500          1,800          1,600        1,800   Carrots       1,000      1,200        1,000        800              1,300          1,250          1,250        1,000   Apples        800        800          750          800              1,000          1,000          1,160        1,000</p>

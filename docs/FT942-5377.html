			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (7): Your savings in their hands - Bethan Hutton stages an identity parade for famous names Do you know who is looking after your money? By buying shares in an investment trust, you are in effect handing over your savings to the managers of a trust, hoping they will invest wisely on your behalf. But many investors have a very hazy idea of who the real people are behind the name on the share certificate. It is not always obvious from the name of a trust what it is and who actually manages it. The Bankers trust is an international generalist run by Henderson Touche Remnant, as are both Law Debenture and Witan - but who could have guessed? Some management groups, like Edinburgh Fund Managers, are gradually changing the names of their funds to present a unified 'brand image' and increase awareness of the group behind the funds; but others are reluctant to sacrifice names which can be a century or more old, and often pre-date the management company. Investment trust management is a small but diverse segment of the fund management industry. The biggest three investment trust management groups are Henderson Touche Remnant, with Pounds 3,680m under management, Fleming with Pounds 3,659m, and Foreign &amp; Colonial with Pounds 3,455m. At the opposite end of the scale, there are also a dozen or two groups with less than Pounds 50m of investment trust money under management, though for many of them investment trusts are a sideline to their main insurance, pension fund or unit trust business. The large players, like HTR and Fleming, tend to have broad ranges of funds, with general UK and international funds at their core, supplemented by portfolios of small specialist trusts. Smaller groups often concentrate their resources on a particular segment of the market, such as smaller companies, or the Far East. Niche players are often the result of one experienced manager or small team breaking away from well-known houses to follow their own ideas. One example is Scottish Value Management, set up by former Templeton and Scottish Provident manager Colin McLean in 1990, which specialises in investing in other investment trusts, and seeking hidden value in other companies. As might be expected, many investment trust groups have solid roots in the City of London. But it is a matter for dispute whether the Scots or the English invented investment trusts, and the predominance of Scottish accents is still noticeable in the industry in modern times. Perhaps a third of investment trust assets are managed north of the border, by groups like Abtrust, Baillie Gifford, Dunedin, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Ivory &amp; Sime, Martin Currie, Murray Johnstone, and Templeton - but even the London-based groups recruit plenty of managers from Scotland. Charlotte Square, the Georgian square at the heart of Edinburgh's business and financial district, used to be the hub of the investment trust world, as it housed many of the large Scottish fund management groups. People used to talk of the investment community as the 'Charlotte Square mafia', but that has now been largely disbanded. Many of the companies have moved out to shiny new headquarters elsewhere in Edinburgh, while others are based in less traditional Scottish financial centres like Glasgow and Aberdeen. Ivory &amp; Sime is one of the few old stalwarts remaining, at One Charlotte Square. In the US, some fund managers are high-profile personalities who can draw investors to a fund with their name alone. UK investment trusts are anonymous by comparison, with few names or faces recognisable by the general investing public. Most funds are run by teams, often composed of one experienced manager backed up by a number of bright young things trying to make their mark. However, a few personalities do stand out, particularly at the more exotic end of the market. One such is Dr Mark Mobius, the peripatetic American who is the driving force behind Templeton Emerging Markets. He is constantly on the move, visiting and buying shares in obscure parts of the world almost before anyone else has even realised the country has a stock market. He has been called the Indiana Jones of the investment world, and descriptions of him invariably include the word 'guru'. His striking appearance - small, tanned and bald - helps make him a memorable figure. But the real test in the investment world is the performance of your funds - and Mobius qualifies as a force to be reckoned with on that score too. Another home-grown personality hit the headlines last year, when his brainchild for a time became the largest UK investment trust ever launched - Julian Baring's Mercury World Mining trust. Baring has spent his career analysing and investing in commodity and mining stocks, making his reputation with his management of the Mercury Gold &amp; General unit trust. Last year, his persuasive powers were strong enough to attract Pounds 425 to a fund which under normal circumstances would have been lucky to go much over Pounds 50m. Other managers with a strong following include Anthony Bolton, who manages Fidelity European values, and Ed Merner of Schroders, who is about to be launched on the investment trust world with the new Schroder Japanese fund, after making his name with unit trusts. Like those of any other stock market sector, the ups and downs and intrigues of the investment trust sector are monitored by analysts employed by the large stockbroking firms. The select few who follow investment trusts at Smith New Court, SG Warburg, NatWest and Credit Lyonnais Laing produce regular reports and statistical analysis, intended mainly for institutional investors, though some of their research is also available to private investors. SG Warburg, for example, produces an annual private investor guide with clear explanations for the novice investor, while Credit Lyonnais Laing's yearly manual is a very comprehensive reference work with detailed background information on the trusts and their managers. The NatWest annual, written by Robin Angus and Hamish Buchan, can be an entertaining read as well as a source of useful information.</p>

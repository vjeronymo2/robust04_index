			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS OUT FRONT ON QUAKE-SAFE BRIDGES;  </P> <P> SEISMIC SAFETY: SHAKEN BY THE COLLAPSE OF ROADWAYS IN THE BAY AREA QUAKE, IT  HAS UNDERTAKEN AN UNPARALLELED RETROFITTING PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Jim Roberts, a gruff-talking engineer who is happiest poring over bridge  designs and calculating stress and load factors, has been thrust by the Loma  Prieta earthquake into the unlikely role of an international celebrity.  </P> <P> Since the Oct. 17, 1989, collapse of the upper deck of Oakland's Nimitz  Freeway, engineers and seismic experts from Soviet Armenia, Japan, France,  Italy, Australia and New Zealand have made pilgrimages to California to trade  information with Roberts and his engineering team in the structures division of  the California Department of Transportation on their favorite topic -- seismic  retrofitting of highway bridges.  </P> <P> An appreciation of the subject may elude most people, but in earthquake  engineering circles California offers the latest in the design of seismic  safety devices for existing bridges.  </P> <P> In the year since the Loma Prieta temblor showed California that its bridges  were not earthquake-proof, Caltrans has embarked on a seismic safety program  for bridges unparalleled in the world.  </P> <P> Shaken out of what officials admit was complacency, state officials have  approved more than $50 million for seismic bridge projects -- roughly the same  amount they spent on seismic safety in the previous 17 years. The Legislature  has demanded that every bridge, freeway connector, overpass or other type of  elevated road structure in California be examined for earthquake vulnerability.  It has mandated that any roadway deemed a possible earthquake risk be placed on  a priority list for seismic retrofitting and that all of it be completed by  1994.  </P> <P> So far, Caltrans has identified 6,862 state bridges as potential candidates for  seismic retrofitting. Officials believe that further analysis will pare down  the list to about 4,800. Another 6,792 locally maintained bridges are expected  to be added to the retrofit program. Before it is over, officials estimate that  the retrofitting may cost between $1 billion and $2 billion, a far cry from  their original guesses of between $300 million and $500 million.  </P> <P> "We're in a mandated crash program and right in the middle of that mandated  crash program we are developing, experimenting with, learning and applying  stuff that hasn't been done any place in the world," said Caltrans Director  Robert K. Best. "We're doing things here in California during the last year  that have never been done any place in terms of earthquake research and  evaluation."  </P> <P> In the 15 seconds that the Loma Prieta earthquake shook Northern California, it  did more to change Caltrans than any single event. The collapse of a milelong  stretch of the Cypress viaduct section of the Nimitz killed 42 people and  exposed critical flaws in a seismic retrofitting program that had been  considered a national model.  </P> <P> George Housner, a retired Caltech professor who headed a board of inquiry  appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to investigate the collapse, said the  disaster showed that seismic retrofitting could no longer be treated as an  afterthought in the transportation budget-making process or permitted to  proceed at a snail's pace. Nor, he said, could engineers use past experience as  their sole guide for designing seismic protections for bridges.  </P> <P> "If you put it (the Nimitz collapse) in the context of the total deaths and  injuries that occurred in transportation-related accidents in California every  year, it looks pretty small," said Best. "But it's a single, very spectacular  event and because of that it has created a dedication both with the department  and with the policy-makers of state government that we're going to make damn  sure it doesn't happen again."  </P> <P> From its inception 17 years ago, the retrofitting program has been driven by  earthquakes. Each time a temblor strikes California and cripples highway  bridges, engineers rush in to assess the cause of the damage and develop  techniques for strengthening similar structures.  </P> <P> After the 1971 Sylmar quake collapsed part of the I-5 and I-210 interchange,  Caltrans launched a retrofitting program of reinforcing bridge spans by tying  roadway sections together and mooring them to support columns to prevent  slipping during intense shaking. After the October, 1987, Whittier quake,  Caltrans turned its attention to the columns that support bridge decks and  began designing ways that they could be buttressed to prevent crumbling under  extraordinary stress.  </P> <P> The two quakes together only caused two highway deaths, and seismic  retrofitting took a back seat to other road programs in the budget-making  process.  </P> <P> "When the 1971 and the 1987 quakes occurred there was tremendous focus and  rhetoric and a lot of promises immediately after the quakes, but as time went  on seismic upgrading became less and less of a priority," said Assembly  Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar).  </P> <P> Housner credits Roberts' engineers for always being "willing to do a good job,"  but said that in the past they were often "cut back because somebody else felt  they had more urgent need for the money."  </P> <P> Then came the Loma Prieta earthquake and the death toll was not two but 44, the  Bay Area highway damage not a few million but nearly $1 billion. Within weeks,  the Legislature elevated the seismic retrofitting program to top priority in  the department.  </P> <P> "As of right now, the environment has changed definitely because we now have a  law that essentially says earthquake retrofit is the No. 1 priority for the  expenditure of funds in the state," said Best.  </P> <P> Housner said the new funding priority forced the department practically  overnight to change its fundamental mind-set. Expanding highway capacity became  secondary to ensuring the safety of those that existed.  </P> <P> "California has always been sort of a leader in earthquake engineering but  Caltrans has just sort of put the blinders on," said Housner. "(Caltrans) had  such a big building program they were turning out a bridge a day for years.  Their main thought was how to build bridges efficiently and rapidly.  Retrofitting was a low priority."  </P> <P> After Housner's committee issued its recommendations it was determined that  Caltrans would not only have to develop techniques to protect bridges from the  type of damage created by the Loma Prieta quake, but it would have to predict  what might happen to bridges in future quakes.  </P> <P> With supercomputers and new techniques, Best said, the department could  simulate different kinds of quakes and determine how individual structures  would react to them.  </P> <P> "Now that's a tremendous advancement away from the days of saying, 'Well, we  saw this happen, now how can we stop that from recurring?' to sitting back and  predicting things that we've never seen before and then designing ways to stop  them from happening," Best said.  </P> <P> He said the department is aiming at a retrofitting standard that would set the  survival probability at 99.99%.  </P> <P> "You talk about change," Best said. "We are so far ahead of almost everybody  else in terms of seismic design and retrofitting of transportation structures  that there is nobody to turn to. We're just developing everything as we're  going along."  </P> <P> Before the quake the department retrofit program employed just a few engineers  and contractors; now at least 500 people work in one aspect or another of  seismic retrofitting. Because of the retrofitting and accelerated highway  construction programs, each year Caltrans is recruiting and hiring one-third of  all civil engineering graduates in the United States.  </P> <P> To assist in the development of techniques for retrofitting bridges, it has  awarded nearly $8 million in research contracts in the last year to the  University of California campuses at Irvine, San Diego, Berkeley and Davis;  USC, the University of Nevada at Reno and two private consulting firms.  </P> <P> "One thing I think will make a big difference in the future is that they now  are appointing some earthquake advisory committees that include outside  experts," said Housner. "Before they were sort of inbred. They were not asking  for any comments from outside so they fell behind on some of the earthquake  engineering part of it."  </P> <P> California's crash program is not without its potential aftershocks. State  government has only begun to pay the bill for the massive retrofitting  projects. The engineering and design work of the early months was relatively  inexpensive; the real costs will come in a few years when some of the bigger  projects get under way.  </P> <P> "As you go on you start spending more and more money. That will be the test.  Whether in a couple of years from now as the bills begin to mount it is still a  crash program, full speed ahead, costs be damned, or whether the program is  leveled out and those funds are distributed over more years," Best said.  </P> <P> Initially, $80 million from a temporary quarter-cent sales tax was earmarked  for bridge retrofitting. The state Department of Finance has indicated that  another $300 million from the special sales tax may also be slated for  earthquake retrofit work. The Federal Highway Administration has made funds  available for the replacement of structures damaged or destroyed by the quake  but has ruled that other retrofit programs are not eligible for federal  disaster relief funds.  </P> <P> Once the initial funding is used up, Katz said, the department will have to  begin using money from a gasoline tax increase that was approved by voters in  June. Although it was originally determined that some revenue from the tax  increase would be used for seismic work, it was never contemplated that the  "final price tag" would be over $1 billion, Katz said.  </P> <P> Katz recently held a legislative hearing to examine the costs of the  retrofitting program. He said the purpose of the hearing was twofold. He wanted  to put Caltrans on notice that lawmakers were not going to back off from their  decision to make seismic retrofitting the agency's top priority. At the same  time, he said, he wanted it known that they would be watching expenditures.  </P> <P> "Part of our purpose was to let Caltrans know we're not going away," said Katz.  "The commitment I made was that seismic retrofitting is going to be high  priority. I will honor that commitment even if it means some new project for  new capacity is delayed. We have an obligation to make the existing roadways  safe before we build new roadways."  </P></p>

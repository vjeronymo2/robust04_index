			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Minor parties may be crucial to Major THE position of even the most pro-European of the minor parties at Westminster appeared to be hardening against the government yesterday, as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Mr John Major of undermining the case for Europe. The Liberal Democrats exemplify the dilemma for many of the minor parties, whose votes could prove crucial if the Tory rebellion is maintained. They broadly support the Maastricht treaty and bill, but would oppose the government if the issue is one of confidence. If the motion itself is bland and technical, then the way the government presents it in the run-up to the debate could have a critical impact on how the smaller parties behave in the vote. The Liberal Democrat MPs will discuss today how they intend to vote next week. Though all 20 MPs would sign up to voting against the government, the sole Liberal Democrat Euro-sceptic, Mr Nick Harvey, might abstain if the official decision were to vote in favour of Maastricht. Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist spokesman on European affairs, said yesterday that the party's nine MPs would vote against Maastricht even if it meant bringing down the government or the prime minister. The Unionists' abstention in last week's debate on pit closures helped the government's majority into double figures, but Mr Taylor said that if the government went ahead with the Maastricht bill there was 'no question' of another abstention by Ulster Unionists. The three Democratic Unionist MPs, led by Mr Ian Paisley, are also likely to vote against Maastricht. For the three nationalist, and pro-European, parties, the dilemma is similar to that for the Liberal Democrats. Between them they have 11 MPs, though the four Social Democratic and Labour party representatives do not invariably attend even close-run votes. There was some cheer for Mr Major, however, from Sir James Kilfedder, the sole Popular Unionist MP. His supportive intervention in the Commons yesterday afternoon, in which he talked of the prime minister's 'brave deter-mination . . . to put the UK at the heart of Europe', has heightened expectations that he would vote with the government next week.</p>

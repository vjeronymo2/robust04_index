			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HE WISHES THE NAME WOULD CHANGE TO PROTECT HIS PLAYING STYLE;  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON: AARON WILHITE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A 'FULL-COURT' PLAYER, BUT  HE'S INTRODUCED AS TITANS' STARTING CENTER.  </P> <P> Being introduced by the public address announcer, strutting onto the court and  slapping high-fives with teammates is an exhilarating experience for most  basketball players, one of the perks of being a starter.  </P> <P> But as much as Aaron Wilhite enjoys starting for Cal State Fullerton, he can't  help but cringe sometimes when he is introduced in the Titans' lineup.  </P> <P>  At center, a 6-foot-7 sophomore from San Diego, No. 32, Aaron Wilhite!  </P> <P>  It's not that Wilhite is shy or uncomfortable being the center of attention.  He just dislikes being called a center.  </P> <P> "I've always had a picture of a center being a 6-10 clumsy guy who only posts  up," said Wilhite, Fullerton's leading rebounder (7.6 a game) and  second-leading scorer (12.9 points) entering Saturday's game against Colorado  State at 1 p.m. in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> "The stereotype of big men is they don't get the ball on the fast break and  they don't take outside shots. I'm more of a full-court player."  </P> <P> Wilhite played all over the court at San Diego's Lincoln High School, where he  averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds as a swingman in 1988-89 and was the San  Diego Section 2-A player of the year. Wilhite shot from the outside, filled  lanes on the fast break and posted up occasionally in three seasons as a  varsity starter.  </P> <P> But he has since become more of a full-figured player at Fullerton, growing one  inch but gaining about 25 pounds since high school. "I grew out," the  240-pounder says.  </P> <P> And in Titan Coach John Sneed's run-by-numbers offense (1=point guard,  2=shooting guard, 3=small forward, 4=power forward, 5=center), Wilhite --  though he doesn't fit the mold of a prototype center -- fits best in the No. 5  position.  </P> <P> Whether he likes it or not.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me that much because the No. 4 and 5 positions are basically  the same," Wilhite said. "I just don't like being introduced as a center. I've  never really played it."  </P> <P> But if it means helping the team and starting, Wilhite will play it.  </P> <P> His game may be confined more to the inside than he likes, but Wilhite has  adapted well, scoring in double figures in all eight games for Fullerton. Not  surprisingly, his high game of 18 came against Mississippi Valley State, a  wide-open, run-and-gun affair won by the Titans, 109-100.  </P> <P> "I always figured because there were no special plays designed for me, if I  scored in double figures it would be a miracle," said Wilhite, who averaged 3.7  points a game last season. "That's one of the ultimate things I could do for  the team, but if I didn't do it, it wouldn't matter as long as I rebounded  well."  </P> <P> Wilhite's points have not come at the expense of rebounds, but many have come  because of rebounds. Of his 61 rebounds this season, 29 have come on the  offensive end.  </P> <P> "I was always taught in high school to go harder for offensive rebounds,  because those are points," said Wilhite, who set a San Diego Section high  school record with 39 rebounds in one game. "If you get two a quarter and get  two putbacks, that's four points a quarter. It's just natural to go harder for  offensive rebounds."  </P> <P> Many of Wilhite's early season points came on follow shots, but he has been  posting up more lately, scoring on inside jumpers. He has been one of the  Titans' most accurate shooters, making 36 of 68 field-goal attempts for a .529  percentage.  </P> <P> "That Mississippi Valley State game was the first time I've seen Aaron get  vocal on the block and call for the ball," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said.  "His confidence has come from age, maturity and hard work. His nickname is  A-train, but I call him a plow-horse. He's a tireless worker."  </P> <P> Wilhite has had to work hard making the adjustment to center, a position he was  unaccustomed to playing and surprised to be playing last season.  </P> <P> "When I got to Fullerton, my game changed," Wilhite said. "They put me on the  block and I had to learn how to play low-post. I was more of a perimeter player  in high school, but now I'm lucky if I shoot from 10 feet out."  </P> <P> Wilhite said he didn't like playing in Sneed's system last season. Although  Wilhite's media-guide biography credits high school coach Ron Loneski for  "being one of the biggest influences" on his career, Loneski may have been  partly responsible for Wilhite's rocky transition to college.  </P> <P> "What messed me up is he said I was a 6-8 center when I was only a 6-6  forward," Wilhite said. "A lot of schools recruited me as a center and I think  Sneed had this picture in his head of a post-up guy. He put me in that position  and we worked from there."  </P> <P> Wilhite says it would be impossible for him to make the NBA as a center, so  playing the position at Fullerton won't enhance his professional prospects. But  Wilhite says he has no intentions of transferring to a school that would allow  him to play another position.  </P> <P> The business management major says he likes Fullerton and had a 3.1 grade-point  average his freshman year. Besides, he realizes the NBA is a longshot -- a lot  longer than most of his shots.  </P> <P> "I'm comfortable where I am so I'll just go with the flow," Wilhite said. "I  don't even think about the pros. I'm here to get an education and get something  started for myself. I just want to succeed in life."  </P></p>

Including 27  ministers (compared with 22 in the previous government), 60  percent of them are drawn from the Frobedu [Burundi Democratic  Front], the president's party. The remaining 40 percent come  from the opposition, principally the Uprona [Unity for National  Progress] and a newcomer, the new Liberal Party. This formula  had already been adopted by the late President Ndadaye.    Jean Ngendanganya, Burundian ambassador in Brussels,  welcomed  this re-establishment of democratic institutions and appealed to  public opinion, friendly governments, and non-governmental  organizations to help the new government team to rebuild the  country, deeply marked by recent events. "We have 800,000  refugees to be repatriated, and just as many displaced persons  who we must help to return to their homes," he stated, adding  that -- for greater efficiency -- this government "is mainly  composed of technicians. These qualities took precedence in  selecting the future ministers, more than their position in the  party hierarchy. It is also clear that the services of those who  took part in the attacks were not retained."</p>

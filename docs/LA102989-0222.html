			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 HURT AS MOTORCYCLE CRASHES AT HIGH SPEED IN COSTA MESA  </P> <P> Jose Guillermo Olmedo Rojas, 22, bought his powerful motorcycle just a week  ago. He was proud of the bike and so, when he met 18-year-old Camille Jones at  a party in Costa Mesa on Friday night, he suggested a spin.  </P> <P> The pair hadn't driven too far when Olmedo, traveling at more than 60 m.p.h.,  lost control of his Suzuki 1100 on a curving stretch of Iowa Street and plowed  into two parked cars, said investigator Steve Rautus of the Costa Mesa Police  Department.  </P> <P> Olmedo, who was wearing a helmet, suffered a mangled right leg when he slammed  into the cars and then became entangled in the rear wheel of the motorcycle,  Rautus said. In addition, he suffered a broken right arm and nerve and tendon  damage to the arm. Jones, who was not wearing a helmet, was thrown from the  bike. She suffered a concussion and scrapes.  </P> <P> Olmedo, of Costa Mesa, and Jones, of Coto de Caza, were in stable condition  Saturday at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "The passenger is alive by the grace of God," said Rautus, who had just  returned from visiting Jones and Olmedo at the hospital. "She has a scrape on  her shoulder, but not even a mark on her face."  </P> <P> Rautus said Jones told police she met Olmedo at a friend's party.  </P> <P> "He had just gotten the motorcycle," Rautus said. "He was a friend of one of  (Jones') friends, so she decided to go for a ride with him on the motorcycle."  </P> <P> High speed was the apparent cause of the crash, which is still under  investigation, Rautus said. Olmedo, who carried a valid driver's license but  had no motorcycle validation, was not ticketed.  </P> <P> "We have established that he was traveling in excess of 60 m.p.h. in a  25-m.p.h. residential zone," Rautus said. "Traffic was light and alcohol was  not a factor."  </P> <P> No other drivers were involved in the crash, which occurred near New Hampshire  Drive.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement, by Peter Toth; place and date not  given: "We Do Not Want To Be `Diluted'"]    [Text] [Toth] In the Tuesday (28 December 1993) issue of  SLOVENSKY DENNIK, Arpad Matejka, government commissioner for the  new territorial and administrative arrangement, said that it was  impossible to grant collective rights to the Hungarian ethnic  minority and to establish ethnic borders in Slovakia. How do  you evaluate his statements?    [Bugar] Who is talking here about ethnic borders? Who wants  to establish ethnic borders? Ethnic borders cannot be  established in Slovakia, because southern Slovakia is ethnically  mixed, inhabited by both Slovaks and Hungarians. What we want  to prevent is a further artificial "dilution" of these areas, so  that the districts of Dunajska Streda and Komarno are not  "tagged" as purely Slovak districts. In this way, the higher  territorial entities would be "diluted" in such a way that the  Hungarian minority would everywhere constitute fewer than 20  percent of the population.    [Toth] There is no doubt that within the Hungarian minority  there exists a minority that would welcome ethnic borders. Is  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] prepared to  eliminate this factor?    [Bugar] If such people exist at all, they are only  individuals. It is not a minority or a group, but only  individuals who could imagine a different territorial and  administrative division and, perhaps, also a completely  different government and, maybe, also a different state. There  will always be such individuals. What counts, however, is the  political will of parliamentary parties. What count are the  intentions of representatives of the Hungarian minority, be they  politicians or representatives of Csemadok [Hungarian minority's  cultural organization] or the Union of Hungarian Pedagogues in  Slovakia. So far, I have not encountered anywhere the intention  to secede from Slovakia or to create a purely Hungarian region.    [Toth] Coexistence Chairman Miklos Duray has said on several  occasions, between the lines [medzi recou], that his aim was  territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority. He is an  individual, but a leader of your coalition partner....    [Bugar] If Mr. Duray understands as "territorial autonomy"  the rights that, according to the new territorial and  administrative division, will fall due to the other regions,  regardless of whether these regions are Slovak or mixed,  everything is okay. These are self-administered areas with  certain powers. But if he understands by this term territorial  autonomy such as exists in South Tyrol, it is a waste of time to  speak about it because we know that the political will for this  is lacking, both on the Slovak side and on the part of various  European institutions (such as, for example, the Council of  Europe). The draft principles of the law on the position of  ethnic minorities, as signed by both the MKDH and Coexistence  deputies, speaks about transferring jurisdiction over education  and culture to the regions. If someone speaks about something  else, it is only his personal view, even if it is Mr. Duray  himself.</p>

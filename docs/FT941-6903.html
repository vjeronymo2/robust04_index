			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Japan sets its face against further boost to economy Japan's finance minister, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, yesterday dismissed suggestions that his country should do more to stimulate its economy, saying there were no further plans to boost domstic demand. On his return from a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries near Frankfurt, Mr Fujii said: 'We are not contemplating additional fiscal steps, because the package we just announced was very large.' The Japanese delegation insisted that the more than Y15 trillion (Pounds 95bn) package would accelerate reduction of the trade surplus. But other G7 members said Japan had yet to prove its commitment to strengthening demand. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'What Japan has done is not sufficient to get the kind of growth in demand that would have a serious effect on their budget.' Other finance ministers stressed that dealings between the US and Japan were amicable, but that no progress was made on their trade dispute. The ministers also avoided discussion on currency co-operation, agreeing that exchange rates must not be used to cut Japan's huge trade surplus. 'I expressed concern that any precipitous yen appreciation would undermine the effects of Japan's efforts to expand domestic demand,' said Mr Fujii immediately after the meeting, which went out of its way to soothe market fears of rising interest rates. Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor, was puzzled by the recent bond market shake-out, which he thought was 'possibly an over-correction. . . . On the evidence we have heard today, a possible repeat of 1987 is exaggerated,' he added. 'I cannot see any grounds for thinking the stability we have achieved is at risk.' Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said 'mistaken assessments' had given rise to fears that US inflation was on the way up. But these concerns would not last, and markets would soon calm down from their recent 'over-reaction'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said the news from continental Europe was significantly more encouraging than it had been at previous recent meetings, with no danger of the recoveries faltering. However, Mr Bentsen reiterated his call for European countries, in particular Germany, to lower interest rates more rapidly. 'Given the progress Europe has made on inflation, we believe the authorities should take advantage of any opportunities to reduce rates further,' he said. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister and chairman of the G7 meeting, repeated official forecasts that the German economy was on track for 1.5 per cent growth this year. French representatives had said they expected a further growth spurt in the second half of this year.</p>

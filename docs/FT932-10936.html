			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Cheltenham to take over Heart of England CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday disclosed that it will take over the marginally profitable Heart of England Building Society following the collapse in March of an attempt to do so by the Bank of Edinburgh. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said the proposed merger was 'not a rescue'. It had assessed Heart of England's mortgage book and assets closely following a problematical merger with the Portsmouth Building Society in 1991. 'We have said before that we're not in the rescue business, and this is not a rescue,' he said. Heart of England was a 'middle England society with a middle of the road mortgage book quite unlike the Portsmouth', he added. C&amp;G's pre-tax profit for 1992 fell 29 per cent after making Pounds 211m provisions against bad and doubtful debts, which included Pounds 90m against loans inherited from the Portsmouth, a society with a poor mortgage book. C&amp;G, the sixth largest society with assets of Pounds 16bn, indicated that it may close 12 of Heart of England's 50 branches which overlap with its own. Heart of England members will vote on the proposal on June 8. The society said that because its reserve to assets ratio of 4.54 per cent was higher than Heart of England's 4.22 per cent, it would not pay a bonus. Heart of England members would earn extra interest, and get a discount on new mortgages. Heart of England, based in Warwick, had assets at February 28 of Pounds 1bn, and pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 1.6m.</p>

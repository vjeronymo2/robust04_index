			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Rising costs undermine profitability of unit trusts HALF of all unit trust companies earned marginal profits or made losses in 1991, mainly reflecting spiralling costs of sales and distribution, according to a survey. Mr Derek Ross, partner at Touche Ross Management Consultants, said the firm's latest industry survey showed that there was still significant over-capacity in the sector and that consolidation was likely. 'The main point is rationalisation,' he said. 'There are too many unit trusts.' Recent figures from the Unit Trust Association, the industry trade association, show that last year the number of unit holder accounts, at 4.46m, was the lowest since 1987. The number of trusts, at 1,400, was also marginally below the peak. There were 157 separate unit trust companies, compared with 139 in 1987, the peak year for net new investment, according to the UTA. The study shows that most unit trust companies made losses on the sales side of their businesses, but many were able to recoup through operating charges on ongoing business. Larger companies showed little benefit from economies of scale, because cost savings on sales were eaten up by the higher commissions and fee discounting they were forced to offer to remain competitive. The study concludes: 'Despite the scale cost advantages that large companies enjoy, they do not appear to have converted them into a significant lead in staff efficiency when compared with their smaller rivals.' Mr Ross said Touche Ross had reviewed the three main sales channels - independent financial advisers, direct sales and group sales forces - and found that none was profitable. Of the three channels, independent financial advisers accounted for nearly 60 per cent of all sales. Group sales forces, which accounted for 19.3 per cent of all sales, incurred the highest commission costs and paid the highest rebates of fees to unit holders.

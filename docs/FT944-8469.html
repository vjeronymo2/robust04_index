			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: From small fiddles to big abuses - The puzzle is that Spanish practices have survived the Big Bang Old Spanish practices, they are called, although they are not always old and certainly are not confined to Spain. In the financial markets, corner-cutting and kickbacks can be found almost wherever there are money-making relationships and a lack of transparency. Are such practices seriously corrupt, or do they represent a necessary oiling of the markets' wheels? Two examples have been highlighted in London this week. The City's biggest fund manager, Mercury Asset Management, has decided to abandon so-called soft commissions - a payment device whereby part of the commission on share trades is rebated to a fund manager in the form of services or benefits of various kinds. MAM says it is responding to market pressure to move towards 'clean' fees. It is not the first manager to make such a declaration, but it is in a minority. Separately, the Office of Fair Trading has published a provocative paper by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School on the cosy system by which UK rights issues have for many years been underwritten. The deals are syndicated to numerous sub-underwriters - essentially, the medium to large investment institutions - at prices which have consistently earned the fortunate recipients juicy profits (described more neutrally by the professor as 'excess returns'). Both of these practices hark back to the cosier days of the stock exchange when share commissions were fixed and competition was less intense. Soft commissions gained popularity in London mainly as a way around the fixed commission scale, so that institutions could get extra value from the business they did. Hoare Govett's DataStream electronic information system and Wood Mackenzie's performance measurement service for pension funds - both usually 'softed' in those days - were examples of innovation by brokers. Sub-underwriting commissions were altogether murkier at that time and, essentially, helped to finance the marketing muscle of the big new-issue brokers. Reliable fund managers - those who would accept the dud issues as well as the winners - were rewarded with a regular stream of almost risk-free underwriting commissions. The puzzle is that such practices have largely survived London's Big Bang eight years ago. Fixed commissions were swept away and the big global investment banks moved in. The trouble is that the winds of change were not always unpolluted. Soft commissions, for instance, are rife in many markets around the world, not least in the US where the Securities and Exchange Commission has been surprisingly relaxed about them, although imposing various conditions. Britain's own Securities and Investments Board has been reluctant to be tougher than the SEC. Interestingly, institutions such as MAM appear to be moving ahead of the regulators. Not everything about soft commissions is bad. They enable small brokers to compete against big ones and they provide a channel for innovative products and independent research services. But fund managers are also tempted to charge what ought to be their own expenses against the fund. The client, in effect, pays twice - and could be trading shares at the wrong prices, too. Although resistance to soft commissions is becoming apparent in pension fund management, where the clients are professional (or at least receive professional advice), there is little opposition in, say, retail unit trusts where the turnover of portfolios is often much higher than can be justified by the quest for investment performance. Do the managers have a vested interest in such churning? Presumably they do, and soft commissions may be a factor. Meanwhile, Marsh's report has touched raw nerves in the City of London. Not just merchant banks and brokers but also institutional investors have protested - an indication that the private investor has been the real loser from being left out of the cosy sub-underwriting ring. Of course, private investors count for little in the UK, where they only own about 20 per cent of company shares. They are much more important in the US, where the institutions are much more numerous and diversified, too. There, the emphasis is on syndicating securities through a vast distribution network. It is fairer but also considerably more expensive, which is a reason why British companies may have tolerated the sub-underwriting system in London. London's institutional investors, for their part, have clung on to the sub-underwriting system not primarily because they are greedy but because they have seen it as a way of protecting the principle of pre-emptive rights of shareholders. This has largely gone by the board in the US, where the big investment banks call the shots. In the UK, however, existing shareholders normally still have first call on new shares, and cannot be diluted by company treasurers selling new equity at a discount through the voracious distribution chains of investment banks. Pre-emption is certainly a principle worth defending. But the UK's institutional investors should surely be prepared to bid competitively for sub-underwriting contracts to show that big shareholders are not gaining an unfair advantage over small ones. Then, they would be supporting two principles at once. Markets are full of grey areas. If you scratch my back, perhaps I should be ready to scratch yours. Many people feel nostalgia for the old City markets where relationships counted for a lot and electronic auto-execution systems were unknown. But small fiddles have a capacity to grow into big abuses. And the fact is that oil for the wheels can turn into grease for the palms.</p>

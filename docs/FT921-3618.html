			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bank launches Dollars 750m of new paper BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of Italy's leading commercial banks, is launching its first Euro-depositary receipt programme, worth up to Dollars 750m, organised by Goldman Sachs International, writes Haig Simonian. Under the highly flexible deal, BCI's new paper can be issued in a variety of leading currencies and with maturities ranging from three months to 30 years. Moreover, the paper to be issued can be in either fixed or floating-rate form. The bank said the funds would be used to provide a consistent source of finance for its branch network, especially over medium to long-term maturities. BCI has issued certificates of deposit out of London and commercial paper from New York, but the deal marks its debut in borrowing of this type.</p>

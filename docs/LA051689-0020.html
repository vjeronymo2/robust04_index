			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION / MITCH POLIN;  </P> <P> WESTMONT'S NO-STARS REACH NAIA AREA BASEBALL PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> Westmont College Coach John Kirkgard wasn't too surprised when only two of the  players of his district-winning team were named to the National Assn. of  Intercollegiate Athletics All-District 3 baseball team.  </P> <P> He has become used to it.  </P> <P> "It's kind of surprising when you win the district and have only two players on  the team, but it's indicative of the balance on this team," Kirkgard said.  </P> <P> Kirkgard said his team doesn't usually have the individual talent to receive  much attention on postseason all-star teams. So, Kirkgard has to console  himself with team success.  </P> <P> The Warriors have been the hottest team among College Division schools in the  Southland since March 17, winning 25 of 27 games.  </P> <P> With three consecutive victories last week, the Warriors won their first  district tournament title in 23 years and advanced to the NAIA area playoffs  that start Thursday at Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> Westmont (33-14) will face Linfield of Oregon in its opening game, and  Hawaii-Hilo meets Whitworth in the other game of the four-team,  double-elimination tournament. The winner advances to the NAIA World Series  that starts May 26 at Lewis-Clark State in Idaho.  </P> <P> Kirkgard said the team is confident after recovering from an 8-12 start.  </P> <P> "If anything, losing motivated us," he said. "It's an indication of how hard  this team's work ethic has been."  </P> <P> Hard working or not, the coach said he couldn't have anticipated his team  winning 25 of its last 27 games.  </P> <P> "We anticipated that we had the opportunity to be district champion," Kirkgard  said. "I've been here six years and our expectations are always to do better  than the year before and we accomplished that. But I never expected to do it by  winning 25 of our last 27 games."  </P> <P> Westmont has four players batting at least .300. There are outfielder David  Heldoorn and shortstop Tim Kimmel at .321, catcher Jackie Schniepp at .302 and  third baseman Greg Loewen at .301.  </P> <P> However, Kirkgard is quick to add, "We are without a doubt a pitching and  defensive-oriented team."  </P> <P> The Warriors have an outstanding 3.28 team earned-run average and an  exceptional .965 fielding percentage.  </P> <P> "We don't beat ourselves with mistakes," Kirkgard said. "We don't walk anyone  to give a team extra chances."  </P> <P> Westmont's top player is Jeff Ludwig, a senior who was selected district player  of the year. He has a 10-3 record and 2.19 earned-run average, with eight  complete games in his last nine starts.  </P> <P> "He's the closest (to a star) as far as his numbers go," Kirkgard said. "But  he's really a fine example of the type of talent we have. He's a player who's  had to do a lot of hard work to get to this point. His work ethic got him to  where he is now."  </P> <P> Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has grown accustomed to winning California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. titles in just about every sport, except baseball.  </P> <P> Before this season, the Mustangs had never won a conference title in baseball.  In fact, the school's first and only appearance in the NCAA Division II  playoffs was in 1977, whenthe Mustangs were eliminated in two straight games.  </P> <P> But San Luis Obispo ended its frustration by winning the CCAA title last week  and will host the three-team Division II West Regional that starts Friday.  </P> <P> Third-ranked Cal State Sacramento (35-16) will play San Francisco State (31-20)  in the opening game of the double-elimination tournament at 2 p.m. Friday, and  the loser faces the sixth-ranked Mustangs (31-23) in the second game at 7 p.m.  Friday. The tournament continues Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest factor in San Luis Obispo's success this season has been  its pitching. The leaders are senior Greg Paxton, 9-2 with a 3.45 ERA and 7  complete games, and junior Dave Wilson, who is 6-5 with a 2.82 ERA and 118  strikeouts in 108 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> On offense the Mustangs have been paced by junior Rich Shepperd, batting .323  with seven home runs and 41 runs batted in. First baseman Pat Kirby (.317) and  outfielder Billy Smith (.305) are next in average, and shortstop Ron Crowe has  a team-leading 11 homers and 48 RBIs.  </P> <P> In perhaps a preview of the regionals last week, San Luis Obispo and Sacramento  split a two-game nonconference series last week in Sacramento. San Luis Obispo  won, 11-2, and Sacramento won, 5-3. However, the Mustangs didn't pitch Paxton  or Wilson in either game.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive season, Cal Lutheran and Cal State Bakersfield have  advanced to the national tournament in women's softball.  </P> <P> Bakersfield (35-22) will compete in the four-team NCAA Division II nationals  starting Friday at Cal State Sacramento, and Cal Lutheran plays in the 16-team  NAIA nationals starting Thursday at Emerson Park in Midland, Mich.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran will be trying to improve upon its performance in the nationals  last season, when the Regals were defeated in their first two games of the  double-elimination tournament.  </P> <P> The Regals, seeded No. 11 in the tournament with a 35-16 record, will meet  sixth-seeded Kearney State (28-14) of Nebraska on Thursday in their opening  game. West Florida is the top seed.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran, which won two straight games over Mesa State of Colorado in the  Bi-District playoffs last week to advance to the national tournament, has been  led by the pitching of junior DeeAndra Pilkington and sophomore Leslie Stevens.  </P> <P> Pilkington has an 18-4 record and 0.99 ERA, with five shutouts in her last six  games. She is also leading the team with a .413 batting average and 25 runs  batted in. Stevens has a 12-5 record and 1.15 ERA.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Bob Coons, coach of the cross-country and women's track teams at Cal State  Bakersfield for the last 13 years, has announced that he will resign at the end  of the season. Coons, the school's first and only head coach in women's track,  guided the Roadrunners to top five finishes in the NCAA Division II from  1981-83. . . . Brian Newhall, interim men's basketball coach at Occidental last  season, has been named full-time to the position. Newhall guided the Tigers to  a 15-10 record -- the team's best since 1980 -- and third place in the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference last season. . . . Mari Uchida,  who led Claremont-Mudd-Scripps to second place in the SCIAC and competed last  week in the NCAA Division III individual championships in singles, has been  named conference player of the year.  </P></p>

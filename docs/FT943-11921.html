			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Police put guard on 100 Jewish sites after bombings Britain introduced an around-the-clock armed police guard on more than 100 prominent Jewish sites yesterday after two bomb attacks in London heightened concerns about a global terrorist campaign. Extra security precautions were also being taken in several cities including Paris and New York. The UK measure, which included rigidly enforced parking restrictions, was aimed at preventing a repetition of an attack on Tuesday against the Israeli embassy and another early yesterday at the headquarters of a Jewish charity. Israel yesterday urged governments around the world to step up security. In London, Mr Yehuda Milo, deputy director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, accused the UK of having ignored requests for additional security after the July 18 bomb attack on the Jewish community building in Buenos Aires which killed at least 96 people. Mr Azriel Nevo, the Israeli military attache in London, described the second London bomb as a 'true blunder by local security forces'. The bombed building, headquarters of the Joint Israel Appeal, was temporarily without police protection. The London bombs, which caused injuries and property damage but no deaths, followed the signing in Washington of a co-operation agreement between Israel and Jordan. Israeli officials say extremist groups are attempting to disrupt the Middle East peace process. In Beirut yesterday, Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah denied any involvement in the Buenos Aires and London attacks. Similar denials were issued by Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, in Damascus. The Foreign Office last night said investigations into the attacks were 'at an early stage'. 'We do not have clear evidence as to who is responsible', an official said. Sir Paul Condon, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, warned of an unprecedented threat from radical Islamic terrorism. He said: 'The new dimension for us is the power and ferocity of the devices being put down and the total disregard of the terrorists involved for their own or anybody else's lives.' Israel's UN envoy Mr Gad Yaacobi last night said he expected the security council to 'declare all-out war' against terrorism after talks due tomorrow. Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina deputy foreign minister, said his country was 'seriously reconsidering our diplomatic relations' with Iran following the Buenos Aires bomb. Intelligence officials in Buenos Aires said an Argentine investigative magistrate had taken evidence in Caracas from a dissident Iranian diplomat which suggested that Tehran and possibly Syria offered logistical support to the terrorist attack. Mr Uzi Baram, Israel's tourism minister, attributed the bombings to Islamic fundamentalist groups bent on wrecking Middle East peace moves.

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 53% VOTE TO UNIONIZE MACK TRUCKS  </P> <P> A bitter 18-month effort by the United Auto Workers to organize the Mack Trucks  Inc. assembly plant ended with 53% of the employees voting to accept union  representation.  </P> <P> Mack Trucks said today it will contest Thursday's election, which the UAW won  with 453 votes to 398 for the company. An employee group, which offered to  represent workers, received two votes.  </P> <P> "It is totally on hold until it is settled," company spokeswoman Deb Woolley  said. "Mack is not finished fighting this battle."  </P> <P> Observers predicted the outcome of the election could affect the way business  is conducted in South Carolina, which historically has ranked among the least  unionized states. Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. moved quickly to assure business  owners and workers that "right-to-work" labor laws will not change in South  Carolina.  </P></p>

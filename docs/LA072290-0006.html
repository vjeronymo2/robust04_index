			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> It was with a heavy heart that I began the article on Linda and Dan Broderick,  "Till Murder Do Us Part," by Amy Wallace (June 3). Many others have missed the  mark, trying to rationalize Betty's actions.  </P> <P> But by the time I finished, I knew that Wallace had gotten it right. Betty  refused to get on with her life despite generous alimony and every conceivable  advantage. Larry Broderick is also right: It was cold-blooded murder.  </P> <P> The terror and havoc Betty caused were obvious at key times in Linda's and  Dan's lives, and yet they carried on with grace, good cheer and love for each  other.  </P> <P> Linda's devotion to Dan and the children in spite of Betty's horrible verbal  and physical attacks has left a lasting impression on those of us who had the  pleasure of knowing her. Linda had to have lived in great fear for herself and  Dan yet stayed with Dan to the end.  </P> <P> Two very special people are gone and four children's lives savagely altered  because of Betty's calculated vendetta. As a society, we have got to find a way  for spoiled people like Betty to get through a divorce short of destroying  their families.  </P> <P> JAMES A. ROBERTS  </P> <P> CHURCHILL, KAPLAN &amp; ROBERTS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Handled by two or more third parties. Each time custody of the property changes hands, the inventory will be annotated to show any overage, shortage, and damage found. In the case of pickup by a carrier from a NTS contractor, an exception sheet must be prepared and be acknowledged by the warehouse firm to reflect any changes in the condition of the goods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.189  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Payment to the claimant beyond the statutory limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When payment of the statutory limit is made on a claim determined to be meritorious in a greater amount after the application of individual and category maximum allowances, USARCS will apply amounts recovered from a carrier or contractor to compensate the claimant to the extent of the difference between the statutory limit and the amount that would have been paid but for the statutory limit. However, when an insurer has paid any portion of the value of the items involved, USARCS will apply the procedure in &sect;536.190(b). Any additional recovery monies available will be paid out under 536.190(b), if applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.190  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reimbursements to claimants and insurers from money received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USARCS is responsible for pursuing recovery on all claims paid under this subpart that involve payment of the statutory limit, increased released valuation purchased by the member, replacement cost protection, and/or private insurance. When forwarding these files to USARCS, the field office should identify them by writing in red on the front upper left corner of the file, ``IRV,'' ``RCP,'' or ``STATUTORY LIMIT.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Reimbursement to a claimant. Only USARCS may reimburse claimants on files which are required to be forwarded to USARCS for centralized recovery. In cases where a JA/claims attorney allowed payment of a claim before settling with private insurance, a command claims service, area claims office, or claims processing office with approval authority may always make a supplemental payment to a claimant when the claimant's private insurer paid more on an item than did the Government. If a claimant has not been fully compensated, he or she can receive a supplemental payment up to the adjudicated value of the claimant's loss under the following circumstances: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category maximum and the amount collected exceeds the amount paid on the claim, the claimant will be paid the adjudicated value to the extent that the amount recovered exceeds the amount paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the adjudicated value of the loss on an item exceeds an item or category maximum and the claimant has purchased increased valuation protection or other depreciated value coverage, the claimant will be paid up to the amount of the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the adjudicated value on that item or category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When the value of the loss on an item exceeds DA's payment and the claimant has purchased RCP, the claimant will be paid up to the amount of the additional coverage to the extent that this does not exceed the value determined for that item. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Reimbursement to insurers by USARCS only. When a claimant has purchased an insurance policy covering the shipmentor storage of property and the insurance company pays any portion of the value of items lost or damaged, the insurance company is entitled, to the extent of its payment, to reimbursement of a pro rata share of the amount recovered on such items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Reimbursement of recovery money to a carrier, warehouse or contractor. If a claims office or contracting office determines that recovery or offset against a carrier, contractor or warehouse was improper, the claims office will forward a request (with appropriate justification) to the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, USARCS, who will authorize a refund as necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.191  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Recovery action against a claimant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claimant is entitled to the benefit of any additional coverage purchased (such as private insurance, excess valuation, or RCP) on an item-by-item basis as described in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;50. If a claimant is compensated by a third party on an item and is also compensated by DA pursuant to this subpart, the claimant is entitled to retain only the portion of the payment that represents the total adjudicated value of the item, without regard to a limitation on payment due to application of a maximum allowance. If a claimant is compensated twice and the total exceeds the amount the claimant is entitled to retain, prompt action to recover the excess will be taken in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55m. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.192  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims arising from packing and containerization contract shipments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Field claims offices will process to completion recovery actions on all packing and containerization contract shipments against the delivering contractor unless private insurance is involved. (See &sect;536.190.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.193  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims caused by stevedoring contractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The ``Liability and Insurance'' clause used in stevedoring and related services contracts provides in pertinent part that the contractor is liable to the Government for loss or damage to personal property (including POV's), caused in whole or in part, by his or her negligence or fault and that the amount determined by the contracting officer will be withheld from payments otherwise due the contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Claims offices processing claims against the Government under this paragraph for loss, damage, or destruction of personal property of any kind (including POV's) caused in whole or in part by the negligence of a contractor will, when final recovery action is complete, forward the claim file directly to the Commander, USARCS. Claims offices processing a claim involving a POV will obtain an affirmative statement from the claimant as to whether settlement is also being processed directly with the contractor or has already been received from the contractor. Normally, a settlement with the contractor bars further claim against the Government. (But see &sect;536.186(b).) The procedures for processing POV recovery actions against stevedores are in &sect;536.195. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.194  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims arising from intra-theater shipments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless private insurance or payment of the statutory limit is involved (see &sect;536.190)_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Recovery action under a European intra-theater tender or a delivering direct procurement method contract will be assembled and forwarded to U.S. Army Claims Service, Europe, APO AE 09166&hyph;5346. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Recovery action under a Korean intra-theater tender or a delivering direct procurement method contract will be assembled and forwarded to U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service, Korea, APO SF 96301 AP 96205&hyph;0084. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Other recovery action against a delivering third party not involving shipment under a Through Government Bill of Lading will be processed by the field claims office to completion in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.195  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims against ocean carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No demand will be made directly on an ocean carrier operating under a Military Sealift Command contract by individual claimants or by field claims offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) POVs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Payment less than $100. A POV shipment file will be closed and no recovery action taken when the amount paid for the damage is less than $100. However any file involving loss of items from vehicles will continue to be processed regardless of the amount paid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

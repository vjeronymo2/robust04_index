			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind decline at Telemetrix AFTER EXCEPTIONAL charges of Pounds 2.93m, Telemetrix, the electronics and information systems group, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 2.47m to Pounds 673,000 for the six months to June 30. However, operating margins climbed from 6.9 to 8.3 per cent as turnover rose to Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 41.7m) and operating profits advanced to Pounds 3.88m (Pounds 3m). Comparative figures have been restated to consolidate the Zimbabwean operations. The group is also listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and 49 per cent of its equity is owned by Altron and its chairman, Mr Bill Venter. Some Pounds 2.3m of the exceptional item related to provisions against the closure of the defence-related activities in the Trend subsidiary, instigated by the new board as part of its restructure of the group. These were secure communications and encryption businesses, which, given the pressure on defence budgets worldwide since the Gulf war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, had seen a sharp contraction of activity. The benefits of the closure became effective on July 1. The retained telecommunications services and test operations 'had underlying profitability', said Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive. GTI, the 65 per cent-owned data communications subsidiary in the US, doubled operating profits to Pounds 3.2m on turnover up Pounds 7m at Pounds 27.7m, helped by Valor, its networking subsidiary, which lifted its sales 68 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. With growth specially in the Far East, Zetex, the semi-conductor subsidiary, also doubled profits - to Pounds 800,000 - on turnover ahead at Pounds 7m (Pounds 5.9m). In Zimbabwe, where Telemetrix makes telecom and lighting products, profits rose to ZDollars 4m (ZDollars 3.3m) on turnover of ZDollars 13.1m (ZDollars 9.3m), but on translation after devaluation there, there was a sterling fall to Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 700,000) on turnover at Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.8m). Group debt was reduced to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 4.8m), giving gearing of 23 per cent (28 per cent). After tax kept high at Pounds 1.06m (Pounds 787,000) by the US and Zimbabwe operations and minority interests at GTI of Pounds 995,000 (Pounds 556,000), losses per share emerged at 1.6p (earnings 1.3p).</p>

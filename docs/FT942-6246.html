			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Tail wags the dog in Groupe Schneider affair This morning, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe Schneider will be led from Brussels' notoriously unpleasant Foret prison for a hearing in a fraud case before Belgium's prosecuting authorities. At roughly the same time, on the other side of town, minority shareholders of Schneider subsidiary Cofimines will have another chance to voice their grievances against the beleaguered French chairman at their annual general meeting. It is thanks to the aggressive tactics of the two Belgian subsidiaries - Cofimines and Cofibel - that the investigation into the French electrical engineering group was triggered. Their initial complaints centred on claims that Schneider's 1992 bid to buy them out had undervalued their shares. At the end of last year some of the shareholders reached an agreement with Schneider, after which they agreed to withdraw legal proceedings. At least one refused. Yesterday Mr Andre de Barsy, a prominent Belgian property owner and shareholder in both Cofimines and Cofibel, said he had independently collected thick files of information that incriminated Mr Pineau-Valencienne. He denied suggestions in the French press that it was he who had prompted the Belgian authorities to continue their investigations. Yesterday Groupe Schneider denied it had harmed the interests of minority shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel. The French group said it had invested BFr2.2bn (Pounds 43m) in Cofibel and Cofimines since 1989 and that the two companies had seen their net assets per share rise markedly. Schneider said the offer, launched in 1992, to buy out minority shareholders in the two companies was equivalent to 4.25 times the share price of Cofibel in 1981 and 4.6 times the share price of Cofimines at the same date. During the same period the Brussels bourse rose in value by 4.59 times. 'These facts show that the relations between Schneider and its Belgian financial subsidiaries were not developed for sole benefit of the majority shareholder,' the company said. The affair continued to provoke indignation, and a certain amount of smugness in the Belgian press. Long used to being dismissed by the French as les petits Belges they enjoy jabbing their arrogant neighbour. L'Echo, a Francophone financial daily, said Belgium's 'audacity' in daring to imprison a member of the French establishment had prompted indignant, acid and occasionally insulting comments about the Belgians in the French press. All the Belgian newspapers have meanwhile vigorously defended the reputation of Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen , the Belgian prosecuting judge.</p>

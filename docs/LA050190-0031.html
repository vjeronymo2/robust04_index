			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE AGREES TO TRANSFER 5,700 ACRES FOR PARK SITES  </P> <P> With all due respect to Bob Hope, he just doesn't get it. Before we proclaim  him a saint for having agreed to donate and sell some of his land to the state,  we need to examine the downside of his would-be deal ("Hope Agrees to Transfer  of Lands for Parks," Part A, April 20).  </P> <P> The new agreement between Hope and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is  simply the latest counteroffer in negotiations that would result in a major  development inside Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> This counteroffer is an attempt to 1) heal Hope's tarnished image, 2) bail out  the fast-sinking plan of Potomac Investment Associates to develop Hope's Jordan  Ranch, 3) restore the good name of the conservancy, which has signed off on the  PIA development plan and 4) pressure the National Park Service to give away our  public lands.  </P> <P> The bottom line remains the same: the public does not get fair value, and the  national park will be degraded. PIA still plans a major golf course and luxury  homes on Jordan Ranch. This development would harm the natural resources of not  only the ranch, always viewed as a key tract for park service purchase, but  adjoining Cheeseboro Canyon, as well.  </P> <P> The Park Service can block this deal because PIA needs a piece of federal land  to build a highway to Jordan Ranch. The mandate of the National Park Service is  to protect our natural resources -- not to deal them away. Yet, under pressure  from PIA, the park service is acquiescing in this plunder. Doing so would set a  terrible precedent.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, this deal would constitute a raid on the federal  treasury. The law requires that any lands exchanged be equal in value, and Park  Service regulations direct that the contributory value of the exchanged land to  the Jordan Ranch development be considered in its appraisal. But the value of  the lands and money PIA plans to give the federal government do not approach  the value of the proposed Jordan Ranch development.  </P> <P> The peculiar postion of the conservancy should not go unnoticed. Last year its  representatives told the Wilderness Society that no funds were available to  purchase Jordan Ranch. Now, they suddenly have found $20 million to acquire  some of Hope's lands that do not even lie within the boundaries of Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area. What gives?  </P> <P> The Wilderness Society is working with Congress to stop this assault on our  public lands. The more that members of Congress learn about this development  plan, the more concerned they become. It is clear that the conservancy, the  park service, and Bob Hope just don't understand what is at stake.  </P> <P> What they need to do is so simple: Stop scheming on a way to build those luxury  homes and the golf course inside the boundaries of a national recreation area.  </P> <P> GEORGE T. FRAMPTON JR.  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Wilderness Society  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RETHINKING MILITARY MESSAGE;  </P> <P> PEACE GROUP TELLS STUDENTS THINGS RECRUITERS DON'T MENTION  </P> <P> Margaret Difani joined the Navy in 1975 and spent the next four years as a  secretary. Today, she tells high school students that her stint in the military  wasn't an adventure. It was just a desk job.  </P> <P> Tim Johnston spent eight months, 10 days, 16 hours and 20 minutes in Vietnam as  a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. He saw several friends die  there. Today, he volunteers his time to let young people know that he is still  trying to figure out why.  </P> <P> Michael Hall spent from 1968 to 1972 in the Army mortuary service, processing  the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam. When he came home, he became an  Army recruiter, enlisting so many people that he earned a gold badge. Today, he  travels around the county telling teen-agers they don't have to buy what  military recruiters are selling.  </P> <P> These veterans don't wear uniforms. They boast no catchy slogans and have no  contracts for students to sign. But make no mistake -- like their nemeses, the  military recruiters, these men and women have their own hard sell.  </P> <P> They are peace recruiters -- members of a tiny Encinitas-based network called  the Project on Youth and Non-Military Opportunities, or Project YANO. Since  1984, they have spoken to thousands of students in dozens of schools around San  Diego County, pitching an unconventional brand of patriotism that says you can  serve your country without ever firing a gun.  </P> <P> Especially in recent months, as the military build-up in the Persian Gulf  raises the possibility of U.S. troops going to war, Project YANO's message has  taken on a new urgency. But its mission, members say, remains the same: to tell  kids what the military won't.  </P> <P> "We are not here to tell you what you should or shouldn't do or what you should  or shouldn't think," Rick Jahnkow, Project YANO's program coordinator, told  about 300 juniors and seniors at Torrey Pines High School this week. "What  we're going to give you today is not a balanced presentation -- you're already  getting the other side. We're here to . . . fill in the blanks."  </P> <P> Military recruiters who speak only of adventure, travel, education and job  training leave out a few things, Jahnkow says. Among them, he says: the racism  and sexism many enlistees experience; the low-tech jobs that often lie behind  the high-tech terms in recruiting literature; and the possibility, implicit but  in his eyes often under-stressed, that joining the military means risking your  life.  </P> <P> "We're not talking about Hawaii, Guam, places like that," says one veteran in a  15-minute slide show that is part of Project YANO's presentation. "We're  talking about Lebanon, Grenada, Iran, Iraq -- places with violence."  </P> <P> Another veteran adds: "Videogames don't prepare you for that 10-year-old body  all torn to pieces. And for the knowledge that you were part of the military  machine that caused it."  </P> <P> Jahnkow, a long-time anti-war activist who never served in the military, says  Project YANO espouses no particular political viewpoint. The eight veterans  that make up his speaking pool say that even they don't agree about the role of  the military or the justness of war. What they share, however, is a belief that  teen-agers need help figuring it out.  </P> <P> The military has them completely outflanked. This year, the armed services  combined will spend $2.86 billion on recruiting nationwide, including $203  million for advertising, Pentagon officials say. Project YANO's annual budget,  which stays balanced only because the veterans donate their time, hovers around  $20,000.  </P> <P> So, like any clever underdog, Jahnkow has tried to turn weakness to advantage.  The military's recruiting campaign is so pervasive, he tells teen-agers, that  he need not repeat it to them. We've all heard the ads, he says: slogans like,  "Be all that you can be" and "We don't ask experience, we give it." All he asks  is that kids think more critically, ask more questions and make up their own  minds.  </P> <P> "We're really selling them a method rather than an idea," said George Grider, a  former Navy officer who is a Project YANO speaker. "Reason and patience and  caring -- if they can learn those things, we like to think they will choose  non-military opportunities. But if they don't, at least they will be choosing  for their own reasons."  </P> <P> Project YANO suggests several alternative ways for young people to express  their love of country. Among them, joining the Job Corps and the Conservation  Corps, entering youth training programs or vocational schools. But Jahnkow  acknowledges that, where his group offers suggestions, the military can offer a  paycheck.  </P> <P> In part for that reason, military recruiters in the area appear largely  unthreatened by Project YANO's efforts.  </P> <P> "They haven't affected us at all," said Sgt. Joe Steele, a public affairs  officer for Marine Corps Recruiting Station San Diego. He said recruiters in  his office view Project YANO's speakers as "disgruntled vets. They got some bum  scoop, or their experience when they went into the service was negative, so  they're taking that into the classroom."  </P> <P> Teachers counter that the veterans have proved to be valuable catalysts for  debate. They say that, by challenging students' perceptions of what a career in  the armed services can offer, Project YANO forces them to confront what's  important to them -- sometimes for the first time.  </P> <P> "None of these kids have any idea that they'd be called on to kill. They have  very little experience with death, with having to give up anything," said  Darlene Palmer, an English teacher at Torrey Pines High School, said after a  recent Project YANO visit. "This is what education is all about."  </P> <P> "For me, the bottom line of Project Yano is: get informed," said Michael  Mangin, a history teacher at San Dieguito High School. "There's conflict,  there's difference of opinion, and the class has to work through that. It's a  terrific learning experience."  </P> <P> One year, Mangin says, Project YANO prompted students to form a small political  discussion group. Another year, Jahnkow and his crew came to class after one of  Mangin's students already had decided to join the Navy. After hearing their  presentation and asking several questions, the student didn't change his mind.  But he told Mangin he was glad he'd been forced to articulate his convictions.  </P> <P> "He felt more confident about it, having been challenged," Mangin said.  </P> <P> Often the kids challenge the speakers right back, critiquing their political  biases and their patriotism. At Torrey Pines High School this week, for  example, the 16- and 17-year-olds were full of questions. How do you go about  proving you're a conscientious objector? Can you be drafted if you're not an  American citizen? Without military recruiters to enlist new soldiers, who would  defend the United States?  </P> <P> "You're not really against the military," one student chided. "You're just  against what it does. If the military fit into your personal political beliefs,  you'd be all for it."  </P> <P> Another student approached Jahnkow later to say he felt he could serve in the  military in some capacities, but not in combat. When Jahnkow informed him that  he would not necessarily be allowed to choose his job, he grimaced with  surprise.  </P> <P> "I don't have a choice?" he asked.  </P> <P> Critical or not, each question represents a victory, Jahnkow says. If the  students apply the same skepticism to everything they hear, Project YANO will  have accomplished its aim.  </P> <P> "When students say, 'Aren't you being unpatriotic,' I say, 'Veterans don't  fight wars so that people can just wave the flag. We fight for those basic  principles of being able to speak your mind,' " said Hall, the former military  recruiter.  </P> <P> "When they come up and say we're a bunch of hippie-commie-freaks, were  thrilled," Grider said. "It shows they're listening."  </P></p>

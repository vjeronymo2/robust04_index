			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amer set to expand sporting goods side in US Wielding a tennis racquet specially designed for Steffi Graf and calling on an assistant to bring in one of his company's Michael Jordan basketballs, Mr Seppo Ahonen, chief executive of Amer, yesterday declared that the diversified Finnish group, which owns the Wilson sports equipment brand, was set to concentrate increasingly on sporting and leisure goods. Amer, an oddly-shaped company that combines sports equipment with car sales, tobacco processing and printing and publishing, announced a three-fold rise in pre-tax profits in the first eight months of the year to FM135m (Dollars 28.3m) from FM43m in the same period last year. Earnings per share rose to FM5.40 from FM1.90. Sales were down 5 per cent to FM4.83bn from FM5.07bn and are set to fall over the full year. But this was blamed on exchange rate fluctuations and the sale this year of Amer's paper operations. Mr Ahonen predicted a 'significant improvement' in full-year profits over last year's pre-tax surplus of FM120m and said Amer was well placed to push ahead with its strategic shift towards sporting and leisure products. 'In future we will focus and expand in that area,' he said. 'Every other part of the business is making a profit today. But none is our core business and if we get good offers to buy, we would consider them.' Mr Ahonen said he was looking for organic growth in the sporting goods division, which accounts for 48 per cent of group sales and is dominated by Wilson. But Amer, which has driven its equity ratio up from 27 per cent two years ago to 42 per cent today, would also consider growth by acquisition. 'Our balance sheet is now at the stage where we can start to look at acquisitions, but we are not in a hurry.' Mr Ahonen was brought into Amer from the telecommunications group Nokia two years ago to pull the company out of losses. Just as Nokia has moved in a few years from being a widely diversified group to focusing on mobile and fixed telephony, Mr Ahonen is reshaping Amer. It started life as a tobacco processor and by the early 1990s was a sprawling conglomerate. The group still includes a division which sells Toyota, Citroen and Suzuki vehicles in Finland, a franchise to make Philip Morris cigarettes for the Finnish market and printing and publishing businesses. But Mr Ahonen quickly identified the sports division as the focus of future strategy. Amer acquired Wilson and the MacGregor Golf Company in the mid-1980s. The prestigious labels have given Amer leading or second ranking positions in the US markets for tennis racquets, golf equipment, American footballs, baseball equipment and basketballs. In the first eight months, sporting goods sales fell slightly to FM2.32bn, hit by a sharp fall in tennis racquet sales and exchange rate changes. But Amer said profitability and market share improved. Mr Ahonen said he wanted to strengthen the sporting goods penetration in Florida and on the US west coast and in Europe and Japan. He also was seeking to expand Amer's product range beyond the summer sports in which it is strongest and was looking for opportunities in non-team and non-competitive sports areas, such as camping and fishing.</p>

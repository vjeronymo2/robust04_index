			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lower interest costs help lift London Electricity to Pounds 17m LOWER INTEREST costs helped London Electricity to increase interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 17.3m, in spite of lower operating profits due partly to reduced distribution charges. The interim dividend was increased by 12 per cent from 5p to 5.6p, but the company was more cautious than others have been in recent days about growth prospects. Mr John Wilson, chairman, said the policy was to achieve consistent growth in dividends 'taking into account the expected medium-term trend in earnings.' In the six months to September 30, operating profits of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 14.8m) were achieved on turnover of Pounds 584.3m (Pounds 568.5m). Total units of electricity distributed fell by 1 per cent. However, with weather factors stripped out, the company said underlying trends were for 0.7 per cent growth. Commercial growth was 1.3 per cent (lower than in the last few years). The reduction was attributed to the effect of the recession, particularly on small commercial customers. The introduction of lower distribution tariffs in April, contributed to the decline in distribution profits from Pounds 58m to Pounds 54m. The supply business reduced losses to Pounds 35m (Pounds 38m). Mr Wilson said a decision would be made by the end of the year about the retailing business, reduced from 60 outlets two years ago to about 20. Some analysts expect closure. Total retail sales had risen as a result of increased selling space, but the business was adversely affected by market conditions. The programme to separate retailing from customer services, both financially and physically, would be completed by the year-end. Electrical contracting had already been restructured, and with a reduced workforce of 100 (400), was breaking even. A reduction in debtor days - a measure for outstanding accounts - from 38 to 29 contributed to a marked fall in borrowings and a reduction of Pounds 2.5m in net interest paid to Pounds 3.1m. COMMENT The cautious policy on dividends is perhaps typical of a company that critics says is too plodding to merit its medium rating among regional electricity companies. London tends to brag its merits less than other regional electricity companies and it is less adventurous. Its involvement both in retailing and independent gas-fired generation, where the risks and rewards are greater than in the core businesses, is below average. Supporters say the company is more likely than others to end up on the right side of the regulator in forthcoming pricing negotiations, especially after its improvement in customer service, particularly disconnections, and its separation of retailing from servicing. The latter will eliminate suspicions, to which other RECs are vulnerable, of cross subsidies. Assuming a 12 per cent dividend rise to 18.8p, the shares are on a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent.</p>

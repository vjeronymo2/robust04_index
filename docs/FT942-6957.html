			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Pilkington drops licensing policy: Glassmaker bows to pressure as US steps up anti-trust battle Pilkington, the UK glass maker, agreed yesterday to make far-reaching changes in its technology licensing policy in what is the first application of an aggressive US anti-trust policy beyond US borders. The company agreed with the US Justice Department to end restrictions on licensees for the use of its float glass technology, which has kept Pilkington at the top of the world plate glass industry for 30 years. The Justice Department said the agreement, which must still be approved by a US federal judge, would 'break a licensing stranglehold on glass manufacturing that kept American companies from designing and building glassmaking plants overseas'. Pilkington said the agreement 'would have no material impact', apart from the potential loss of less than Pounds 1m a year in licensing fees. However, the case sets a precedent for the ability of the US government to influence the activities of foreign companies in international markets. 'We are satisfied with this arrangement which protects a large body of technology developed by the group,' said Sir Robin Nicholson, the company's technology director. Pilkington earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 40.7m on sales of Pounds 2.5bn during the year to March 31 1993. Of that, about Pounds 10m is thought to have come from licence fees. Pilkington's shares rose 1 1/2 p to 188p yesterday. According to the company, the agreement means US glass makers using pre-1983 technology under licence from Pilkington will now be able to sub-license the technology to any company in a foreign country, subject to certain confidentiality agreements. Pilkington said it retains the rights to later technology not subject to licence agreements with US companies. The deal averts a potentially costly battle in the US although Pilkington still faces several civil suits. Justice Department officials said the settlement might enable US companies to win contracts for as many as half of the estimated 50 plate glass plants that are expected to be built over the next six years, mostly in eastern Europe and south-east Asia, and increase US exports by up to Dollars 1.25bn over the period. The case represents not only a new aggressiveness in the Clinton administration's enforcement of anti-trust law but also a new willingness to pursue claims against foreign companies outside the US. Under the Reagan administration, the Justice Department said it would pursue anti-trust cases overseas only if US consumers were affected, but that policy was reversed in 1992 to allow action if US exports were damaged. The Pilkington case is the first to be brought under the new policy. The Justice Department said Pilkington had imposed tough restraints on companies which bought licences for its technology, including allegedly limiting them to specific countries and restricting sub-licenses.

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: WOULD LICENSING IMPROVE APPRAISAL QUALITY?  </P> <P> As a former civil servant, I have often been witness to the ineffectuality of  the federal government in its response to problems of national importance.  </P> <P> For instance, as a combatant in the "War on Hunger," I worked under the  political appointee who proclaimed ketchup to be a vegetable.  </P> <P> Now, as a real estate appraiser facing federally mandated licensing and  certification requirements, I am again witnessing what promises to be an  impractical, ineffectual response to a national problem.  </P> <P> The "problem," as described by "The Barnard Report" of the House subcommittee  on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, is this:  </P> <P> "Hundreds of savings and loans . . . have been severely weakened or declared  insolvent because faulty and fraudulent real estate appraisals provided  documentation for loans larger than justified by the collateral's real value. .  . . Of greatest concern is 'client advocacy appraising,' wherein large numbers  of appraisers willingly agree, or otherwise succumb to pressure brought to bear  by lenders, borrowers, and others involved in the loan origination and  underwriting process."  </P> <P> More simply, our system has been operating without the checks and balances to  guarantee objective and accurate appraisals.  </P> <P> Developers and mortgage loan borrowers put pressure on appraisers to increase  the appraised value of their collateral so they can borrow more. What has  evolved is a group of "developer's darlings" who manipulate appraisals to hit  target values.  </P> <P> The Office of Thrift Supervision now counteracts this by requiring thrift  institution appraisals to be solicited by lenders, not borrowers.  </P> <P> Commercial banks have not yet been required to do the same, although such a  rule has been proposed. One bank's chief review appraiser confided to me that  about 80% of the borrower-solicited appraisals he reviewed were biased.  </P> <P> Lenders too can corrupt appraisers.  </P> <P> The mortgage lending business has become fiercely competitive, with loan agents  required to make ever more loans or face loss of income, employment or career  advancement.  </P> <P> Loan agent compensation based on commissions exacerbates the problem. Hefty  loan origination fees can also be collected before selling a bad loan to a  third party. Herein lies the pressure on appraisers to produce values that  "support the deal."  </P> <P> Another problem besetting the appraisal profession is "assembly-line  appraising," in which appraisal reports lacking adequate research and analysis  are hastily assembled by otherwise competent appraisers or their subordinates  so as to maximize turnover and profits.  </P> <P> This form of negligence is often mistaken for "incompetence."  </P> <P> Given this unsatisfactory status quo, the federal response is that each state  "register, license, and . . . certify" real estate appraisers, requiring  appraisers to demonstrate competence by passing examinations.  </P> <P> Yet "The Barnard's Report's" central concern seemed to be appraiser misconduct  rather than incompetence. Extensive testimony divulged that many appraisers  involved in thrift failures held the highest credentials recognized by the  appraisal profession.  </P> <P> Many acts of appraisal incompetence, too, are actually acts of negligence or  laziness by qualified appraisers who could easily pass an examination.  Examinations will thus require all fraudulent and negligent appraisers to  demonstrate competence before they can continue their destruction of our  nation's financial institutions.  </P> <P> The other advantage of licensing, we are told, is that licenses can be revoked  for misconduct. This fear of revocation will supposedly give appraisers the  same incentive to behave as properly as other licensed professionals, such as  real estate agents, securities dealers and attorneys. God help us all!  </P> <P> Many forget that some of the states hardest hit by appraiser misconduct, such  as Texas and Florida, have for years required appraisers to have real estate  licenses.  </P> <P> A recent Wall Street Journal article focusing on Texas appraiser corruption  noted that the abuses were not curbed until federal regulators successfully  prosecuted or sued some appraisers.  </P> <P> The reported consensus among Texas appraisers was that the federal actions have  now made them "extremely conservative in their estimates." It was the fear of  fines or incarceration, not the loss of a license, that cleaned up the  profession in Texas.  </P> <P> Moreover, state licensing law enforcement would actually divert scarce  enforcement resources away from the prosecution of appraisal fraud. In Florida,  appraisers have been jailed, not for fraud, but for practicing without a  Florida real estate license, even if they had licenses from other states.  </P> <P> Does occupational licensing work?  </P> <P> The American Enterprise Institute for Policy Research reported in 1980 that the  consensus of scholarly literature on the subject was that the public interest  defenses for occupational licensing were generally of questionable merit, and  the improvement in the quality of service was debatable.  </P> <P> The benefits of licensing extended mainly to licensees by raising the cost of  entry into a profession, restricting the supply of professionals, thereby  increasing their earnings. Licensing systems end up protecting the profession  rather than the public.  </P> <P> Licensing was also found to stifle professional innovation, something  appraisers need to respond to an increasingly complicated and sophisticated  real estate investment marketplace.  </P> <P> Proponents of appraiser certification, the next step beyond licensing, envision  a system similar to the public accounting profession, wherein "certified  appraisers" would have status akin to CPAs, not necessarily ideal role models.  </P> <P> Recent scandals have shown the limitations of "Big Eight" auditors in  uncovering and reporting unsound corporate financial conditions. The same  weakness of the proposed appraiser regulatory system parallels that of the  public accounting profession, namely the conflict of interest stemming from an  agent-client relationship. Accounting firms often find it difficult to bite the  hand that feeds them.  </P> <P> Another problem with regulating appraisers is who will do it. Can each state  come up with impartial and effective licensing/certification boards, or will  politics prevail?  </P> <P> Special-interest lobbying and discord has already been intense.  </P> <P> Realtors' associations particularly want to rule appraisers so as to provide  employment opportunities for their own members, but can realtors provide  objective opinions of value while simultaneously selling, leasing or managing  their clients' properties?  </P> <P> Although this conflict of interest already exists at many full-service real  estate firms, why put foxes in charge of the henhouse?  </P> <P> Admittedly, appraiser licensing/ certification is not harmful, either, but it  is also not the panacea it is envisioned to be by its congressional architects,  because it does not provide sufficient incentives for appraisers to be honest  and diligent.  </P> <P> As the eyes of the nation are upon Texas with respect to appraiser misconduct,  so can we observe a more effective solution to the problem -- increased federal  investigation and enforcement -- which has already scared the Texas appraisal  community into good behavior.  </P> <P> It seems that the two emotions prevailing in the real estate business are greed  and fear. The latter goes far in combatting the former.  </P></p>

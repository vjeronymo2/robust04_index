			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THATCHER BRAVES A FUROR AFTER AIDE BLASTS GERMANS;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION DEMANDS RIDLEY BE FIRED FOR LIKENING EC TO HITLER  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fought off a storm of protest in Parliament  today after refusing to fire one of her closest senior Cabinet aides for  likening the European Community to Adolf Hitler, calling French economic  leaders "poodles" and labeling Germany's recent monetary union "a German racket  designed to take over the whole of Europe."  </P> <P> Shouting "Sack him! Sack him!," members of the opposition Labor Party charged  that the comments made by Nicholas Ridley, Britain's secretary of state for  trade and industry, had damaged Britain's image in the European Community, and  they argued that Thatcher's failure to fire him would imply that "his views are  her views."  </P> <P> In defending her decision to retain Ridley, 61, Thatcher cited his public  apology for his statements, which appeared in the current issue of the  Spectator magazine, released here this morning.  </P> <P> "On reflection," Ridley declared in a one-line statement issued from Budapest,  where he is attending a series of trade meetings, "I very much regret remarks  reported in the Spectator and unreservedly withdraw them."  </P> <P> Thatcher, straining to be heard through the torrent of angry shouts and jeers,  added in the House of Commons, "I have always understood that it is the custom  of this House . . . that such a withdrawal is gracefully accepted."  </P> <P> In the Spectator interview, Ridley is quoted as blasting the European Community  as "17 unelected reject politicians . . . with no accountability to anybody."  </P> <P> "I'm not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to this lot. You  might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.  </P> <P> "This rushed takeover by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the  French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable," he  said.  </P> <P> Spectator Editor Dominic Lawson, who conducted the tape-recorded interview at  Ridley's 18th-Century home in Gloucestershire, noted within the interview  Ridley's incessant, angry references to the Germans and then asked the  minister, "But surely Herr (Helmut) Kohl is preferable to Herr Hitler. He's not  going to bomb us, at least."  </P> <P> To which, Ridley replied, "I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have the (bomb)  shelters and the chance to fight back, than simply being taken over by  economics.  </P> <P> "He'll (Kohl) soon be coming here and trying to say this is what we should do  on the banking front, and this is what our taxes should be," Ridley said. "I  mean, he'll soon be trying to take over everything."  </P> <P> The magazine's cover carried a cartoon of Ridley painting a Hitler mustache on  a portrait of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The article's title was  "Saying the Unsayable About the Germans."  </P> <P> Lutz Stavenhagen, a senior aide to Kohl, said, "This is an unusual and  unprecedented event. The attacks against Federal Chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl are  scandalous."  </P> <P> Sources within both the Labor and Conservative Parties said Thatcher's decision  to retain Ridley, who is among the last of her original ministers still in the  Cabinet, indicates a deep split within the prime minister's inner circle over  the issue of future European unification.  </P></p>

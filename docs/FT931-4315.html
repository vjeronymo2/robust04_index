			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: SA industrial group in R650m rights issue W&amp;A INVESTMENT Corporation, the diversified South African industrial conglomerate involved in a restructuring, is to raise R650m (Dollars 204m) in a rights issue to recapitalise the group. Last month, it was announced that Trencor, the highly-rated South African transport and container company, would support a rights issue, investing R350m in a recapitalised W&amp;A, and thereby obtaining joint control. Trencor will have an effective 26.5 per cent stake in W&amp;A. W&amp;A also said it suffered attributable losses of R11.5m in 1992 from profits of R129m the year before. Turnover slipped to R3.19bn from R3.23bn but adverse trading conditions saw operating profits fall by 35 per cent to R217.6m from R335.5m.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Name That School: Musician Frank Zappa doesn't view the possibility of having a  new high school named after him as a compliment. Zappa's name is among 132  under consideration by the Antelope Valley Union High School District board for  its new school, set to open in 1995. "Considering the sorry state of education  in California, it would be more appropriate to name a high school after Ronald  Reagan than to name it after me," said Zappa, a 1958 graduate of Antelope  Valley High School.

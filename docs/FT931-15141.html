			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Body Shop shares hit as UK sales fall BODY SHOP International saw its share price drop by almost 9 per cent yesterday after it reported disappointing pre-Christmas sales figures for its UK stores. In the wake of the announcement, which follows similarly disappointing figures from a number of other high street retailers, analysts trimmed their profit forecasts and the shares dropped 15p to 153p. The group said UK sales fell by 8 per cent in the nine weeks to December 26 on a like-for-like basis - excluding the effects of shop openings and closures while total UK sales were down 2 per cent. However, US and international sales grew strongly reflecting the group's expanding overseas business and investment. Sales in the US rose by 4 per cent on a like-for-like basis and by 46 per cent in total, while international sales grew by 2 per cent like-for-like and by 20 per cent in total. Commenting upon the figures, Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said: 'Christmas was, in line with many other retailers, particularly late this year. There was a marked contrast between disappointing sales in November and early December, and the final few weeks of December.' Mr Roddick said that in the UK, like-for-like sales increased by 4 per cent over the three-week period to January 2. He noted that overseas retail sales remained strong, but said 'it is too early to pick out a discernible trend in the UK for the last two months of the year.' However, analysts viewed the UK figures in particular as 'disappointing,' and reduced their profit forecasts for the current year to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 22m, down from about Pounds 25m. Some analysts have speculated that the decline in UK sales reflected the impact of increased competition from more traditional retailers. Boots in particular, has had success with its own-label range of Natural Collection products and supermarket groups, such as J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have also earmarked the personal care sector for growth. Mr Roddick firmly rejected these suggestions yesterday. He said Body Shop's independent research shows that UK customers are not going elsewhere, instead he believes the downturn reflect the general economic recession, which some analysts point out has hit the young particularly hard.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A relationship on the rocks - Skiing / Why Switzerland needs to modernise The British love affair with Switzerland is almost all-forgiving. Almost, but not quite. Switzerland has unsurpassed mountain scenery with some of the best skiing and mountain restaurants in Europe, but in some resorts the infrastructure is falling behind the times. The French have faster and more modern lifts; Austria is rapidly getting rid of its old-fashioned T-bars; Italy is usually a lot cheaper; and the lively 'gemutlichkeit' of Austria seems to go down better with British skiers than the more reserved Swiss equivalent (one reason why British skiers seem so loyal to Soll, Mayrhofen and Niederau). The very discreet, old-fashioned and tasteful Swiss quaintness that has for so long attracted British skiers is now in danger of sending the special Anglo-Swiss relationship into neutral or, even worse, reverse. Switzerland needs to find a balance between rustic charm and modern-day realism - if only they ran their ski resorts like their trains. Where to Ski, a lively new guide to resorts around the world pulls few punches on the subject of Swiss skiing: 'For a fast, efficient, queue-free lift network, Swiss resorts rarely come up to French standards - and the worst are positively abysmal.' It adds: 'Swiss resorts have a reputation for efficiently relieving you of your money. The reputation is well earned.' Verbier in particular receives short shrift. While admitting the resort has 'a large, challenging ski area and very lively night life' Where to Ski claims there are 'bad queues, over-crowded pistes, very poor piste maintenance, lack of grooming, marking, safety measures, very little artificial snow-making, and Europe's most expensive lift pass'. The Consumers Association's Good Skiing Guide mentions the 'shamefully antiquated lift system' and 'unacceptable queuing'. Verbier, superb natural ski arena that it is, clearly has problems. Like a brilliant but wayward child, it seems to need some kind of course correction. While I would dispute Where to Ski's comments about piste maintenance, grooming and safety, there can be no doubt that Verbier's popularity and range of skiing means that it does have a problem moving skiers around the mountain. This winter, the resort is setting great store by the installation of its Funitel 'jumbo' gondola to Attelas which has finally replaced one of Verbier's most antiquated telecabins. Its 15 cabins, each big enough for 30 people, can transport up to 2,000 skiers an hour, but it remains to be seen whether this will have a significant effect on the queues. Switzerland, it has to be said, is waking up to the need to modernise its out-dated lifts. Flims-Laax has spent millions of francs in recent years on new lifts but no resort can do everything at once. Similarly, the gondola at Startgels, the so-called 'tumble-dryer', is still bumping and jostling passengers but its days are numbered. Saas-Fee, too, is gradually overhauling its lift system. This winter, the upper section of the Alpin Express gondola will start operating and the resort will replace the traditional Fee-Chatz (snow cat) service, taking skiers from Langfluh to Felskinn, with a truly state-of-the-art lift. This is designed to cope with the problems of transporting skiers along a glacier which has no rocks on which to anchor lift towers. The ice here moves up to 20cm a day, but a lift has been designed with towers that can be moved back into place instead of drifting along with the ice. All this is expensive. And the longer you delay, the more you have to spend at once. Switzerland is paying the price for being the first on the scene in the world of winter sports. France, which only really emerged as an important ski nation in the 1960s, was able to start with more advanced technology and is still out in front. The Swiss National Tourist Office recently celebrated the centenary of its establishment in London, and it is well over a century since Edward Whymper first scaled the Matterhorn. These events helped to forge a bond between the two countries. Today, British skiers who can afford it still make their annual pilgrimage to the Swiss Alps because of the high quality to be found in traditional Swiss hotels and restaurants. No other resort in the Alps, for example, can match the range and quality of cuisine in Zermatt's mountain huts, but Zermatt - which, in many ways, has sacrificed its old-fashioned charm on the altar of new technology - has also been battling with lift queue problems. British skiers have been immensely loyal to Switzerland. But the big modern French resorts, often accused of being unattractive, provide skiers with what most of them want: fast lifts, good snow and easy access to the slopes. Just as factory farming has sadly eclipsed the more wholesome free-range option, it is now possible that high-tech skiing at a good price may start to eclipse the tradition of the 'good old days' inherited from Sir Arnold Lunn. Charm, scenery and luxury hotels may, in the end, not be enough.</p>

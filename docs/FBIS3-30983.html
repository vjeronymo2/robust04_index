			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning's round of Croatian-Yugoslav talks at  the level of deputy prime ministers has ended. Croatian Deputy  Prime Minister Mate Granic, his guest, Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic, and their associates met, it was  announced, to review humanitarian issues and the possibilities  for establishing communications links between the two  neighboring but still mutually unrecognized countries.    After brief talks between the two delegations in their  entirety, the meeting continued between the delegation heads and  their closest aides, who discussed political issues. Working  groups on humanitarian issues and communications links held  separate meetings at the same time.    According to assessments made at the beginning of the talks,  the purpose of today's meeting is to resolve problems over which  there is a convergence of views between the two countries;  however, open questions may arise, and the two sides should at  least coordinate methods and dynamics for resolving them.    Croatian circles have noted that this morning's round of  talks was held in a cooperative working atmosphere. This  particularly applies, reporters were told, to the talks  conducted by the mixed commissions for refugees, expelled, and  missing persons.    Talks between the Yugoslav and Croatian deputy prime  ministers and their associates will continue this afternoon.</p>

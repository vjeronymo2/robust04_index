			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Adverse weather brings setbacks for tea producers THE COMBINED production of tea in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh amounted to 931.3m kg in 1992, down from 1,027.6m kg in the previous year. While Indian and Sri Lankan production suffered major setbacks, output in Bangladesh, a minor producer, rose by 3.1m kg to 48.3m kg. The worst sufferer was Sri Lanka, which, because of bad weather and low productivity, lost nearly 62m kg at 179m kg. According to the Indian Tea Board, south India, which is in the same climatic zone as Sri Lanka, accounted for 26.43m of the 37.79m kg drop in the country's tea crop in 1992, which amounted to 703.9m kg. While the production of tea in Assam fell marginally to 387.8m kg the gardens in West Bengal lost 11.6m kg at 150.24m kg. Darjeeling in West Bengal, which has a small production base but boasts of some of the finest teas in the world, produced only 9.87m kg last year, compared with 13.07m kg in 1991. South Indian production was 158.61m kg. Following the virtual collapse of the Russian market, which until 1991 was the destination of more than half of India's tea exports, the Indian tea companies reduced the production of orthodox tea to 115.22m kg from 155.37m kg. Production of CTC (crush, tear and curl) tea was raised to 581.28m kg.</p>

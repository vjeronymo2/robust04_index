			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inchape deal enhances its reputation - Price of 129p per share compares with 250p paid by Ricoh in 1991 INCHCAPE'S deal with Gestetner, the office equipment distributor, will enhance the international business service group's reputation for being ready to wait until the price is right. Inchcape is paying 129p per share for its initial 15.3 per cent stake in Gestetner, compared with the 250p per share which Ricoh, the Japanese photocopier manufacturer, paid in 1991 for a 24 per cent stake. One of Inchcape's largest recent deals came at the end of 1991, when it bought TKM, the motor dealer, for Pounds 382m, reputedly Pounds 100m less than its asking price 18 months earlier. Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the first contacts with Gestetner came in Hong Kong in August, 1990, but 'we were always way apart on price'. Although Mr Mackay believes the present purchase price is 'very acceptable', he said the structure of the deal reflects a decision to proceed cautiously. Unlike TKM, a private company which allowed Inchcape to 'crawl all over it' before the acquisition, Mr Mackay said that in case of Gestetner they had to rely solely on information supplied at arms-length by one shareholder, the vendor, Chiltern Capital. Mr Mackay said: 'We would be well advised to take one step at a time. It is the right thing to do with this company at our present level of knowledge. It shows no lack of confidence, it's just that our knowledge base is not there.' Mr Rod O'Donoghue, finance director, and Mr Andrew Cummins, the strategic director, are joining the Gestetner board. Although confident that Gestetner is not associated with the pressure-selling abuses which has dogged parts of the photocopier market, Mr O'Donoghue will be keen to ensure that the company takes a conservative line on issues such as non-recourse financing and writing down the value of leased assets. Mr Basil Sellers, Gestetner's Australian chairman and chief executive, is a large shareholder in Chiltern. He said the investment in Gestetner had 'just been average' since he bought into the former family-controlled group in 1986. The cash consideration of Pounds 39.7m represents a book loss of Pounds 300,000 compared with the current book value of Chiltern's investment in Gestetner. Mr Sellers said: 'I would obviously have preferred to sell out at 250p, as we did to Ricoh, but the time had come to return to my roots. I came here for two years and stayed for seven.' The Australian management team is credited with doing a good job in moving Gestetner away from stencil duplicators towards photocopiers, but it also made an ill-judged expansion into the photographic equipment market. In January the planned sale of the group's Vivitar and Hanimex camera distribution businesses fell through, but there is no doubt that the company will focus entirely on office supplies. Inchcape will treat its 15 per cent stake as a trade investment, and would only equity-account the stake if and when it is lifted to 25 per cent. But Mr Mackay stresses that outcome is by no means predetermined. 'We will be entirely pragmatic. We could say we don't like the look of this thing.' Inchcape said that Gestetner operated mainly in office equipment, a large, globally homogenous industry in which the distributor role was well established and could potentially generate good returns as a result of revenue from service and supplies.</p>

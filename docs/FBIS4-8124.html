			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 9 (AFP) -- UN chief Butrus  Butrus-Ghali Saturday ordered UN forces in Bosnia to use "all  available means" to obtain the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb troops  threatening the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    Butrus-Ghali said in a statement released by his spokeswoman  Therese Gastaut that the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in  former Yugoslavia must "use all available means as authorized by  the relevant Security Council resolutions to attain this  objective."    Gastaut said the resolutions included the possible recourse  to NATO air strikes because Gorazde was a protected UN "safe  haven".    The statement was issued as the Bosnian Serbs seized  strategic high ground overlooking Gorazde as part of a 10-day  offensive on the Moslem pocket in eastern Bosnia.    In his statement, Butrus-Ghali welcomed ``the positive  momentum and progress towards peace and stability in the former  Yugoslavia.    ``With regard to the safe area of Gorazde, the  Secretary-General has taken note of the improvement in the  situation there which was reported to him this (Saturday)  morning.    "At the same time, he calls for a return by the parties,  especially the Bosnian Serbs, to the positions they held before  the outbreak of the recent fighting."    The statement was issued after the UN chief held meetings in  Geneva earlier on Saturday with his special representative to  former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UN mediator  Thorvald Stoltenberg, Sarajevo special coordinator William  Eagleton and UNPROFOR chief General Bertrand de Sauville de  Lapresle.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 23, BNS -- The Russian Representative  Assembly finds that Estonia should grant permanent residence  permits to all the non-citizens who since July 1990 have been  permanently living in Estonia, says a declaration the  organization adopted at its annual conference May 21.    The assembly proposes to simplify the complicated procedure  of issuing residence permits by reregistering all resident list  entries made before July 1990.    The statement suggests that persons living in Estonia since  July 1990 should be given legal guarantees as to receiving  residence permits.    "A short, simple and universally understandable procedure  needs to be worked out that wouldn't depend on politics and the  arbitrariness of officials," the statement reads. The assembly  holds the position that the promises and decrees of the  government are insufficient as guarantee.    The Estonian Cabinet ruled at the end of last month to  extend  the residence permit application deadline and grant the rights  of a permanent resident to those holders of temporary residence  permits who were entered in permanent resident lists before July  1990. The government decree stemmed from the wave of protests  of Russian organizations against the current procedure for  registering permit applications and issuing permits.    The Russian Representative Assembly also urges that the  issue  of granting residence and work permits to Russian retired  officers be solved in a "humane manner."    "This issue of principle will probably have to be solved at  interstate (Estonian-Russian) negotiations," the statement  reads. The assembly suggests that, pending solution, all  military retirees be issued temporary residence permits and  granted all rights of a permanent resident.</p>

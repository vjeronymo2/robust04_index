			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets vary in Latin America Variations in equity market performance characterised the Latin American region last week. According to data supplied by the IFC, the private sector division of the World Bank, Brazil registered the strongest gain in dollar terms. However, the market remains highly volatile and the Bovespa index started this week, for instance, with a gain of 9 per cent, partly on renewed rumours of the announcement of an economic stabilisation plan. But as Baring Securities notes, for many institutions the risk of being out of Brazilian equities is still perceived as being greater than being in. Of the region's smaller markets, Peru has attracted heavy foreign buying. Some measures conflict with the pattern shown by the IFC table, and there are indications elsewhere that Peru has shown the best performance in dollar terms over the year to date. The approval of a new constitution in Sunday's referendum, says Mr Robert Simpson, a director of the Latin American desk at BZW in London, provides a new incentive; while privatisation proposals, expected to be in place by the end of the year, will boost market capitalisation and generate fresh overseas interest. A fall in inflation to around 1.8 per cent per month has also been encouraging.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                     No. of     Oct 29    % Change     % Change Market              stocks       1993   over week   on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)     821.66        -3.9        +41.6 Brazil                (44)     225.83       +10.4        +80.6 Chile                 (20)     463.85        -1.3        +10.8 Colombia1              (8)     515.46        -2.1        +21.2 Mexico                (58)     781.13        -0.3        +15.5 Peru2                  (7)     118.16        +4.0        +18.2 Venezuela3             (8)     603.70        -9.2        +16.2 East Asia South Korea4         (130)      98.79        -0.2         +0.6 Philippines           (11)     234.87        +3.4        +75.9 Taiwan, China5        (76)      84.31        +0.7        +14.3 South Asia India6                (61)      90.42        -1.9         -3.5 Indonesia7            (31)      97.73        -0.5        +66.5 Malaysia              (61)     274.48        +2.2        +67.8 Pakistan8              (8)     268.56        +4.6        +34.2 Sri Lanka9             (5)     148.59       +10.4        +48.6 Thailand              (52)     360.48       +10.7        +56.5 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)     224.70        -0.9        +15.1 Jordan                 (5)     165.51        -3.6        +41.7 Portugal              (16)     109.73        -0.7        +42.2 Turkey10              (31)     172.15        +1.1       +157.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Local currency terms                         Oct 29      % Change     % Change Market                    1993     over week   on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina           504,194.15          -3.9        +42.0 Brazil           49,530,147.49         +10.4     +2,277.9 Chile                   768.08          -1.3        +19.8 Colombia1              747.68           -1.8        +22.3 Mexico               1,048.23           -0.2        +15.4 Peru2                  156.11           +4.0        +56.1 Venezuela3           1,371.71           -8.6        +46.9 East Asia South Korea4           105.04           -0.3         +3.2 Philippines            328.48           +4.5       +103.2 Taiwan, China5          84.16           +0.5        +20.7 South Asia India6                 100.00           -1.8         +4.7 Indonesia7             111.56           -0.5        +69.6 Malaysia               258.96           +2.6        +64.1 Pakistan8              364.66           +4.6        +57.3 Sri Lanka9             158.99          +10.4        +59.0 Thailand               362.70          +11.1        +55.6 Euro/Mid East Greece                 366.21           -2.5        +28.6 Jordan                 237.31           -3.1        +42.1 Portugal               131.06           -0.2        +68.1 Turkey10             1,043.85           +1.9       +289.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Decision to reduce export credit insurance premium praised Sir, The British Exporters Association welcomes the Trade Minister's decision to reduce export credit insurance premiums for medium- and long-term business under the Portfolio Management System to a more realistic level ('Export insurance premiums cut by up to 50 per cent', March 10). When the Portfolio Management System was introduced in early 1991, the government hoped that other countries would raise their export credit agency premiums to UK levels. That has not happened. David Dodwell's article 'Putting risk reality back into export cover' (World Trade News, February 4) makes the point that Italy is saying 'no' to the Portfolio Management System unless the rest of the world follows. As a result, while the Portfolio Management System relates risk to premium, its uncompetitively high rates have adversely affected our ability to export capital goods. Other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries appear to be winning contracts (and employment opportunities) in the UK's traditional Third World markets. The British Exporters Association hopes that the government's decision heralds an ongoing review process which will cover not only premium rates but also Portfolio Management System market capacity - that is, the amount of cover available for individual countries. Although some markets are highly price sensitive, the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) must be aware that others appear to be cover sensitive. A degree of flexibility by ECGD to relate its policy to market needs would be welcomed by industry. The government's decision on premium rates is a first step in the right direction. Campbell E Dunford, chairman, British Exporters Association, 16 Dartmouth Street, London SW1H 9BL</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Sung--yol] </F>   [Text] To the relief of government and business circles,  the planned nationwide strike in sympathy with striking train  engineers and subway workers did not take place yesterday.    The National Council of Union Representatives (NCUR), a  hard-line labor alliance, announced last week that major unions  of larger business firms would go on "sympathy strike" beginning  yesterday. But most of the unions didn't obey, apparently  because of the popular outrage against the "reckless strike" of  train engineers and subway workers.    The prosecution has warned that any sympathy strikes would  be  illegal and said it would sternly deal with the unionists  involved.    The two key unions of Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan and  Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery in Koje Island, both in  South Kyongsang Province whose action would have considerable  impact on any future labor disputes, virtually ignored the  NCUR's announcement. Train engineers across the nation went on  strike last Thursday calling for pay raises and protesting the  arrest of their colleagues who had staged a sit-in. The NCUR  late last week declared a nationwide sympathy strike to begin  from yesterday.    The Daewoo union announced it would not participate in the  planned sympathy strike, while Hyundai unionists went on a  five-hour strike during which they held rally condemning  Sunday's police action against train engineers.    A Daewoo union spokesman said that collective bargaining was  under way and added the union will make an independent decision  whether or not to go on strike regardless of the NCUR's  announcement. He said a strike ballot is scheduled for tomorrow.    Daewoo union leaders attempted a three-hour strike last  Tuesday but only 450 of the 8,300 unionists participated.    Above all, the negative public opinions on the ongoing of  train and subway workers' strikes might have discouraged Daewoo  and other union leaders from joining the sympathy strike, said  an official at the Labor Ministry.    Kia Motors and Daewoo Motors, whose unions have taken a  hard-line attitude in the past, also boycotted the sympathy  strike.    Unionists at Hyundai Heavy Industries, however, decided to  go  on strike tomorrow.    As of yesterday, only seven unions were on strike, including  train engineers, Seoul and Pusan subway workers, unionists at  Kumbo &amp; Co., Daedong Industrial Co. and Paek Hospital in  Pusan.    Workers at other major industrial sites in Ulsan, Chongwon,  Masan in South Kyongsang Province and in Kwangju in South Cholla  Province showed no signs of joining the sympathy strike.    Later in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok presided over a  meeting of labor-related ministers and instructed them to  mobilize all administrative power to fill the vacancies caused  by striking train and subway engineers.    Yi also called for the arrest of union leaders who  masterminded illegal strikes.    Meanwhile, the prosecution warned that riot police will  enter  business firms if unionists go on strike illegally to disperse  them and arrest leading unionists.    The prosecution is also searching for Yang Kyu-hon, chairman  of the NCUR, and Secretary-General Mun Song-hyon for their  alleged role in inciting the illegal strike.    A prosecution spokesman said that riot police will soon  storm  several work places, where illegal strikes are under way.    At the same time, the Labor Ministry will try and persuade  unionists in other firms to settle ongoing disputes without  going on strike to prevent the proliferation of strikes, a  ministry spokesman said.</p>

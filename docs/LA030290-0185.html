			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN POSTS $636-MILLION TRADE DEFICIT, ITS FIRST IN SIX YEARS  </P> <P> Japan reported a trade deficit for the first time in six years today with a  current account shortfall for the month of January, but economists said Tokyo  is expected to return to a trade surplus soon.  </P> <P> The current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, was  $636 million in deficit after a $2.51-billion surplus a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry said.  </P> <P> Japan's last deficit, of $562 million, was recorded in January, 1984.  </P> <P> Analysts said factors involved in the decrease, such as the initial depressing  effects of a weaker yen on trade, higher oil prices and slowing auto exports,  will continue at least for the first quarter of 1990. But they saw no cause for  alarm.  </P> <P> "The drop was largely due to seasonal factors," said Nobuyuki Saji, senior  economist at Nikko Securities Research Centre. "It's nothing to get excited  about."  </P></p>

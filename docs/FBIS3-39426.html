			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Franco Angioni, commander of NATO </F> ground forces in southern Europe, by Toni Fontana in Verona;  date not given: "Angioni: `Peace Cannot Be Imposed at  Gunpoint'"]    [Text] [Fontana] General, is Sarajevo another Beirut?    [Angioni] The comparison is not entirely unfounded. There  are similarities and differences. The real difference is that  Lebanon had become ungovernable owing to the large number of  external "sponsors" that made negotiations impossible. So far,  strife in the former Yugoslavia has been restricted to the  communities present in the territory concerned; it is important  that mediation should continue and that it should remain a  matter for the parties directly involved. Sponsoring by  third-party nations must be avoided, because if they were to  become involved the war would spread and make the pursuit of a  solution even more complicated.    [Fontana] NATO orders the Serbs to stop, and they react with  threats against Italy.    [Angioni] Every war takes place at various levels: There is  psychological warfare, determent, and political, economic, and  then military pressure. No threat should be underestimated.  That would be presumptuous. Attacks can be made with  artillery, missiles, and aircraft. As far as we know, there are  no artillery weapons with sufficient range to reach Italy, no  missiles or rockets, as far as NATO is aware, and the Serbs have  not been given missiles with a range exceeding the 200  kilometers that separate the Italian coast from Serb territory.    [Fontana] What would be the risk to the population in the  event of a NATO strike on the Serb positions?    [Angioni] NATO has already cleared the potential forms of  intervention with the United Nations. Two forms of action are  technically possible: One is to provide direct air support for  the UN troops if they come under heavy fire. The procedure  would be for the commander of the UN troops in Bosnia to apply  to the permanent representative of the UN Secretary General, who  would then ask the commander of the allied forces for southern  Europe, who is empowered to order strikes on identified targets  making direct offensives against the blue helmets, to intervene.  The second form of intervention would consist of destroying  weapon systems attacking the civilian population or the blue  helmets. This scenario also contemplates strikes against the  artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and this could happen when the  ultimatum expires.    [Fontana] And will the population be exposed to risk?    [Angioni] NATO has taken account of the real aspects and  those that serve as propaganda; it is aware that artillery is  unlikely to be found in completely unpopulated areas. NATO has  the "physical representation" of the lie of the land at its  disposal, and there are photographs, etc. It must be borne in  mind that these are mobile targets, and that our information  must be updated constantly. The artillery posts can be moved in  less than 24 hours. Our updates must be increasingly accurate  as the ultimatum approaches zero hour. NATO will not strike if  the risk is too great, but the possibility that the artillery  may be positioned in or near residential areas gives rise to  great concern. The pilot's orders and skill must reduce the  risk to the absolute minimum.    [Fontana] The raid could trigger the entry of other powers  into the war, Russia in particular.    [Angioni] Scenarios change rapidly. The UN resolution was  passed by the Security Council, on which Russia has a seat as  well, but Russia is against the eventuality of more substantial  strikes. Moreover, it is impossible to ignore the reaction of  public opinion, and the "automatic" involvement of certain  nations must not be forgotten.    [Fontana] Do you believe in the theory of "surgical  bombing"?    [Angioni] Those who believe in it on the basis of the Gulf  war make two mistakes. Firstly, it is misleading to think that  the same situation is repeating itself, and secondly, it is  wrong to think that air strikes alone can put the situation  right.    [Fontana] There is talk of 500 guns surrounding Sarajevo.    [Angioni] Some information is secret, but 500 guns may seem  a  lot. What matters is the "quality" of these guns. This  category is often taken to include weapons that are not guns but  mortars or howitzers. The most dangerous guns in the Serbs'  possession are Russian-made, the "130's," which have a range of  about 30 kilometers. All the others have a shorter range, and  cannot strike from a distance greater than 10 kilometers.    [Fontana] Second scenario: massive intervention by a  peacekeeping force. How many troops would be needed?    [Angioni] A peacekeeping army can only act in a context of  support for peacekeeping operations, and if a settlement has  already been reached, otherwise it becomes a euphemism for  making war. In this case, too, the precedent provided by the  Gulf war is misleading, because the distribution of three armies  across the whole of Bosnia means that we cannot advance like a  steamroller. The parties at war must reach a settlement whereby  they can be separated and some form of justice can be restored.  We must not allow emotion to interfere with a political and  military solution, which must be approached with detachment and  clear-sightedness. Unless the parties at war reach a settlement,  the UN and NATO operation could well achieve nothing. Indeed,  we must stand up and say that if blame is to be apportioned in  Yugoslavia, it should not be laid at the door of those who will  not or cannot intervene, but primarily of those who refuse to  reach a settlement.    [Fontana] So you regard intervention by ground troops to  impose peace as unlikely?    [Angioni] Highly unlikely, practically out of the question  if  you consider the numbers involved: 100,000 Serbs in Bosnia,  50,000 Croatians, all armed and determined to pursue their  goals, 50,000 Muslims. Confronting and overcoming such massive  forces would require a military organization large enough not to  risk defeat or, what would be worse, prolonging the war. The  numerical ratio in the field must be one to three, or probably  five or more. If the forces to be confronted number 200,000,  how many armies would it take?    [Fontana] There would be a large number of casualties. What  if the factions reach agreement?    [Angioni] The issue is a political one. What would be the  purpose of intervening? To establish the cantons contemplated  in the latest peace plan? And for how long? These are  questions requiring answers in political terms. Once it has  these answers, the military organization can intervene to "keep  down" the violence. But if this process does not begin, asking  for a military presence, as an end in itself, in the hope of  reducing the risk to human lives is completely unrealistic. The  risks would increase, we would be providing more "hostages."    [Fontana] So you place greater faith in the arms of  diplomacy  than in the arms of warfare?    [Angioni] Yes, definitely. My experience has led me to  believe that peace cannot be imposed at gunpoint. It would be a  peace imposed with proclamations and notices posted on walls.  Peace is a conquest made day after day, and it belongs to those  who will benefit from it, the "consumers." Armies are not in a  position to impose peace; they are there to help implement  political decisions, and they need technical objectives to  achieve in a strictly defined timeframe pursuant to political  objectives. If the expiry of the ultimatum is followed by  intervention, it will merely be the consequence of that  political decision. If they do not withdraw the artillery,  there must be intervention. Nothing is happening for the time  being because the ultimatum, too, is a deterrent, and this is  where the political decision is so finely balanced: Should we  lose political face and credit by not intervening if the  ultimatum is not complied with, or intervene on a limited,  selective scale to show that we mean what we say? It is a  psychological balancing act.</p>

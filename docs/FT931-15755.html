			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nestle Merseyside package DETAILS HAVE emerged of the offer by Nestle, the Swiss foods conglomerate, to assist in the formation of an ice-cream company to be owned by former Clarke Foods employees in Kirkby, Merseyside. Nestle confirmed that it had offered production equipment and storage facilities worth about Pounds 500,000 to get former employees at the Kirkby factory started in an own-label ice lolly manufacturing business. The foods group will also contribute to overheads such as security and electricity until the end of February. One of the workers said the equipment offered by Nestle was not 'state of the art' although it was in good running order. At its peak, the Kirkby factory had been capable of producing up to 40,000 ice lollies an hour. The equipment left by Nestle would allow output of 25,000 per hour, he said. The proposed venture had already received 'significant interest' in the placing an order from one of the site's former customers, a leading supermarket chain. Nestle acquired the equipment when it bought most of Clarke Foods' assets following the company's collapse in October last year. The 67 employees at the Kirkby site, made redundant by the receiver before Nestle moved in, had staged a sit-in at the factory during December in an attempt to persuade the conglomerate to keep the factory open. The deal is contingent on the completion of a business plan and the arrangement of financing for the proposed venture. Nestle has offered Pounds 2,500 towards the costs of devising the business plan, with the balance likely to be paid by the Department of Trade and Industry. The representative of the Kirkby employees said some form of Employee Share Ownership Plan was being discussed to arrange initial financing for the new business. Meetings had been set up with financial institutions this week to discuss working capital finance. The venture is also receiving significant support from the Knowsley council, which owns the freehold on the site and has set up similar employee co-operatives. Mr Brian Revell, of the Transport and General Workers Union, welcomed the offer from Nestle: 'They are taking account of their social obligations to the workers in Kirkby, which is one of the worst unemployment black spots in the country.'</p>

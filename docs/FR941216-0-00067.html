			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action are included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances to pose a threat to human health or the environment. As a matter of Agency policy, those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed regardless of their HRS score, if all of the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (available only at NPL sites) than to use its removal authority to respond to the release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPL includes two sections, one of sites that are evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''), and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987) and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining whether the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Deletions/Cleanups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 67 sites from the General Superfund Section of the NPL, most recently Yakima Plating Co., Yakima, Washington (59 FR 43291, August 23, 1994); Wide Beach Development, Brant, New York (59 FR 44633, August 30, 1994); Revere Textile Prints Corp., Sterling, Connecticut (59 FR 45628, September 2, 1994); North-U Drive Well Contamination, Springfield, Missouri (59 FR 46354, September 8, 1994); BioClinical Laboratories, Inc., Bohemia, New York (59 FR 46569, September 9, 1994); C &amp; J Disposal Leasing Co. Dump, Hamilton, New York (59 FR 48178, September 20, 1994); Ringwood Mines/Landfill, Ringwood Borough, New Jersey (59 FR 54830, November 2, 1994); and Allied Plating, Inc., Portland, Oregon (59 FR 56409, November 14, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify for the CCL when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have been achieved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g., institutional controls); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the 66 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional 213 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but two from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of December 1994, the CCL consists of 279 sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of November 1994, EPA had conducted 648 removal actions at NPL sites, and 2,331 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals is available from the Superfund hotline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Action in This Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule adds 18 sites to the NPL, 14 to the General Superfund Section and 4 to the Federal Facilities Section. This action results in an NPL of 1,242 sites, 1,088 of them in the General Superfund Section and 154 of them in the Federal Facilities Section. An additional 46 sites have been proposed, 40 in the General Superfund Section and 6 in the Federal Facilities Section, and are awaiting final Agency action. Final and proposed sites now total 1,288. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Information Available to the Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Headquarters and Regional public dockets for the NPL contain documents relating to the evaluation and scoring of sites in this final rule. The dockets are available for viewing, by appointment only, after the appearance of this notice. The hours of operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. Please contact the Regional Dockets for hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

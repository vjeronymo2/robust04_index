			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gloom for Eurotunnel underwriters The gloom continued for underwriters of the Pounds 858m Eurotunnel rights issue yesterday, as the share price dropped a further 15p to 288p, leaving it just 23p above the rights price. Brokers reported a substantial increase in sales from both UK and French small shareholders, with some 2.7m Eurotunnel units traded, the highest level since the pricing was announced, and close to 8m of the nil-paid shares. The offer closes at 3pm next Wednesday. Given the 16 per cent share price fall last week, and no signs of institutional support, there is an increasing possibility that underwriters will be called upon to cover a sizeable slice of the issue. At the time the issue was announced, the talk was of artificial devaluation of the share price through short selling, and it bounced strongly in the aftermath. But there has been no more good news to support the shares, and once more investors have focused on the long distance to profitability and dividends, and news reports of breakdowns in the freight service. Monday will be the last day trading the nil-paid rights shares, and the outcome of the issue should become clearer.</p>

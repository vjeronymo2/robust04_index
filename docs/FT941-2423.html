			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: German chemicals Results from the big three German chemicals companies - Bayer, BASF and Hoechst - have struck an unexpected note of optimism. Dividend cuts aside, the figures were marginally better than expected. More importantly, all agree that chemicals markets turned some time in the fourth quarter, since when improving conditions in the US have offset only gentle decline in Europe. If that improvement is sustained, investors judged the turn quite neatly: the shares of each have outperformed the German market by up to 10 per cent from a low-point in November. There are still reasons for caution. While the outlook in industrial chemicals is improving, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals could act as a drag. History suggests that benefits flowing from a turn in the chemicals cycle will not be spread evenly. Bayer and Hoechst outpaced the German equity market from mid-1983 to mid-1984, the year after European economies turned. BASF's higher exposure to petrochemicals delayed similar outperformance until 1987. Given the scale of overcapacity in plastics markets, that pattern could be repeated. While costs are being cut and markets are no longer deteriorating, though, earnings growth looks assured. The steady stream of restructuring announcements - such as Hoechst's plan to spin-off its fibres business - points to an encouraging emphasis on self-help. If the companies can avoid the temptation to retrench as European economies improve, the combination of earnings recovery and attractive yields will prove difficult to resist.</p>

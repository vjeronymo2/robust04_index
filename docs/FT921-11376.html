			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Photo-Me edges ahead to Pounds 8.7m Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and operator, reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 8.54m to Pounds 8.7m in the six months to October 31. Turnover increased by 14.5 per cent to Pounds 62.2m, but profits were hit by a sharp rise in depreciation charges from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 5.64m. The pre-tax figure was struck after a loss on exchange of Pounds 123,000(Pounds 875,000)Operating profits rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 14.5m. With the prediction that the recession would continue, directors had taken a cautious view and expected full year pre-tax profits to be comparable to the previous Pounds 17.1m. Earnings per share expanded by 20 per cent to 9.37p (7.81p), helped by a drop in minority interests from Pounds 955,000 to Pounds 296,000. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.3p (1.2p). Following the recent death of Mr Terence Chute, Mr Philippe Payen had been appointed executive chairman.</p>

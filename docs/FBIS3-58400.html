This was the meeting which not only had to set a  new course and iron out recent friction between the Europeans  and the Americans, but above all make a fundamental opening to  the East, offering Central and East European countries the  prospect of future membership.    The alliance knew that it was at a turning point, and just  as  it has always been at its most creative when its existence has  been in doubt, once again it seems to have administered itself a  booster -- which will be much needed for a long time to come.  The message was unanimous: NATO remains the best guarantee for  security in Europe.    Following the often underlying mutual criticism, U.S.  President Bill Clinton urged the alliance to find a new balance  between Europe and the United States and seems to have made a  great step forward in doing so. The "new" NATO will have much  more of a European flavor. It has provided a stronger than ever  response to the demands of the Europeans to construct a fully  fledged European pillar. Never before has the alliance so  clearly expressed its support for a European defense and  security identity or established what role the European Union  can play in the European security structure.    Although the old U.S. demand for "burden sharing" (the  sharing of costs) is no doubt still present, Clinton has a very  different approach to European unification than his predecessor  George Bush, who distrusted the process and tried to slow it  down. Clinton has repeatedly made it known that it is in both  the United States' and Europe's interest for Europe to assume a  greater role. Now that NATO has made its resources available to  operations by the Western European Union -- among other things  through the use of combined joint task forces, in which it  neither wants to nor is able to participate itself -- the  Europeans will have to show they are ready for the role.    At the same time, the U.S. leadership will not be  compromised  in any way. It is an old truth that the alliance only works  well under clear U.S. leadership. In this respect, there was  general relief in Brussels that Washington remains fully  committed to its obligations and that Clinton is even pulling  the alliance along behind him. Nobody makes any secret of the  fact that this was very much "Clinton's summit." The dominant  themes -- the new balance, enlargement to the East, and halting  the proliferation of nuclear weapons -- were all Clinton's  themes.    The question yet to be answered is to what extent they will  work. In particular, doubts hang over the Partnership for Peace  which is designed to draw closer to NATO the candidate members  from Central and East Europe. NATO admits that this proposal  does not give these countries what they are seeking: security  guarantees against a Russian threat. By inviting them to  participate in military cooperation or peace missions, NATO  hopes to prepare them for full membership at some time in the  future.    There is no longer any discussion on the principle of  expanding the alliance. Everyone agrees that this will happen.  Nobody, however, ventures to say how and which countries will  be the first to be considered for membership. Not all the  candidate countries will be able to join at once. This would,  however, mean that some countries (Romania, Bulgaria) will have  to remain behind in a Russian-dominated zone which is something  NATO cannot allow. New dividing lines in Europe are not  acceptable. It is uncertain whether the Partnership for Peace  will be able to solve this problem. For internal reasons, it is  the best NATO can offer itself: it postpones the painful  decision. For this fact alone, the summit has been a success.    But this success is tempered by the continuing failure on  one  subject: Bosnia. However much the alliance may want to  reorganize itself, it stands or falls by its credibility, which  has been seriously damaged in Bosnia. Threatening language  cannot restore it. NATO's worth is determined only by its  ability to implement its policy. Further empty threats would  further damage its prestige and finally create nothing but a  profound general malaise.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) The test procedures that would be effective and practicable for testing reflectors and lamps with integral reflectors for the purpose of detecting which devices would degrade significantly in service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, and Trucklite. They reported that acrylic devices are designed to operate up to about 170 degrees F and that stress relaxation begins at about 180 degrees. A heat test of plastic samples at 175 degrees F is incorporated by reference in Standard No. 108. The amount of distortion experienced at temperatures between 180 and 200 degrees F depends on the residual stress at the particular location, and the speed at which it stabilizes depends on the temperature. Unlike haze, creep is not indefinitely progressive; stabilization occurs in a matter of hours at elevated temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All lamp manufacturers reported using a heat warpage test of some sort, even though no longer required by Standard No. 108. Some test more stringently than SAE J575d. Some commenters reported using photometric testing after a heat warpage test while others used a visual examination (the method set forth in SAE J575d). Peterson reported that acrylic lenses with reflectors subjected to SAE J575d show less than 5 percent losses in photometric brightness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency eliminated the warpage test because it did not deem it required for safety. The degradation of acrylic reflectors alleged by Sierra would not be detected under SAE J575d which specifies a visual inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creep would affect a reflex reflector in a way fundamentally different from haze. Haze reduces the brightness of the reflector at all light entrance angles. Creep may cause the reflex reflector to lose brightness at some angles while gaining brightness at other angles. It appears unlikely that the loss of brightness reported by General Electric was the result of creep. GE did not test the acrylic reflectors thoroughly enough to make well founded conclusions about their performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, there is no evidence that reflex reflectors degrade before other visible damage occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Dye Loss of Acrylic Reflectors and Lenses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sierra claimed that the weathering test of Standard No. 108 is inadequate because complying red and amber acrylic lenses lose their color in use. NHTSA responded that the breakdown of the dye may not be a property of the plastic but of the dye itself. Dyes with higher temperature tolerance are frequently used in polycarbonate products because they may be designed for higher temperature applications than acrylic products, but there is no property of acrylic plastic which contributes to fading. NHTSA understands, however, that the SAE adopted the three-year test when plastic began to replace glass because of some concern that plastic would not be as fade resistant as glass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA requested that commenters provide information on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether the commenter has test or other data relating to fading or loss of dye color in acrylic or polycarbonate lenses through exposure to heat or weathering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether any data exist indicating that acrylic or polycarbonate lenses fade or do not fade under realistic operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Four House of  Representatives members on Friday [20 May] defected from former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP] due to  differences with the party leadership.    They are Satoshi Arai, Yukio Edano, Yuichi Takami and Seiji  Maehara, all of whom were elected to the lower house for the  first time on the JNP ticket in last July's general election.    "It was tough and painful to part from our colleagues...We  will continue doing our utmost to revamp Japan's politics," Arai  said at a news conference.    The four will form a new parliamentary group and seek a  tie-up with the 18-member parliamentary group of new party  Sakigake [Harbinger]/Seiun and new party Mirai.    They said their reason for quitting the two-year-old party  rested in the formation of a new parliamentary group, Kaishin,  in late April.    Kaishin was abruptly established by ruling coalition  parties,  excluding the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a move that led to  the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition and forced Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata to form the first minority government in  39 years.    The lawmakers also noted they want to pursue a management  style that differs from the JNP's, though they share political  goals.    Edano said he shares political ideals with a number of JNP  members and hopes he can join forces with them in the future.    On Thursday, Edano and Takami revealed they would quit the  JNP, and Arai and Maehara decided to follow suit on Friday.    Last month, three JNP members left the party after Hosokawa  and his party leadership formed closer ties with key coalition  strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's  core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. The three defectors  established the Seiun group.    Wtih the latest breakaway, the JNP's strength in the lower  house is pared down to 33.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a  news conference the defection from the JNP -- a move that also  reduces the strength of the ruling coalition -- is regrettable.    But the top government spokesman also declared the governing  forces will stay united and march forward despite the departure.</p>

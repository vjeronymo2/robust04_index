			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kazakhstan, April 27 (XINHUA) --  Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today that his current  four-nation tour of Central Asia is successful.    Speaking at a news conference, Li said he had "comprehensive  and in-depth" exchange of views with leaders of the four  countries -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan  -- on bilateral, regional and international issues.    "We reached agreement on a wide range of issues and found  many common points," Li said.    "As far as I know," he said, "the four basic principles and  six- point proposition I stated for developing relations,  including economic cooperation, with the Central Asian nations,  have won good response from leaders and people of all circles in  the four countries."    "We all hope to remain good neighbors and friends forever,"  he added.    In particular, Li noted, the signing of the Sino-Kazakhstan  border agreement defined the boundary in a legal form, saying he  expected the boundary to be one of "lasting peace and  friendship."    He also said that the visit has achieved substantial results  in the economic field, for the top trade officials and  entrepreneurs traveling with him came into wide contact and  signed a range of agreements, contracts or letters of intent  with local business circles.    In this respect, he said the agreement reached between  communications departments of China and Kazakhstan on developing  international railway transportation is "a specially important  achievement."    Before long, he added, "We will invite relevant countries,  including Russia, Kyrghyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, to  further discuss the issue to ensure smooth traffic and make full  use of the new silk road."    The Chinese premier, referring to the Sino-Kazakhstan border  trade issue, said that the selling of shoddy or even fake  products by some Chinese businessmen, mostly private, run  against the Chinese Government's policy in this regard.    "We are ready to work with the Government of Kazakhstan to  draw up relevant measures so as to reduce the negative effect,"  he said, adding that large corporations of the two countries  should form the "main channel" of bilateral trade.    Asked to elaborate on talks with President Nursultan  Nazarbayev, Li again voiced appreciation for Kazakhstan  Government's position on adhering to the "One China" policy with  regard to the Taiwan and Tibet issues, on not allowing elements  of "East Turkstan" to undertake activities against China here  and on opposing national separatism in general.    Also, he said, "We support and appreciate President  Nazarbayev's efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia."    The Chinese premier also stated China's position on nuclear  test ban and talked about Sino-Russian relations.    Li arrived here Monday [25 April] on the last leg of the  10-day Central Asia tour, which is to end Thursday.</p>

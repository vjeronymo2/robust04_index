			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: RTZ wanted The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, jumped 10 1/2 to 862 1/2 p on news of an expansion at its Escondida mine in Chile. RTZ has a 30 per cent stake in the mine which is expected to become the world's single biggest copper producer in two years time. Last year, the mine contributed Pounds 36m to RTZ's net earnings of Pounds 373m but some analysts believe the impact will be less marked than initial figures suggest. SG Warburg argues that it will only increase earnings per share by four per cent and not until the end of the decade. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped 8 to 639p as the US Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee recommended approval of its controversial anti-AIDS treatment for reducing the risk of transferring the HIV virus from mothers to babies. Also, Paribas issued a buy note arguing that the recent figures highlighted the company's solid performance in a difficult environment and the shares were trading at an unjustifiably high discount to the market and sector. Profit-takers were out in force in the water sector reversing several of the sharp gains seen following the issuing of the Ofwat report on Thursday. But other stocks remained firm amid a flurry of broker recommendations in response to what was considered a highly favourable document from the industry regulator. Among the fallers, Welsh tumbled 17 to 621p, Yorkshire 13 to 543p, and Severn Trent 16 to 556p. After the market closed the latter group's agm heard that sales and profits for the first quarter to June were running ahead of levels for the same period a year previously. Northumbrian was the best performer, adding 8 to 635p. Motor dealer Lex Service, which reported disappointing figures earlier this week, languished 13 to 424p. Electricals group Delta lost 6 to 504p on fears of stiff competition in one of its key markets following Thursday's Pounds 96.1m recommended offer by Hanson for Scholes, a rival to Delta. Transport and property group P&amp;O tumbled 15 1/2 to 657 1/2 p following a press report of a formal investigation by US authorities into whether the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (on routes and rates) has engaged in anti-competitive practices. P&amp;O operates container ships on the route. However, one analyst said: 'There is little to worry about since profits from those operations are tiny.' Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved 8 ahead to 314p, after reports that a joint French and British government committee awarded it a provisional licence to operate a limited passenger service. Profit-taking in BAA left shares in the UK airports group 20 lower at 953p, after an Pounds 11m jump in first quarter profits to Pounds 111m. Charterhouse Tilney continues to favour the stock and upgraded its full year profits estimate by Pounds 6m to Pounds 366m. Mr Mike Stoddart at the broker, said the adjustment was to reflect, 'strong traffic growth and the confirmation that trading is in line with expectations.' A positive agm statement from BPB, the building materials group, saw the shares appreciate 2 to 332p. The chairman told shareholders that a trend of better sales volumes seen last year had continued into the first quarter of the current financial year. BT shares shaded 6 1/2 to 369p, with Morgan Stanley moving to a hold on the stock.</p>

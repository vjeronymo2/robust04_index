			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- Japan's top private banker  praised the thrust of the government's new market-opening steps  Tuesday [29 March] but said more detail is needed to restart  Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks.    Tadashi Okuda, chairman of the Federation of Bankers  Associations of Japan, said the government is taking the right  steps to aim at further opening Japan's markets and cut the  country's mounting current account surplus. But he noted the  package approved at a morning cabinet meeting just set out the  directions for further steps and that "almost all the main parts  are to come in June."    Okuda called for the measures to be fleshed out quickly,  saying otherwise there can be no breakthrough in the stalled  bilateral talks.    U.S. officials have said they would weigh the Japanese  proposals in considering whether to restart the trade talks that  fell apart in February over disagreement over the use of  numerical indicators to gauge progress in opening Japan's  markets.    Okuda, who is also president of Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank,  blasted  U.S. legislation that would retaliate against foreign financial  services deemed to be closed to outside competitors. The fair  trade in financial services bill, which passed the U.S. Senate  this month and is expected to clear the House of Representatives  and be signed into law by President Bill Clinton, would violate  the "nondiscriminatory principle" of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Okuda said.    Okuda said the economy, which is on the verge of bottoming  out, is at a delicate stage of "seeking timing." If Diet  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget is greatly delayed, it  would hurt consumer and corporate sentiment, he said.    The cabinet Tuesday approved a 50-day, 11 trillion yen  provisional budget as budget deliberations for the fiscal year  starting Friday remain deadlocked in the Diet.    He also defended Japan's financial industry against  criticism  of a "pack" mentality and lack of innovation, leveled last week  by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno. Okuda said the  industry has been highly regulated but pointed to recent  deregulatory steps, saying competition and innovation will grow  as deregulation proceeds.    He also said the bankers' federation agreed at a Tuesday  meeting to review its disclosure regulations in line with a  Finance Ministry report calling for steps such as the disclosure  of business results for bank subsidiaries moving into the  securities and trust banking businesses.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SAMS' FLY MISSIONS OF MERCY;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: OXNARD DOCTOR DALE HOYT FLIES TO BAJA EVERY MONTH TO TREAT THE SICK  -- 28 YEARS AFTER HE FOUNDED THE 1,400-MEMBER FLYING SAMARITANS.  </P> <P> The ruddy-cheeked man in the brown leather bomber jacket clambered out of the  Cessna 210 and looked briefly across the forsaken plain, the dusty view broken  only by occasional clumps of cactus and scrubby underbrush.  </P> <P> Eager to check on a baby he had helped treat for a brain abnormality, Dr. Dale  Hoyt waited for three gun-toting soldiers in camouflage to finish inspecting  the plane. Then he hurried across the small military landing strip and hoisted  himself onto the back of a rusty, orange cattle truck heading toward the  100-person village of Punta Prieta.  </P> <P> But bad news waited there for the 68-year-old Oxnard doctor who founded the  Flying Samaritans, an organization that has provided medical services in remote  areas of Baja for 28 years.  </P> <P> The 15-month-old baby had been dead for a week.  </P> <P> "It's hard," Hoyt said, shaking his head slowly back and forth. "It's really  hard."  </P> <P> Kay Hoyt, 55, the doctor's wife and assistant for 14 years, struggled against  her tears as did some of the other 20-odd volunteers who had traveled for three  hours in private planes to host their monthly medical clinic.  </P> <P> But the doctors, nurses, dentists, pilots and errand-runners had little time  for grief.  </P> <P> It was 1 p.m. and in just a few hours the sun would dip behind the mountains,  making it impossible for the five private planes transporting the group to fly  to the next town, Bahia de Los Angeles, where there are no lights to illuminate  the small landing strip.  </P> <P> The team members -- some along for the first time, others seasoned veterans of  the expeditions -- hurried into a light-blue building that had been set up for  medical services.  </P> <P> The outside walls were punctuated by jagged holes. Inside, particle-board  partitions smudged with dirt and buckling from their frames separated three  examining rooms and a dental office, where two antique chairs faced each other.  </P> <P> In the pharmacy area, seemingly endless bottles of pills and creams, most  donated by doctors from the United States, crammed makeshift plywood shelves. A  cardboard box served as a trash basket.  </P> <P> Outside, townspeople gathered around. The arrival of the Flying "Sams" is about  the biggest social event in town, drawing people from outlying communities who  are eager to see the doctor or the dentist.  </P> <P> The clinic is the only means of medical treatment for many of the people in and  near Punta Prieta, a town about 500 miles south of Ventura County that was  built as a compound for road workers during construction 15 years ago of the  two-lane highway that extends the length of Baja's finger-like peninsula.  </P> <P> People still live in the barracks-like structures that include a communal  eating hall and recreation room. The outlying area is dotted with houses, built  mostly of cinder blocks, interspersed with abandoned cars rusted to their  chassis.  </P> <P> To this and other poor communities, the Samaritans provide a scholarship  program to encourage children to stay in school. On this trip, they also hosted  a Christmas party, for which kids lined up to choose from hundreds of toys.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a steady stream of people swarmed around the entrance of the medical  clinic, where Flying Sams sorted records at a card table.  </P> <P> Hoyt waited in an examination room along with his wife and a nurse.  </P> <P> As he mused about his observations -- "Little bit of redness in left ear canal  . . . OK, they're both red" -- Kay Hoyt took copious notes.  </P> <P> She read them back to him, whereupon he made a diagnosis and called out an  appropriate prescription.  </P> <P> To most of the people he sees, Hoyt is just another doctor with the group.  </P> <P> Even new Flying Samaritan volunteers ask chatty questions about his background,  not realizing he is responsible for the international organization that boasts  about 1,400 members.  </P> <P> The idea for the organization took form in 1961 after two American pilots  flying from La Paz to San Diego were forced to make an emergency landing on an  isolated mesa during a dust storm. People from the nearby village of El Rosario  fed and sheltered the two women before finding more fuel for their plane and  sending them home.  </P> <P> Impressed with the kindness of the townspeople, the two women, Polly Ross and  Ailene Mellott, organized an airlift of food and toys to the 1,200 people in  the fishing village. Hoyt, a pilot with the Civil Air Patrol, joined the  effort. After the deliveries had been made, the villagers were asked if they  wanted to see a doctor.  </P> <P> On that first visit, Hoyt held office hours on a kitchen table as another pilot  held a flashlight for him to see. He examined only 22 people -- some with  hernias or tonsillitis, one woman with cancer of the uterus -- before he ran  out of supplies.  </P> <P> Drawn again and again by the needs of the people, Hoyt continued flying back to  the remote town.  </P> <P> "I was frustrated," Hoyt said. "Walking off and leaving somebody was kind of  rough."  </P> <P> Within months he had established a monthly clinic that ultimately became the  Flying Samaritans, a nonprofit organization with nine chapters in California  and others in Arizona and Tijuana.  </P> <P> The largest chapter is called the Foothill Chapter and has about 300 members  from around Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Hoyt joined this chapter when he  moved to Oxnard from Orange County two years ago to begin a personal injury  practice.  </P> <P> The Hoyts were attracted to Oxnard because it is far enough from Los Angeles to  be rural but close enough for access to different cultural activities.  </P> <P> "Oxnard is a comfortable town, a caring town," Kay Hoyt said.  </P> <P> While he was very active in the Flying Sams in the past, Hoyt has begun to slow  down in recent years, content to fade into the background and leave the  leadership of the group to others.  </P> <P> On his trips to Mexico, he concentrates only on treating those who come to see  him, his ego seemingly uninflated by the kudos given to the welfare service  that helps people in more than 20 Mexican towns.  </P> <P> "It is of great significance to our lives," said Margarita Cota, 42, Punta  Prieta's unofficial mayor. "They have done a great many helpful things."  </P> <P> If a medical emergency arises between the periodic visits from Hoyt and his  colleagues, residents try to borrow a car and head to Ensenada or Tijuana.  </P> <P> Otherwise, they wait for the Flying Samaritans.  </P> <P> Maria Sanchez, 38, wanted to see the dentist about a sore tooth that has hurt  her for more than a year.  </P> <P> "I can eat nothing too cold and nothing too hot," Sanchez said. "I am not able  to eat on the left side of my mouth."  </P> <P> Indolecio de Perez, 72, and his wife, Germana, 60, walked for four days to get  to the clinic. The old man, wearing a soiled blue dress shirt and black shoes  scuffed to a dull gray, was told he must have surgery for a hernia. His sight  also is failing.  </P> <P> "We used to make saddles," Germana de Perez explained. "Now, he cannot see. He  is not able to cut the leather."  </P> <P> In halting Spanish, a nurse explained that Germana de Perez must also seek  further tests and treatment at a Baja medical clinic for an abdominal infection  caused by unsanitary drinking water.  </P> <P> But the Samaritans could do nothing more for the couple that day. They had  treated about 40 people, and it was time to board their planes and head to  Bahia de Los Angeles, a coastal fishing village of about 500 people.  </P> <P> Dale and Kay Hoyt stayed near the back of the cattle truck. She exchanged  pleasantries while Hoyt, a quiet man with a wry sense of humor, studied the  others on the trip.  </P> <P> Hoyt, with his calm blue eyes and slate-gray hair, spoke in a slow and measured  manner as he recalled his first visits to Mexico. When Hoyt began the clinics,  he would bring his family, putting them to work. His brother interpreted for  him. His wife held a flashlight during surgery.  </P> <P> The villagers were not used to the ways of the Americans, Hoyt said.  </P> <P> Nurses on the trip were warned by the local residents that wearing shorts was  improper. The modest townspeople were reluctant to submit to exams.  </P> <P> "There were so many gowns and slips that to do a pelvic exam in those days it  was difficult to get all those clothes off," Hoyt said.  </P> <P> They spent one night in a room with goats, Hoyt recalled. They also slept in  sleeping bags under the wings of their plane.  </P> <P> As he reminisced, it became apparent how much the organization has meant to  Hoyt. For Kay Hoyt, also, the group is as important as family.  </P> <P> "We eat together and work together for 24 hours and we are four to six little  people up in a plane all together," Kay Hoyt said. "You go down with strangers,  and you leave hugging."  </P> <P> Hoyt disengaged himself from the Samaritans for five years, when he and Kay  moved to Northern California where they started a farm raising exotic animals  and he lived the life of a country doctor.  </P> <P> A nostalgic trip back to El Rosario in 1984 illustrated to Hoyt how much he  missed his work in Mexico.  </P> <P> As Hoyt walked through the town where he had held the Samaritans' first  clinics, people came down from the hills to welcome him, Kay Hoyt said.  </P> <P> "They would say, 'Don't you remember you delivered my baby?' " Kay Hoyt said. "  'He's 21 now.' "  </P> <P> He rejoined the Flying Samaritans, treating everything from leprosy to cleft  palate. He has amputated a gangrenous foot and removed part of a cancerous ear.  He has seen a woman, her cancer metastasized, seemingly cure herself with doses  of an Indian tea made from local plants. And he has arranged surgery in the  United States that allowed a girl to regain her sight.  </P> <P> Now, though, the Hoyts and other Flying Samaritans are turning their attention  to the future.  </P> <P> Dale and Kay Hoyt are anticipating their next trip.  </P> <P> "It's been fun as well as a challenge," Hoyt said.  </P></p>

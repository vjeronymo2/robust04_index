			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Bauman to take over from Cahill as BAe chairman The new chairman of British Aerospace has been confirmed as Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive of the drugs group SmithKline Beecham. He succeeds the present chairman, Mr John Cahill, who is stepping down after only two years of his five-year term. Mr Cahill's departure, which had been signalled in advance, is believed to be partly due to dissent within the BAe board. He will walk away with Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3.21m) in the form of share options. It is understood that he has waived payment on the final three years of his contract. He holds options on 908,000 at an exercise price of 260p. BAe's share price closed yesterday at 543p. Mr Bauman, 62, will be paid Pounds 50,000 a year as non-executive chairman, working one or two days a week on average. He will also receive options on 120,000 BAe shares at 550p. At SmithKline Beecham, where he is due to retire in April, he was one of the UK's highest-paid executives, with earnings of Pounds 1.5m in 1992. He said last night: 'I think BAe has made progress, and they're starting to sort out a management team and a strategy for the future. I've had the chance to meet all of the board, and I feel good about my ability to work with them.' BAe last night played down suggestions that Mr Cahill, who had spent much of his time as chairman living in the US, had been at loggerheads with his colleagues, particularly those in the group's defence business. An official said last night: 'John Cahill has made an important contribution in changing the culture of BAe's defence business, and has worked as part of a team. He has now accomplished the majority of the tasks he set out to do, and therefore feels this is a sensible time to make a change.' Mr Cahill's two years at the company have been a period of dramatic change, after the departure of Professor Roland Smith. It culminated last week with the announcement of the sale of Rover to BMW of Germany. The appointment of Mr Bauman, who will continue to be based in London, is likely to be well received in the City. He has experience of the aerospace business, having been chairman from 1981 to 1985 of Avco of the US. His replacement at SmithKline Beecham has already been announced as Mr Jan Leschly, head of pharmaceuticals. As Mr Bauman is a US citizen, BAe is having to change its articles of association to allow him to be chairman. Bauman profile, Page 12</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Underlying improvement at NCC A strong upturn in underlying performance was yesterday reported by NCC, Sweden's second-largest construction group, even though conditions in its home market continued to worsen. The group relied on reorganisation, lower financial costs and a better investment performance for the improvement. Headline profit declined to SKr130m (Dollars 16.9m) in the first six months from SKr303m, but both figures were distorted by one-off gains from share sales. Excluding these, the group swung from a SKr170m loss to a SKr106m profit. Reflecting the continuing depression in the Swedish market, revenues slipped to SKr7.6bn from SKr8.6bn while the order intake was unchanged at SKr6.7bn. NCC said industry estimates showed the market would shrink by a further 13 per cent this year before making a modest recovery in 1995. New housing starts fell 40 per cent in the first half to just 3,300 units. The group expects to remain in the black for the full year after last year's SKr175m profit. Lower profits from its three building units are expected to be offset by a stronger performance from NCC Invest and reduced losses in NCC Real Estate. Euroc, the cement and building materials group, saw a sharp increase in first-half profits to SKr258m from SKr95m, after shrugging off a continued downturn in its two most important markets, Finland and Sweden. The company said synergies from its acquisition of two Finnish companies at the end of last year increased productivity, and better market conditions in the US and the UK contributed to the improvement. It predicted a full-year profit of at least SKr650m, well ahead of last year's SKr240m. The estimate comprises a SKr470m underlying profit and a further SKr180m in one-off gains. During the second half, a SKr460m dividend from the winding up of the Protorp investment group will be partly counterbalanced by SKr280m in writedowns, it said.</p>

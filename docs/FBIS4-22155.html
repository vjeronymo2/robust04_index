			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pyotr Karapetyan: "Heavy Fighting at Kodori </F> Canyon In Sixth Day, Abkhaz Detachments Take Control of  Strategic Points"]    [Text] In all the conflicting reports coming out of Tbilisi  and Sukhumi, one thing is beyond doubt: On March 25, after  several months of relative peace, the first shots rang out in  the Kodori canyon in the border region.    Blood is being spilled, and people are dying. There are dead  and wounded among the civilians of the villages of Khucha,  Kvemo, and Lata, and Ganakhleba has been destroyed almost  completely. According to official sources, local battles are  under way in Zugdidi Rayon in Western Georgia. The Abkhazians  have taken control of the strategically important village of  Lata. The Georgian authorities are hurriedly evacuating the  population of Svanetia and villages adjacent to the Kodori  canyon.    Unfortunately, those who predicted a new escalation of the  Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation in spring have been proved  correct. It is by no means accidental that the new round of  fighting began in the Kodori canyon.    In terms of its importance to the Abkhazians, it can be  compared to the Lachinsk corridor in Nagorno-Karabakh. There is  a "humanitarian path" at Kodori, and helicopters delivering  cargo from the republics of the North Caucasus to Abkhazia fly  over the Kodori canyon. Significantly, their flight paths are  out of range of air defense systems. The Georgians will  naturally do everything in their power to block that corridor;  by the same token, it is clear that the Abkhazians will fight  for it to the last man. The forces that have been committed --  artillery, Grad launchers, and helicopter gunships -- attest to  the seriousness of both sides' intentions. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has  learned that the Abkhazians have moved a regiment into the  Kodori canyon and the adjacent area. The Georgians are opposing  it with two divisions, not from the regular army but from the  militarized Mkhedrioni detachments.    In this situation, the politicians can only concede that the  opportunity to activate a peaceful mechanism to settle the  conflict has been missed. Eduard Shevardnadze has said that  recent events in Abkhazia make it perfectly clear that the  Gudauta leadership has nothing but disdain for the peacemaking  efforts of the UN and Russia. The counterattack on Sukhumi  didn't end anything either. People there remember the Georgian  parliament's well-known decision to disband the Abkhazian  Supreme Soviet, automatically liquidating the Abkhaz delegation  at the Geneva talks as a legal entity. As a result, the talks  that had been set up with such difficulty were torpedoed.    The sides continue to claim that dialogue is still possible.  But at the same time, to all appearances, they are preparing for  a different course of events.</p>

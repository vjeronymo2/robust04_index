			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Dilemma for Major as UK doubts grow IT IS good for Europe and good for Britain. But that is not to say it is good for the government. That judgment, offered by a British minister last night on the Yes vote in France for the Maastricht treaty, encapsulates the dilemma now facing Mr John Major. When the British prime minister was asked in the wake of last week's sterling crisis whether he still hoped that the French would endorse the treaty, he replied in the affirmative. But there was no enthusiasm in his voice. It was the same last night as he offered his congratulations to President Francois Mitterrand. It is not hard to explain the ambivalence. There is much in the treaty that Mr Major wants to preserve. He sees the inter-governmental dimension which it adds to the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act as the route to Europe's future - and to Britain's participation in that future. There was serious concern in Whitehall that a No vote would have been followed immediately by a new Franco-German initiative to secure European Union for an inner core of EC nations - underlining Britain's retreat to the fringe, after last's week enforced withdrawal of sterling from the ERM. But Mr Major must also look to domestic politics, where Maastricht threatens to re-open the wounds which led his party into civil war only two years ago and prompted it to ditch Baroness Thatcher. Pressing ahead with ratification will greatly compound the political difficulties triggered by sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM. After the debacle on the currency markets, the Tory Euro-sceptics have gained new confidence - and many new recruits among the previously uncommitted. They are promising a bloody campaign against any move to return sterling to the ERM and against Maastricht ratification. Mr Major, who has spent the past two years rebuilding a pro-European coalition in his party, is seriously weakened. His demeanour over the past few days points also to disillusionment. Cabinet colleagues believe that will be a temporary phenomenon: when Mr Major considers coolly the options, he will conclude as he did two years ago that there is no place for Britain on the periphery of Europe. It may take time. The official message from Whitehall last night was that in its capacity as president of the Community, Britain would now press ahead with the task of securing ratification by the Twelve. But no one should expect too much too quickly. The narrowness of the French vote and evidence across the Community that its citizens are restless with the pace of integration are seen in London as demanding a thorough re-assessment by its leaders of the Community's ambitions. The expectation is that the emergency summit of EC leaders early next month will consider how the voters of Europe can be reassured that Maastricht does not represent the increased centralisation of power in Brussels. The British Foreign Office has been working on plans to give substance to the idea of 'subsidiarity', or decentralisation, enshrined only in outline in the treaty. The summit needs also to co-ordinate a response to Denmark's assessment of the clarifications and changes it would need to persuade its electorate to reverse the rejection of the treaty in a June referendum. The aim is to secure a framework agreement with Copenhagen at the Edinburgh summit in December. More controversially, Mr Major wants the leaders to undertake a detailed examination of the ERM - and in particular of the 'asymmetry' which loads the burden of responsibility for defending existing parities on the governments and central banks of weak currencies. Those with longer memories in Whitehall have few illusions that the Bundesbank - which Mr Major blames for sterling's collapse - would be willing to compromise its independence. It has rejected too often demands from France and Italy that in times of crisis it must share the cost of intervention and demonstrate willingness to cut its interest rates. But Mr Major's domestic politics demand that he uses the presidency to put the issue at the top of the EC agenda. As for ratification of the treaty, the best that the rest of Europe can hope from its presidency is that the House of Commons will be asked again to vote in principle on the issue later in the autumn. Detailed consideration of the legislation will have to wait until next year. Mr Major's oft-repeated aspiration to keep Britain at the heart of Europe remains on hold.</p>

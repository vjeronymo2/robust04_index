			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.15&blank;Factors of Financial Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 668.15(b) (1), (2), and (3) have been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify that, in order to be financially responsible, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must be providing the services described in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official publications and statements; providing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative resources necessary to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of subpart B; and meeting all if its financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations. This is a change from the proposed regulations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have required an institution to demonstrate that it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> able  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to provide and meet these requirements. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes these changes more accurately reflect the intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(4) further defines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirement that an institution be current in its debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments. The Secretary considers an institution to be current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in its long-term debt obligations if it is not in violation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing loan agreements at the end of the institution's fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. The Secretary considers an institution to not be current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in all of its debt obligations whenever the institution is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 120 days delinquent in making payments, and a legal claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been initiated against the institution or a lien has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed on its assets due to the non-payment of the obligation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that an institution's non-payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations is a serious concern because the possibility exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that legal actions brought by creditors may result in forfeiture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of some or all of an institution's assets. Consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that payment delinquencies place the institution at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk, the Secretary notes that such actions are also often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precede an action by creditors to force a company into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(5) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to require that the amount of an institution's required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash reserve shall be one-quarter of the amount the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid in refunds during its previous year, as shown in its audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement. By using historical information specific to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the individual institution, the Secretary provides for adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves for all institutions, rather than establishing an across  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the board measure which would be inadequate for some and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate for others. Also, in response to the comments, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have been changed to require the cash reserve to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained as a cash deposit in a federally insured bank account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or an investment in U.S. Treasury securities, with an original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maturity of three months or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;668.15(b)(6)(ii) that would have provided that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is financially responsible if the institution does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets to meet current operating expenses, has been removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations. This change was made based upon general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations that were presented in the public comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the need to implement consistent standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining financial responsibility for for-profit and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, and to simplify the administrative resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to determine whether institutions were in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to numerous public comments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(A) and (b)(8)(i)(B) have been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that both for-profit institutions and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions must meet an acid test ratio of 1:1 to replace the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed ratio requirements that differed for for-profit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit institutions. The acid test ratio is defined as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sum of cash and current accounts receivable, divided by current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities. The Secretary has kept the regulatory exclusions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they represent capital outflows from an institution that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain provisions for repayment. The Secretary has allowed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of the institution's cash reserve requirement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of the acid test ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment concerning the proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of standards for nonprofit and for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, &sect;668.15(b)(7)(i)(B) has been amended to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a for-profit institution may not have operating losses in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or both years exceeding ten percent of equity capital. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's intent is to determine whether a trend of continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses exists, or if a loss occurs in any one year that it's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude is such that it does not materially impact the equity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution. The Secretary has changed the reference year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in the calculation to be that of the beginning of the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year in the two year period rather than the most recently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(b)(7)(ii),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(8)(ii), and (b)(9)(v) have been added to provide that a for-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profit institution, a nonprofit institution, or a public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may demonstrate that it is financially responsible if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it submits evidence of a superior bond rating as an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to having to meet the tests for financial responsibility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the institution has currently issued an outstanding debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations that are, without insurance, guarantee, or credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhancement rated at or above the second highest level of rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has been changed from the NPRM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to incorporate the existing requirement that a nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution must have a positive unrestricted current fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance or positive unrestricted net assets. This requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unchanged from the former requirement in effect for more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fourteen years that a nonprofit have a positive unrestricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current fund balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 668.15(b)(8)(i)(C)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) has been amended to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a nonprofit institution may not have excess current fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures in either or both of two years that results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease in the current unrestricted fund or a decrease in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unrestricted net assets of greater than ten percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's unrestricted current fund balance or unrestricted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net assets in the beginning of the first year of the two year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. The proposed regulation would have required that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit institution not have a decrease in total net assets of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such significance that if continued would result in a current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio of less than 1:1. As in the requirement for for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, the Secretary's intent is to determine whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trend of continuing excess expenditures exists, or if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant excess expenditure in any one year is so great in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude that it materially affects the unrestricted current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund balance or the unrestricted net assets of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM the Secretary proposed that a public institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is financially responsible only if it has its liabilities backed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the full faith and credit of a state. In response to public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, &sect;668.15(b)(9) has been revised to add three alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a public institution may employ to demonstrate that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible: for institutions reporting under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Single Audit Act, a positive unrestricted current fund balance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a positive unrestricted current fund balance in a state's Higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education Fund, as presented in the general purpose financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements of the state; or the submission of a statement by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Auditor General that the institution has sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources to meet all of its financial obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(d)(ii) has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to identify the circumstances where an institution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to participate fully by showing that it meets certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions to demonstrate that it has sufficient resources to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure against its precipitous closure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public comment, &sect;668.15(e)(3) has been added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify that the submission of an audit performed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the Single Audit Act satisfies the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a submission of an audited financial statement under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.15(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Cabinet backs end to public sector pay ceiling MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, has won cabinet backing for his plan to scrap next year the rigid 1.5 per cent ceiling for public-sector pay settlements. But the government is expected to replace the formula with tight cash limits on the pay bills of the main Whitehall departments. The expectation among ministers is that the overall wage costs of the public sector will not be allowed to grow by more than about 2 per cent. With the annual public spending negotiations now under way Mr Clarke argued that a second year of rigid pay restraint would increase the risk of damaging pay rises when the ceiling was lifted. That view, shared by Mr John Major, has been accepted by colleagues serving on the cabinet committee charged with meeting the government's spending targets. The decision has heightened concern within Whitehall that the government will be unable to avoid significant cuts in capital spending programmes unless it replaces the present formula with a cash limit. The Department of the Environment in particular has warned that it may be impossible to hold down local authority pay without a clear signal on the need for continuing restraint. The Treasury's public spending targets allow for growth in spending of less than 1 per cent a year in real terms for the next three financial years. In spite of a series of negotiations between Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and the ministers responsible for the main spending departments, bids for funds in the 1994-95 financial year are still several billion pounds above the Treasury's Pounds 254bn cash target. Few of the spending ministers have been willing to concede any reductions ahead of the autumn, when the cabinet committee will examine line-by-line all the principal Whitehall budgets.</p>

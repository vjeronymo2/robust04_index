			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza to float with Pounds 34.5m valuation A PRICE of 200p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Canadian Pizza valuing the pizza crust maker at Pounds 34.5m, almost Pounds 5m more than estimated last month but Pounds 5m less than originally indicated by the company's advisers in September. Advisers said Mr Harry Kent, deputy chairman of the company and one of its founders, as well as other shareholders, had been reluctant to see their holdings diluted 'unnecessarily'. Partly for this reason a factory the company was planning to build in continental Europe would now be funded from cash generated internally and debt. This accounted for most of the fall of Pounds 10m from the first company valuation. The Kent family, the largest shareholder, will have an 18 per cent interest after the float, a reduction from 19.5 per cent. The second valuation discrepancy was a function of strong institutional demand for the shares. Dealings in the shares are expected to start on Friday November 19. On forecast pro-forma pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.21m) for 1993, the issue price gives a notional p/e of 15. The board expects to recommend a final dividend of not less than 3.6p. The total 5.9p dividend the directors would have recommended for the year ending December 1993 would give a gross yield of 3.7 per cent. Pro-forma earnings per share are 13.3p. Of the 11.1m shares offered, 64 per cent of the enlarged capital, 68 per cent are being placed firm with institutions and the balance placed subject to clawback for the public offer for sale. The money will be used to repay Pounds 2.5m in senior debt and redeem Pounds 11m in preference shares, including a 10 per cent premium. The float cost Pounds 1m and the company will not be geared on quotation. The last date for applications will be November 10, with dealing starting on November 19. COMMENT The reluctance of existing shareholders to be diluted unecesssarily suggests their awareness of the attractions of the business. However, the company's relatively high pre-tax margins - 14.5 per cent last year going on 17 per cent this year - makes its growing niche vulnerable to invasion by bigger rivals. CP's biggest customers are the stingy supermarkets which account for 50 per cent of sales. But 84 per cent of the company's profits come from crusts, a mere 12 per cent of a chilled pizza's retail selling price. The rating, at a 14 per cent premium to the sector excluding Unilever, limits scope for any significant initial rise.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Inkatha to boycott S African poll: Alliance of rightwing blacks and whites threatens viability of election The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said at the weekend it had decided to join white rightwing parties in opposing South Africa's April elections. The decision increases the threat of election-related violence and raises doubts about whether a poll can be conducted nationwide. Inkatha called on its supporters to boycott the poll and to campaign with the conservative Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) to ensure it is cancelled. Both Inkatha and the AVF were careful to avoid an overt call to violent resistance - Inkatha said it would use only legal methods to oppose the poll and the AVF said it would 'give priority to peaceful means'. But Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, warned that the boycott might bring death and bloodshed. 'It is impossible for me to lie to you and reassure you that the IFP opposition to fighting the elections under the present constitution will not bring casualties and even death,' the Zulu leader told about 10,000 supporters. He called on them to set up self-defence units. 'If we do not defend our people, no one else will. We must defend our communities with all our might. We must defend and fight back. We must resist the African National Congress and their communist surrogates,' he said. The three groups in the rightwing Freedom Alliance - Inkatha, the AVF and the black homeland of Bophuthatswana - allowed a weekend deadline to pass without registering to participate in the election, to be held on April 26-28. Both the government and the ANC said parties could register even after the deadline, but only if progress is made in constitutional negotiations. Meanwhile Mr Kobie Coetsee, defence minister, said South Africa's defence force was taking measures to meed a threat from the white right, adding that the force had withdrawn a large number of weapons issued to white part-time soldiers who had 'abused' them. Inkatha said it remained committed to negotiation and called for international mediation to break the deadlock. But Inkatha officials made clear that the KwaZulu government, which Chief Buthelezi heads, would not allow polling booths to be set up in the homeland. This puts KwaZulu on a collision course with the central government which said it would use 'physical force' to ensure the election takes place. Things threaten to fall apart, Page 12</p>

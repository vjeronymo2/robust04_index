			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daisy Villalobos from the "Facing the Moment" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN]  said on 14 March that the Alfredo Cristiani administration has  not complied with important aspects of the peace agreements.  FMLN leader Leonel Gonzalez [Salvador Sanchez Ceren] listed  four issues that are still pending: public security, land  transfer, the program to return former guerrillas to civilian  life, and compliance with the Truth Commission recommendations.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] In terms of the public security  issue, according to the program to disband the National Police,  there should also be a program to reduce the size of the  organization. This program has been suspended, and, therefore,  the peace plan is not being complied with. Their idea is to  leave about 3,000 national policemen working until October and  later recruit them for the National Civilian Police [PNC]. This  will mark another failure to comply with the agreements. As for  the PNC deployment, according to the agreements, this process  should end in September at the latest, but the government wants  to postpone it until December. A postponement would be another  failure to comply with the peace agreements.    Yet another example of noncompliance is the distortion of  the  PNC. We have pointed out this problem since 1993, but it has  not been corrected. Its civilian nature is not being respected.  In addition, there is no training to ensure that new agents  respect life and human rights. Many PNC agents who are linked  to the [word indistinct] are resorting to the traditional  methods employed by the repressive corps.    As for land transfer, 70 percent of the land has not been  transferred. In other words, about 20,000 people are facing  uncertainty because land has not been transferred to them.    As for the program to return former guerrillas to civilian  life, the most worrisome aspect is that former fighters who  already have land have not yet received loans. The time to sow  is close at hand, and our companeros are not yet sure whether  they will receive the necessary loans to farm the land. [end  recording]    The FMLN accused the government of hindering the advancement  of the pending agreements and noted that there is a new  timetable proposed by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] that  the government has ignored. Leonel Gonzalez believes the  government wants to continue ignoring the agreements to punish  former fighters, dodge its responsibility, and merge the  National Police with the PNC.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Beattie warns on current half JAMES BEATTIE, the Wolverhampton-based department store group, derived a third of its Pounds 9m pre-tax profit from interest income in the year to January 31. It was the ninth year of growth in taxable profits. However, the company warned that the first half of this year would not match the Pounds 3m achieved in the six months to July 1990. Sir Eric Pountain, the non-executive chairman, said that the decline in interest rates would reduce this source of income ahead of a restoration of consumer confidence. Trading profit last year fell to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 6.28m). Mr Malcolm Smart, a director and company secretary, said margins had been squeezed because of lower prices. Interest and investment income rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 2.5m). The amount of cash held expanded by Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 23.9m. The pre-tax figure advanced from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 9.02m on turnover of Pounds 67.12m (Pounds 64.18m). Heavy snow in December reduced sales by nearly Pounds 1m. The group opened a new store in Burton-upon-Trent in the autumn, bringing its total to seven. Capital spending fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 3.6m), but is likely to rise substantially this year as most of the Pounds 7m earmarked to build a new store in Worcester goes out. A plan for a new store in Macclesfield has been abandoned because the developer failed to find sufficient finance. Earnings per share rose to 13.03p (12.51p). The proposed final dividend is increased to 4.1p, making a total of 5.5p (5p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. Ambassador James Cheek on 14 March said that on  21 March U.S. Vice President Al Gore will propose to President  Carlos Menem the need for Congress to pass a law creating the  status of repentant within a group of new legal weapons against  drug trafficking. Cheek thus confirmed what was reported by  CLARIN on 14 March.    In order that Gore's proposal not sound like diplomatic  pressure, Secretary for the Prevention of Drug Abuse Alberto  Lestelle said "it is very probable" that Gore and President  Menem will discuss this sensitive subject. "There is absolute  coordination between Argentina and the United States on this  subject," Lestelle pointed out.    During a news conference on 14 March to report on Gore's  agenda here, Cheek said the "United States has been suggesting  and endorsing the laws approved by Congress that, I understand,  are supported by the Argentine Government and the majority of  Congress."    In order to clarify any doubt, the U.S. ambassador added:  "We have stressed the need for the approval of these laws in  order to give the Argentine Government the necessary  cooperation." In this manner, Cheek referred to the draft bills  that create the status of repentant, informer, undercover agent,  and controlled delivery of drug shipments, which the powerful  DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) demands to make the struggle  against drug trafficking in our country "more efficient." DEA  experts believe that with these new laws drug traffickers can be  fought "more efficiently."    Besides asking to approve these laws, Washington also wants  the military to give their logistical support to the security  forces in this struggle, although it understands that "for the  time being" it is not necessary. U.S. Antinarcotics Under  Secretary Robert Gelbard [title as published] last week gave  signals about these two subjects to officials from the Argentine  Foreign and Interior Ministries and the Secretariat for the  Prevention of Drug Abuse.    Following a ceremony in the Communications Secretariat  headed  by Oscar Gonzalez, Ambassador Cheek referred to the U.S.  interest in the approval of a law including, among other  subjects, the status of repentant.    The U.S. concern over these laws began to be expressed  mainly  after the Mar del Plata Penal Court for Economic Crimes released  Colombian John Arroyave Arias, who was involved in the Shrimp  Operation.    After learning about Cheek's statements, Lestelle said he  believes the draft bill he sent to Congress 20 days ago "will be  approved before the end of the year, if the congressmen decide  so."    Lestelle added: "We rejected a draft bill approved by the  lower house because it lacks the status of repentant."    Radical Civic Union [UCR] congressmen nonetheless unleashed  a  storm. UCR Deputy Gaston Ortiz Maldonado, vice president of the  Chamber of Deputies Drug Addiction Committee, labeled Lestelle's  decision to send a new draft bill to Congress as "untimely"  given that the lower house already had approved a bill he  himself drafted.</p>

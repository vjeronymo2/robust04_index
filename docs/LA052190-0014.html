			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARNES MOVES CENTER STAGE TO GET RECORD;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: TRUE TO HIS WORD, HE BREAKS WORLD SHOTPUT MARK ON HIS SECOND  TRY WITH A THROW OF 75-10 1/4.  </P> <P> Sometimes when the stage is set for a world record performance, the show  doesn't live up to expectations.  </P> <P> Randy Barnes was concerned that the setting was too perfect for him to break  the world record in the shotput Sunday at Jack in the Box Invitational at  UCLA's Drake Stadium.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he did it on his second attempt, a throw of 75 feet 10 1/4 inches,  breaking the world record of 75-8 set by East Germany's Ulf Timmermann in 1988.  Barnes earned $50,000.  </P> <P> "With all the press that was here and the coverage, the balloons and the money,  you knew that the timing was right," Barnes said. "But I figured everything was  too perfect right now. I figured the pressure would be too great, or something  would happen to screw it up.  </P> <P> "I'm not usually cynical like that, but it happened like it should. Everything  was right and I was ready."  </P> <P> Not only did Barnes, 23, break the world record, his series was the best ever:  71-10, 75-10 1/4, 73-11 3/4, 73-7 1/2, 73-3 1/2 and 74-8 1/4 -- an average of  73-10 3/4.  </P> <P> Barnes said he had his best opening throw.  </P> <P> Then, with the attention of the announced crowd of 5,672 centering on the  shotput ring, with balloons bordering the area and a massive sign reading  "75-8" planted in the landing zone, Barnes responded on his second try.  </P> <P> The 16-pound ball kicked up dirt near the wooden barrier at the end of the  landing area that is estimated at 80 feet from the throwing ring.  </P> <P> "I thought it was farther than it was," Barnes said, "but I didn't want to get  too excited too fast."  </P> <P> Barnes had said earlier in the week that he was ready to set a world record,  putting some pressure on himself.  </P> <P> He also said he had a "mind-blowing" throw while practicing at Fallbrook High.  He wouldn't reveal the distance at the time, but he said Sunday that his  practice throw, even though he fouled doing it, was measured at 79-2 1/2.  </P> <P> As for his world record, Barnes said: "It didn't feel like a dream throw.  Technically, it wasn't perfect. The release wasn't as solid as I have felt in  the past. I truly believe there was a chance to go farther.  </P> <P> "I felt so good. Usually my big ones come on my last throw, and I don't have  time to really enjoy them.  </P> <P> "Part of me wanted to pack it in, to enjoy the throw. Then I realized, 'Don't  cut yourself short.' My training has been so phenomenal that I wanted to jump  on every throw I could.  </P> <P> "I still have that 79-2 looming over my head, so I know that there's more. I  want to take time to enjoy this, but I want to keep pushing for it. I have too  much work under my belt."  </P> <P> Barnes also broke the pending American record of 73-10 3/4, set by John Brenner  in 1987; and surpassed the 75-foot throw by Brian Oldfield in 1975. That was an  unofficial world and American record but wasn't sanctioned because Oldfield was  a professional.  </P> <P> "Brian has always been the best in my mind, so it feels like quite an  accomplishment to surpass his mark," Barnes said.  </P> <P> Barnes isn't sure what he is going to do with his $50,000 bonus, out of which  he will repay the $5,200 meet officials spent on insurance against a world  record.  </P> <P> "I'm building a house in West Virginia, maybe I can use it on that, or check  out a car," Barnes said.  </P> <P> Barnes said he felt like a caged lion while sitting in his hotel room Saturday  night.  </P> <P> "You know you're ready and you're not doing anything," he said. "You're just  sitting there burning energy and wondering whether you had one too many  practice throws. You want to get on with it."  </P> <P> Other noteworthy performances Sunday:  </P> <P>  -- Roger Kingdom, the world record-holder and two-time Olympic gold medalist,  won the 110-meter hurdles in 13.37 seconds in his 1990 outdoor debut.  </P> <P>  -- Joe Falcon, a former Arkansas star, pulled away from the field with 600  yards left in the mile and won in 3:56.22. Steve Scott, the American  record-holder, was second in 3:57.32.  </P> <P>  -- PattiSue Plumer won the women's mile in 4:29.54. Romania's Paula Ivan, the  world record-holder and 1988 Olympic 1,500-meter gold medalist at Seoul, was a  struggling fifth in 4:38.56.  </P> <P>  -- Danny Everett, a former UCLA star, won the 400 meters in 44.72 and was  timed in 45 flat for 440 yards, short of the world record of 44.5 set by John  Smith, now a UCLA assistant track coach, in 1971.  </P> <P> Track Notes  </P> <P> Randy Barnes had a warmup throw Sunday of about 77 feet. His world record was  the third set in the invitational meet. Others were Renaldo Nehemiah, 110-meter  high hurdles, 13.00, 1979; and Tom Petranoff, javelin, 327-2, 1983. . . . Roger  Kingdom was asked about a possible challenge from Tony Dees this year. Dees ran  a wind-aided 13.09 in the 110-meter high hurdles at the recent Modesto  Invitational. "I'm still No. 1-ranked in the world and the world record-holder.  He has to come after me", Kingdom said. . . . Joe Falcon, who won the mile,  said his goal is to be ranked No. 1 in the United States in the 1,500 meters  this year. He was ranked No. 3 in 1989. "I skipped the TAC (Athletics Congress)  meet last year and that was a mistake,"he said. "I won't do it this year." . .  . Danny Everett said his goal this year is to break 44 seconds in the 400 and  20 seconds in the 200.  </P> <P> MEN'S ALL-TIME SHOTPUT LIST  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.11IN:3.54IN:2.66IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS"

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 18 (CNS) -- Member of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) and Hong Kong Affairs Adviser, Mr. Yu  Kwok-chun, speaking in an interview with the Hong Kong China  News Agency, expressed that early preparations for the issuance  of passports of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region  (SAR) and consultation with foreign countries on mutual  exemption of visas was an important matter for the smooth  transition of Hong Kong, adding that if the British Hong Kong  government was sincere to maintain the prosperity and stability  in the territory, it should engage in active coordination to the  issuing of such passports.    Mr. Yu said that it was very necessary for the Preliminary  Committee [as received] for the Preparatory Committee of the SAR  as well as its security affairs group to discuss at present the  preparatory work on the issuance of the SAR passports, since  there were only more than three years to come from now on to the  hand-over of sovereignty right of Hong Kong in 1997. In this  period, the preliminary work on this matter should be carried  out. In addition, such passports should be publicized and  popularized overseas in order to make them acceptable in more  countries and passports issued by foreign countries would be, in  return, recognized in Hong Kong.    Mr. Yu pointed out that the issuance in advance of SAR's  passports to those China's citizens who were holding permanent  residential identity cards certainly required the British Hong  Kong Government to provide related materials of passport  applicants, the issuance of this kind of passports must be  responsible both for Hong Kong people and those countries by  which these passports were accepted therefore they could not be  issued in an irresponsible way.    The adviser held that should the work of the passport  issuance be done after 1997, the two kinds of passports would  not dovetail, creating inconveniences for Hong Kong residents in  their travels and businesses overseas as well as unfavorable  influence to the territory.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / EC ministers fail to find budget answer EC foreign ministers failed yesterday to break the impasse over the EC budget, one of the vital issues needed to pave the way for a successful summit in Edinburgh. The UK played down growing expectations that its plan would raise the Community's budget ceiling. At the same time, Spain remained adamant it would not budge from its demand that 'cohesion' finance be doubled for the four poorest member states. 'Better no agreement at Edinburgh than a bad one,' said a Spanish minister, making clear Madrid was willing to play a long game. 'There are plenty of other cities and lots of other dates.' Foreign ministers, in Brussels for a two-day meeting ahead of the Edinburgh summit on Friday, were also trying to clear the way for agreement at Edinburgh on ratification of the Maastricht treaty by Denmark and the UK, enlargement of the EC, and decentralised decision-making or 'subsidiarity.' 'We are still in three groups of four,' said a UK presidency official. Spain has the firm backing of the other three 'cohesion' countries: Ireland, Portugal and Greece. The UK's Treasury-dictated line has the support of Germany, the Netherlands, and - with nuances - Italy. Wobbling in the middle are France - on the look-out for support in its opposition to the Uruguay Round farm deal - Denmark, Belgium and Luxembourg. Neither Germany nor Italy, however, are unconditional allies of the UK. Bonn is hardening its ideas on how to cut back the budget rebate Britain has received since 1985 (worth around Pounds 2bn a year), even though the UK says this is non-negotiable. Italy, the Dutch, and others could join in this assault. The UK 10 days ago presented a 'compromise' on the so-called Delors II future financing plan. This would mean an increase in the annual budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54.04bn) now to Ecu79.4bn (1992 money) in 1999. The original Delors II package wanted a rise of nearly a third, to Ecu87.5bn - and by 1997. However, Mr Delors last month offered to stretch a smaller increase over seven years, getting to Ecu80.2bn by 1997 and Ecu86.2bn by 1999. The Commission's revision would raise total fiscal transfers for regional and cohesion spending from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu27.3bn in 1997 and Ecu30.2bn in 1999. This is close to what Spain and its allies want, but at the expense of increases in other areas.</p>

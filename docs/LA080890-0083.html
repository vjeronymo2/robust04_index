			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL TEASE SCHABARUM KEEPS THE 1ST DISTRICT GUESSING ON ELECTION PLANS  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum, ever the political flirt, now says that running for  the 1st District seat under a court-ordered plan intended to elect a Latino to  the all-white board is a "serious option."  </P> <P> How serious?  </P> <P> "Sammy Serious is my middle name," said Schabarum, who played a central role in  the legal fight over whether new political boundaries were needed to create  opportunities on the board for nonwhites.  </P> <P> In March, Schabarum announced he was retiring from the board because being a  supervisor was not "as much fun as other things these days."  </P> <P> But on Tuesday, the conservative supervisor said Judge David V. Kenyon's  decision on Friday to implement a drastic redistricting plan had altered his  thinking about the race.  </P> <P> Schabarum teasingly refused to elaborate, saying there were "too many unknowns  to expand" on his vague hint. Pressed further by reporters, Schabarum squeezed  his lips and hummed.  </P> <P> Kenyon ruled that the county had intentionally discriminated against Latino  voters by diluting their voting power. He ordered that new district boundaries  be drawn to increase a Latino's chances of winning a seat on the powerful  five-man board. Under Kenyon's order, Schabarum's old district will be  dominated by Latino voters.  </P> <P> Schabarum's handpicked successor, Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien, has  expressed a reluctance to re-enter the race under the new district lines.  O'Brien had finished second behind Schabarum's former aide, Sarah Flores, in  the June primary, forcing a runoff between the two. They would be eligible to  run for the seat still, as would Schabarum, even though they no longer live in  the 1st District.  </P> <P> Asked when he would decide whether to run, Schabarum said, "Certainly before  the filing deadline," which is Aug. 24. Schabarum's aide, Judy Hammond,  confirmed that the supervisor has made inquiries about the candidate filing  period with the county registrar-recorder.  </P> <P> Reaction to Schabarum's musing was swift, and largely negative.  </P> <P> "Pete can run, but he can't hide," said Los Angeles City Councilman Richard  Alatorre, who is a likely candidate for the new district seat. "He has a record  to defend . . . a record that is inconsistent with the needs and aspirations of  the community."  </P> <P> Alatorre said that Schabarum's potential candidacy is just a "spiteful" act,  intended to gum up the election that could potentially elect the first Latino  to the board.  </P> <P> Flores, who is the only announced candidate in the new district, said, "May the  best man, uh, person, win."  </P> <P> When asked why Schabarum would consider running again, Flores said, "because  he's Pete. He always likes to keep people guessing. . . . He's just trying to  create a wrinkle."  </P> <P> Schabarum's board colleagues were not surprised by Schabarum's statements, and  they were not pleased at the prospect of him staying on the board.  </P> <P> Fellow conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said he was disappointed. "He's  burned a lot of bridges. I would not be unhappy if he left," said Dana.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich said it would be "hypocritical" for the four-term  Schabarum to run when he is pushing a ballot measure limiting local officials  to two terms. Antonovich conceded that Schabarum would be a "heavyweight"  candidate even in the heavily Democratic and Latino district.  </P> <P> "He has name recognition and a campaign treasury," Antonovich said.  </P> <P> Other potential candidates for the district include Los Angels City  Councilwoman Gloria Molina and U.S. Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles),  Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente).  These Latino officials have vowed to present a united front in the race.  </P> <P> The county has appealed Kenyon's ruling in favor of the redistricting and his  adoption of the new political boundaries. The appeal has yet to be heard by a  higher court.  </P></p>

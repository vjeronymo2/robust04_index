			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: MORMONS' DATES SET A 'DIFFERENT' STANDARD  </P> <P> The movie was rated "PG," so he thought it a safe choice for his night on the  town. Initial impressions can be deceiving, however. Midway through the film,  that modern Hollywood requisite -- The Bedroom Scene -- staged a surprise  attack.  </P> <P> So Scott Boyenger, 19, walked out of the theater.  </P> <P> "My date was all, 'You're so weird,' " recalled the Huntington Beach resident,  employing typical teen-age vernacular.  </P> <P> Usually Boyenger dates only young women who, like himself, are Mormons --  members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Otherwise, his  social life might become a series of disastrous outings like the one he cited.  </P> <P> "I feel more comfortable dating Mormons because I know that they have the same  standards I have," agreed Melissa Pinkston, also 19. "Generally speaking, I  know that they're not going to try anything."  </P> <P> Her remark elicited a unified guffaw from her group of friends, all present to  talk about the art of Mormon dating.  </P> <P> Mormons are different from the world at large, and they're proud to admit it.  Church rules dictate that they don't drink, smoke, curse, listen to racy songs,  watch racy movies, or engage in premarital sex.  </P> <P> Thus, their dating experience is different, as well.  </P> <P> "Different," however, is not synonymous with "difficult." In fact, meeting  prospective mates may be much easier for Mormons than for the general  population; a major function of the church is the care and fostering of  relationships. Mormons even organize wards -- roughly, the Protestant/Catholic  equivalent of congregations -- specifically for the unattached.  </P> <P> Of about 100 wards in Orange County, serving 47,000 local Mormons, six are  designated for "young single adults." Bishop Gary Nelson oversees one such  ward, based in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "One of the goals is marriage and family within the church, and this is a good  way for Mormons to meet one another," Nelson said. "We've had over 100  marriages (among members of his ward) in the 3 1/2 years that I've been  bishop."  </P> <P> The singles' wards sponsor dances almost every weekend. Occasionally, two or  three wards will combine forces for a social event so that young Mormons  throughout Orange County can interact.  </P> <P> On Sunday afternoons, Nelson leads his 300-member congregation in discussions  about courtship and marriage. "They find strength from one another in trying to  live in a world that doesn't practice their same standards," he said. "We teach  the law of chastity -- total abstinence before marriage -- which sets us  apart."  </P> <P> Nelson often counsels unmarried couples about sexual attraction. "We hope  they'll seek us out before it becomes a problem," he said. "One of my main  responsibilities as bishop is to help young people avoid (premarital sex)."  </P> <P> While the church allows dating -- and even marriage -- with non-members, it  encourages otherwise, Nelson said: "As a safety valve, we recommend to kids  that serious dating take place within the membership. It's not that we think  we're better than the rest of the world; it's just that it's easier for kids to  find support among their Mormon peers."  </P> <P> "When you date a Mormon, you date someone who has the same principles as you,"  Boyenger said.  </P> <P> Not only do they prefer dating within their religion, Boyenger and his buddies  said that they would rather hang out with fellow Mormons in most all social  settings. "I don't feel comfortable going to non-Mormon parties because I end  up being the only person who's sober," said Michelle Molinari, 20, of Anaheim.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Ted Moore, 22, of Huntington Beach, enjoyed dating  non-Mormon girls in high school. "It's fun meeting people who think differently  from yourself," he said. "A lot of girls would make the comment, 'I feel safe  around you,' which was a compliment to me."  </P> <P> Wholesome, "safe" Mormons indeed can make appealing dates for outsiders, the  friends said. "I once had a (non-Mormon) guy ask me to a New Year's Eve dance  because his grandparents were going to be there, and he wanted to take someone  they'd approve of," said Denise Newburg, 19, of Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Although most of the group said that they have dated non-members, all plan to  marry Mormons. One of the dangers in dating outside their church, they added,  is the possibility of falling in love with someone who does not share their  beliefs.  </P> <P> Moore admitted that he and a non-Mormon developed crushes on one another in  high school. "Her parents didn't want her to join the church and made us stop  dating," he said. "I was bummed out."  </P> <P> Statistically, Mormons marry young -- before the age of 25. "Most people (in  the general population) don't get married until they've gone to college and  started their careers. Our church says, no, those things shouldn't get in the  way of marriage; you can be married and go to school at the same time," said  Molinari, who plans to marry her fiance, Brian Peterson, 21, this October.  </P> <P> Unlike many modern singles, Mormons do not stall their relationships in a  lengthy holding pattern before tying the knot. "We don't grab the first person  we see, but then again, when we find someone we're compatible with, we don't  date them for five years," Molinari explained. "The mystique would wear off,  and you'd never get around to marrying them. And you'd end up an old maid."  </P> <P> "(Church counselors) say that within three or four months, you should know if a  person is right for you," Boyenger said.  </P> <P> Besides, Molinari interjected with humorous candor, "it would be difficult to  date someone for two years and stay celibate."  </P> <P> so we might as well do it.' "  </P> <P> The church advises group dating, to reduce the risk of overly romantic  interludes. "It's recommended that there not be a lot of kissing because that  might lead to something else," Boyenger said.  </P> <P> But, Pinkston quickly clarified, "They don't say not to kiss, either. If you're  going to do anything, make it kissing."  </P> <P> An advantage of saving sexual intimacy for marriage is that partners start with  a clean slate, devoid of pre-learned expectations, said Pinkston. "You can't  compare because you don't have anything to compare it to."  </P> <P> Additionally, premarital relationships are founded on more than physical  affection, she said: "You can sit down and talk to each other."  </P> <P> "You better like talking to each other because after a while (sex) probably  gets old, anyway, and you're back to talking," Moore said, winning a round of  laughter.  </P> <P> Because the church teaches members to sidestep temptation by shirking  un-Mormon-like influences -- Hollywood bedroom scenes, for example -- finding  an acceptable movie for a date can be tricky. The group endorsed "Field of  Dreams" and "Tucker" as examples of good, clean entertainment.  </P> <P> "You know how many swear words were in 'Top Gun'? I counted: 77," Pinkston  said. "That's not necessary; that's not the sort of thing I want to put in my  head."  </P> <P> Mormons, Newburg concluded, have to be "creative" when it comes to dating. "We  don't go to bars; we don't drink; we don't go to R-rated movies. We make our  own fun. We get together and play games. We have dances."  </P> <P> Do Mormons like rock 'n' roll? "Of course," Newburg said. "We even have disc  jockeys from (rock stations) KLOS and KROQ emcee our dances. Contrary to  popular belief, we don't sing hymns while we're dancing."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ball Bearings Ruling Issued: The Commerce Department issued a final ruling that  anti-friction bearings from nine countries were being sold unfairly in the  United States, paving the way for permanent anti-dumping duties. It said the  nations were West Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden,  Thailand and Britain. The department also said Singapore and Thailand were  "dumping" bearings on the U.S. market at less than fair value. Duties being  imposed average 10% to 80%, with the highest at 212%, meaning that prices would  have to be raised by that percent to bring them to a fair value.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR GALLEGLY?  </P> <P> A couple of months ago Rep. Elton Gallegly wrote to a newspaper implying he is  proud of his congressional voting record. But what has he really done for his  constituents?  </P> <P> He did not bring home one cent of our hard-earned tax dollars for federal  projects, which could have provided jobs, increased revenues for federal  projects, which could have provided jobs, increased revenues for local business  and stimulated local economies.  </P> <P> As to the issue of senior citizens, his voting record shows that time and again  he was not looking out for their best interests. This was also viewed by the  National Council of Senior Citizens, which gave him a 7% out of 100% average  rating for his first three years in office. As an example, in 1988, he voted to  lower funding for senior meals, programs, employment, transportation and senior  centers.  </P> <P> If he is so interested in tougher laws in regard to the war on drugs, why did  he vote against a law to help law enforcement track down billions of dollars of  poison profits of drug lords who send money out of the country by international  wire transfer? Is it because he gets campaign contributions from big banking  interests who are opposed to this bill?  </P> <P> I think he needs to take a closer look at his voting record and then answer,  what accomplishments, Congressman Gallegly?  </P> <P> SHOSHANA BROWER  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

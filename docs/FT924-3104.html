			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (6): Mercury link may be only a start - Profile of BCE LIMITED growth opportunities and stiffening competition at home are driving many Canadian companies to broaden their horizons. Among the most prominent is BCE, the Montreal-based telecommunications and financial services group. BCE's latest foray abroad was its purchase in mid-November of a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications, Britain's second-biggest telephone company. As part of the deal, Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, is to become a partner in BCE's cable TV business in the UK. 'We were interested in getting closer to a company which had geographical reach,' says Mr Red Wilson, BCE's president. 'I see it as the beginning of an alliance where, we hope, C&amp;W and ourselves are going to have a lot to do in common in the future.' BCE already has a sizeable international presence through its 53 per cent stake in Northern Telecom, the telecommunications equipment maker. Thanks largely to its acquisition last year of Britain's STC, Northern now makes more than a fifth of its sales outside North America. BCE itself is part of a consortium which set up Clear Communications, New Zealand's second phone company; one of its executives is Clear's general manager. The Canadian company owns 49 per cent of a fledgling digital telephone network in Moscow, and a subsidiary has cellular franchises in Mexico City and New Delhi. BCE's international thrust is driven by the limited opportunities on its home turf. It is already Canada's biggest public company, with annual revenues of about CDollars 20bn, and the only one to have posted net earnings of more than a billion dollars a year. Its cash cow, wholly-owned Bell Canada, has a virtual monopoly on phone services to the 15m residents of Ontario and Quebec, and has stakes in several other provincial telephone companies. Bell's dominance of the domestic market makes further expansion difficult within Canada. At the same time, regulatory barriers which have protected provincial phone utilities from competition are gradually being lowered. A rival long-distance service is currently being set up and cut-price resellers are gaining an ever bigger share of corporate telephone business. Mr Wilson says that Bell is earmarking a growing slice of its resources to marketing. Getting a toehold in the international telephone business has not been easy. BCE's US partner pulled out at the last minute of a bid for a stake in Telefonos de Mexico; a bid with Bell Atlantic (no relation to Bell Canada) in the privatisation of Venezuela's phone company was also unsuccessful. BCE hopes the alliance with Cable &amp; Wireless will give it the long-sought springboard into the international telephone business. The chairmen and chief executives of the two companies plan to get together twice a year to explore opportunities. They have yet to discuss specific joint ventures. But Mr Wilson says that both companies recognise that south-east Asia 'is one part of the world where we can work together'. A senior Bell Canada man is to take over the reins of one of Mercury's divisions and Mr Wilson expects that half-a-dozen operating people will be seconded to Mercury at any one time. 'We wanted to be sure we would be an active player in Mercury and not just an investor,' he says. BCE has laid the groundwork for its international telecoms thrust by retreating from other businesses. It expects to raise about CDollars 650m before the end of the year as warrants on its remaining shares in TransCanada PipeLines are exercised. Another CDollars 142m came recently from the sale of two US telephone directory advertising firms. A wholly-owned trust company, Montreal Trust, will probably end up as part of a larger financial institution. BCE's problem child remains an ill-advised investment which it made in a large property developer in the mid-1980s. It wrote off its 67 per cent equity stake in BF Realty (previously known as BCE Development) three years ago, but continues to have a debt exposure of over CDollars 400m to the near-bankrupt company's principal subsidiary.</p>

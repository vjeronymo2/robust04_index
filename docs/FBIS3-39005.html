			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Alison Little, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Chinese ambassador to London was warned today by  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd over his reported claims that UK  firms would suffer in his country because of arguments over  democratic reforms for Hong Kong.    Ma Yuzhen was reported as saying at the weekend that anger  in  China over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's plans meant British  companies' "client relationship" and "public relations" would  compare unfavourably with that for French, German and American  firms.    Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee  that British officials had raised the matter with Mr Ma and that  his remarks were discussed at yesterday's meeting of EU foreign  ministers in Brussels.    Mr Hurd said he was aware of suggestions to businessmen  "that  British interests will suffer as a result of discrimination  against them in the China market because of the arguments over  Hong Kong."    But he said: "I am not saying he is exceeding his functions,  but I think British businesmen would be well advised not to take  his analysis at face value.    "That kind of discimination for political reasons is  something which the EU would have to take very seriously and  would take very seriously."    A spokesman confirmed Mr Ma was called to the Foreign Office  "within the last week" in response to his statements.    David Wright, deputy under-secretary with responsibility for  Asia, had told him such remarks to British companies in China  were "unhelpful."    Mr Hurd, defending Mr Patten, said: "The Chinese have chosen  to focus their opposition to some of his proposals -- put  forward of course with our full knowledge and agreement -- to  personalise that disagreement on Mr Patten to some extend.    "I think that's a pity. I think that gets in the way of  sorting these matters out as we would wish to do."    He said the Chinese were given advance notice of Mr Patten's  1992 speech in which he first set out his democratic proposals,  and the UK had stressed it was open for discussion: "Throughout  we have sought to act by agreement, because it obviously makes  sense if possible to reach agreement. We continue to seek  agreement. It has been elusive, but that is not our fault."    He stressed it was in China's interests to take over a  flourishing and confident Hong Kong, and he hoped Beijing's  appreciation of that fact would prevail and talks could resume.    Mr Hurd also told the committee the UK would continue to  raise human rights issues with China "regardless of events or  agreements or disagreements in Hong Kong.... There has been no  soft peddling."    But he conceded the UK's progress in tackling human rights  with Beijing could be "measured in teaspoonfuls...frustratingly  slow."    Asked if China's application to join General Agreement on  Tarriffs and Trade might be linked to its improving its human  rights record, he said: "I don't at the moment feel, and the EU  doesn't feel, that it is in our interests to attach a human  rights conditionality to China's Gatt application. There are  quite strong reasons from our point of view for China joining  the GATT."</p>

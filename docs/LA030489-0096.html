			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP LED BY JACOBS PROPOSES TO BUY SHAKLEE FOR $528 MILLION  </P> <P> A group led by Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs announced Friday a  long-anticipated proposal to buy Shaklee Corp., a marketer of foods, vitamins  and personal care products, in a deal valuing the company at $528 million.  </P> <P> Jacobs has been steadily buying shares in San Francisco-based Shaklee, and his  investment group already holds close to 15% of the company's 13.2 million  outstanding shares. In response, Shaklee has taken steps to prevent a possible  takeover attempt.  </P> <P> In February, Shaklee sold a 78% stake in its profitable Japanese subsidiary to  Tokyo's Yananouchi Pharmaceutical for $350 million. On Thursday, it declared a  $20-a-share special dividend for stockholders.  </P> <P> But Jacobs, whose tentative offer for Shaklee amounts to $40 a share, told the  Dow Jones News Service on Friday that "we didn't think too much of the dividend  and the market clearly didn't either. We think Shaklee Corp. is worth more than  the value the market is putting on it."  </P> <P> The buyout offer was revealed after the close of trading on the New York Stock  Exchange on Friday. In composite trading, Shaklee closed at $34 a share, down  50 cents. The stock rose $4 a share after Shaklee sold the stake in its  Japanese unit, but the shares have not risen above $36.25 in the last year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colorful Past  </P> <P> Dan Williams, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, told United  Press International that the offer was slightly higher than he would have  expected for Shaklee. "I'm a little hard pressed to explain what is the  attraction of the company," Williams said.  </P> <P> Shaklee, which sells its products through a international network of 10,000  independent distributors, has had a colorful past. It was founded in 1956 by  the late Forrest C. Shaklee Sr., a chiropractor, and his two sons, Raleigh L.  and Forrest Jr.  </P> <P> From the beginning, the elder Shaklee pitched the company's products as in  "harmony with nature," a theme the company continues. But over the years, the  elder Shaklee was accused of making outrageous health claims about the  products, and the Food and Drug Administration charged in 1976 that the company  mislabeled some of its goods.  </P> <P> Motivated by cash, cars and convention trips, Shaklee's sales agents  traditionally have been very loyal to the company and fervent in their  recruitment of additional distributors. In recent years, however, the company  has lost some of its luster. With more women in the work force seeking  full-time jobs, the company has been hard-pressed to maintain its sales force.  </P> <P> In addition, some analysts considered the company's Japanese operations, which  have accounted for 40% of the company's earnings, among its most valuable  assets.  </P> <P> The conditional offer from the Jacobs group, which includes Minneapolis  investor Carl R. Pohlad, has a provision to reduce the price by $20 a share if  Shaklee actually pays its special dividend to shareholders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earnings Improved  </P> <P> David M. Chamberlain, Shaklee's president and chief executive, said the letter  from Jacobs outlining the takeover proposal had been referred to the company's  directors. Chamberlain declined additional comment.  </P> <P> Shaklee's sales and earnings improved in 1988 over the prior year, but the  company's profits were far below what it reported in 1986.  </P> <P> In 1988, Shaklee earned $27.2 million, up 16% from 1987. Sales rose to $627  million from $572 million in the prior year. The company said the improved  earnings reflected sales growth in its Bear Creek subsidiary, the nation's  largest direct mail marketer of fruit and gourmet foods.  </P></p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / US Money and Credit: Wall St divided on strength of rally THE US credit market reached a historic landmark on Friday when the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell below 6 per cent for the first time in its 16-year life. But, amid the celebrating, Wall Street Cassandras were quick to wonder how soon the remarkable bond market rally of the past few months might go into sharp reverse. The factor which finally took the long bond through 6 per cent was a surprisingly poor unemployment report for August on Friday morning, which suggested at first glance that the economy was growing more weakly than expected. By the close of trading, the issue was showing a yield of 5.94 per cent, down from 6.14 per cent a week earlier. The rest of the yield curve also dipped by 20 - 22 basis points, with the 10-year note ending the week at 5.28 per cent. With US interest rates at their lowest in 25 years, investors face a dilemma: is the bond rally of the past six weeks a sign of a seriously overheated market, which is bound to end in a sharp correction and an upward turn in the interest rate cycle? In short, is the bond market rally about to peak out? Or does the rally mean the market is entering a new trading range, reflecting an economy facing a prolonged period of low growth and low inflation, and that this could push interest rates down even further, back to the level of the 1960s? Wall Street is divided. Few analysts forecast the long bond would breach 6 per cent, yet after the event many argue that the bull rally remains relatively secure, though it is bound to suffer short-term corrections. A minority, however, warn that the market is seriously overbought. The main factors behind the rally provide ammunition for both camps. First, many statistics suggest US economic growth remains subdued, and President Bill Clinton's tax increases and healthcare reforms could further retard expansion. However, last week the government revised its estimate of second-quarter GDP growth up to 1.8 per cent, compared to the 1.6 per cent initially reported. And August's employment statistics were not nearly as bad as the headline figures would suggest. Businesses may not be hiring new workers, yet hours worked are rising at a respectable 2.5 per cent annual rate. Coincidentally, the surprisingly poor August figures came exactly a year after very similar statistics prompted the Federal Reserve into its last easing move, and some of Friday's bond rally may have stemmed from hopes of a repeat performance by the central bank. Yet the Fed seems unlikely to change a rates regime which, by underscoring its anti-inflation hawkishness, has been a powerful contributor to the current rally. Nor do there appear to be any significant inflationary clouds on the horizon. The only statistic of note to be released this week will be Friday's producer price index for August. The overall PPI may show the first rise in four months, but the increase is expected to be modest, at around 0.2 to 0.3 per cent. Apart from economic fundamentals, market forces driving the bond market rally have included the Clinton administration's reduction in the supply of 30-year bonds, and heavy demand from both banks, taking advantage of the steep yield curve, and mutual fund investors seeking higher returns. Flows of cash into bond funds jumped 22 per cent in July to a record Dollars 13bn. There are no immediate signs of this tide turning, yet mutual fund investors could prove volatile if a run of adverse economic statistics suggests the market is peaking out. Any correction - be it the turn of the interest rate cycle or not - could prove nasty.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Employee share trust move - At a glance New Finance Bill clauses accepted this week by the government will make it easier for companies to establish and operate employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs). It will no longer be necessary for the majority of the trustees to be employee representatives, and the maximum period for which shares can be retained in the trust is being increased from seven years to 20. ESOTs have until now been shunned by all but a handful of companies and these changes are designed to boost the take-up rate.</p>

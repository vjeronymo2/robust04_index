			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maks Khazin report: "Volgograd Authorities No Longer Suing </F> IZVESTIYA"]    [Text] The Volgograd Oblast Administration had sued the  IZVESTIYA Editorial Office and its own correspondent V. Kornev,  demanding that it repudiate the information contained in his  article "Volgograd Authorities Still Opposed to Reform"  (IZVESTIYA No. 95, 22 May 1993). Incidentally, it took the  authorities five months to decide whether to deny the report or  not. Clearly, they were helped to make the "right" decision by  the approaching elections.    The first judge to receive the case disqualified herself --  the local administration had promised to allocate an apartment  to the Volgograd Central Rayon People's Court, and the judge  considered that she had no right, as an interested party, to  hear her "benefactor's" suit. Nonetheless, the case remained  with the same court.    The hearing of the case was tendentious. The plaintiffs did  not show up at all for the first two sessions, yet there were no  consequences. On the other hand, representatives of the  editorial office were twice fined for spurious reasons.  Ultimately, the court itself repealed these illegal "fine  sanctions."    V. Kornev submitted exhaustive materials to the court,  indisputably demonstrating the accuracy of all the points in his  article and the groundlessness of the suit. Before the end of  the hearing an oblast administration representative considered  it necessary to abandon all of their claims -- including the  claim for 11 million rubles in damages for the "moral harm" done  to the administration. At the same time, against all logic, the  administration insisted on a repudiation of the article, whose  accuracy was no longer in question.    The people's court has completely ended the proceedings.    I. Shabunin, head of the oblast administration, appealed the  people's court ruling at the oblast court. His appeal was  rejected.</p>

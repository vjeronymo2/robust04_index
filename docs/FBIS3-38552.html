In  an interview with the Cologne EXPRESS (Friday edition), the  minister stated that he is aware of the defense minister's  financial worries and concerns. Yet he added that, in the event  of a further reduction of the Bundeswehr, the constitutional  stipulation of equality in conscription would sooner or later  become a problem.    It must be determined what troop strength is needed for what  purpose, and then the financial aspect must be discussed, and  not the other way round, under the motto: "How much money do we  have, and how many soldiers can we afford for that?"    Ruehe stated in Bonn on Wednesday [2 February], that, in  order to cut defense expenditure, the strength of the Bundeswehr  should be reduced to 345,000 soldiers by the end of 1994 and not  to 370,000, as originally planned.</p>

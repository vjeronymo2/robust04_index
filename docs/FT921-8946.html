			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Recession drives Ford to record Pounds 920m loss in UK FORD, the US carmaker, suffered a record Pounds 920m loss on its ordinary activities in the UK last year. The figure, before extraordinary gains, includes losses of Pounds 450m associated with Ford's takeover two years ago of Jaguar, the UK luxury car producer, and compares with a loss of Pounds 274m a year earlier. Hit by the recession and steep fall in new car sales in the UK, Ford of Britain's net loss for the year was Pounds 590m after taking account of Pounds 330m of extraordinary gains. Of this, Pounds 290m came from the transfer of ownership of Jaguar to its US parent company last November and Pounds 40m from the sale of its loss-making Ford New Holland tractor operations to Fiat of Italy. The heavy losses announced yesterday have forced Ford of the US to pump Pounds 390m into Ford of Britain to shore up the UK company's balance sheet. Ford of the US has injected Pounds 100m in new equity capital, with the remainder coming through the Jaguar transfer. Excluding Jaguar, Ford of Britain fell to a loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 470m last year from a Pounds 61m profit in 1990. The scale of the losses by Ford, the UK new car market leader, will intensify the pressure from UK carmakers on the government to take urgent action in next month's Budget to stimulate car sales. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman and managing director, insisted yesterday that the company was not 'playing politics' by bringing forward publication of its results from the normal date of mid-May. However, he said that 'we do think that the government should take action to stimulate the market'. New car sales in the UK have plummeted by 31 per cent in the past two years, while commercial vehicle sales have fallen by 43.7 per cent. The speed of the decline in UK new vehicle demand and the depth of the recession took Ford by surprise. Ford vehicle stocks climbed to unacceptable levels last year, forcing it into an expensive price war. Worldwide, Ford plunged into a net loss of Dollars 2.258bn last year from a net profit a year earlier of Dollars 860m, according to results announced yesterday. The US recession and competition from Japanese carmakers have hit American producers hard. Chrysler last week announced a net loss for 1991 of Dollars 795m, compared with a net profit of Dollars 68m in 1990. General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, is expected to announce losses of several billion dollars later this month. Ford of Europe's automotive operations, including Jaguar, slumped to a Dollars 1.079bn net loss last year from a Dollars 145m net profit in 1990 and a Dollars 1.19bn profit in 1989.

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (28): Calculated risks for higher rewards - Performance measures It is not difficult to see why emerging market investments have caught on: the best performing emerging market funds last year made returns of more than 100 per cent, while the top 20 funds over the past three years have all returned more than 200 per cent, according to Micropal, which tracks funds' performance. Meanwhile, interest rates in developed countries are approaching their cyclical lows, and although economic growth is starting to pick up in some western countries, it is expected to remain slow. Investors are becoming increasingly willing to venture further afield to enhance their returns. But the rewards offered by emerging market investments are, inevitably, accompanied by greater risks, and the first-time investor may find it difficult not only to select a market but also to track performance. Emerging markets are both less liquid and more volatile than investments in established stock and bond markets. They are also less transparent, and often subject to restricted access for foreign investors. Even for the institutional fund manager, investments in emerging markets are a complicated affair. While a fund manager in the UK stock or bond market can, if he so desires, replicate the FT-SE index or a gilts index, and then try to outperform them, indices on emerging markets are more complex. Among existing bond indices, JP Morgan's liquid Brady bond index and Latin American Eurobond index are widely followed. But these, and other bond indices, include only a relatively small portion of the potential universe of investments. In one sense, this has favoured the performance of bond fund managers, because it has made it relatively easy to outperform such indices. This is because the indices tend to cover the most liquid, least volatile, and therefore lower risk bonds. However, investors need to be aware of the risks involved in investments in markets where, for example, there may be a high level of political instability. 'No index is perfect,' says Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed income at Latin American Securities, the emerging markets division of Foreign and Colonial. 'The problem is that the markets change so quickly, and have enormous access and liquidity constraints. You can't have an index that reflects all that.' For example, he points out that many Latin American bond indices are heavily weighted towards Mexican bonds, and may not include more esoteric paper such as that of Peru. Latin American Securities adopts a three-pronged approach, to achieve a balanced measurement of its performance. First, managers do not use a single index, but look at a number of benchmarks. Second, they look at their 'peer group' - that is, similar funds with which they are competing. Third, they try to set targets in terms of the type of risks, return on investment, volatility, and so on. 'We are not just selling returns, we want to sell a good risk/return investment,' he says. 'Some people don't necessarily want the highest returns, but are keen to have controlled volatility.' Agreeing the parameters of investment in emerging markets is therefore a vital part of the fund manager's service to a client. 'It's a difficult thing for a fund manager and an end-investor to get to grips with,' agrees one London-based emerging markets salesman. 'What risk is the fund manager allowed to take? The eurobond and Brady bond indices are just a guide stick. You have to decide whether the fund manager will be able to throw in Algeria and the Ivory Coast.' He points out that the prospectus for a specific fund always sets out in detail what the constraints on investment are. But, for both bond and equity markets, the problem is not merely one of selection but also of access. Many markets, particularly equity markets which tend to be more politically sensitive, are partially or largely closed to foreign investors. 'In many emerging markets, much of the market capitalisation is not available to a foreign investor,' says Mr Bruce Johnson, head of global research at Baring Securities, whose emerging equity market indices are among the most widely followed. In setting up its index, Baring tried to take account not only of market size and volume, but also of whether stocks are 'investable' or available. Many markets have a series of legal restrictions - on the total amount a single investor may hold in any one company, the total amount foreigners can hold in any one company, and the total amount all foreigners can own in the market overall. There can also be tax and other difficulties, for example forcing investors to hold stocks for as long as three years, or treating capital gains inconsistently. Other issues include the convertibility of the domestic currency, and the fact that some foreign-held stocks trade at a premium. Mr Johnson points out that although stocks may be legally available, there may be practical restrictions on their availability due to illiquidity. There are some ways round restrictions and illiquidity problems, such as buying American depositary receipts (ADRs). However, there is a danger of a mis-match between ADRs and the domestic market. Other methods of circumventing regulations include buying country funds or using swaps, or bonds with embedded options. The Baring index places some importance on the ease of replicating the index. To this end, the market turnover has to be at least Dollars 2bn a year. Pakistan, for example, is a borderline case. Other leading equity indices, such as those compiled by Morgan Stanley, place greater emphasis on economic criteria. The smallest market included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index is Sri Lanka, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 2.5bn. 'Our indices are broadly based,' explains Mr Mark Sladkus, who publishes the index. 'We are trying to provide a benchmark. Some investors do try to buy every stock, but they will have problems.' For investors keen to venture into the emerging markets, there are no simple choices. Individual country funds have been a popular choice, and have often performed well, but are risky if they do not form part of a more diversified portfolio. Generally, it is safer to try to find an investment vehicle which gives exposure across a range of emerging markets, taking the view that, while individual market moves will be hard to call, in the longer term, the developing economies are likely to offer falling yields on bond investments and strong equity markets fuelled by economic growth.  -------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKET FUND PERFORMANCE DURING 1993*  -------------------------------------------- Fund                                        %  -------------------------------------------- Turkey Trust                           180.25 Turkish Investment Fund                155.53 J F Malaysia                           150.38 J F India                              150.07 J F Asean                              136.68 Barclays ASF Malaysia                  107.42 J F Eastern                            106.16 Fidelity Fds Malaysia                  104.15 Infinity Ltd                           103.37 Fidelity Asean                         103.03 Equity Fund of Brazil                  102.77 Thornton Philippines Rdwlpt            102.74 J F Thailand                           102.45 Oriental Smaller Companies             101.67 Morgan Grenfell Lat Am Brady           100.25 Fidelity Fds Asean                      99.30 Brazilian Investment Fund               98.51 J F Philippines Trust                   94.39 Genesis Malaysia Maju                   94.29 Gartmore I F Asean                      94.10  -------------------------------------------- * Up to end of November  -------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal  --------------------------------------------</p>

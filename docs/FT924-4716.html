			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Housing: time to end tax relief and encourage lettings (2) Sir, With regard to your leader, 'A new policy for housing', although it will be some time before statistics show the change, more people are now letting homes than for many years. Traditionally, residential landlords have been small-time investors. After being driven out by the Rent Acts, they are now returning to the market throughout the UK. Every month they are buying repossessed houses at auction and, after repair, letting them to tenants. Their return to the sector should be encouraged by the repeal of the Rent Acts which are no longer required as the supply of rented houses is adequate. Landlords could also be helped by tax allowances. As mortgage interest relief is unlikely to be changed and tenants need to be on a level playing field with mortgagors, why not let them set off rent against tax up to an equivalent amount, say Pounds 750?

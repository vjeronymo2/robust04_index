			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CALEDONIA VOTE POSTPONED IN WAKE OF ASSASSINATIONS  </P> <P> French Premier Michel Rocard said Friday that he is postponing local elections  in New Caledonia after the assassinations of two moderate separatist leaders.  </P> <P> He said elections, set for June 11, are being suspended to allow a period of  mourning for Jean-Marie Tjibaou, 53, and his deputy, Yeiwene Yeiwene. Rocard  commented on the situation in the South Pacific territory before leaving Paris  to attend the funerals of the two men.  </P> <P> Rocard's announcement effectively derailed the schedule for a transfer of power  by Paris, which imposed direct rule over New Caledonia last year, to regional  councils that were to have been established in the June election. Rocard gave  no indication of when the rescheduled vote might take place.  </P> <P> Tjibaou and Yeiwene, president and secretary general, respectively, of the  separatist Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, were shot dead by  hard-line separatist Djubelly Wea on Thursday on the island of Ouvea.  </P> <P> Wea shouted "Long live independence!" as he shot Tjibaou in the head. Tjibaou  died instantly, while Yeiwene died later in the hospital. Wea was killed by one  of Tjibaou's bodyguards.  </P> <P> The elections were part of a pact signed last August ending a long period of  violence.  </P> <P> Rocard told Radio France Internationale that he would not give up his battle to  end violence in New Caledonia. He denied that the peace plan, which he  negotiated, is in tatters.  </P> <P> "We have to mobilize more energy, more strength and more conviction," he said.  </P></p>

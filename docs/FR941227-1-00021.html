			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of section 1258 is to treat the time value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income from conversion transactions as ordinary income. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1258(a) may create a character mismatch, however, because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focuses only on the gain recognized on the transaction. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer separately disposes of the positions of a conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction, the taxpayer's inability to net losses on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions against gains could result in the recharacterization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gain in excess of the time value element.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, assume that a taxpayer buys a capital asset for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100 and simultaneously sells that asset forward for $105 in one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Assume that the AIIA is $8. If the asset were delivered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to close out the forward contract, the taxpayer would have a $5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital gain. Even though the AIIA is $8, no more than the $5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gain would be recharacterized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assume, instead, that the taxpayer sells the asset and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closes out the forward contract in separate transactions when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the asset has dropped to $97. Gain subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharacterization under section 1258(a), determined separately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each position, is $8 on the forward contract. If the $3 loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the asset were not netted against that $8 gain prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying section 1258(a), the full $8 gain would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recharacterized as ordinary income. This recharacterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would force the taxpayer to recognize $8 of ordinary income and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $3 of non-offsetting capital loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide relief from this potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> character mismatch in certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specific Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations allow taxpayers to net gains and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses on the positions of certain conversion transactions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of section 1258(a). To be eligible, the taxpayer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify, before the close of the day on which the positions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become part of the conversion transaction, all the positions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are part of the conversion transaction. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer must dispose of all the positions within a 14-day period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is within a single taxable year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also provide special rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses on positions of conversion transactions. These rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the netting of built-in loss against gain. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules treat certain losses that arise during the term of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion transaction as built-in losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations are proposed to be effective for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion transactions entered into on or after the date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing of the final regulations with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Solicitation of Comments on Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The scope of the relief provided by the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be broadened if a taxpayer could elect to treat retained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positions of a conversion transaction as if they were sold for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their fair market values whenever another position of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction was disposed of, terminated, or treated as sold under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other provision of the Code or regulations. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not include such a mark-to-market provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marking positions to market raises a number of issues under other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Code (for example, sections 1271 through 1278).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service solicits comments on the necessity for and terms of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mark-to-market provision under section 1258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is aware that section 1258 presents a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues not addressed by the proposed regulations. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comments concerning which, if any, of these issues should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be addressed in future regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration for comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection and copying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

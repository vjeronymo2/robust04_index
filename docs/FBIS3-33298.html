"We will not leave the PRI until our stay in the party is  truly untenable," said the spokesman of the PRI dissident group,  which is called the Progressive Democratic Current [Corriente  Democratica Progresista]. Until they are expelled for breaking  the party's bylaws, the PRI dissidents will try to find  supporters for Cardenas within the government party, which has  been in power for 64 years and whose candidate is former Social  Development Secretary Luis Colosio.    Sanchez added that the dissident group has approximately  20,000 members in Mexico City and the States of Mexico,  Guerrero, and Aguascalientes, among others. He said the  dissidents had decided to back Cardenas "despite pressures from  the PRI leaders."    The elections will be held on 21 August, and it is expected  that approximately 40 million Mexicans will cast their votes.    This is the second time Cardenas has run for the presidency.  The first time was in 1988, when Cardenas headed a large  movement that was formed after he left the PRI, where he had  headed a democratic current for several months.</p>

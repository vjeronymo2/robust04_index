			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wills plans ADollars 99m asset pay-out to shareholders WD&amp;HO Wills, the Australian tobacco group in which BAT Industries holds a 67.3 per cent stake, is to pay out a substantial portion of its assets to its shareholders, by way of special cash hand-out. Assuming the plan is approved at an extraordinary general meeting next month, Wills said it would return ADollars 99m (Pounds 48m) to its stockholders, equivalent to 75 cents per ordinary share. At the end of June, Wills' net assets stood at ADollars 364m, so the payment equates to more than a quarter of the company's net worth. The move continues the debate over whether companies which generate large amounts of cash but operate in mature, or declining industries, like tobacco, should use these funds to pursue new business opportunities, or should simply return the money to their investors. On the one hand, it is argued that returning capital to shareholders shows lack of management imagination. On the other, proponents of such a strategy suggest that shareholders should be allowed make investment choices for themselves. Having invested in a tobacco company, they should not find themselves owning a company which has moved into food or banking. Ironically, this argument surfaced during the abortive bid battle for BAT during 1989-90, when the UK company was forced to defend its strategy of diversifying into financial services. However, Mr David Leach, Wills' finance director, said that he did not see any incompatibility between Wills' latest decision, which follows the approach taken recently by Rothmans, and its parent's stance. Wills, he said, had no intention of diversifying and hence had no use for the surplus funds. At end-June, the Australian group had net cash of ADollars 76.9m, so the ADollars 99m capital reduction will mean that it takes on modest borrowings. He added that it was 'extremely premature' to say whether there would be further pay-outs in the future. The payback will be effected through a capital reduction. Some ADollars 99m of Will's ADollars 167.6m share premium reserve will be used to restore the fully-paid status of the issued shares. The cash payment will not attract any income tax liability for Australian shareholders, and no immediate capital gains tax liability. However, when investors eventually sell their shares, the base price will be reduced for capital gains tax calculation purposes.</p>

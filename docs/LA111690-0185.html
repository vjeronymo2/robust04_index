			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DUNLEAVY PUTS WORTHY'S STATE OF MIND FIRST  </P> <P> Lakers Coach Mike Dunleavy says his main concern is for the well-being of James  Worthy following the star forward's arrest Thursday on charges of solicitation  of prostitution.  </P> <P> "All I know is that James has been a model citizen for the Lakers and has been  a wonderful person and player for me in my tenure as coach," Dunleavy said.  </P> <P> "My main concern right now is for James Worthy and his mental state."  </P> <P> Several hours after he was arrested at his hotel Thursday, Worthy reported to  the Lakers' bench in the second quarter of their game with the Houston Rockets  and finished with 24 points in a 108-103 overtime victory.  </P> <P> "James is a great performer and he told me he wanted to play," Dunleavy said.  "He did and I think that says a lot for the kind of guy he is."  </P> <P> If convicted of the two Class C misdemeanor charges, Worthy faces up to six  months in jail and a $1,000 fine. He had to post $500 bond Thursday.  </P> <P> Worthy has been the Lakers' second-leading scorer for each of the past five  years.  </P></p>

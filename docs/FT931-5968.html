			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Mini-Opec' formed to tackle CIS energy crisis THE LEADERS of 12 former Soviet republics yesterday formed a 'mini-Opec' in an effort to resolve their mounting energy crisis. Russian and Ukrainian representatives at the meeting in the western Siberian city of Surgut also appeared to make progress on untangling their conflict over oil and gas prices, which threatens the supply of gas to Europe. However, while republic's heads agreed in principle to co-operate in an effort to revive Russia's declining oil industry, they skirted the critical question of the pricing of the oil and gas Russia supplies to the other former Soviet republics. Sounding a conciliatory note, they were optimistic that their agreement to co-operate in a specific sector of the economy would be more effective than the dozens of more general, and widely-ignored, decisions made by Commonwealth of Independent States. 'We have established something similar to the European Steel and Coal Union,' said Mr Georgy Khizha, the Russian deputy prime minister. He said that the newly formed association's next step would be to set a uniform price for oil and gas 'just as in Opec'. 'It is impossible to stop the inflationary spiral without centrally agreed prices for energy,' Mr Khizha said. He added that the oil and gas association could serve as a model for inter-republican co-operation in other sectors, such as the steel and coal industries. Russian officials warned that the Surgut agreement, intended to channel investments from the non-Russian republics into the Siberian oil industry, could make it even more difficult for Western companies to reach deals in the Russian energy sector. The association, which will be governed by an oil and gas council made up of the prime ministers of the member states and administered by a secretariat based in the Siberian oil capital of Tyumen, will co-ordinate investments from all of the republics in the Russian oil industry and in exchange guarantee energy supplies. Russian oil production, more than 70 per cent of which comes from the Tyumen region, has fallen sharply from a peak of 557m tonnes in 1988 to 385m tonnes last year. The principal reasons for the decline are a drop in investments in the sector and difficulties in obtaining vital equipment, particularly from non-Russian republics such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan, which were traditionally the oil industry's main suppliers. The spirit of co-operation appeared to be carried over to Ukrainian-Russian relations, which last week erupted in a bitter dispute over gas prices. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian prime minister, said he had reached a preliminary understanding with Gazprom, the Russian gas company, to pay for gas at about the same, subsidised, prices Russia charges other CIS republics. However, Mr Kuchma said the issue would not be definitively resolved until later in the week when he planned to meet Russian premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow.</p>

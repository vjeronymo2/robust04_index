			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Discounted Nafta news brings selling Wall Street US INVESTORS put the successful passage of Nafta through the House of Representatives behind them yesterday, and instead focused on rising bond yields. With profit-taking also in evidence, the result was a decline in share prices across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.01 at 3,685.34. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 1.19 to 463.62, while the American SE composite shed 3.00 to 469.54 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.02 to 754.34. New York SE volume was 313.5m shares. Although the equity markets had hoped that the House of Representatives would vote for Nafta, investors did not greet the good news with buying, primarily because expectations of a successful outcome had already been discounted earlier in the week. Thus, the stage was set for some early losses as investors took more profits earned during the markets' gains on Tuesday. Another rise in bond yields also pressured equity prices lower. The bond market was reacting to the latest evidence of economic growth - weekly jobless claims fell by 20,000, and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's report on local business activity was stronger than expected. Although the data should have been bullish for stocks, equity investors were more concerned by the latest rise in bond yields, and with prices also undermined by computerised sell programs, the markets ended the day notably weaker. Trading in Chevron was halted because of an order imbalance on the sell side amid speculation that Pennzoil, a major shareholder, would sell its stake in the company. After refusing to comment, Pennzoil later confirmed that it had sold 8.2m shares in the oil group. By the close, Chevron was down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 88 5/8 on volume of 10.5m shares, while Pennzoil, which was left with a 2.8 per cent stake in Chevron, was up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 58 1/8 . Other major oil stocks were mixed. Texaco fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 3/4 and British Petroleum Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 , but Exxon firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 64 1/2 and Mobil Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 77 3/4 . Mexican-related stocks celebrated the Nafta vote with gains. Telefonos de Mexico rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 in volume of 7.4m shares, the Mexico Fund added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 29 3/8 and the Emerging Mexico Fund climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 . Canada TORONTO stock prices closed mixed after busy trading. The TSE 300 index lost 1.8 at 4,234.7, but rises led declines by 435 to 362. Volume came to 68.3m shares valued at CDollars 860m.</p>

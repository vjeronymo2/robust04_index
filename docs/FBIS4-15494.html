			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn April 7 TASS -- Estonian President Lennart  Meri, State Assembly Chairman Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart  Laar signed on Thursday a statement saying: "At the 18th round  of Russian-Estonian talks, which has just finished, the Russian  side linked the deadline for complete withdrawal of Russian  troops (August 31, 1994) to the conditions that had been already  settled during previous rounds, thus casting doubt on the very  deadline of troop withdrawal approved by the international  community.    Estonia cannot agree to new terms, but is still ready to  negotiate with Russia with a view to benevolently surmount all  difficulties. However, the Estonian republic regards President  Boris Yeltsin's order #174 of April 5, providing for creation of  new military bases not only in CIS member-countries but also in  the Latvian republic, as Russia's departure from its earlier  commitments, as well as from international agreements and  principles.    With this in view, the Estonian Foreign Ministry and  Estonia's representatives abroad are instructed to do their  utmost in persuading foreign leaders to recall Russia that it  should unconditionally adhere to its international commitments  and to pull out promptly and in the proper order its troops from  Latvia and Estonia, which has been repeatedly called for by  numerous international documents.    Unfortunately, certain political circles in Moscow are quite  likely to use this situation to engineer provocations against  Estonia and Latvia. But such attempts are doomed to failure.  Estonia will resolutely counteract pressure from Russia. The  Estonian people will go ahead with creating new values on its  straight way back to Europe".</p>

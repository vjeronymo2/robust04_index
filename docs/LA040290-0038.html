			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SATELLITES FIND NO TREND OF GREENHOUSE WARMING  </P> <P> Despite fears that the greenhouse effect is heating up the Earth's atmosphere,  measurements taken by satellites show the planet has not warmed over the past  decade, scientists said last week.  </P> <P> Researchers from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and University of Alabama  in Huntsville said they found dramatic swings in monthly and yearly temperature  patterns, but the average global temperature did not rise -- or fall -- in the  10-year period from 1979 through 1988.  </P> <P> "There is no obvious long-term trend, and anomalies during the first five years  nearly balance those during the last five years," researchers Roy Spencer and  John Christy wrote in a study published in the journal Science.  </P> <P> The scientists emphasized their findings go back only as far as 1979, and  cannot be used to determine whether Earth has actually warmed about 1 degree  Farhenheit over the past century, as most ground-based records show.  </P> <P> "We may never show the climate is affected by man-made pollution. But we have  no contention with the obvious facts -- that the chemical composition of the  atmosphere is affected, that deforestation is occurring, that water supplies  are being degraded and that there is air pollution," he said.  </P></p>

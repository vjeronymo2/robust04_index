			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fall in savings schemes - At a Glance Investment trust savings schemes last year showed their first annual fall since the schemes began in 1984. The total amounted invested through savings schemes for the year was Pounds 115.5m, down from Pounds 119.5m for 1991. The Association of Investment Trust Companies attributed the fall in the year to poor stock market performance and lack of investor confidence because of the weak economy. However, the final intake of Pounds 33.49m last quarter was strong. Lump sum investments accounted for most of this rise, totalling Pounds 21.72m, an increase of 87 per cent on the third quarter.</p>

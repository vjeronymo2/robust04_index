			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL TOBACCO BILL PASSES TEST;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY PANEL APPROVES MEASURE ON SECOND VOTE. OPPONENTS SAY IT  IS AIMED AT HEADING OFF ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINE SALES.  </P> <P> A key Assembly committee passed a measure Wednesday that opponents warned could  stop California cities from further regulating the distribution of tobacco in  public and private places.  </P> <P> The opponents contended that the legislation was aimed at heading off attempts  in Los Angeles County and elsewhere to ban or severely restrict the sale of  cigarettes from vending machines.  </P> <P> But supporters of the measure said it was designed only to set a statewide  standard on the tobacco industry's distribution of free promotional samples.  </P> <P> "It is a fair proposal," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). "It  is unfair now in Los Angeles County, where you have 86 different cities and 86  different ordinances and expect people to be in compliance."  </P> <P> The controversial measure was approved at a hectic session of the Assembly Ways  and Means Committee, which sent the bill to the Assembly floor as it was  considering more than 200 measures in a rush to meet a self-imposed legislative  deadline. The first committee vote on the bill ended with the measure on the  losing side of a 10-2 tally. About an hour later, after lobbyists for the  industry spoke to several committee members, the bill passed on a 12-9 vote.  </P> <P> Opponents said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who has  received significant campaign contributions from the tobacco industry, was  pushing hard for the bill.  </P> <P> Brown could not be reached for comment, and Polanco denied that the speaker was  involved. But Brown did appoint Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) to the  committee as a replacement for another member just for Wednesday's meeting.  Chacon voted for the bill, which passed without a single vote to spare.  </P> <P> "This is a tobacco industry relief act," said Mark A. Pertschuk, executive  director of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights. "We have had a vital anti-tobacco  movement at the grass-roots level. This is a slap in the face of every  Californian who has worked on this issue."  </P> <P> On the surface, the bill would toughen laws against marketing and distributing  tobacco products to minors. But it also includes a provision declaring that  only the state and not local governments can regulate certain aspects of  tobacco distribution.  </P> <P> Polanco said this "preemption" in his bill applies only to laws governing the  distribution of free tobacco samples. The measure would outlaw the distribution  of free tobacco products within two blocks of places where minors are known to  congregate.  </P> <P> Polanco said, and the Legislature's chief lawyer agreed, that a law already on  the books prevents cities from regulating cigarette vending machines. The city  of Duarte recently passed such a measure, and Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights  is pushing a similar proposal in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But opponents of Polanco's legislation, which was drafted by the tobacco  industry, said current law does not already block local government from  regulating vending machines. They said it only prevents cities and counties  from imposing different fines than the state has imposed for the distribution  of tobacco to minors.  </P> <P> Even putting the bill in its best light, opponents said, it still would  represent an unwarranted intrusion into the rights of local government.  </P></p>

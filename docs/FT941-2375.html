			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Nerves on edge ahead of Fed meeting - Currency Markets Foreign exchanges will this week focus on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which is expected to herald a further tightening of US monetary policy. Although the market has discounted a 25 basis points increase in the Federal funds rate, nerves are on edge following the unscheduled meeting last Friday between President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed. When the Fed last tightened policy, on February 4, foreign exchanges remained largely immune from the ensuing turmoil in financial markets. Anxiety remains, however, because a further divergence in US and European interest rates could prompt shifts in international asset allocation which would affect currencies. Indeed, a key issue in the weeks ahead will be the extent to which US and European interest rates can decouple. Put differently, how fast can the Bundesbank ease policy while the Fed is tightening? This is important for the dollar, weaker now than before the Fed raised rates, because some observers believe the US currency will strengthen only if German interest rates are cut sharply. This issue is also important for European currencies. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, argues that 'the still cautious monetary stance of the Bundesbank, in circumstances of bond market deterioration, threatens to renew strains within the ERM'. He believes that the French franc is most vulnerable to such pressures. In the UK, the key concern is whether a good retail inflation figure on Wednesday will prompt a cut in interest rates. Opinion is divided. Some argue the government will want lower rates to offset higher taxes that take effect next month. Others are firmly opposed. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, says if the Bank of England cuts rates again, 'It will run an enormous risk of further eroding the confidence of the marketplace'. He predicts a 'very definite chance' that a cut in base rates will see the pound slip into the DM2.45 to DM2.50 range.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING SOON: SNEAK PREVIEWS OF FORTHCOMING BOOKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS;  </P> <P> EARLY ENCROACHMENT  </P> <P> 'Yes, here was a special place, as if set apart by Providence.'  </P> <P> THREE HUNDRED MILES to the south of San Francisco, Senora Clara Boneu was  sitting on the veranda of her hacienda, young Father O'Hara beside her, looking  out over her garden with its pink and white hollyhocks and dark-red Spanish  roses. "I welcomed the North Americans at first," she was saying bitterly,  "just as you did. They seemed our liberators from Mexican oppression. But now  this!" She pointed to the two white-hooded wagons of the newly arrived  squatters standing side by side a mile down the valley.  </P> <P> Her rough old voice was hardened by life, O'Hara thought, and her face reminded  him of an ancient tree trunk, expressing acceptance and resistance in equal  measure. The flaming red hair, almost as profuse as in youth, was held back  from her face by a simple chaplet of seashells. She had not adopted Spanish or  Mexican dress but wore the Mother Hubbard of a Christianized Indian woman. Yet  her bearing said unmistakably she was the Senora, daughter of a legendary  Indian chieftainess, widow of a famous conquistador.  </P> <P> "We must endure with vigilance." O'Hara spoke with the frankness of long  friendship. "The Norte Americano squatters have also occupied my orchard,  tearing down fences for firewood. Yet there is a law. And on that we must rely.  With God's help."  </P> <P> "I don't think much of a law which says I must establish my right to a place  where I've lived all my life!"  </P> <P> "I likewise must submit a claim to the Land Commission," he rejoined, "for soil  hallowed by nearly a hundred years of devotion!"  </P> <P> O'Hara's hair was nearly as red as Clara's. Son of a general in the Spanish  Army who'd sent him from Madrid to a seminary in Dublin over the tearful  objections of his Castilian mother, O'Hara had felt the call to California and  had come marching in the footsteps of the missionary fathers, a one-man army,  strong in faith that by sheer zeal he could resurrect from the ruins of Mission  Santa Lucia what he conceived to be the greatness of a past -- which included  Clara. It was his special pleasure once a month to ride out the 18 miles from  town on his mule and say Mass for her and those of her people who chose to  attend. Afterward, the gray-robed Franciscan liked to sit on the veranda and  talk as now. Changing to a more pleasant subject, he observed: "I never tire of  looking at this scene," gesturing toward the valley below.  </P> <P> On the playing field, Indian youths from the village were engaged in a  ball-and-stick game resembling modern hockey. On the course nearer the river  still others from the village and from Clara's household, and even visitors  from town, were preparing a horse race. And at the village itself, a cluster of  adobe cabins and thatched huts beside the stream that she maintained there in  the ancient way, they could see groups of women rolling dice into basketry  trays and girls playing the guessing game, as she'd once played it. Beyond the  river, grassy hills rose steeply, speckled with grazing cattle, culminating in  that high-rounded hill where her husband, Antonio, lay buried. She and he had  dreamed of a scene like this. All that marred it for her and O'Hara were those  wagons down the valley. He asked: "You've talked to them?"  </P> <P> "Yes. They refuse to budge. Someone has told them my title is in doubt until  the Land Commission rules."  </P> <P> On the race course below, two youths -- one, Clara's grandson, Pacifico, tall,  blond; one short and dark, Benito Ferrer, son of the Jewish storekeeper in the  town -- were racing their horses, a gray and a bay, neck and neck, while cheers  urged them on. The youngsters finished in a dead heat and glanced for approval  toward the veranda. Clara raised her right hand and waved. O'Hara did likewise.  </P> <P> Yes, here was a special place, this Rancho Olomosoug, as if set apart by  Providence. In all California there could be nothing quite like it. O'Hara  prayed silently that greed, prejudice, the hatred, the violence that were  defiling so much of the state would spare this peaceful scene. But reason told  him that his prayer was probably too late.  </P> <P> Down in the valley, old Abe Jenkins, leathery, irrepressible, stood at the prow  of his wagon like the captain of a ship, observing them through a brass  spyglass. "The Papist is a-settin' there a-gabbin' to her," he announced to his  family. "They're a-figurin' what to do about us, I reckon. Ha!"  </P> <P> Clara continued quietly to O'Hara: "There must be no bloodshed. The soil of  this valley is soaked in blood, Indian blood, white blood. There has been  enough. That's what I told that old galoot Jenkins that day he arrived."  </P> <P>  Copyright 1989 by Robert Easton.  </P> <P> </P></p>

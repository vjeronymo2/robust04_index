			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: The end of ideas - Political Notebook NO ONE speaks any longer of the end of history. The book of that name, produced a few years ago as the Berlin Wall came down, has proved one of the passing, if lucrative, fads so beloved of US academics. But as Mr John Major's government stumbles towards the summer parliamentary recess, its simplistic logic lives on in the British cabinet. Unable to craft a credible agenda for the 1990s to replace the heroic illusions of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1980s, Mr Major's colleagues are invoking as their excuse the demise of the socialist demon. The case was made a few days ago by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Now Mr Hurd is the most eloquent and elegant of ministers. He is among the small group of senior Tories who can claim still to be political thinkers. But in a speech in Oxfordshire last Friday he too began to bemoan the passing of old enemies. The Soviet Union was gone, CND had evaporated, union bosses had lost their power. How difficult it was, he complained, 'to work yourself up into a storm of indignation against opponents who are empty of ideas and character'. It is a familiar refrain. Ask any cabinet minister these days to explain the government's lack of direction and as likely as not they return nostalgically to the great battles of the 1980s. Mr Major himself took up the theme in a recent private meeting with parliamentary private secretaries. Mrs Thatcher had it easy, they say. Alongside the familiar demons mentioned by Mr Hurd, there were a host of other enemies to slay. There were nationalised industries, the Marxist mobsters running Liverpool and London, runaway public spending, ludicrously high marginal tax rates. In between times she could take aim at president Galtieri or at Mr Neil Kinnock's leftwing past. The Iron Lady then defined herself in terms of her enemies. Mr Major's government cannot. In the process the Conservative party has lost the cement which bound together its different factions through the 1980s. It is hardly surprising that the government is having a tough time displaying a convincing sense of purpose. A Citizen's Charter here, a burst of deregulation there and a belated crackdown on crime elsewhere cannot be expected to fill the gap. Nor can Mr Major, caught by the Maastricht treaty, seek an escape route in his predecessor's reflex nationalism. For the Conservatives, it seems, the end of history has given way to the end of ideas. It is a startling admission of failure - and perhaps just a little harsh on the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd, it must be said, did make the point himself that the government must now find itself a positive agenda. He even offered Mr Major a five-point checklist - sustaining the economic recovery, if deregulation, improving the quality of public services, winning the argument in Europe and playing a 'decent' role on the world stage. Nor are the Conservatives alone in their floundering in an ideological vacuum. The Labour party is struggling still to strike a balance between its new-found commitment to markets and old interventionist ways. Mr John Smith is beginning to tap the seam of discontent caused by the progressive erosion over the past 14 years of local democracy and accountability. Mr Tony Blair has started to formulate a new rhetoric to put his party's traditional commitment to collectivism in the framework of the promotion of individual opportunity. But corporately, Labour appears gripped by the same lack of imagination as the government. It is Mr Major though who is suffering most from the aimless drift of British politics. Surviving this week's Maastricht denouement and an expected electoral disaster in the Christchurch by-election - and that is by no means guaranteed - will not be enough for the prime minister. His administration - accused even by its members of being obsessed with gimmicks and wheezes - needs a sense of purpose. It needs focus. Mr Chris Patten suggested once that Conservatism in the 1990s should be about just three or four things: a stable legal framework, a prospering economy and decent education and health care. That may not sound like a big idea. But it is better than lamenting the demise of Mr Arthur Scargill.</p>

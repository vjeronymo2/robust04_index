			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Appointments: Lawson elected to ICA Roger Lawson, 3i's director for Asia, Pacific and the US, was yesterday declared vice president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in the first ever contested elections for the post. It makes him one of only a handful of vice-presidents in more than 100 years of the Institute's history who does not work in a firm of chartered accountants. He takes up his post in June, and is likely to give greater prominence to the concerns of chartered accountants in business, who make up more than half of the Institute's 97,000 members. The election remains only partly democratic. Only elected council members of the Institute may vote, and Lawson will only succeed to the presidency after two years. Lawson beat Chris Swinson, the outspoken managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, and Pat Brenan, a director of Minories Finance, formally Johnson Matthey bank, by a substantial margin in a transferable vote election.</p>

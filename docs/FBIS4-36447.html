			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Fierce Fighting in Northern </F> Iraq Threatens To Torpedo Reconciliation Between Kurds"]    [Excerpts] London -- Fierce fighting broke out yesterday  in northern Iraq and seemed to threaten collapse of the  reconciliation agreement between Kurdish leaders Mas'ud Barzani  and Jalal Talabani. A source close to the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK] (led by Talabani) has told AL-HAYAH that "forces  of the Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] (led by Barzani) as well  as Islamic Movement forces and Iranian forces launched a major  attack at dawn on the city of Qal'at Dizah" which is under the  control of the PUK forces.    Meanwhile, Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member of the  Presidential Council of the Iraqi National Congress [INC], has  rejected Presidential Council Member Barzani's proposal calling  for Iraqi Kurdistan to be declared a demilitarized "UN  protectorate." In a statement to AL-HAYAH from his headquarters  in Salah-al-Din, al-Naqib said that "any international  trusteeship over any part of Iraq would not solve the internal  problems, even if it did not further complicate these problems."  He emphasized that "the real solution to the Kurdish question  must be within a national unified Iraqi framework." [passage  omitted]    Al-Naqib said that "the recent regrettable incidents between  the Kurdish brothers prove that the only way to solve problems  is dialogue and negotiation. That is one of the lessons which  must be learned about settling differences between Kurdish and  non-Kurdish patriotic opposition forces." He urged the Kurds to  "show wisdom and farsightedness, let reason and logic prevail,  and give priority to the main struggle against the dictatorial  regime over the secondary conflicts." [passage omitted]    In al-Naqib's view, "the real solution to the Kurdish  question must be within a national unified Iraqi framework  acceptable to the Iraqi people -- Arabs, Kurds, and minorities  -- and enjoying regional and international support." [passage  omitted]    On the fighting which flared up again yesterday, a source  close to the PUK said that "the joint attack launched by the  KDP, the Islamic Movement, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard  forces is supported by artillery batteries and rocket launchers  in the Iranian area of Sar Dasht. The PUK forces have succeeded  in recapturing the city of Qal'at Dizah (5 km from the  Iraqi-Iranian border) whose inhabitants had to move out as a  result of heavy shelling." He added that "the three forces on  Monday attacked the cities of Sayyid Sadiq and Banjwin east of  al-Sulaymaniyah and were defeated by the PUK forces."    He admitted that "the fierce battles" threaten to torpedo  the  reconciliation agreement reached between Barzani and Talabani  after last month's fighting between their parties.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Obituary of Turgut Ozal: Reformer who built on Ataturk's legacy TURGUT OZAL, who died suddenly on Saturday, dominated Turkish politics for the last decade. Appointed by the generals in the wake of the 1980 coup d'etat, he was to oversee Turkey's critical transition to civilian rule, becoming prime minister in 1983 and eventually succeeding Gen Kenan Evren in 1989 as the country's second civilian president since the coup. His achievements as a reformer are second only to those of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder. If Ataturk erected the social and political pillars of a pro-western, secular Turkey, Mr Ozal was the architect of the country's economic recovery and the driving force behind its policy to join the European Community. His relations with the military were one of the central contradictions of his career. He remained, to his death, the only Turkish politician strong enough to challenge the military on key security questions. As if to symbolise his independence of the generals, on one famous occasion he was to review troops dressed in Bermuda shorts and a sun hat. In many ways, Mr Ozal epitomised modern Turkey. A devout Moslem - he was even said to have had ties with the fanatical Nakshibendi sect - he was profoundly democratic in many of his political views. He once claimed to be the first Turkish leader to use the word Kurd in public; previously this troubled minority were referred to as mountain Turks. He was certainly the first Turkish leader to contemplate a political solution to the Kurdish problem, perhaps Turkey's single greatest challenge today. His loss will be strongly felt by moderate Kurds who looked on him as an unofficial patron of the campaign for greater political and human rights. His death occurs at a critical time, as Mr Suleyman Demirel's government considers its response to the current ceasefire offered by the rebel Kurdish Workers' party (PKK). Mr Ozal was born in 1927 in Malatya and was an electrical engineer by training. He worked at the World Bank in Washington in the 1970s, returning to a series of posts in the Turkish private sector before becoming adviser to the government of Mr Demirel. With the military coup of 1980, Mr Ozal was asked to stay on, a move that soured his relations with Mr Demirel ever after. In the restrictive political environment that followed the coup, Mr Ozal was able to push through an austerity package, which might have proved difficult under a more democratic system. The reforms centred on trade liberalisation, removal of exchange controls, and in 1982 the rescheduling of Turkey's Dollars 3.2bn foreign debt. Within three years, adopting classical monetarist strategies, Mr Ozal pulled inflation down from 120 per cent to 30 per cent and doubled Turkey's exports. After a timely resignation in July 1982, he founded the Motherland party (Anap), a curious mix of progressive and conservative elements, a coalition of technocrats, businessmen and farmers. The party emerged as clear winner in the restricted election of 1983. Somewhat reluctantly at first, the generals approved Mr Ozal's choice of cabinet, formally handing over power on December 13 1983. Anap won again in 1987 and Mr Ozal progressively turned his energies to foreign policy. He was admired if not liked by the political establishment. Some Turks became concerned Mr Ozal's policies were threatening the country's European identity, as enshrined in the Kemalist legacy. In 1987, against the advice of many foreign ambassadors in Ankara, Turkey applied for full membership of the European Community. A one-time Islamic nationalist, Mr Ozal strongly contended that Turkey's application was politely rejected, on the grounds of religion, by a Christian European club. Throughout the cold war Turkey provided the Nato alliance with a bulwark against the Soviet Union on its south-eastern flank. During the Gulf war, Mr Ozal overrode strong public opposition to impose sanctions against Iraq and to provide the US-led coalition with the use of bases, once more re-asserting Turkey's western identity.</p>

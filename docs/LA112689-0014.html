			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HOLY DUPLICATION!  </P> <P> The most publicized video of the year -- "Batman" -- apparently has been put on  the market without Macrovision, the standard anti-copying device used to  prevent unauthorized duplication of copyrighted videocassettes.  </P> <P> Warner Home Video shipped an estimated 13 million-16 million copies of the  video nationwide on Nov. 15, with a suggested list price of $24.98. (Many  stores have priced it considerably lower.)  </P> <P> Outtakes was able to copy its "Batman" video, and a survey of several local  video stores indicates that most, if not all, the "Batman" videos are  apparently being sold without anti-copying protection. Warner Home Video execs  we reached declined to comment and a company spokesman had not returned our  calls at press time.  </P> <P> An insider at Tower Records, where the "Batman" video is a hot item, thought  its lack of protection won't hurt sales: "Copy-guard is just an industry  security blanket," he said. "At this ridiculously low price, it's cheaper to  buy than copy it. The fact that it isn't copy-protected won't affect our sales  at all."  </P> <P> A smaller retailer disagreed. "We think people won't rent it as much if they  can make copies at home," he said. "Once word gets out that you can copy it,  there won't be any market for it."  </P> <P> "Who's going to want a copy for Christmas when every kid already has one?"  asked another video store owner. "Warner usually copy-guards its product. I  don't know why they didn't protect this valuable property."  </P> <P> A video manufacturing insider theorized that Warner, with a rushed shipping  schedule, skipped the Macrovision stage to save time. "And since the price (for  the consumer) is so low, the added cost of encoding each copy was probably a  factor," he added.  </P> <P> The all-time video sales champ, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," which sold close  to 15 million copies last year, was protected with Macrovision.

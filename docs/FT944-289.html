			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Beijing plans to overhaul bankruptcy law China plans to overhaul its eight-year-old bankruptcy law next year to accelerate the streamlining of loss-ridden state companies. According to the New China News Agency, a draft law to be presented to the National People's Congress, the nominal parliament, will tighten existing legislation and bring it into conformity with market reforms and international practices. At a session of Chinese legislative leaders which ended yesterday, the standing committee of the People's Congress also called for tighter control by the legislature and the State Council, or cabinet, over the People's Bank of China and its monetary policy. Under a draft law that has to be ratified by the legislature next year, the central bank will no longer engage in commercial or policy-related lending and will have to report regularly on money supply, credit balance and other issues. The People's Bank of China has been trying to modernise and make the transition from acting as the funding source of a planned economy to being a market-oriented institution. The legislative committee also cleared a new prison law aimed at curbing China's rising crime in a move that extends legislative supervision and the reach of Mr Qiao Shi, the powerful congress chairman, considered a contender to succeed Mr Deng Xiaoping, the ailing paramount leader. 'The tasks in the coming year remain very heavy,' Mr. Qiao was quoted as saying in a speech urging other legislative leaders to 'promote the sustained, fast and healthy development of the national economy as well as political and social stability of the country'. Despite the proposed changes in bankruptcy legislation, western economists questioned whether the government will carry out its bankruptcy programme. However, Mr Cao Siyuan, a bankruptcy consultant and the architect of the proposed legislative changes, predicted the draft law would speed the rate of bankruptcies. Although the government admits that more than 40 per cent of the 72,000 state-owned industrial enterprises are in the red, only about 2,000 have been allowed to go into default.</p>

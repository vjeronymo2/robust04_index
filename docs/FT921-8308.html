			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Stationery Office unions urge rejection of 3.5% offer WORKERS at Her Majesty's Stationery Office are being urged to take industrial action over pay just a year after HMSO became the first Civil Service agency to break away from national pay bargaining. Four unions have recommended that the 2,000 non-industrial civil servants at HMSO reject the proposed deal, which they estimate is worth 3.5 per cent from the settlement date of last October. Two, the NUCPS and CPSA, are urging industrial action short of a strike. The other two, the IPMS and GMPU, say they will follow suit if their members reject the deal. Action the unions are considering includes working to rule or to job description and an overtime ban. They are also considering strikes by selected groups of workers. Mr Graeme Watt, NUCPS assistant secretary, said any action would probably delay supplies to customers. The offer compares with rises of at least 6.5 per cent last year for civil servants who remain in national bargaining. Last week workers whose pay is determined by public-sector pay review bodies were awarded rises averaging 6.5 per cent. The dispute at HMSO is likely to strengthen the resolve of Civil Service unions in maintaining national bargaining arrangements. The government is urging greater devolution of pay determination as part of its Citizen's Charter programme. The unions ordered the ballots after failing to persuade HMSO to ask the Treasury to vary its Pounds 4m profit target for last year. HMSO managers had argued that they were unable to pay more than the offer because anything greater would have jeopardised the Pounds 4m target. They offered a three-month pay deferral followed by a 4.7 per cent increase for the rest of the pay year. Union leaders are concerned that similar arguments will be used in the pay negotiations next year, especially as the profit target has been increased to Pounds 6m for the 1992 calendar year.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: What's up for grabs? - A report on new opportunities for service companies to bid for government contracts Opportunities to sell business services to a customer with a triple-A credit rating are rare in the present recession. The UK government's market-testing programme to put Pounds 1.5bn of civil service work out to tender has therefore excited widespread interest among service companies in the UK and abroad. Two conferences staged by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit to sell the programme to business (the most recent on Friday) have each attracted 500 executives to learn more about the work being market-tested and how to bid for it. Bidding for government contracts is a well-established part of business for companies in the defence industry. And service companies in fields such as office cleaning, catering, security guarding and printing have been winning contracts from government departments, local authorities and the health service since the start of the 1980s. But the government's latest programme of market-testing represents a 50-fold increase in its contracting-out programme. For the first time, core civil service activities such as collection of statistics, management of government computer facilities and fishery protection surveillance operations are to be put out to tender. And many more support services are on offer, including payroll, audit, accountancy, office services and legal advice. Many are advertised in the press; alternatively, companies can find out what work is available by contacting government ministries or the Efficiency Unit. There is also a drive to attract small and medium-sized enterprises into the market, since ministers are keen to stimulate competition for contracts. According to the Efficiency Unit, more than 300 of the 350 contracts on offer in this first round of market-testing involve fewer than 200 jobs  - and 83 currently employ less than 10 people. Executives attending the Efficiency Unit conferences have been keen to know more about what would be expected of them and if previous experience in contracting for government will be necessary. According to Ian Williams of the Efficiency Unit, those in charge of awarding contracts will be looking for reliability, quality of staff and a track record in providing the sort of services out to tender. Competing bids will be judged on three sets of criteria: Capability - has the bidder the people and skills to do the job? Particular attention will be paid to the management and supervisory back-up to be provided. Technical assessment - whether the bid meets the requirements set out in the specification. BS5750 - a quality management standard - will not generally be a requirement. Financial standing - the robustness of the bid given the commercial and financial strength of the company. A common concern among potential bidders is that there will be an element of bias towards the in-house team, which will normally be competing to retain the work. Sir Peter Levene, the government's efficiency adviser, says great efforts have been made to ensure there will be 'fair and open competition' for contracts. Those responsible for drawing up contract specifications and evaluating bids will be separated by 'Chinese walls' from the staff currently doing the work. New costing guidance has been drawn up to ensure that in-house bids fully reflect overheads and start-up costs. The responsibility for ensuring fair play will ultimately lie with the National Audit Office, the government expenditure watchdog, Sir Peter says. Another concern is whether contract specifications will be too rigid to permit contractors to develop new and more flexible approaches to doing the work. 'Bidders will be encouraged to offer innovative or novel proposals,' according to Ian Williams. 'The successful bidder's proposal, as modified during discussions, will form part of the contract document.' Winning the business will not be the end of the process, however. Extensive arrangements will be put in place to check quality standards and monitor services - including random checks, regular inspections and audit of complaints. A second round of market-testing will be launched by the Efficiency Unit in the autumn, with at least a further Pounds 1bn of business put out to tender.  --------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF MARKET TESTING BY DEPARTMENT  ---------------------------------------------------                           Pounds m  --------------------------------------------------- Others                         241 N.

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY ISOLATES DEFECT IN TRIDENT MISSILE  </P> <P> The Navy has found the mechanical problem that caused a Trident 2 missile to  explode last March, and corrective design changes will contribute to a  three-month delay in deployment, a military official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said a Navy board of inquiry had  blamed the failure on a mechanical linkage in the first-stage nozzle. The  Pentagon previously had disclosed preliminary findings, made final by the Navy  board.  </P> <P> "We now expect the first operational missiles to be at sea on the (submarine)  USS Tennessee in March" of 1990, he said.  </P> <P> The Navy's investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident 2 missile  fired from the Tennessee blew up four seconds after launch.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hening Stanislavski, deputy chief of the UN </F> Sanctions Assistance Mission, by Tsvetana Krusteva; place and  date not given: "UN Observers Are Confronted With Companies  That Have Never Heard of the Yugo-Embargo"]    [Text] Hening Stanslavksi is the deputy leader of the UN  Sanctions Assistance Mission that is in charge of assisting  Bulgarian customs officials to prevent breaches of the embargo  against Serbia and Montenegro. On 29 January 1994, a group of  his colleagues were forced by gangsters to leave the Kalotina  checkpoint at the Serbian border and were followed to their  hotel in Sofia.    [Krusteva] Mr. Stanislavski, how many times did you discover  embargo breaches?    [Stanislavski] We just had a case in Vidin where a cargo  ship presumably tried to transport 5,000 tonnes of fuel  deliveries to Serbia. The vessel had arrived downstream during  the night with its lights out, without establishing any radio  contact with the shore authorities, and it was caught thanks to  the cooperation between the Bulgarian customs officials and  members of the Sanctions Assistance Mission and of the WEU  Control Group.    [Krusteva] How did it happen?    [Stanislavski] A customs official who had the evening off  and was staying at home looked out of his window and heard the  vessel approaching. He informed his colleague who was on duty  at the customs office. The ship was followed with a fast  motorboat, but did not stop until the joint crew showed its  weapons. The vessel's crew, which was presumably sailing under  a Czech flag, declared that it had never heard about an embargo.  The same cargo ship, however, was involved in a similar case,  in 1993, when its attempt to bust the embargo was prevented by  the UN mission and Bulgarian customs officials. In another  case, which occurred in December 1993, the Bulgarian river fleet  tried to sell seven cargo ships, three barges, and three  passenger ships to Serbia.    [Krusteva] Similar violations presumably occur also on the  border with Serbia?    [Stanislavski] In December 1993, I witnessed how the  Bulgarian customs officials lost control of their territory in  Kalotina, because of criminals who were in control of the  situation. The majority of customs officials are afraid of  being killed and hence, they are not in a position to cope  normally with their tasks. It was just before Christmas 1993  that the police organized an operation in the border area and  seemed to have solved the problem for the time being. The  current situation is peaceful, but one never knows how long this  is going to last, because the criminals who were arrested during  the operation were released within seven days.    [Krusteva] Are you concerned about the 29 January 1994  incident, and what are the problems, generally speaking, that  you are confronted with in this country?    [Stanislavski] Sometimes we have difficulties in  communicating and establishing contact with customs officials.  We are also confronted with security problems that have nothing  in common with the economic situation. The greatest problems  are emerging at the small border checkpoints where people are  waiting in line. Minor breaches of the embargo are always  likely to occur. I am talking about violations that the customs  officials are deliberately overlooking. We call them the  "illegal traffic of the ants." We could prevent them, but our  task is to cope with large-scale illegal traffic, which involves  smuggling several tonnes of goods.    [Krusteva] What are you supposed to do when you discover an  act of busting the embargo?    [Stanislavski] We are only assistants, which means that as  soon as we discover a breach we are obliged to inform the  Bulgarian authorities, namely the customs officials, and  sometimes even the Prosecutor's Office. It is their duty to  adopt the necessary measures.</p>

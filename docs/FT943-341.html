			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar deficit put at 1.8m tonnes The world is expected to face another deficit year in sugar supplies after a worsening in prospects for this year's crop, according to the latest report by ED &amp; F. Man, the UK commodities house. Sugar production is forecast to be 110.7m tonnes for the next crop year (1994-1995) leaving a shortfall of 1.8m tonnes. World supplies are already tight after the unloading of stocks in the current crop year when production of 109.03m tonnes led to a deficit of 2.2m tonnes. The two deficit years come after 12 years' of production surpluses with supply tightness already pushing prices higher. A poor sugar crop in China and crop difficulties in Cuba combined with India's desire to increase imports and rebuild stocks could all contribute towards pushing prices higher. Man expects India's output to reach 11.6m tonnes with consumption at 12.1m tonnes, leading to imports for next year at similar levels to this year. China's cane crop has been badly damaged by flooding this year and stocks are dwindling. Man's estimate for Cuba's crop next year is 3.5m tonnes - 500,000 tonnes below this season's level pushing the country out of the top ten producers.</p>

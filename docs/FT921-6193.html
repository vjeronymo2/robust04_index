			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BP workers vote against strike UNION MEMBERS at the BP Chemicals plant at Baglan Bay, West Glamorgan, have voted by a 3-1 majority against a strike over the company's intention to end collective bargaining. The ballot was organised by the TGWU general workers' and the AEU engineering workers' unions which now fear that the vote may encourage BP Chemicals to introduce similar measures at its other two main plants at Grangemouth in Scotland's Central region and Hull.</p>

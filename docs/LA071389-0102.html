			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TO STAY OUT OF ISRAELI COALITION DISPUTE  </P> <P> Washington will not pressure the Israeli Labor Party to remain in its fragile  coalition government with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir despite an internal  dispute over elections in the occupied territories, a U.S. official said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "No, that is something that the parties in Israel have to decide for  themselves," John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, told  a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.  </P> <P> Labor Party leader Shimon Peres this week urged the party to withdraw from the  coalition government with Shamir's Likud Party because of its new, hard-line  conditions for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The New York Times and the Washington Post reported Wednesday that Washington  is urging Labor to remain in the coalition. At the State Department, spokesman  Richard Boucher called the reports "patently absurd."  </P></p>

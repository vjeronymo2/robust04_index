			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice  president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], has welcomed a decisive and responsible Egyptian role in  resolving the crushing crisis in his country. He praised Egypt  for the immense sacrifices and assistance it offered for the  revolution in Yemen and for its constant support for current  Yemeni issues.    Interviewed by AL-AHRAM at his residence in Aden, al-Bid  stressed that Yemen cannot accept being a country of domestic or  international terrorism that may harm the Egyptian people.    He said if the Arab countries fail to join forces, they will  find themselves in a difficult situation.    Al-Bid said that the current crisis in Yemen has put to a  real test his country's ability to establish a state of  institutions and stability despite the stimuli of confrontation.    He noted that there has been no clear, unified vision toward  the unified state. The adversary forces, he added, did not give  the YSP enough time; the party was pushed to a difficult  position through assassination of its leading figures and  statesmen, and even desecration of houses. He noted the party's  sacrifices to establish a state that will take Yemen to the 21st  century, not return it to the 19th century.    Al-Bid considered the recently concluded Pledge and Accord  document as merely a step toward rectifying the course of unity.    He stressed that the crisis between him and Yemeni President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is not personal, but one among all ruling  organizations and bodies involved in the current dialogue.</p>

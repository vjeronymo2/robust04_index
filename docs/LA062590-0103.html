			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LIDO OCEAN FETE EXTOLS CLEAN BEACH  </P> <P> It was a bit of a spin on Earth Day.  </P> <P> Environmentalists gave speeches and passed out literature as part of the Stop  Toxic Ocean Pollution festival Sunday at Lido Marina Village.  </P> <P> But the main focus was on fun in the sun, including bands, a fashion show, lots  of seafood, a chowder cook-off and a sing-along, all to celebrate Orange  County's clean beaches, as well as warn of environmental hazards.  </P> <P> The event was a benefit for the Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign,  but was organized by Newport Beach residents.  </P> <P> Debbie LaPlant of Newport Beach, who came up with the idea for the celebration,  was inspired by the successful cleanup of the American Trader oil spill off  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "We had to celebrate the clean beaches and turn it into a positive situation,"  the 34-year-old LaPlant said. "I got all my friends and said, 'Come on, we're  going to have a show.' "  </P> <P> Speakers from groups including the Audubon Society and Save the Whales, along  with "Cheers" star John Ratzenberger and Miss Universe Mona Grundt, addressed  the crowd.  </P> <P> Lido restaurants, serving everything from shark to ice cream, donated 30% of  their proceeds from the event to the American Oceans Campaign.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Rusty Pelican won the chowder cook-off for a New England clam  chowder. "I really think we have the best chowder in Newport Beach," said Chuck  Cummings, general manager of the restaurant. "If it sounds cocky, it is."  </P> <P> Others used the occasion to display "environmentally conscious" wares.  </P> <P> Among them was the "Cricket," an electronic system installed on the inside of a  boat to prevent barnacles and other marine fauna and flora from attaching to  the hull. With the device, boaters don't have to use toxic paint to ward off  sea life, according to the manufacturer.  </P> <P> "No matter what paint it is, they all work on the basis of being toxic," said  Stephen Rabbette, a representative of the manufacturing company. "You don't use  the toxics at all -- you don't need them."  </P> <P> Bill Hamilton, owner of the Cannery Restaurant, demonstrated the Hamilton Oil  Remover, which he said can be used to mop up oil spills of up to 10,000  gallons. The device has a rotating drum that sticks to oil, but not water. As  the drum turns, oil is collected in a pan and vacuumed up into buckets. It can  collects 450 gallons of oil per hour, Hamilton said.  </P> <P> Hamilton said he hopes to develop the oil remover so it can be used in larger  spills, such as that of the American Trader.  </P> <P> "It's obvious that the need is there," Hamilton said. "It was a big one, but it  wasn't anything like Valdez or Texas, and we still couldn't control it." TED  JOHNSON  </P></p>

FSLN candidate (Evelyn Watler) was beaten up,  and a window in a station wagon owned by Victor Espinoza, FSLN  political secretary in Puerto Cabezas, was smashed.    Brooklyn Rivera, YATAMA's top leader and currently director  of INDERA [Nicaraguan Institute for the Development of the  Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast], headed the attack.  Alfonso Smith, governor of the North Atlantic Autonomous  Region, Kenneth Bush, the Government Ministry's delegate, and  other YATAMA activists also lead the criminal action.    The FSLN issued a statement on Radio Caribe on the night of  23 February repudiating the attitude of the YATAMA leaders and  urging authorities to restore order in the North Atlantic  Autonomous Region.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ARMS RACE IN NICARAGUA;  </P> <P> IT TAKES TWO TO DISARM -- CONTRAS AS WELL AS SANDINISTAS  </P> <P> Nicaragua is not Lebanon -- at least not yet.  </P> <P> So recent reports that the Sandinistas are passing out guns to their supporters  before handing the government over to President-elect Violeta Chamorro are not  the cause for panic that they would be in Beirut. But it's an alarming  development that must be stopped.  </P> <P> The tactic is not new: The need for a well-armed militia has been Sandinista  dogma ever since they took control of the popular revolution that overthrew  Somoza in 1979. The country's 75,000-person army, for example, includes 30,000  militia members and reservists who keep their weapons at home. So the  Sandinistas won't stop their routine practice of distributing thousands of  pistols and rifles while the Contra rebels who have been fighting against them  also remain armed.  </P> <P> After their defeat in last month's election, Sandinista leaders said they were  willing to give up power. But they won't leave their many supporters in the  Nicaraguan countryside to the mercy of the Contras or the vengeful landowners  who may try to retake farms that were confiscated during the last 10 years and  broken into small plots for pro-Sandinista peasants.  </P> <P> That's why Chamorro and other opposition leaders must renew their effort to  persuade Contra leaders in neighboring Honduras to demobilize their troops.  Turning in their guns would be the clearest signal the Contras can send the  Sandinistas. That would also deprive the Sandinistas of any excuse for handing  out any more guns on their side -- or, if they did, subject them to  condemnation by the United Nations, Organization of American States and the  many other neutral bodies that verified Chamorro's election victory.  </P> <P> Obviously when lots of people have guns, the potential for a blood bath exists.  But it doesn't have to come to that -- if both sides are convinced that there's  no longer any need for violence in Nicaragua. For now, the first step must be  taken by Chamorro and the opposition. They have won, after all, and if the  Sandinistas try to deny them that victory, they will have something a lot more  potent than guns to back them up: world support.  </P></p>

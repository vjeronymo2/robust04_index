He briefed them, along with the sons of this  homeland, on the great pressures and responsibilities that  Jordan has borne and is still bearing. No other country could  have remained steadfast while facing these pressures and  responsibilities and at the same maintained its principles and  its security, and continued carrying its message.    With the right words, his majesty reviewed the pan-Arab and  courageous role Jordan had played in rescuing the major part of  Palestine, and the position it adopted in 1967, without which  Israel would have occupied both banks [of the Jordan River].    Twenty years ago, Jordan tried to warn of the vacuum that  would result from viewing the PLO as the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people, not for ambitions or  intentions it was harboring, but to give the country from which  the land was snatched the opportunity to regain it before giving  it back to its owners. But the Rabat summit decision was adopted  at that time, and the vacuum of which Jordan had warned occurred.    When Jordan decided to disengage links with the West Bank,  it  sought to cede the land to the Palestinians and not the  Israelis. However, developments and recent agreements did not  fully lead in this direction. A new situation surfaced with  which Jordan tried to deal with the highest possible  self-restraint, and declared that it accepts what the  Palestinian leadership accepts.    Nevertheless, the brothers in the Palestinian leadership  began to keep away from coordination, which aims in the first  place to safeguard their authority on their soil and to realize  the hoped-for objectives of ending the occupation and attaining  independence and sovereignty.    Since the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, Jordan has  been aiming to reach an understanding with the future authority  in the West Bank and Gaza and not with the authority that is  occupying them. Jordan has been hoping that its eagerness to  maintain the Arab nature of the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem  in particular would be met with eagerness by the brothers in the  Palestinian leadership to expedite bolstering future  Jordanian-Palestinian relations on sound political and economic  bases that reflect the cohesion between the two fraternal  peoples--cohesion that no one can end or shatter.    Therefore, Jordan has the right, amid the successive  developments in the region, to ask the brothers in Palestinian  leadership to expedite reaching an understanding and to  coordinate with Jordan in order to establish sound and healthy  relations that will be in the interest of the two peoples, and  in order to prevent the occupier from benefiting from any  confusion that may strike these relations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Central Information Office Minister [title as  heard] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares said the Democratic Action [AD]  proposal for a special powers law is interesting. He added,  however, that it remains to be seen what methods will be used to  reach a consensus in the legislature to approve the proposal.    Alvarez Bajares believes the measure would expedite the  implementation of certain laws that must be applied quickly if  they are to accomplish the intended objectives.    [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] The AD proposal refers to  the truly difficult situation the country is experiencing. We  want to interpret this proposal with the utmost good faith in  the sense that it can contribute to the expediency of  decisionmaking and therefore speed up the process to solve the  country's crisis. [end recording]    Alvarez Bajares noted that although the AD proposal is  interesting, the government had at no time considered making  such a proposal itself.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIA'S LEADER SEEKS SUPPORT ON U.S. VISIT;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THRUST TO THE FORE BY EVENTS, THE FORMER DISSIDENT IS DUE IN L.A.  ON A MISSION TO GATHER HELP FROM 'OUR BROTHERS ABROAD.'  </P> <P> A scholar in the history of ancient Armenia and Syria left his books two years  ago and took to the streets to try to free his people from Communist rule.  After six months behind bars for his dissident activities, Levon Ter-Petrosyan  is now the president of the smallest Soviet republic.  </P> <P> Changes are coming so rapidly in the Soviet Union that dissidents do become  presidents and sit down to negotiate with the Kremlin leaders who had jailed  them. The visions that seemed so dangerous just months ago now are official  policies.  </P> <P> "Everything flows by so fast," Ter-Petrosyan said about the pace of events in  Armenia. "We haven't even had the chance to ponder the changes."  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan is due in Los Angeles as part of a nine-day visit to the United  States that has also taken him to New York and Washington to meet with U.S.  officials, including President Bush, and Armenian groups to lobby for support.  </P> <P> "I look on my trip as a consolidation of the Armenian diaspora to help create  an independent Armenian government," Ter-Petrosyan said. "We need moral,  material, economic and political help from our brothers abroad."  </P> <P> Help from abroad is especially important to Armenia now, Ter-Petrosyan said,  because it must learn to live without Moscow's control or support.  </P> <P> At home, Armenians' faith in Ter-Petrosyan and his government of former  dissidents gives him a mandate previous Communist-led governments never  enjoyed.  </P> <P> "It's our only asset," Ter-Petrosyan, 45, said in an interview. "We have no  experience in managing the state, we have no authority as politicians as yet,  and so we have only the people's trust to work with."  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan, who has written extensively on the cultural relations between  ancient Armenia and Christian Syria, put his studies aside in 1988 to join  forces with several other scholars in the Karabakh Committee, a tight circle of  intellectuals that became the heart of the Armenian nationalist movement.  </P> <P> The scholars regularly drew tens of thousands of people into the streets of  Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to protest violence against Christian Armenians  in the neighboring Muslim republic of Azerbaijan and to call for an end to the  Communist Party and central government's rule in Armenia.  </P> <P> The central topic of many of the rallies was the long-festering conflict over  Nagorno-Karabakh. An Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh has  voted to join Armenia, but Azerbaijanis consider the territory historically  theirs.  </P> <P> The protests brought Ter-Petrosyan to the fore. A tall man with a calm  disposition, he spoke more often than anyone else at these rallies and worked  from dawn to midnight for the movement.  </P> <P> "He's a good orator because he explains things very well," said Babken  Ararktsyan, another member of the Karabakh Committee and Armenia's new vice  president. "His personality is very attractive to the people."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was far from pleased with  the activities of Ter-Petrosyan and his fellow nationalists. While on a trip to  view the devastation of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia, Gorbachev  accused the Karabakh Committee of exploiting the tragedy to further Armenian  claims to Nagorno-Karabakh, then under virtual siege by Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> Over the next weeks, Ter-Petrosyan and several other nationalists were jailed.  Formal charges were never brought against them. Their detention only increased  the committee's popularity. When Ter-Petrosyan was released, he was suffering  from a back ailment so painful that he was hospitalized for four months in  France.  </P> <P> "He was imprisoned to free his people," Mager Airapetyan, 36, a supply manager  for a private construction firm, said. "Levon Ter-Petrosyan is our king. Thank  God our people finally have a king again. If the Communists do not thwart him  in his struggle for democracy, he will surely be successful."  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan had been jailed before for his political activity. As a  university student in 1966, he spent 10 days in jail for organizing nationalist  demonstrations and meetings.  </P> <P> "Most of my friends from the Karabakh Committee started in politics as student  activists in the '60s," he said referring to the period of political thaw under  Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev. "We're part of the Khrushchev generation."  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan's activities contrasted sharply with the political beliefs of his  father, a founder of the underground Syrian Communist Party, who brought his  family back to their homeland in 1946 when Ter-Petrosyan was a year old.  </P> <P> But after university, Ter-Petrosyan largely stuck to his study of ancient  Armenian-Syrian relations, writing six books and more than 70 scholarly  articles.  </P> <P> And, until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the government allowed little  nationalist expression.  </P> <P> Although Ter-Petrosyan's ascent to the Armenian presidency seems lightning  fast, he said it was natural for the Armenian Parliament to elect him almost  two months ago. Since last year, he has headed the Armenian All-National  Movement, which won two-thirds of the seats in the parliamentary elections in  May; the movement had only four seats in the previous Parliament.  </P> <P> Soon after Ter-Petrosyan's election, Gorbachev telephoned to congratulate him  and made it clear that he would not treat him as a former dissident.  </P> <P> Although Gorbachev seems to have revised his opinion of Ter-Petrosyan, the  Armenian leader has little complimentary to say about the Soviet president.  </P> <P> "In the very beginning, 1985, Gorbachev was the initiator of the reforms,"  Ter-Petrosyan said. "But since then he has always been the rear guard. He is  always behind the pace of events."  </P> <P> Ter-Petrosyan, nonetheless, said he intends to work with the Soviet president  to achieve his aims for the republic.  </P> <P> Right after his election Aug. 4, Ter-Petrosyan flew to Moscow and persuaded  Gorbachev to extend by two months the deadline for paramilitary groups in  Armenia to disarm. Then he began to disarm the bands himself. He had convinced  Gorbachev, he said, that it would be dangerous if troops from Moscow were used.  </P> <P> "The people would not have understood if the Russian army was punishing  Armenian militia, and would have stood up against the army," Ter-Petrosyan  said. "When we did it ourselves, the people understood and said we did the  right thing."  </P> <P> Most of the weapons have been turned over, Ter-Petrosyan said, and those  militia members who kept their arms pledged allegiance to the Parliament.  </P> <P> The people will respect Ter-Petrosyan's decrees, Ararktsyan said, "because he  is the first Armenian leader who really represents the people."  </P> <P> But Ter-Petrosyan needs more than public popularity to salvage Armenia's  economy, reconstruct the areas destroyed by the earthquake, establish a  democracy and assert Armenia's independence from the Kremlin after more than 70  years of Communist rule from Moscow.  </P> <P> Soon after Ter-Petrosyan came to power, the Armenian Parliament passed a  declaration on the republic's independence.  </P> <P> "It calls for gradual increase in the republic's sovereignty," he said. "I mean  economic independence and our own foreign policy. We haven't had this for more  than 70 years because we have been monopolized by Moscow. Now we want  independence here, too."  </P> <P> Lending A HAND: Armenian-Americans bring help, money and hope to Soviet  republic. A18  </P></p>

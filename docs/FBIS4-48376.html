			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UN Security Council has passed a resolution  allowing for the deployment of 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda. One  hundred and fifty UN monitors will be sent to Rwanda immediately  and 500 Ghanaian troops, who had been withdrawn from Rwanda,  will be sent back. No country so far has confirmed readiness  for contribution to the troops to be sent to Rwanda. [passage  omitted]    Concerning the resolution of sending 5,500 UN troops to  Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has given a statement  saying that it would not be bound by the resolution, if the  government in Rwanda participated in passing the resolution.  The RPF has also called for the withdrawal of the UN special  representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, before  the RPF can approve the deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda.  Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has been closely associated with  the dictatorship in Rwanda, to the extent that he has helped to  install the current illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF  has accepted the principle of deploying a UN force to Rwanda  with a humanitarian mission, with a reasonable number of troops,  about 2,500 troops.</p>

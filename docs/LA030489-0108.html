			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING: DABBLING IN DAFFODILS AT DESCANSO  </P> <P> Anyone who has traveled to the Pacific Northwest in spring has seen one of the  region's most glorious sights -- huge yellow daffodils, thousands of them,  glowing in the fog as if lighted from within.  </P> <P> Many Southern Californians have come home from such trips eager to grow those  splendid flowers in their gardens. Come fall, they rush out, buy two dozen of  the King Alfred bulbs they saw blooming in such profusion in Washington and  Oregon, plant them and wait for success. And they're almost invariably  disappointed.  </P> <P> Not only are the blossoms not as spectacular here, the King Alfred usually  performs well only during the first year it's planted.  </P> <P> "If you're happy with the King Alfred's blossoms that first year, be satisfied  and throw out the bulbs," says Polly Anderson, a lifelong gardener and a  founding member of the Southern California Daffodil Society. "However, part of  (the society's) ambition is to find varieties that do well in Southern  California -- and that means ones that will naturalize."  </P> <P> This weekend at Descanso Gardens, you'll have the opportunity to see daffodils  that do do well in Southern California; so well, in fact, that they will often  naturalize -- in other words, make themselves right at home in your garden and  come back year after year without much effort on your part.  </P> <P> Anderson, who is an expert on creating new strains through cross-pollination,  says Peeping Tom and February Gold are daffodils that do particularly well in  this area. Both are yellow and both have blooms on the small side.  </P> <P> "The white ones, in general, don't do as well here as the yellow ones, but the  blends of yellow and white do fine," she says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sun Lovers  </P> <P> She suggests planting the bulbs in a sunny location in September or October.  Set them six to eight inches deep and add a good, low-nitrogen granulated  fertilizer to the planting hole. Then water the bed moderately but regularly.  You won't see their sunny faces until early spring.  </P> <P> "When the green spikes peek out of the ground, begin watering heavily,"  Anderson says. "It's really hard to over-water when daffodils are in their  fast-growing and blooming stages." Give them another good feeding when they  begin to grow.  </P> <P> Then, enjoy. With luck and a little cold weather, you'll have blooms for weeks.  </P> <P> After the blossoms are gone, let the greens rest until they bend over and lose  all traces of green. When they're completely brown, cut them off at ground  level and resume a light watering schedule.  </P> <P> Daffodils like the company of other plants in the garden and don't mind poking  up through annuals. "A lot of old-timers plant the daffodils right in their  lawns, where they'll naturalize. Then they just leave them there," Anderson  says. "We even know one fine grower who lets the weeds grow around his  daffodils as a natural mulch, which he doesn't pull until the blossoms are  gone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wide Selection of Bulbs  </P> <P> Local nurseries typically have a good selection of daffodil bulbs on hand  during planting season -- but, again, don't be hoodwinked by the spectacular  photos on the King Alfred boxes. You might also want to write for a catalogue  from Grant Mitsch Novelty Daffodils, P.O. Box 218, Hubbard, Ore. 97032 --  you'll see varieties that never are available through retail outlets here, and  the catalogue does note which strains are well-suited for Southern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All in the Family  </P> <P> The daffodil, like the jonquil, is a member of the narcissus group and all are  part of the amaryllis family; many members of the family thrive in Southern  California. Anderson is particularly fond of the paper-white narcissus, which  smell divine and naturalize beautifully. Because of our cool February, many  narcissus are still in bloom, and some will be on display during the  competition at Descanso Gardens.  </P> <P> The Southern California Daffodil Society Competition, today from 1:30 to 4 p.m.  and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge,  will feature 200-300 different kinds of daffodils, from old favorites such as  Tete-a-Tete, a miniature yellow trumpet, to strains so new that you won't find  them in any catalogue. Although there is no additional fee for viewing the  competition, general admission to the gardens is $3; seniors 62 and older and  students with ID $1.50; children 5-12, 75 cents; 4 and younger are free.  </P> <P> A number of classes on growing the daffodils, including sessions on  cross-pollination, will be featured throughout the two-day competition.  </P></p>

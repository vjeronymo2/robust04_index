			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] La Paz, 7 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Approximately  20,000 peasants--some 20 percent of the coca growers of the  Cochabamba tropical region and La Paz department--today  expressed their willingness "to replace coca with other  products" on condition the government carries out, in the short  term, "effective alternative development plans" in the  production zones.    Several coca growers' leaders told LOS TIEMPOS that their  unions "will do this if the Government Ministry and the Social  Defense Secretariat" fulfill their commitments with the peasants.    The union leader said: "They just make promises but have  done  nothing to carry out the projects and works established in the  agreements and documents signed with officials in March and May  of this year." [passage omitted]    The government announced recently that at least $600 million  has been invested in alternative development plans in the  Chapare region of Cochabamba and the Yungas region of La Paz.    The official spokesmen added that only about 10 percent [as  published] of that amount--about $100 million--has "really" been  used in projects to replace coca.    The coca leaders added that most of the plans "failed, to  the  misfortune of the peasants and the country."</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / BR chief warns of rail 'devastation' from signal strike British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid intervened publicly in the signalling dispute for the first time yesterday with a grim warning that continuing disruption threatened the future of the railway industry and everybody who works in it. In an open letter to Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT transport union's general secretary, he warned that the expected intensification of the eight-week long conflict with the planned stoppages for 72 hours around next weekend 'would be hugely destructive'. The BR chairman called on the RMT executive to ballot their signalling grade members again on Railtrack's latest pay offer and suspend further strike action until the result was known. His plea came as travellers endured the eighth 24-hour strike by signal staff and as the RMT prepared to announce the result of the rail supervisors' strike ballot. Their decision will have a crucial impact on the dispute. Sir Bob said it would be 'devastating' if the rail dispute were 'to degenerate into outright confrontation'. 'There is a new atmosphere of bitterness and recrimination in the public statements from both sides,' he said. 'That is no help to us in dealing with the difficult and taxing problems ahead - reorganising the industry and continuing to improve services to secure business for rail. All must do whatever we can to avoid that. I believe there is a last chance for you to take action that could avoid it.' In a separate letter to Railtrack chairman Mr Bob Horton, Sir Bob said that his 'key concern' was to 'do whatever I can to ensure that the railways get back as quickly as possible to providing the safe and reliable service to our customers that is vital for all of us in industry'. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four's PM programme last night, Sir Bob said there might have to be sackings before the dispute was solved though he added that this 'does not have to happen'. Railtrack said last night it had no immediate plan to force through its pay offer by requiring signalling staff to sign new employment contracts and it ruled out any suggestion that any of them would be dismissed. Instead it called on the signalling staff to urge their union to come back to the negotiating table. The state-owned company that maintains and runs the network claimed that the package on offer is liked by signal staff in every area of the country. It called on them to 'persuade the RMT executive to listen to them and reconsider plunging the industry into even deeper conflict'. Yesterday, Railtrack denied suggestions it had made any new offer when talking to the conciliation service Acas over the past few days. But it said it had 'repackaged' its pay offer by agreeing to an improvement. This would involve consolidating half the 6 per cent supplement into basic rates proposed eight weeks ago, which will be backdated to April 4. Railtrack said this would give the signalling staff an immediate earnings increase of 4.5 per cent. An RMT spokesman said that there was no extra money involved. 'The gap between what we want and what is being offered has not closed.' The union still insists on an interim payment for past efficiency savings before talking about restructuring. Railtrack wants the whole package to be negotiated while accepting there should be an up-front payment. Railtrack plans for the unthinkable Page 5 Observer Page 15</p>

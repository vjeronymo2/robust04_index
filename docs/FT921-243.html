			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: New violin concertos The new violin concertos by Dominic Muldowney and Robin Holloway, premiered in the last fortnight by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the BBC Philharmonic respectively, are big, ambitious pieces, each an important staging post in its composer's development. But there the similarities begin and end. For where Muldowney's work represents a genuinely fruitful attempt to revivify the concerto tradition, and to create something live and dynamic out of the traditional opposition of soloist and orchestra, Holloway's seems more concerned with nostalgic backward glances, fondly and elegantly exploring a lost expressive world without ever colonising new territory of its own. Though it was completed more than two year ago, Muldowney's concerto is the the most elaborate to date of his experiments in rhythm and in combining different strands of tempo. Here the orchestra is divided left and right into two ensembles, each with its own conductor and set of metronome speeds laid down by computer-generated click tracks. At some points the two groups have totally independent material, at others they share, while the soloist holds the ring between them, looking from one to the other to take tempo cues, siding first with one and then the other. It takes us away, says Muldowney, 'from the 19th-century notion of the solitary hero struggling against the rest and towards that now common dilemma, a choice between two.' He is so adroit in handling his rhythmic constructs that it's the almost theatrical vividness of these shifting liaisons and the teeming invention of the music that is projected, hardly ever the mathematical complexity. So though the components of the slow movement concern themselves with the tempo ratio of 499: 500 the music emerges untrammelled, as a shining rhapsody with the soloist's lyrical subtley inflected lines spun across a gentle, fluctuating accompaniment. There are three movements, but the concerto is also conceived as a giant set of seven variations on the same Bach chorale Es ist genug that dominates the finale of Berg's concerto. In this case though the effect is not at all valedictory. The first movement moves through a kaleidoscope of rhythmic relationships, taking up the first five variations which outline a waltz at one point, a kind of scherzo at another, and always etching the solo line sharply against the busy orchestral detail until it is overwhelmed in the last section. Then after the beautifully poised slow movement, the finale, another single variation, careens along as a toccata while the tempo constantly changes and the textures gather themselves, fall apart and reform. The performance had been splendidly prepared; the composer and Libor Pesek took charge of the bifurcated Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and Tasmin Little was a compelling soloist, astonishingly assured in a part that requires her constantly to change tack and yet preserve her poise and sense of proportion. It's undoubtedly a work with which she should gain a stack of engagements. * Holloway's concerto is a good deal more straightforward, and for all its incidental beauties, finally lacks a distinctive character. Holloway declares it to be a homage to the French tradition, burying away a Faure song at its emotional centre and it certainly provides the soloist - Ernst Kovacic, for whom Holloway wrote his winning violin Romanza 15 years ago - with succulent, grandly expressive opportunities. Yet Holloway's gentle reflections and tonal shifts evoke other references - back to Elgar in the fruitiest passages, to Berg in its more bittersweet moments. It is all very pleasant and easy on the ear with a refinement and discipline which some of Holloway's recent music has lacked. But unlike the Muldowney it never leaves the impression that there are yet more rewards hidden beneath the surface, awaiting discovery. Liverpool Royal Philharmonic/BBC Radio 3</p>

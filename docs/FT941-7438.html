			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest fails to please Financial stocks were shaken as National Westminster Bank reported preliminary profits at the lower end of market estimates and disappointed the market's optimists in revealing a 6 per cent increase in the dividend total. NatWest shares plunged soon after the figures were released and ended a turbulent session 28 1/2 lower at 503 1/2 p. The pressure of selling was sufficient to produce the heaviest day's business in NatWest shares - 20m - since September 17, 1992, the day after the UK withdrew from the ERM. One bank specialist said the market was not especially perturbed by the profits and dividend figures but there was a worry that the underlying profits could be coming under pressure. There was also concern that the exceptionally good results from NatWest Markets may not be sustainable.</p>

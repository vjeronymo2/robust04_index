			<p>BFN     [Text] The water resources working group within the  multilateral talks stemming from the Middle East peace  conference continued its meetings at the Muscat Intercontinental  Hotel this morning.    The sultanate's delegation to this meeting was led by His  Excellency Muhammad Bin-'Alawi al-Khusaybi, the Omani ambassador  to Japan.    A source close to the meeting said the group will discuss  the  same issues on its agenda again today, including regional  cooperation, administering water resources, and collecting data  on water and water supplies.    The conferees have initially agreed to set up an  international research center on sea water desalination in the  sultanate. The center will try to coordinate research efforts  in order to reduce the costs of sea water desalination  technology, in order to enable the countries of the region to  get fresh water at low cost, and to reduce dependence on  declining quantities of surface and ground waters.</p>

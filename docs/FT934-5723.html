			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Brazil debt hope A large majority of Brazil's foreign bank creditors support the Dollars 52bn (Pounds 34.8bn) debt agreement due to be signed in Toronto today, writes Richard Waters in New York. By the end of last week, creditors accounting for 86 per cent of the debt had backed the deal, said Mr Bill Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank. The deal needs 95 per cent support to be triggered. Brazil has yet to reach an agreement with the IMF, on which the bank deal depends.</p>

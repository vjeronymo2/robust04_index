			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank comments ignored BUNDESBANK officials yesterday issued strong hints that another cut in official German rates would not be announced at their council meeting on Thursday, but that did not stop the D-Mark weakening against most currencies, writes James Blitz. As usual, the market is in two minds about whether to expect another cut in official German rates this week. On the one hand, the German central bank has carefully eased money market rates down to a level 75 basis points below the Lombard rate ceiling. On the other hand, recent comments from Bundesbank officials on monetary policy have leaned on the hawkish side. Yesterday, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, added to the hawkishness by saying that lower German rates were more likely to occur through money market operations than through cuts in key lending rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, added that the Bundesbank saw no reason to sound the all-clear on monetary policy, and that price stability remained the central bank's primary goal. Yet, these comments were ignored in a market which is confident that German rates will be cut soon, perhaps even this week. The dollar strengthened against the D-Mark in European trading, peaking at DM1.5435, and closing up nearly a pfennig at DM1.5385. The Spanish peseta also strengthened considerably, closing at Pta70.69 from a previous Pta71.58. Like other exchange rate mechanism currencies, the Spanish currency rallied as expectations of a realignment of the ERM failed to be met at the weekend. The Italian lira rallied particularly strongly. There is growing confidence in the Italian currency, and in the prospect that it will re-enter the ERM sooner rather than later. Yesterday, the lira closed at L863.3 to the D-Mark from a previous L876.1. The damage that Britain's political turmoil is doing to sterling is all too clear from the fact that, even in this environment, the pound managed to lose nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close at DM2.4425. The pound also lost more than 2 1/2 cents against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5870, a seventeen month low against the US currency. Sterling was specifically undermined Mr John Major's threat to call a general election if Conservative backbenchers fail to ratify the Maastricht bill in parliament. If the situation worsens, the pound could threaten the historic low of DM2.3690 reached in the aftermath of 'Black Wednesday.' There could be more volatility in the sterling/dollar exchange rate, because of the dollar's upward direction. Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said yesterday that sterling could drop to Dollars 1.20 next year.</p>

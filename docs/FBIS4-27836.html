			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Washington is not  considering military options against North Korea for its refusal  to allow checks of its nuclear facilities and will work through  the United Nations, a senior Foreign Ministry official said  Monday.    Yutaka Kawashima, director general of the Foreign Ministry's  Asian Affairs Bureau, was responding to concerns posed at a  House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing that the  United States was considering independent sanctions.    "The concern of the U.S. Government has been squeezed down  to  how to respond through the UN Security Council and there was no  thinking about military options," Kawashima said in response to  a question.    Kazuo Kitagawa, a member of coalition component Komeito, had  asked Kawashima about remarks made by U.S. Secretary of Defense  William Perry in a U.S. television interview that it is possible  that independent sanctions may be imposed on North Korea by  countries involved in the issue.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said that Japan will provide its  efforts through a number of routes, while noting that Tokyo is  seeking a negotiated resolution to North Korea's refusal to open  its nuclear activities to full international inspections.    Hata, speaking at the same committee sesssion, said Japan  will cooperate with the international community "within the  limits permitted by the constitution" if the UN should decide to  impose sanctions on North Korea.</p>

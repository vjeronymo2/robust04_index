			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FAFFNER HALL' OPENS WITH MUPPETS AND FRIENDS  </P> <P> Oh, those ubiquitous Muppets. The dynasty that Jim Henson hath wrought takes up  the cause of music appreciation in "The Ghost of Faffner Hall," an ambitious  new children's series that begins at 8:30 tonight on HBO.  </P> <P> It all happens in a Gothic mansion called Faffner Hall, an institution  dedicated to music. Residents include the Hall's founder, Fughetta Faffner, a  ghost who loves music (even if it does tend to "solidify her ectoplasm"); the  fat, jolly Wild Impressario, who plans the Hall's musical events, and hipsters  Rif and Mimi.  </P> <P> There are assorted penguins, fish, otherworldly monsters and the villain of the  piece, music hater Farkus Faffner.  </P> <P> Top-drawer, winsome guest stars are worked into each plot. Tonight's episode,  "Your Body Is an Instrument," features Gary Karr, who says his double bass is  his voice and "my voice is me"; Grammy winner Bobby McFerrin, whose body is an  entire orchestra; and Swedish trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger playing an achingly  beautiful solo. (The show's music is original.)  </P> <P> In next week's episode, Nigel Kennedy, with his punk-rock look and young boy  charm, shows the extraordinary range of a violin, while singer-songwriter Joni  Mitchell is Wild Impressario's love interest.  </P> <P> Created by producer Jocelyn Stevenson and based on a curriculum developed by  two University of York professors, John Paynter and R. Murray Schafer, the  13-part series is designed to inspire creative listening and show that all  sounds can be musical.  </P> <P> Does it all work? Surprisingly, no. It's watchable, the Muppet creations are as  wild and wonderful as expected and the guest stars even more so -- they all but  steal the show. (Future guests include Ry Cooder, Dizzy Gillespie and Ladysmith  Black Mombazo.)  </P> <P> But entertainment and education here are a lumpy mix; the pot needs more  stirring. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

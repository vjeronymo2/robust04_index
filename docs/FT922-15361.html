Gearing was cut from 131 per cent to nil at the year end. There was a strong performance from the automotive division, which included figures from Motor Panels for four months, towards the end of the year. All companies traded profitably except one of the marketing services offshoots. However, after an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 1.85m) relating to business closure costs and the sale of Tri-ang in 1990, the loss for the year was Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 1.46m). A dividend is not being recommended but the company said it was proposing a reduction of the share premium account to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves and payments should resume this year. Group turnover was Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 13.8m). Earnings per share were 1.91p (1.56p).</p>

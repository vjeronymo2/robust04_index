			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA) -- Arab diplomatic sources in  Cairo have stated that the shuttles that President Mubarak's  envoy Ambassador Badr Hammam is currently making between Sanaa  and Aden are the "last hope" in the attempts designed to prevent  the outbreak of a devastating all-out civil war between north  and south Yemen. According to these sources, numerous Arab and  international parties have exerted intensive efforts to mediate  between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, leader of the General  People's Congress [GPC] in Sanaa, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice  president and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leader in Aden, to  preserve the unity of the state. However, the mediation efforts  have been in vain and failed to prevent the recent military  clashes that left more than 1,000 military personnel dead.  These sources expressed their fear that the Yemeni crisis might  reach the point of no return in view of the resumption of  clashes between the northern and southern forces. They also  expressed their fear that Yemen may not remain united.    These sources noted that the Yemeni opposition is currently  demanding that confidence be withdrawn from the government  because it is responsible for the current disarray. They  pointed out that the opposition is demanding the formation of a  national salvation government in which all political forces  participate in order to preserve the unity of the state and  implement the "Pledge and Accord" document on national  reconciliation that was recently signed in Amman.    The battles that occurred in the 'Imran camp north of Sanaa  represent a fresh escalation of a serious political crisis that  has continued for eight months between the two main parties in  the ruling coalition, the GPC in the north and the YSP in the  south. During their propaganda campaign they traded severe  accusations that the other one is seeking to secede and is  responsible for the deterioration of the political and economic  situation in Yemen.    This crisis has crippled political and economic activities  and caused Vice President al-Bid to stay in Aden and refuse to  return to Sanaa. It has also led to the deterioration in the  economic situation, caused the national currency to plummet,  inflation to spiral, prices to go up, and unemployment to  increase because of a lack of new jobs as local investments  declined and foreign investors fear to enter the Yemen market in  view of instability and the assassination and kidnapping of  foreigners.    Despite the recent signing of the "Pledge and Accord"  document in Amman following intensive mediation by Jordan's King  Husayn, the two parties to the conflict failed to implement its  clauses. This document has been frozen, as it is the only hope  for the Yemeni people to emerge from the crisis and the Yemeni  leaders have already signed it and approved its clauses. Arab  sources in Cairo affirm that Egypt's efforts, led by President  Mubarak, are almost the last ditch for the Yemenis to keep the  banners of unity flying.</p>

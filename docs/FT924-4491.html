			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Building industry calls for rate cut A CUT IN interest rates of a further 1 percentage point is needed to stimulate recovery in the construction industry and to prevent further job losses, the government was warned last night, Andrew Taylor writes. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, the industry's biggest trade association, said: 'The construction industry faces a long haul before output reaches a level where the rise in unemployment will first be checked and then reversed.' Sir Brian was speaking at the confederation's annual dinner in London. He added: 'Another cut in interest rates of 1 per cent would provide a further vital component in the government's engine for growth.' More than 400,000 jobs are estimated to have been lost in the industry since the summer of 1989. Company failures, job losses and plant closures are expected to continue, even if construction output stops falling next year. Sir Brian said the housing market needed improving if the economy was to recover and people were to be encouraged to start buying consumer goods again. In spite of government measures announced in the Autumn Statement, there remained significant anxiety about housing. Barely 800,000 house sales are expected this year, compared with 1.3m a year in the 1980s.</p>

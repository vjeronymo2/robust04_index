			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Venezualan charges put Young Group in the red WITH THE underlying business performing badly and the need to provide heavy exceptional and extraordinary charges, particularly for its Venezuelan investment, Young Group incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 6.71m in the six months ended May 30. Turnover at this USM-quoted coal mining group fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 21.6m) and the trading outcome, after interest, went from a Pounds 756,000 profit to a Pounds 952,000 loss following a small deficit in the second half of last year. On top of that were exceptionals of Pounds 2.93m for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.88m, and extraordinaries of Pounds 2.82m. The UK opencast sites suffered both tonnage and quality difficulties stemming from the geological and mining problems experienced last year. However, as a result of actions taken the remainder of 1992 was expected to show a recovery, said Mr Robert Young, chairman. Of the exceptional charges Pounds 1.33m was for trading losses of the operation in Venezuela. The mine did not perform well, Mr Young said, and production was poorer than expected, with consequent severe cash flow problems for the group. Because of those changed circumstances, the option agreement for Peabody, the US coal producer, to acquire the Venezuelan subsidiary had been changed. Instead of being exercisable until next May at a price of Dollars 6.6m, it could be exercised this October but at Dollars 3m, and that write-down resulted in the extraordinary provision. Losses per share were 40.83p (earnings 5.56p). There is no interim dividend and there is unlikely to be a final or preference payment for the year. Previously, there was an interim of 2.6p.</p>

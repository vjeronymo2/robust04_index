			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO GEAR UP FOR AN ASSAULT ON GARMENT DISTRICT;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: THERE'S SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER THAT IT MAY TAKE MORE THAN ONE TRIP  TO FIND THE REAL DEALS. DISCOUNTS RANGE FROM 20% BELOW RETAIL TO BELOW  WHOLESALE.  </P> <P> Makeup artist Rose Librizzihad only minutes to spare. A limousine was waiting  outside the Cooper Building, in the heart of the Los Angeles Garment District,  to whisk her back to a movie set. She swooped up a $20 silk camisole to wear  with a $50 silk blazer she had purchased earlier in the day and raced for an  elevator -- her black leather bag (a $19 trophy from a previous visit) flapping  against her floral baby-doll dress, which, like her leggings, her lace bodysuit  and her black cowboy boots, was a discount treasure.  </P> <P> For Librizzi and others born to shop, the Garment District is a paradise  crammed with bargains. To the uninitiated, it is part jungle, part mystery. But  solve the mystery,and there is every chance of becoming a district devotee --  someone who returns again and again for the fun of the chase and the thrill of  a great deal.  </P> <P> Doing your homework before your first trip is essential. There are at least two  books on the subject, Barbara Moe's "Guide to the Los Angeles Garment District"  (C. Taylor Publishing Co.) and "Garment District Los Angeles" (P.B.G.  Publications). Both are available in major bookstores, and Moe's latest  edition, the 15th, will be out in December.  </P> <P> To cover the area, wear comfortable, accident-proof shoes and clothing. Chances  of someone treadding on your toes or smearing your blouse with ice cream are  excellent, especially on a crowded Saturday.  </P> <P> A fanny pack is the ideal way to transport a tape measure, pocket calculator  and acceptable credit cards (Discover is a no-no in most establishments, but  virtually everyone accepts Visa and Mastercard; carrying cash is not always  safe, and not every store accepts checks). It also frees your hands to feel the  merchandise. A woman wearing a bodysuit and leggings will be able to try on  clothing without the benefit of a dressing room, which not all stores have.  </P> <P> Basically, what you will find are overruns of current merchandise. But some  stores carry apparel produced just for them. To recognize a true bargain, shop  your favorite retail stores before heading downtown. And unless you are the  no-regrets type, limit yourself on the first few trips.  </P> <P> Trip 1, you might want to look but not buy. Trip 2, you might want to buy only  shoes, for example, or slacks. Select carefully because exchanges are usually  the best you can expect.  </P> <P> And never buy the first thing you see, unless you are confident or in a hurry.  Librizzi advises looking around for the best deals. Many stores carry the same  labels but not always at the same price. Some stores discount only 20% or 40%  below retail while others actually discount below wholesale. And many merchants  are prepared to bargain.  </P> <P> As for the lay of the land: The Alley is where the whole scene began in 1979  when a few manufacturers opened their back doors to the public. Now, it has a  flea market feel to it, and you have to sift through a lot of merchandise to  find the goodies and the good stores.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, especially in stores along Los Angeles Street between 7th and 9th,  you can find known labels -- such as Nolan Miller, Nino Cerruti, Esprit, Liz  Claiborne, Albert Nipon, Jones New York, Donna Karan, Anne Klein, Gianni  Versace and Giorgio Armani -- in a retail atmosphere that includes helpful  salespeople and fitting rooms.  </P> <P> With so many stores in the area, it is truly a buyer's market, and merchants  are looking for repeat customers. If you don't like the conditions in one  store, find another.  </P> <P> This is especially true for men, because the Garment District is a male  shopper's dream. There are many, many stores offering top-notch apparel. Some  even have amenities virtually unheard of for women, such as in-house tailoring  and free delivery.  </P> <P> The closer you park to the heart of the district, the higher the price. The  California Mart and the Cooper Building have underground garages that are very  expensive. For bargain parking, look for outdoor lots around 9th and Wall  streets or 9th Street and Maple Avenue. Don't park on the street even if you  find a metered space. Chances are you will shop longer than planned, and one  ticket could turn your bargains to dust.  </P> <P> Stores are generally open Monday through Saturday, 9:30 a.m to 5 p.m. and  Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Linda Sweeten of the Fashion staff and Aaron Davis, View editorial assistant,  contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A FEW ESSENTIALS  </P> <P> Wear comfortable, accident-proof clothing and shoes.  </P> <P> Take a fanny pack instead of a purse to keep your valuables as close as  possible.  </P> <P> Pack a tape measure to measure clothes you might not be allowed to try on.  </P> <P> Take a calculator, to figure out discount percentages.  </P> <P> Use credit cards; it's safer to leave cash and checks at home.  </P> <P> Plan to spend a minimum of $4 a day on parking. The farther from the center of  activity, the cheaper the fee.  </P> <P> The Cooper Building has clean restrooms on every floor.  </P> <P> Avoid the Saturday crowds; if you can't, arrive by 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A SELECTED GUIDE TO SHOPPING THE GARMENT DISTRICT  </P> <P> Here is a cross section of some of the better bets.

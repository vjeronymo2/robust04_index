			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AID FOR STUDENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles just may be the City of Angeles. The parents of the high school  students are apt to believe it when they learn what the operations people of  Northwest Airlines at Los Angeles International Airport did last month.  </P> <P> When Northwest's Flight 190 was being buttoned down for its 12:30 p.m.  departure, nearly half of a group of 40 Japanese high school students were  still mired in U.S. Customs following their long flight from Japan.  </P> <P> Northwest put compassion over schedule and waited more than an hour until the  final one of the group, none of whom could speak English, was on board. They  were, in fact, bound for the Puget Sound area for a three-week intensive  English language course preparatory to going on to Phoenix and a yearlong  exchange program.  </P> <P> But one of the flight attendants said, "We wanted to do everything possible to  keep the group together. Most of us (passengers and crew), are parents and  that's how we would want our youngsters treated -- especially in a foreign  country."  </P> <P> TONY and NANCY BACON  </P> <P> Vancouver, Wash.  </P></p>

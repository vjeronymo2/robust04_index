Since July 1992, a  total of 240 kg of cocaine has been impounded in six operations,  a spokesman of the authority announced today when presenting the  annual 1993 customs report for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.  Thus, the situation in Rostock is worse than in Hamburg,  Bremen, and even Antwerp. The drugs have a street value of  approximately 80 million German marks. In the most recent  operation this year, in November, police seized 12 kg of cocaine  aboard the freighter Bille Trop from Columbia.</p>

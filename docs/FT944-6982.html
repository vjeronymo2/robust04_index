			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Telekom The Deutsche Telekom privatisation will be big in many ways, not least in the size of the fees the investment banks involved in the deal expect to collect. But how is one to explain the astonishing DM450m (Pounds 180m) fee 'pot' being talked about? Is it the reward for thousands of hours hard work by an army of highly-paid bankers, analysts and salesmen? Or is it a reflection of imperfect competition in the supply of global equity distribution services? The answer is probably a mixture of both. Certainly, the work put in by scores of banks on large deals like Telekom is mammoth. Banks also need to invest big sums in building a distribution infrastructure that gives them global reach. On the other hand, the international primary distribution business is, by all accounts, extremely profitable. If competition were functioning effectively, one would expect price-cutting to reduce fees. There are two reasons why this does not happen. First, the industry is an oligopoly: only a handful of banks can arrange global distribution, with the rest providing local feeder networks. Second, though banks fight fiercely for new business, they compete on the quality of their distribution networks rather than their fees. Surely it is better, they tell clients, to receive the maximum sales price for their equity through excellent distribution than skimp on the commission but receive lower overall proceeds. Few clients are able to resist such sales patter. Still, the banks may not have it all their way this time round. The German finance ministry has already indicated that it intends to drive a hard bargain on fees. Such is the prestige of being involved in the Telekom deal that few banks would be willing to drop out, however low the commissions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential </F> candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, with  unidentified reporters at the PRD campaign headquarters in  Panama City -- live]    [Text] [Perez Balladares] Fellow citizens: According to the  Electoral Tribunal's [TE] figures at 2243 this evening, 52.32  percent of the polling tables have been tallied. This yields a  total of 613,017 votes. A trend has prevailed since the tally  began, and it has not changed. It signifies that we have won  the 1994 elections. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"]    The TE's figures coincide very well with our party's own  figures. A large number of votes have yet to be tallied in  Panama Province, where the advantage in our favor is greater, so  all the analysts -- both ours and independent ones -- accept  this trend is irreversible and, consequently, the winner is  yours truly. [applause] Thank you.    I do not want to extend the wait any longer. I want to thank  all the Panamanian people -- those who voted for me, of course,  and those who opposed us, too -- for their civic-mindedness and  for the behavior we observed throughout the campaign and today  on election day. We now begin, as we have said, to build,  united, without differences or political disputes, the nation's  future, for the youth and the children.    Thank you, Panamanian people, for extraordinary and  exemplary  civic behavior. [applause] I also want in particular to thank  the whole United People campaign team for work and deeds that  seemed like a dream five years ago. We are determined to  recover our national dignity, and we are doing it -- with your  support, in the first place, and the support of all the  Panamanian people.    We now begin a different phase. The elections are over  today; electoral politics are over today. We now begin a phase  that demands the best from all Panamanians to achieve what is  still our goal: a free, independent, and sovereign country with  equal opportunities for each and every one of us. Thank you,  everyone, and we will continue to work, united, for the 21st  century. Thank you. [crowd applauds, chants: "Toro!"]    [Reporter] Any names for cabinet members?    [Perez Balladares] No, not yet,    [Reporter] How do you feel to be the first president elected  in this country in free and honest elections in more than three  decades?    [Perez Balladares] Personally, I am extremely proud. I  accept this victory with a great degree of humility because we  have received a clear message from the Panamanian people, who  want to leave the dark days behind, want to look forward with  optimism, and want all Panamanians to join together to enter  into what should be Panama's golden decade beginning with our  government. [applause]    [Reporter] Are you ready to [words indistinct]?    [Perez Balladares] I do not have the slightest doubt: I am  accompanied by very capable men and women. But we want to add  more. We want this to be a truly representative government, a  government based on an agreement among all Panamanians.  Together we will be able to achieve this.    [Reporter] Are you going to work with [words indistinct]  parties?    [Perez Balladares] We are now going to begin to form a  government that we can feel proud of, one that will allow all  Panamanians to feel that they are being worthily represented.    [Reporter] Does this mean that you would form your  government  with parties that have opposed you?    [Perez Balladares] Throughout my campaign I said that I was  willing and hoping to form a government with the best men and  women available, regardless of political persuasion, and I am  now reiterating this following my victory.    [Reporter] What about the names in today's extra edition of  LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA -- can you confirm if any of them are  going to be members of your cabinet?    [Perez Balladares] Not yet, not yet.    [Reporter] How can you guarantee that you will be able to  rule if you will possibly be facing a Legislative Assembly and  most of the media in the hands of the opposition?    [Perez Balladares] I believe that the opposition they put up  was during the electoral campaign. Now national goals should  unite us. We now have other things, far more superior things,  to bring us together.    [Reporter] Is it true that you already have received  telephone calls from the Christian Democratic Party candidate  and the Solidarity Party candidate?    [Perez Balladares] I hope that our opponents -- these two as  well as the others -- will make their own statement. I would  rather not say anything. I do want to take advantage of your  question, however, to give thanks to those six candidates who  accompanied us in this campaign because I believe that between  all of us we have managed to, first, set the national goals, and  then to carry out a campaign as we did -- with a few slip-ups,  perhaps, but for the most part a high-level campaign. Thanks,  then, to the presidential candidates.    [Reporter] Does your victory also include a majority in the  Legislative Assembly?    [Perez Balladares] It is too early to comment on this. We  are waiting for the results from the TE.    [Reporter] Do you have any idea, though, since you were  asking your supporters to vote for the entire slate?    [Perez Balladares] I understand that our party received the  most votes in the elections, but it is very difficult -- due to  the system itself -- to know how many legislators won.    [Reporter] President Endara invited you to work with him. He  is going to give you a status report on the presidency. Are you  going to accept this invitation?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, of course.    [Reporter] When do you plan to meet with him?    [Perez Balladares] When he invites me to do so.    [Reporter] You speak of a policy of a free and sovereign  country. When one comes to Panama one finds a dollar economy.  What are you going to change?    [Perez Balladares] Sovereignty and the circulation of the  U.S. dollar are not incompatible. Nowadays the majority of  Latin American economies are dollarized economies. The only  difference is that the dollar circulates in Panama as an  international currency; it could be the dollar or any other  international currency. Our complete and total sovereignty will  be assured with the faithful fulfillment of the Torrijos-Carter  treaties over the next five years.    [Reporter] Is this your commitment with the Panamanian  people?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir.    [Reporter] What are your plans for foreign policy and for  relations with the United States?    [Perez Balladares] I think that in the two cases there will  be high-level policies, policies of respect in which each  country will have to fight for its national interests and  objectives. Sometimes they will be compatible, and sometimes  they will differ, but there should be a lot of respect and lofty  attitudes, as is called for in relations between grown-up  countries and between peoples that share common interests.    [Reporter] What type of relationship will you maintain with  the international financial institutions [IFI's]?    [Perez Balladares] The same relationship we have always had.  I believe that these are necessary relations, and the IFI's  help many countries to attain development goals that are  necessary. It is a matter of being able to explain our national  interests well and to obtain, via negotiations, agreements that  are in keeping with our national interests.    [Reporter] Your opponents still hope that the results of the  elections might change.    [Perez Balladares] I believe everyone will have hopes until  all the votes are counted. That is why I said that these  figures are not mine; they are TE figures. I also said that the  analysts, not only our analysts but the independent analysts as  well, say that due to the way the vote count is headed, because  of the trend that it has shown from the very beginning, it is  practically impossible for the final result to change.    [Reporter] How do you think the United States is going to  react now that many people who were ousted from power thanks to  the invasion are going to return to power thanks to the votes?    [Perez Balladares] Neither the United States nor I have said  this. You are saying it. The party has returned to power. I  was not in power during the invasion. Our party is a renovated  party, as we have said on many occasions. In addition, we are a  party that on several occasions, in practice, has given clear  proof of internal democracy; a party that in any event  represents the victory of democracy in Panama. I do not see how  the United States can do anything other than applaud this  democratic victory in Panama.    [Reporter] Do you believe militarism is completely ruled out  in Panama?    [Perez Balladares] Yes, sir. There is no military here, nor  any possibility of returning to any phase of the previous  militarism.    [Reporter] What would you tell General Torrijos at this  time?    [Perez Balladares] We have picked up your flag, kissed it,  and continued onward. [cheers and applause]</p>

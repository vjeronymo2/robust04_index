			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (5): A slow flight back into profit - The pain for airlines is by no means over The world airline industry expects to fly back into profit this year after suffering four years of record losses totalling Dollars 15.6bn on international scheduled services alone. But the pain is by no means over as the industry continues to adapt itself to profound structural changes caused by increasing liberalisation and deregulation and the after shocks of the worst slump in the post-war history of civil aviation. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is now forecasting an industry profit of around Dollars 1bn this year. 'We are hopeful we have turned the corner,' says Tom Murphy, senior director of the trade organisation grouping 224 airlines. Even if Dollars 1bn is better than nothing, it is still only a tiny fraction of the industry's total annual revenues of around Dollars 110bn. What is more, the financial performance of airlines continues to show dramatic variations. A few, like British Airways and Singapore Airlines, are doing well; the majority are hovering around break-even point; and about a quarter are losing a spectacular amount of money. Pierre Jeanniot, IATA's director-general, blames three factors for the continuing financial problems of the airline business: The world economies were denied a 'soft landing' from the boom of the 1980s and airlines, which had continued to order aircraft in large numbers right up to 1990, were caught with too much capacity when the recession hit and was further exacerbated by the impact of the Gulf war on air travel. The huge level of aircraft orders was financed essentially by borrowing with the result that airlines now have to make an operating profit of at least 3.7 per cent of revenues just to service their debt. The increase in competition in the 1980s combined with increased liberalisation in air transport policy and continuing over-capacity have had a devastating impact on real passenger yields. IATA calculates that air fares have dropped by 68 per cent in constant money in the past 20 years and this trend has been accelerating. Although passenger traffic is expected to grow by an average annual rate of between 5-6 per cent during the next four years - with much higher growth in the Asia-Pacific region of around 8 per cent a year - this is unlikely to lead to any significant improvement in airline yields as has been the case in past cycles. 'In many markets, air travellers have now become accustomed to paying a particular fare level; and if fares are increased, they simply don't fly. So the airlines now have no choice but to find a way to provide a service at this fare level, rather than as in the past seeking to maximise the fare charged for providing the service,' explains Adam Brown, head of strategic planning at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium. Airlines are also facing tougher competition in many markets not only because of the impact of increasing liberalisation, but also from new rival forms of transport. In Europe, the development of a high-speed rail network and the opening of the Channel Tunnel will inevitably intensify competition on shorter routes where rail can provide a fast and more direct service between city centres. Low fares and new competitive forces will force airlines to continue pursuing cost-cutting and other productivity efforts to restore their profit margins. Considerable progress has been achieved by a number of airlines but many still have a long way to go to adapt their structures and operations to the new competitive, liberalised industry environment. This is particularly the case for state-owned European carriers which are now facing far tougher rules from the European Commission on government financial support. The Commission wants to see the phasing out of all state aid to airlines over the next three years. It has also warned airlines they will be allowed one last package of substantial aid as long as it is linked with a large-scale restructuring and cost reduction programme to restore their competitive position. While financially troubled European state carriers like Air France, Olympic of Greece or Alitalia, are wrestling to restructure themselves (Air France alone is getting FFr20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) in government backing to help it recover), large US airlines have also been forced to adapt to new competition from low-cost carriers in their domestic market. The response of the leading US airlines has been to seek labour concessions and launch separate new low-cost subsidiaries to compete against the new breed of domestic US carriers of which Southwest is undoubtedly the most remarkable phenomenon. The move towards more 'open skies' has also intensified the trend towards greater collaboration in an increasingly global industry. British Airways is one of the airlines to have taken the lead in developing a global network through alliances and equity partnerships including taking stakes in USAir, Qantas, the French regional carrier TAT and its new Deutsche BA airline subsidiary in Germany. After the failed attempt last year by four medium-sized European airlines including Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), these European carriers have continued to seek commercial partnerships to strengthen their competitive position against the big carriers. Many airlines have still been reluctant to take the BA route of investing in equity stakes in other carriers. Instead, they have sought to expand their international reach through marketing and commercial partnerships. This has increasingly involved the use of ticket code sharing which enables two carriers to use their respective ticketing codes to simplify computer reservations and cut costs. With the industry's centre of gravity moving east, international airlines have also been multiplying efforts to form alliances with carriers in fast growing markets such as China or India anxious to secure western expertise to develop internationally. Singapore Airlines, for example, is planning to form a new joint airline venture in India with the country's biggest industrial group, TATA industries. In China, Singapore Airlines and BA are actively discussing possible links with Chinese carriers in a civil aviation market developing at break-neck speed with annual growth averaging 20-30 per cent in the past few years. But the industry's problems are not only financial, although as Mr Jeanniot of IATA emphasises, 'the overwhelmingly urgent issue' remains airline profitability. Some progress has been made during the past two years on improving air traffic and airport congestion, and increasing political awareness on the long-term risks of inadequate infrastructure to support the continued growth of international air travel. Without a stepped up commitment from governments to invest in new ground and air traffic control facilities and technologies, the danger is that not only will future air travel growth be clipped but competition will continue to be distorted by preventing new industry entrants from gaining the necessary access to busy airports and airplanes.  ------------------------------------------------ TOP 10 AIRLINES  ------------------------------------------------ (scheduled passenger-kilometres performed - 1993)  ------------------------------------------------ Airline                                  Millions  ------------------------------------------------ United Airlines (2)                       162,527 American Airlines (1)                     156,302 Delta Air Lines (3)                       133,346 Northwest Airlines (5)                     93,549 British Airways (6)                        80,086 Continental Airlines (7)                   68,114 USAir (8)                                  56,681 Japan Airlines (9)                         54,615 Lufthansa (10)                             52,658 Qantas (16)                                44,510  ------------------------------------------------ Last year's rankings in parenthesis  ------------------------------------------------ Source: IATA  ------------------------------------------------</p>

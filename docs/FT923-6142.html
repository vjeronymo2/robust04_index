			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / GrandMet weakened by tough US trade GRAND METROPOLITAN, the food, drinks and retailing group, warned yesterday that profits growth this year would be flattened by tough trading conditions in the US food market and the weak dollar. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, said pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be broadly in line with last year's Pounds 950m - between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m below market forecasts. GrandMet's shares fell 33p to close at 379p. Trading profits from the group's US food operations, which showed little growth in the first half of the year, have been further affected by weak overall consumer demand and price pressures. Green Giant vegetables, which account for a third of the sector's profits, were hit by a bumper harvest that cut prices to 1984 levels and squeezed margins. 'Market share trends, however, remain generally positive,' Sir Allen said. Pillsbury brands increased volume sales by 7 per cent compared with a 1 per cent increase in the market generally. The Pearle eyecare chain in the US and Chef and Brewer pubs in the UK continued to reflect difficult retail market conditions but IDV, the group's drinks business, and Burger King 'sustained good progress'. With more than half group profits coming from the US, the weakness of the dollar has compounded the effects of the testing trading conditions. The exchange rate in the first half added Pounds 21m to trading profits; but this benefit has been wiped out by the dollar's decline since. GrandMet's accounts, however, will include extraordinary profits this year from the disposal of Express Dairy and other businesses as well as its investment in Remy Cointreau. A final dividend of 7.7p will bring a total payment of 12.3p, an increase of 8.4 per cent. Sir Allen said gearing would be lower than last year's 75 per cent. Interest cover should improve to about 10 times compared with 6.6 times last year. GrandMet filed yesterday for a Dollars 600m issue of fixed-rate debt securities in the US. The new debt, in tranches of seven, 12 and 30 years, takes advantage of lower market rates and will replace existing borrowings and lengthen the group's debt maturity. About 90 per cent of GrandMet's Pounds 2.4bn debts are dollar-denominated. Lex, Page 14</p>

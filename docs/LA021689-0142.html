			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DUSTING OFF CROWN FOR ANOTHER ERA OF TV ROYALTY  </P> <P> Are there any women in America today who would jump at the chance to be Queen  for a Day?  </P> <P> Dan Enright of Barry &amp; Enright Productions pondered that question as he  pieced together a pilot for a new "Queen for a Day Show" in his Century City  office.  </P> <P> "We wanted to be careful that women would not feel demeaned or exploited,"  Enright said of the show, which has yet to be picked up for syndication. "We  felt, in these times, that the criteria should be: What has this particular  woman done to benefit others?"  </P> <P> In the pilot show, an announcer still asks the magic question and the audience  still explodes with applause. But the throne, red velvet cape, four-dozen roses  and host Jack Bailey are gone.  </P> <P> "Welcome -- to the new 'Queen for a Day Show!' " the announcer booms. "The show  that makes dreams come true. And, now, here's our host -- Monty Haaaall!"  </P> <P> In somber tones, Hall explains that the first candidate's world "came crashing  down on her, suddenly and brutally" in 1985 when an airplane in which she was  riding crashed into a mountain. Hall sat with the candidate, a burn victim who  aids other burn victims, on a couch in a comfortable living-room setting. The  woman's wish was for money to see her through more plastic surgery.  </P> <P> The second candidate had adopted 30 children and requested several water beds  and a bus because she wanted to adopt more children.  </P> <P> The third woman founded Mothers Against Gangs in Chicago after her 17-year-old  daughter was fatally shot by gang members four years ago. The woman asked for  sports equipment and educational materials to help keep youngsters off the  streets.  </P> <P> Fifty pre-selected audience members considered the candidates and voted, using  IBM selector modules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gift Certificates  </P> <P> "And with 27 votes, it's candidate No. 1!" the announcer says. The new queen's  wish for more plastic surgery is granted and she also receives gift  certificates to Macys department store.  </P> <P> The potential audience for the show, said Enright, who has also produced "The  Joker's Wild," "Tic Tac Dough" and "Concentration," are those who watch such  programs as "Divorce Court," "People's Court" and "Crimes of Passion."  </P> <P> Several former winners from the original show were present in the audience as  the pilot was filmed. Although they feel much of the glamour has been  eliminated in the new version, they said they're anxious for the show to air in  the future.  </P> <P> "We're afraid, since we're all older queens now, that there won't be any of us  left," said Rose Krause, a widow who was granted a piano for her two daughters  in 1958. "So we want the new show to come on. We need some younger members so  the club won't die." R. DANIEL FOSTER  </P></p>

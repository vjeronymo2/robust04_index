			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (5): Changing habits of a lifetime - Value-added services / Packet-switched and other data services Telecommunications and computer companies are running around like headless chickens in an attempt to find the right mixture of products and services to meet the surge in demand for linking together networks of personal computers. It would have been inconceivable 10 years ago to have a telephone company moving at the pace of a one-legged chicken, let alone a headless one, to meet its customers' needs. But data communications, along with mobile communications, are the two services which the European Commission has mandated member states to open to competition. Telephone companies are having to change their habits of a lifetime because unless they innovate, smaller, more dynamic companies will become the main drivers of the market. A new range of products and services is emerging to meet the growth in networking and internetworking. Large companies are demanding solutions to improve their ability to interconnect ever-growing numbers of local area networks (Lans) pieced together on different geographical sites. Lans are proliferating as companies switch critical applications from the mainframe computer to personal computers. Lans traffic is increasing at a rate of 30 per cent a year. There is no single solution for interconnecting Lans. In the past, a corporate telecommunications manager has tended to use private circuits. But running them internally can prove very difficult. Most local area networks have been pieced together over several years and vary widely in size, capacity and in technical characteristics. Many companies would prefer to hand their business over to a public network. Traditional X25 packet-switched data networks are one possibility, but high prices across Europe, coupled with uncertainty about whether X25 can meet current and future requirements for high bandwidth services, are causing many to delay their decision. Telephone and computer companies are now developing products known as fast-packet switching services. In some cases, they are offering improved, higher speed versions of X25. But the real revolution in the data communications industry is the development of the much-trumpeted frame relay, a slimmed-down version of X25. There are already several hundred users of frame relay in the US where it was developed. Judging by the interest in frame relay from telephone companies in Europe, there is an expectation that it will have a similar impression this side of the Atlantic. France Telecom and Swedish Telecom are already providing frame relay interfaces to their X25 networks. Deutsche Telecom, Telecom Lenmark and Spain's Telefonica all plan to launch services this year, while in Finland and the UK public frame relay services are already available. But despite the public enthusiasm of European telephone operators, they are privately cautious about promoting services to compete with their existing X25 and private circuits services. Yankee Group Europe, a leading telecommunications consultancy, says that the mood of European vendors and operators looking at frame relay is to 'wait and see.' Nevertheless, Yankee Group expects frame relay to see 'significant growth in Europe's nascent cross-border data transport market over the next three years.' Frame relay is simpler than X25 and its lower cost is one of the main reasons why the Yankee Group expects it to break through in Europe. In the longer term, its faster speed will be an advantage. Laboratory tests show that frame relay can run at up to 45 megabits per second; much higher than the 2 megabits commonly thought to be the practical ceiling for standard X25. In practice, no operators offer frame relay at more than 2 megabits but this is still much quicker than most existing X25 networks in Europe. Ranco Europe, a supplier of components to the vehicle and domestic appliance sectors, chose frame relay for its pan-European network because of its speed. Its existing IBM-managed network service operates at a maximum of 19.2 kilobits per second which is not fast enough for Ranco's plans to develop just-in-time manufacturing. Ranco's customers want deliveries to arrive at the precise times the products will be used and thereby avoid costly storage. By consolidating information on orders, sales, shipments and stocks on one frame relay network, Ranco can better meet tight delivery schedules. Lucrative Pan-European contracts such as Ranco Europe's are a big draw for leading value-added network operators such as Infonet, Sprint and American Telephone and Telegraph. This market is set to increase sharply with the ending of restrictions on competition in Europe at the start of this year. But there will be less competition for smaller domestic contracts where companies need to invest in networks linking together the largest towns and cities. Yankee Group believes that BT and Transpac - a wholly-owned France Telecom subsidiary - are the two companies best positioned to capitalise on pent-up demand in Europe's domestic markets for high speed data services. BT inherited its European presence from Tymnet, the US data communications company it bought in 1989. It has built on this and now has a formidable frame relay presence in all big western European cities. Transpac is concentrating on X25. It has bought private X25 networks in six European countries and converted them into an extensive European infrastructure. Transpac has fought a rearguard action against frame relay, which, it says is unsafe because there is no guarantee that the data will arrive in one piece. But Transpac is looking closely at another fast packet technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which has the potential to handle large volumes of data more smoothly than its cumbersome name suggests. A number of little-known US and UK vendors such as Cisco, Synoptics, Fibrenet, Wellfleet, Network Equipment Technologies and Netcomm are rushing to supply ATM products for the private Lan interconnection market. The jury is still out on whether X25, frame relay or ATM emerge as the leading technologies for data networking. But the telecommunications industry is in no doubt that the sector as a whole will explode over the next few years. US telecommunications consultancy Frost and Sullivan, for example, forecasts that the market for fast packet switching will rise from Dollars 74m in 1992 to Dollars 2bn by 1997.

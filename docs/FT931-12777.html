			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: USX-US Steel blames imports for Dollars 225m loss USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel company, yesterday reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 225m in the fourth quarter of 1992, up sharply from the Dollars 165m deficit recorded in the same period of 1991. It blamed a surge of steel imports during the final three months, although legal, environmental, and other restructuring charges totalled Dollars 231m. The fourth-quarter results bring the after-tax loss for the year, before the effect of the accounting changes, to Dollars 271m. However, this still contrasts favourably with a Dollars 507m deficit in 1991. Sales for the fourth quarter were down from Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 1.24bn, but for the year overall, they rose from Dollars 4.86bn to Dollars 4.95bn. After the accounting changes, USX-US Steel posted an after-tax deficit of Dollars 1.61bn, compared with a Dollars 507m loss in 1991. Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent company, said shipment volumes had improved in the final three months, but that 'domestic market conditions were adversely affected by a surge of imports in the fourth quarter.' USX Corp reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 343m after-tax, compared with a Dollars 394m deficit a year earlier, and reduced net deficit for the year of Dollars 160m (Dollars 578m) before accounting changes. After this, the net deficit widened to Dollars 1.83bn.</p>

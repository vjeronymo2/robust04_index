			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel has agreed to permit the return of 47  deportees. They will arrive in the territories in two groups.  The first group is slated to arrive in Jericho today.  Officials in Tunis said that in the next few days, Israel will  present a list of another 20 deportees who will be permitted to  return. At the same time, Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head  of the PLO's Economic Department, said that the Paris  negotiations on economic issues will be concluded before 13  April. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports:    [Begin recording] [Amir] The first deportees will return to  Jericho today via Amman and the Allenby Bridge. A Palestinian  source in Tunis yesterday said that Israel had agreed to permit  the return of 20 deportees and would present a list of their  names to the PLO in the next few days. The source stressed that  in his opinion, the new list would also include Akram Haniyah,  who was deported from al-Birah in 1988 and has since served as  one of Yasir 'Arafat's senior advisers. Speaking over the  telephone from Tunis, Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-al-'Ala', the head  of the PLO's economic department, said that in addition to the  aforementioned 20 deportees, Israel has also authorized the  return of 47 deportees.    [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I think about 47. I am not  speaking about names; I am speaking about figures. I believe  that all of them, if not in this group then in the other groups,  they will come.    [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] As  for the economic talks in Paris, Abu-al-'Ala' expressed the  assessment that the negotiations with Israel will be concluded  before 13 April.    [Abu-al-'Ala', in English] I hope, and we will do our best.  I believe that we and Mr. Shohat and the delegation, both of  us, are concerned to finish this mission immediately so as to  come into the implementation of the first stage of the agreement  on Gaza and Jericho.    [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues]  Jericho today awaits the arrival of the deportees returning  across the Allenby Bridge. PLO representatives in the  territories are preparing a warm reception; however, the Civil  Administration has been instructed by the defense establishment  to permit the deportees to enter Jericho only this afternoon in  order to keep celebrations to a minimum. The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] will probably close off the Jericho area to the  media to prevent any coverage of the deportees' return. The  deportees intend to hold a news conference in Jericho. Fatah  leaders in the territories, who, on 'Arafat's instructions, have  closed most of the PLO offices, are now waiting to turn over  supervision of the organization's activists in the field to the  first representatives of the PLO leadership in Tunis. The  returning deportees will primarily handle the preparations for  the arrival of the PLO leaders from Tunis, who are already  packed and ready to move to the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  Abu-al-'Ala' estimates that the PLO leadership, led by Yasir  'Arafat, will arrive in the territories immediately after the  IDF withdrawal and the deployment of the Palestinian police.  [end recording]    [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 5 April in a report  by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on pages 1 and 19  reports that "in his talks with Israeli officials in Tunis, PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat expressed his desire to pray at the  Temple Mount in Jerusalem shortly after he arrives in Jericho in  May. It has been learned that Israeli decisionmakers are  inclined to accept 'Arafat's request."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 5 April  reports that "reacting to Yasir 'Arafat's desire to be allowed  to pray at the Temple Mount mosques, Police Minister Moshe  Shahal said that in his opinion, the time is not ripe for this.  The police minister believes that at this stage, it would be  best to put this off to a later time."]</p>

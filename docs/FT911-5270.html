			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Recovery predicted in financial services THE RECESSION in the financial services sector appears to be coming to an end, according to the latest quarterly survey of the sector by the Confederation of British Industry and leading accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. However, the survey also forecasts that firms are likely to continue making substantial cuts in employment even after those made over the past three months. The report highlights the fall in business volumes in the sector since last summer and says it accelerated during the three months to March. Activity by private individuals is sharply down, and financial institutions and industrial and commercial customers have also cut activity. However it is expected that, overall, business volumes will stop falling over the next three months, with building societies in particular expecting a strong revival in business from private individuals, to offset an expected continued decline in activity within banks, finance houses and general insurance companies. Profitability in the sector declined sharply over the past three months, resulting in widespread job cuts, particularly by banks. The decline in profitability is expected to slow considerably over the next three months as business picks up and costs come under tighter control. Nevertheless, the survey shows that staffing cuts are expected to continue at a slightly higher rate over the next three months as firms strive to reduce the proportion of total costs accounted for by staff.

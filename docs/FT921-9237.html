			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Allied Leisure edges ahead after interest cut Allied Leisure, the tenpin bowling and nightclub group, yesterday reported a slight increase in interim profits, but only after a drop in interest charges after last year's Pounds 16m rights issue. Pre-tax profits in the 25 weeks to January 5, rose from Pounds 1.63m to Pounds 1.65m on sales up 18 per cent at Pounds 10.6m. Interest fell from Pounds 1.04m to Pounds 788,000. The group has also written off its investment in loss-making theme bars, taking a Pounds 3.23m extraordinary charge that includes anticipated losses until they are sold. Mr Richard Carr, chairman, said the recession had created the most challenging trading conditions the company had ever experienced, but that it had 'managed much better than the majority' of its competitors. Bowling produced more than 90 per cent of operating profits, after profits from the dancing division fell by two thirds to Pounds 295,000. Earnings per share fell from 6.92p to 3.69p but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Moves on private pension funds buoy shares ITALY'S government has opened the way to private pension funds, bringing the country into line with most of its European neighbours. The step, still to be discussed by parliament but to be passed as a decree law, will take pressure off the over-burdened state pension system and should stimulate the flow of new funds to the stock market ahead of the government's privatisation programme. Italian shares rose strongly for the second day running yesterday as a result of the decision, which should eventually boost equity purchases by big institutional investors. Shares in insurance companies, seen as the main beneficiaries of the planned new legislation, rose most strongly. Trading was particularly active, according to brokers. The voluntary system, which will not replace the existing state pension scheme, will be open to individuals, professional associations, trade unions and companies. The attraction of private pensions will be boosted by tax incentives, akin to those currently available on life insurance policies, where regular premiums can be partly offset against income tax. The finances of Italy's state pension scheme have been increasingly strained in recent years. The system, now being revised, is generous by the standards of most neighbouring countries. Moreover, longer life-expectancy and the steady shift towards an ageing population mean current payments into the system have increasingly had to be used to pay pensions for past contributors, rather than cover future pensions for those currently in work. The prospect of new pension funds, which could invest part of their resources in shares, contributed to near-record volumes of more than L500bn (Pounds 222m) on the Milan stock exchange on Monday.</p>

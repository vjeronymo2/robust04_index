			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [9 March], FRG Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel opened a meeting with the foreign  ministers of the three Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania in Bonn with the urgent recommendation that they  integrate their Russian minorities. This recommendation was  primarily addressed to Estonia and Latvia, since this problem  with minorities does not exist in Lithuania. Solving the  problem is of "outstanding importance for the future of the  relations with Russia as a whole," Kinkel said.    Kinkel assured all three republics of German support for the  gradual approach to the European Union and the Western European  Union with the final goal of full membership. Closer  cooperation is also to be striven for with NATO. Promoting a  better relationship between the Baltic States and Russia was the  central topic of the meeting, with which the foreign ministers  of the Baltic Sea republics met with Kinkel in Germany for the  first time.    Kinkel stressed the "particularly close relationship" both  with the Baltic States and with Russia. At the beginning of the  meeting, he stressed that the date of 31 August 1994 for the  withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia must be  observed and that there are no reasons for delay. Estonia was  represented by Juri Luik, Latvia by Georgs Andrejevs, and  Lithuania by Povilas Gylys.</p>

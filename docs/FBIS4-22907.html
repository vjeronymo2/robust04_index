Pavlenko, V.V. Izzheurova, I.I. Prudkaya, </F> Bioorganic Chemistry and Petrochemistry Institute at the  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 576.095.3:628.35]    [Abstract] The urgency of intensifying biological waste  water treatment methods, particularly by adding spent and  partially mineralized sludge, in order to lower capital and  operating outlays and the experience of biological sewage  treatment at the Lisichansk Oil Refinery (LNPZ) where partially  mineralized sludge is used as a biogenic additive are discussed,  and it is noted that this method may be economically efficient  for many other plants. The possibility of substituting ammophos  used as a biogenic additive at many plants for stimulating the  development of activated sludge microorganisms in aeration tanks  by partially mineralized sludge from the sludge ground at the  Lisichansk Oil Refinery is investigated; in so doing, the  biological additives are balanced for various nitrogen and  phosphorus concentrations whereby ammonium chloride is used as  the principal nitrogen source. Activated sludge was incubated  for 17 days in rocking test tubes. The study demonstrates the  possibility of using spent sludge as a bioadditive for enhancing  biocenosis of activated sludge; addition of partially  mineralized sludge balanced for the above biological elements  improves the biological treatment indicators relative to  petroleum product removal and raises the number of  microorganisms which destroy hydrocarbons. Even partial  substitution of agents with spent sludge makes it possible to  save mineral raw materials and move a step closer toward  developing waste-free practices of enhancing biological waste  water treatment while ammophos may be substituted with ammonium  chloride, thus lowering waste water contamination with  phosphorus.

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / People: ICI shuffles pack in Australia which is 63 per cent owned by ICI - has seen the replacement of Bruce Vaughan, 66, as chairman by Colin Short, below, 59, ICI's finance director until December 1993. The move reflects ICI's desire to take much closer control over its operations in the important high-growth Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, it is an acknowledgement that there will be a change in the strategy pursued by ICI Australia, which has not concentrated on its core businesses to the extent that ICI overall has. Vaughan, who has been chairman for the relatively short period of 13 months, is a rounded businessman, only one of whose interests is ICI Australia, said ICI. 'He has gone because ICI Australia is being aligned with ICI. Short's appointment as chairman reflects the enhanced significance of ICI Australia following the demerger of (drugs company) Zeneca in 1993,' added the company yesterday. Short, 60, joined ICI's board in 1990. He became deputy chairman of ICI Australia in January this year. He is now to be replaced in that role by Ben Lochtenberg, 63, an Australian who retired as chairman of ICI America last summer. At the same time, Chris Hampson, 62, has resigned as a director of ICI Australia following his retirement as an executive director of ICI.</p>

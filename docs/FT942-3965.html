			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / 'Slim' chance of 1997 currency merger The chances of a majority of European Union countries being able to merge their currencies in 1997 are at best slim, Mr Henning Christophersen, European economics commissioner, said yesterday, report Lionel Barber in Brussels and Reuter in Basle. Mr Christophersen said that the early target date for monetary union by 1997 would be 'very difficult'. There was a general consensus that 'it would be better to wait until 1999'. Mr Christophersen was speaking on the eve of the annual meeting in Basle of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' central bank. His cautious pessimism contrasted with his usual upbeat assessments of the prospects for an early move to Emu. The Danish commissioner may also have had an eye on his audience. A new central bankers' report expresses concern about the size of budget deficits in member states. Last week, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, appeared to cast doubt on the Maastricht treaty timetable for Emu by saying that a single European currency might take until 2001 to realise. Mr Rexrodt stressed that meeting the Maastricht criteria on inflation, currency stability and government debts and deficits was far more important than meeting the Maastricht dates. Asked whether he agreed with the German assessment, Mr Christophersen conceded: 'Unless we get 3 per cent (economic) growth in 1996 and more in 1997, it (Emu) will be impossible.' Despite his cautious line, Mr Christophersen said that he did not want to rule out 1997 altogether because that could prompt countries to scale down their efforts to meet the Maastricht treaty targets. 'I don't want to discourage everyone from trying to get there,' he said.</p>

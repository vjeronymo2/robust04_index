			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Scharping attacks Kohl at election rally Rudolph Scharping, who is challenging Helmut Kohl to take over as German chancellor, addresses supporters in Bonn yesterday after opening the final phase of his election campaign. Mr Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, accused Mr Kohl of being responsible for the mood of uncertainty and lack of direction in the country, and he charged Wolfgang Schauble, Mr Kohl's closest ally, of organising a 'nationalistic front'. The Social Democrats also unveiled the slogan they hope will help them win power in the general election on October 16: 'Look forward to the change, Germany]' Party leaders flatly rejected hints by Mr Kohl that a 'grand coalition' between his Christian Democrats and the SPD might be possible. However, even if the electoral outcome forces such a solution, yesterday's statements suggest that the SPD will not accept the chancellor as its leader. Report, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro, second secretary of the  Central Committee and minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces  [FAR], has sent a congratulatory message to 60 canecutting  brigades that have already cut the millionth arroba of sugarcane  in honor of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of the  Millionaire movement, which is being celebrated today, 3 March.    The brigades are made up of volunteers from the Cuban  Workers  Federation [CTC], regular workers, members of the National  Association of Small Farmers [ANAP], and Youth Labor Army [EJT]  troops from 11 Cuban provinces -- Santiago de Cuba, with 20 work  groups, being the most oustanding.    The message from Raul states: Upon learning that you have  reached the first million arrobas of sugarcane, I felt inspired  to express my sincere congratulations. I know this is an  achievement you repeat in every sugar harvest, but this year and  the next have a special and historic value.    Raul's message goes on to say that 30 years ago, in 1964,  two  cane-cutting brigades set themselves the goal of cutting no  fewer than 1 million arrobas of sugarcane during the next  harvest. That was on 15 June 1964 at the Emilio Lesmes farm in  Contramaestre.    Raul goes on to say: I had the privilege of participating in  that memorable assembly. I understood the unprecedented and  elevated goal that those work groups of fervent revolutionaries  had set, and I encouraged them to make the effort to reach it.    Raul continues: This idea expressing the new attitude  vis-a-vis the work done by the canecutters, now owners of the  cane and the sugar, organized in brigades and freed from the  hard labor of cutting by hand thanks to new machinery, caught on  in the rest of the country. Thus, in March 1965 the Julio  Antonio Mella Brigade from Havana Province completed the first  million arrobas, followed by two brigades from Matanzas.    Raul says, further: On 3 March, our commander in chief  presented those brigades with the first Millionaire banners  bearing the image of Jesus Menendez. That year, attaining their  goal, more than 100 eastern brigades reached the  one-million-arroba mark.    In other words, in 1994 we celebrate the 30th anniversary of  the the launching of the one-million-arroba movement, and in  1995 we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of  this movement. You are the worthy heirs of those forerunners.    In the last paragraph of his message to the canecutters,  Castro says: I hope we will remember both events in a  revolutionary way: making the current harvest more efficient,  working hard today and tomorrow toward the recovery of the cane  crops, the planting campaign, and the weeding campaign -- all  this aimed at obtaining a superior harvest in 1995.    Raul concludes his letter by sending a brotherly embrace to  all canecutters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government is concerned  about the proliferation of carrier missiles and mass destruction  weapons. An increasing number of Third World countries are  trying to acquire such weapons, a report of the Federal  Intelligence Office says, which was presented by State Minister  in the Chancellor's Office Bernd Schmidbauer to the Cabinet on  Wednesday [8 June].    According to Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, it is  pointed  out that North Korea is willing to sell its carrier systems to  anyone who pays the necessary sum of money. It is to be assumed  that more and more "threshold countries" are offering such  systems and that missiles with a range of 1,000 km will already  be available by the beginning of the next decade. The report  comes to the conclusion that only a strict export regime and  close international cooperation can prevent further  proliferation.</p>

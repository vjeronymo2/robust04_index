			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: BAe chairmen paid more despite plunge into loss BRITISH AEROSPACE paid its chairmen 48 per cent more in 1992 in spite plunging to a Pounds 1.2bn loss, the biggest in UK corporate history. At the same time, the new finance director, Mr Richard Lapthorne received Pounds 406,191 for six months' service. The figure, revealed in the annual report and accounts, includes an unpublished amount to compensate him for the loss of his pension rights at his previous job. This means that Mr Lapthorne earned more than BAe's chief executive, Mr Dick Evans. The last two years have seen three BAe chairmen. Mr John Cahill took over from Sir Graham Day last May and earned more than 80 per cent of the year's Pounds 439,318 payout; Sir Roland Smith and Sir Graham shared Pounds 297,703 in 1991. Four directors left the company last year as the losses mounted. Two of them, unnamed, shared Pounds 552,643 as part of their leaving packages. The four who left were: Mr Dudley Eustace (finance), Mr Brian Cookson (legal), Mr Frank Saundry (personnel) and Mr Raymond Mould, chairman of the troubled property arm Arlington Securities. The payments are unlikely to win new admirers for the company. BAe is still struggling to recover from the losses and the European Commission's order last month that it should repay Pounds 44.4m received in 1988 from the government to 'sweeten' its purchase of Rover.</p>

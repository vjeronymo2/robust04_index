			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / French change tack in fight for franc: Bank has wheeled out a new weapon against speculators FOR THE past two months the Bank of France has spent heavily to protect the French franc against attacks by market speculators. Yesterday it changed tactics. The bank suspended its 10 per cent 5-10 day rate - the one used by investors hedging against potential losses on their short-term sales of the French currency. The bank replaced it with a one-day lending facility at 12 per cent. These measures should - or so the bank hopes - make it more difficult and expensive to speculate against the franc. However, the bank's new strategy has wider implications. It could force the commercial banks to raise their base rates to offset the indirect increase in their borrowing costs, thereby intensifying the pressure on the rest of the French economy. 'These changes will undoubtedly make the Paris market less liquid and should have some effect in easing the pressure on the franc,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez. 'But this is really just another stage in the battle to support the franc.' Whether these measures, which would almost certainly have been implemented after consultation with the government, will trigger an increase in base rates depends on how money market rates respond. French market rates have been rising steadily for the past month. The overnight rate moved from 10 per cent in early December to 12 per cent at the start of this week. Yesterday, it jumped as high as 15 per cent. This has made it more expensive for the commercial banks to borrow money and has already prompted them to raise base rates - to 10 per cent - in mid-December. During the autumn currency crisis the banks succumbed to government pressure to hold base rates, even though overnight rates reached 20 per cent, contributing to a FFr400m (Pounds 48.6m) increase in bank borrowing costs at the time. But the French banks are already in difficulty, because of the competitive state of the banking market and problems in the property sector where prices have fallen in the past two years. They may not be able, or willing, to swallow another rise in costs. 'The commercial banks could cope with higher money market rates for a short period, but not for very long,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'If the cost of bank borrowing stays at this level, base rates will rise.' High interest rates are already a drag on the French economy. The high cost of credit has prompted companies to cut down on investment, thereby depressing demand in the industrial sector. This has in turn contributed to the continuing increase in unemployment, now running at an annualised rate of over 10 per cent. Fears of joblessness have also taken a toll on consumer confidence and, hence, on spending. Another increase in base rates could aggravate these problems. The first casualties would be France's smaller companies, which borrow directly from commercial banks. Bigger businesses would be less badly affected, because their debt is more broadly spread. However, another interest rate rise would undoubtedly affect corporate confidence and set back the government's hopes of a recovery in industrial investment. Such a scenario would further lock the economy into its vicious cycle. There are already rumblings of discontent from industry. A Louis Harris poll published yesterday found that two thirds of industrialists prefer lower interest rates to a continuation of the franc fort policy of protecting the franc. The French government has consistently ruled out the possibility of reducing official interest rates until German rates come down. Moreover, as yesterday's rate changes show, neither the government nor the central bank shows any sign of wavering in their support for the franc.</p>

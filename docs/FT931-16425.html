			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / New job for Mexican debt chief MEXICO'S chief debt negotiator for more than a decade, Mr Jose Angel Gurria, is leaving the finance ministry where he is under-minister for international finance. He will take over Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext), the state-run export-import bank. Known for his good humour, and outstanding sales talk, Mr Gurria will be missed on the international finance circuit. He was co-ordinator of Mexico's external debt in 1979, when the country was borrowing money from any bank that would lend, and was still in the job (with a progressively more senior title) when Mexico defaulted on its debt in 1982, reached agreement with its creditors in 1989, and resumed borrowing in the 1990s. His transfer to Bancomext is technically a promotion. He will be given a remit to expand its role, in line with the government's desire to boost exports from medium and small companies. His functions will be taken over by Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the finance ministry's principal under-minister. The international finance under-ministry is being wound up, a decision that reflects to an extent the end of debt as an issue for Mexico. Its net debt-to-GDP ratio is now about 29 per cent of GDP, against 62 per cent in 1988. Mr Gurria's move marks the end of a series of ministerial changes that are likely to be the last significant ones of President Carlos Salinas's administration. On Monday the president replaced Mr Fernando Gutierrez Barrios as interior minister with Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, governor of Chiapas, and Mr Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the attorney-general, with the president of the National Human Rights Commission, Mr Jorge Carpizo. This latter appointment has been well received by human rights groups inside and outside Mexico, and may have been intended to deflect criticisms of the country's human rights record in hearings on the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. By contrast, Mr Gonzalez Garrido has a reputation as a tough governor. His appointment may thus signify a change in policy at the interior ministry, which, under Mr Gutierrez Barrios, has favoured negotiation with opposition groups. Mr Gonzalez Garrido is not considered a likely presidential candidate, and the president may have decided to put him, rather than a better known politician in the post, to ensure the all-important interior ministry is free to make tough decisions in the run-up to next year's presidential election. Mexico's economy grew by 2.8 per cent last year, Mr Pedro Aspe, finance minister, said yesterday. This was a little higher than the most recent official forecast but well short of the government's original hopes. He expected growth of around 3 per cent this year.</p>

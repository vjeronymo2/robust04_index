Kolodziejczyk, who arrived for a two-day visit to the Czech  Republic today, said that not only the rapid integration of the  Czech Republic and Poland into NATO was at stake, but also the  admission of other countries because security is indivisible and  Europe will be secure only when the islands of insecurity are  eliminated. If most media write that the Polish voice has  sounded louder in the talks about admission, this is caused by  the fact that Poland feels threatened on its eastern border,  Kolodziejczyk said. In the states east of Poland there is an  unstable situation, he added.    Poland was not imposing any conditions for the adoption of  the American Partnership For Peace, although there were certain  pressures, for the initiative to include criteria for admission  into NATO, Kolodziejczyk said. Both the Polish government and  the president are currently assessing the partnership as  positive, Kolodziejczyk stated. The Czech and Polish armies  will conduct a total of 54 exchange and other joint projects,  Kolodziejczyk announced.    In 1991 the two countries' defense ministries concluded a  bilateral agreement on the main aims of cooperation in the  military sphere. We have confirmed that although the original  agreement was concluded under the former Czechoslovak  federation, both countries consider it valid, Baudys said. At  the same time, the two ministers have agreed that it was  necessary to conclude a new agreement on mutual cooperation  which would involve some points from the partnership for peace,  Baudys announced.    The agreement would include possible cooperation in  supplying  and manufacturing spare parts for military equipment, in the  arms industry, in particular the aviation industry, and training  and joint exercises to which the two countries want to invite  NATO representatives, Baudys said.    Kolodziejczyk was received by Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec and Chairman of parliament Milan Uhde.</p>

A well-known American reporter revealed that this was a  question he wanted to put to U.S. President Bill Clinton if the  opportunity arose. It is a good question and one directly  linked with the truly sensational agreement which, contrary to  expectations, Moscow, Kiev, and Washington have managed to  acheive, proposing to turn Ukraine into a nuclear-free zone.    The reporter did not particularly philosophize about his  question. The terms of the agreement -- even now that its text  has been published -- clearly leave a lot unrevealed: Some  aspects will need detailed explanation, and it is not ruled out  that modifications will be required "in the course of business"  [v rabochem poryadke].    It is becoming clear from the discussions with the Americans  who accompanied the President that Washington was just as hasty  a partner in this deal as Kiev -- although for entirely  different reasons. It was Washington, insofar as we understand  it, which insisted that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations  conducting the talks in the U.S. capital postpone their return  home 5 January in order to use the time to intensify the search  for a solution to outstanding problems. The delegations  tarried, but when Clinton left Washington for Europe on Saturday  8 January he still had no confidence that the deal would go  ahead, although he had been told that there had been "a certain  amount of progress."    The deal was struck on Monday, 10 January -- that was when  the U.S. ambassador in Moscow and the leader of the U.S.  ambassadorial mission in Kiev informed the State Department and  the Clinton team touring Europe that Presidents Yeltsin and  Kravchuk had initialed the agreement reached by their  delegations.    Why was Clinton in a hurry? Among the explanations we have  heard the most rational is the simplest -- over the past few  months the problem of preventing nuclear arms proliferation has  been top of his personal agenda and personal list of priorities.  The U.S. President saw Ukrainian nuclear disarmament as his  most realistic chance to take the first and most most  substantive step in this direction. If such an agreement were  reached it would, moreover, be another foreign policy triumph  for Clinton -- the second following the reconciliation between  Israel and the PLO. Such a triumph would not be out of place  for the President at a time when he faces growing scandals at  home -- scandals which many are already comparing to Nixon's  Watergate.    Achieving this goal on his personal agenda was made  considerably easier for Clinton by the fact that, Ukraine, as  one of my interlocutors put it, was by then "pretty much ready  -- it had virtually doomed itself to isolation in the  international arena, as demonstrated by Clinton's refusal,  widely trumped by the Washington White House, to visit Ukraine  during his tour of the former Union, and to restrict himself to  Moscow and -- a particular blow to the Ukrainians -- to Minsk."  Kiev clearly understood that going further down the road which  Ukraine had followed since essentially refusing to ratify START  I would mean depriving the country of Western aid. The  agreement to get things moving opened up some nice prospects for  Kiev -- in the form of an extension of aid not so much through  bilateral channels as through the channels of international  organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development.    Moreover, Washington could not fail to notice the personal  ambitions of Kravchuk, who has an undoubted interest in gaining  genuine recognition from the international community and  achieving the standing of a statesmen with whom you can "do  business."    One other point -- the Ukrainian lobby, which is very strong  in those states of America which play a key role in the  presidential election, was exerting very great pressure on the  Washington White House to ensure that Ukraine was properly  treated and certainly not dealt with on a lower footing than  America's relationship with Belarus.    That was the backdrop against which the search for a  compromise was accelerated. Very substantial people were  involved on the American side -- the man in charge was Strobe  Talbott, number two at the State Department; the team also  included Lynn Davis, another under secretary of state, and Nick  Burns, a leading specialist on the former Union at the National  Security Council. Tactically, the U.S. delegation's job, which  met with understanding from the Russian delegation, was based on  creating additional incentives for Ukraine in the shape of firm  guarantees of economic and financial aid and help in contacts  with international departments where the United States  traditionally wields great influence. A key factor was, as  sources put it, Washington's readiness to respond appropriately  to Kiev's longstanding concern that, in giving up its nuclear  weapons, it would be exposed to the threat of a strike, say,  from the East, from Russia. Formerly Washington had avoided any  pledges on this score, apart from quite simply referring to the  fact that Ukraine's accession to the nonproliferation regime  would automatically give it the guarantees it wanted. Kiev was  not satisfied with this and insisted on more. The proposal to  join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program will, as Washington  explained to Kiev, satisfy its longstanding wishes and demands.    Admittedly, there immediately arises the question about a  hypothetical war over the Crimea which the American reporter  would have liked to have asked the American President.    But, alas, there are plenty of other questions too.</p>

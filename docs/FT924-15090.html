			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (10): A Quantum leap forward - Raymond Snoddy looks at two new projects for cable TV viewers IN THE US, long the original home of multi-channel television, the number of channels available to viewers is starting to take a quantum leap forward. Two contrasting projects, each designed to offer no fewer than 150 channels, one involving the use of fibre optic cable technology and the other high power television satellites, show what is becoming possible in a country where 60 per cent of homes already have cable television and 70 channel systems are not unusual. Now, 3,000 cable subscribers in the New York borough of Queens can chose from 150 channels through Quantum, a project set up by Time Warner, the world's largest media organisation. Fibre optic trunk networks have been added to the existing co-axial cable The 'conventional' 75 channels carried by the system include channels for Korean, Chinese, Indian and Greek minorities. The aim of the new system is not to multiply endlessly the number of separate channels beyond the capacity of programme providers to supply or viewers to choose. At the heart of the Quantum project is a significant development of pay-per-view movies - charging for each film viewed. No fewer than 57 channels are given over to around 15 films a week. Because of the enormous channel capacity five channels can be devoted to showing a single hit film - say JFK - with staggered starts so that on one of the channels the film is starting anew every 30 minutes. Using a system that appears to be as much a personal computer as a television set the converter boxes produced by Pioneer of Japan offers viewers menu options on the screen for ordering films. Viewers press a button to call up any one of six hit films. Hits costs Dollars 3.95. Adult movies cost Dollars 4.95 with children's films Dollars 1.95. Quantum says the first 5,000 systems delivered from Japan have already been snapped up with some people taking more than one for different rooms of the house. The Quantum project has been hailed as the beginning of a new phase in cable technology. It is also a sign of the increasing interest being shown in creating yet another revenue 'window' for the movies. In timing pay-per-view will probably slot in immediately after the theatrical release of a film and before video rental and sale. Then it is on to premium films channels on cable before films finally end up on normal broadcast television and 'classic' or old movie channels. No figures are yet available; some of the boxes were only installed in July and Time Warner plans to take the system to other cable networks. As well as offering more chances to see recent films the system offers the possibility of interactivity - two-way communication for everything from home banking to home shopping. On a larger scale, Hughes Communications is pushing ahead with a plan to offer 150 channels of satellite television all over the US. Hughes, the aircraft and communications division of General Motors, has already committed Dollars 500m to the project with the first of three satellites due for launch late next year. The actual programme service is due to begin in 1994. Mr Eddy Hartenstein, president of DirectTv, a Hughes subsidiary, says the company simply decided to go ahead on its own after it proved impossible to create a workable consortium. Hughes brought together some of the leading players in the industry - Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, NBC, the network broadcaster and Cablevision, the cable television operator. A memorandum of understanding was signed but Hughes was unable to get agreement with the other potential partners on an acceptable balance of risk and benefit. It also did not help that Mr Murdoch was experiencing a Dollars 7.6bn debt crisis which meant that for News Corp new high-risk ventures were definitely on the back-burner. Hughes decided it could go with the venture when Mr Stanley Hubbard's United States Satellite Broadcasting consortium committed to take five channel transponders on the first of the three 16-transponder satellite. United States Satellite Broadcasting also paid Dollars 50m up front of a total commitment of more than Dollars 100m. USSB will be running its own programme service. The system plans to use digital compression techniques - turning the pictures into digital form - to multiply the number of channels that can be carried on a single transponder that now broadcasts one channel. The home receiving system, which will be distributed under the RCA brand name, is designed to retail initially at around Dollars 700m. The high power satellites will broadcast to 18-inch satellite dishes. The venture is primarily aimed at the 40m US homes that do not have cable television but could also offer more choice in areas where it will be expensive to upgrade old cable systems. Mr Hartenstein believes the company could be reaching 10m homes by the end of the decade. A large slice of the channel capacity - no fewer than 40-50 channels - will be devoted to a pay-per-view movie service with films starting every 30 minutes. A second important strand of programming will feature subscription sports television. The service will cover big games not being broadcast by conventional national broadcasters. Earlier this year Hughes also signed a deal with the National Rural Telecommunications Co-operative. The deal allows NRTC, which provides telecommunications and electric services to more than 12m rural homes, to market a package of 20 channels of cable and broadcast television programmes in return for a distribution fee of up to Dollars 250m. The majority of homes in rural areas do not have access to cable television. Both Quantum and DirectTv are signs not only that more channels of television are on the way but that films on demand and the associated revenues are fast becoming a practical proposition in the US.</p>

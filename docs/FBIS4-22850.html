Komarovskaya; UDC  620.197:669.71:546.7]    [Abstract] Film metal-oxide heterostructures are widely  used with different electronic devices. In order to develop  carriers for a vertical magnetic recording, magnetic films based  on metal oxide heterostructures on aluminum surface have been  intensely studied for the last several years. The magnetic  medium with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is realized in  these film systems by formation of cell structures with  distributed needle- like particles of ferromagnetic metal. The  Moessbauer effect offers great potentials for studying these  films. The objective of this study was, by applying the  Moessbauer effect, to obtain information on the kinetics of the  process of filling the cells, or pores, and information about  the magnetic condition of needle- like particles. The film  metal-oxide heterostructures were produced by electrochemical  sedimentation of iron in the pores of the anode oxide film,  formed on the aluminum surface by anodizing in the sulfuric acid  electrolyte. The results of Moessbauer measurements demonstrated  that magnetic and non-magnetic components were present in the  spectra of all examined samples. The studies also indicate that  by an appropriate selection of the anodizing condition and  consecutive sedimentation on the aluminum surface, magnetic  films, suitable for application in devices with a vertical  information recording method can be obtained.</p>

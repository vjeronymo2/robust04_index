			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: AT&amp;T buys wireless phone group SHAYE Communications, a small, privately-held UK company which is a world leader in wireless telephone technology, has been bought by AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group. The consideration was disclosed, but is thought to be some tens of millions of pounds. Mr Bill Jeffrey, the founder, will remain chief executive. Shaye will remain in Winchester and no change of employment is envisaged for its 60 staff, most of whom are involved in research and development, The purchase fills a gap in the US company's international portfolio of wireless telephone products. Shaye specialises in a form of wireless telephony - CT2 - which has been unsuccessful in the UK, but looks like being a sizeable success abroad. Known as Telepoint in Britain, the technology depends on a network of base stations, or transceivers, in public places which transmit calls from portable telephones.</p>

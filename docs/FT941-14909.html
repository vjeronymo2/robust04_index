			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Eastern Electricity Eastern Electricity's decision to buy up to 5 per cent of its shares is a small but significant admission of the regional companies' embarrassing riches. The RECs are heading rapidly towards net cash, and even a harsh review of their price caps is unlikely to stop cash generation completely. Funding utilities with equity alone is expensive. While share buy backs help, a much more radical restructuring is needed to get the RECs back on to a sensible footing. Interestingly, the regulator cited cost of capital as an issue he will consider in his current price review. If the RECs do not produce plans to gear up, return excess funds to shareholders and cut bills to customers, the regulator may do it for them.</p>

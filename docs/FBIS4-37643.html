			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, June 23, IRNA -- Iran  termed as false the testimony made by a U.S. official that there  were no Iranian assets in the United States which could be  released.    In a press release Wednesday [22 June], the Iranian mission  at the United Nations stressed that several billion dollars of  Iranian assets and properties in the United States have been  frozen by the U.S. Administration.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs  Robert Pelletreau had falsely testified that the United States  had no forzen Iranian assets except what might be available to  the U.S. Claims Commission.    He made the statement in the hearing of the Europe and the  Middle East subcommittee of the house of foreign affairs  committee on June 14 in response to repeated questions about the  existence of any Iranian assets that had been frozen in the  United States.    The press release said that the fund which was made  available  to the (US) Claims Commission represented the settlement amount  for the small claims, an issue totally distinct from Iranian  assets frozen by the United States.    Terming the testimony as false, the press release said that  apart from different types of Iranian properties which have been  blocked in the United States, three major categories of Iran's  assets are still in the United States which have not been  released to Tehran and have neither been put at the disposal of  the Iran-U.S. claims tribunal.    It added that the Iranian assets which are in the US  include:  (i) the remaining balance in the Foreign Military Sales Fund  (FMS trust funds) (ii) Funds of Iranian diplomatic mission and  (iii) balance of stand-by letters of credit issued by U.S. banks  on the account of US companies in favour of Iranian Government  entities, including but not limited to down payments, good  performance guarantees and commercial letters of credit.    The press release also said that in addition to blocking  some  Iranian military and non-military properties including those of  Iranian diplomatic missions, the United States has, in violation  of its undertaking under the Algiers Accords, refused to return  to Iran its remaining assets and continues to hold them in the  United States.    It stressed that the total value of the items exceeds  several  billion U.S. dollars.</p>

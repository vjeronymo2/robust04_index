			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> HARBOR DREDGED TO ENSURE SAFE BOATING  </P> <P> The tall crane that has dominated the skyline in Dana Point Harbor will  continue dredging through the first week in August, county officials say.  </P> <P> The crane with the "clamshell" bucket on its arm has been removing sand from  several shallow spots, said Larry Paul, manager of coastal facilities for the  county.  </P> <P> The cost of the seven-week project is about $437,000, Paul said.  </P> <P> Periodic dredging is necessary for the safety of about 3,000 recreational and  commercial boats that use the 20-year-old harbor, Paul said.  </P> <P> "We constantly monitor the harbor bottom until we get an accumulation  sufficient to justify the cost of a project like this," Paul said. "It's not an  exact science. But we don't want to have a low tide and a keel stuck in a  shoal."  </P> <P> Over time, silt from storm drains and sand that has sifted through the  breakwaters build up in certain areas of the 20-foot deep harbor.  </P> <P> Recent surveys revealed the need for dredging at the entrance to the east  harbor basin as well as at the fishing dock and fuel dock areas, Paul said.  </P> <P> But most of the buildup occurred on the west side of the outermost breakwater,  he said.  </P> <P> Before work begins, a sample of materials from various points on the harbor's  bottom is taken and sent to labs for analysis.  </P> <P> "Basically, what we have there is sand and clay and silty material," Paul said.  "But we go through six or seven regulatory agencies before the material is  disposed of."  </P> <P> During the course of the project, about 40,000 cubic yards of this material  will be lifted from the bottom, deposited on a neighboring barge and then  shipped to an approved dump site 12 miles off Newport Beach, Paul said.

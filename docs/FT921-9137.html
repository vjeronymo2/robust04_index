			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Battling the repossession scourge: Help for mortgage debtors THE Council of Mortgage Lenders will today announce the number of homes repossessed in the second half of last year. The figure will take the total for 1991 up to just under 80,000 - a staggering increase on the 5,000 repossessed annually as recently as 10 years ago. Yet the announcement is likely to be greeted with relief by the government and the lenders. This is because it is far short of gloomier predictions from housing analysts and campaigners that repossessions would top 100,000 last year. Ministers are also optimistic that the chancellor's mortgage rescue package, announced on December 19, will make a significant impact on the number of repossessions in 1992. The government's contribution to that package was an agreement to pay the mortgage interest element of social security benefits direct to lenders, so that it was not spent on other things. In return, the lenders agreed not to repossess the homes of people covered by such benefits. They also set aside up to Pounds 1bn for mortgage-to-rent schemes under which housing associations would buy the homes of repossessed borrowers and rent them back to their former owners. The lenders claimed that the package would cut repossessions by 40,000 in 1992 - half of which would be through mortgage-to-rent schemes. Yet almost two months after the chancellor announced his package, only three building societies have announced details of their schemes - two of them only pilot schemes covering fewer than 500 homes. At the heart of the delay has been a clash of interests between the lenders and the housing associations over the terms for mortgage-to-rent schemes. The housing associations are keen to help keep borrowers in their homes but are unwilling to take on an open-ended liability to bail out the lenders. So they want the lenders to pay for outstanding repairs before handing over homes, to write off arrears owed by borrowers and to cover their set-up and administration costs. They have also been unhappy about the terms on offer for loans to buy the repossessed homes. The lenders were prepared to offer loans at 6 per cent to 8 per cent, but the associations reckoned that they needed interest rates of below 5 per cent if they were to charge affordable rents. Little progress was made in the negotiations between the lenders and the housing associations until three weeks ago, when the Nationwide Building Society launched its pilot mortgage-to-rent scheme. Anxious to be the first to announce a scheme, Nationwide conceded most of the associations' demands. Housing association costs were to be fully covered, mortgage arrears would be written off and houses put into good repair before sale. Nationwide also conceded interest rates for loans to the associations of between 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent, in return for a share in any increase in value of the houses. Nationwide's terms were not widely welcomed by other lenders, who saw them as overly generous. But they set a benchmark from which the housing associations were reluctant to depart. The Halifax pilot, announced on Friday, is thought to be broadly along the same lines as Nationwide's. So too is the Bradford &amp; Bingley's, launched on Monday. Other initiatives are in the pipeline. Leeds Permanent will announce details of its scheme today, with Woolwich following later this month. Some of the mortgage indemnity insurers, who stand to lose as much as Pounds 3bn over the next two years, are thought likely to set up their own schemes. Most of the centralised lenders, the new mortgage companies which are among the hardest hit by arrears and repossessions, have yet to devise rescue schemes. The Mortgage Corporation, however, has set up a Pounds 15m business expansion scheme to convert 150 homes into assured tenancies. It is also talking to housing associations about renting empty properties to homeless families. The pace of setting up mortgage-to-rent schemes will now quicken. Many involved in housing are, however, cautious about their ability to meet their target. Sir George Young, the housing minister, last week declined to endorse the 40,000 forecast, pointing out that it had been made by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, not the government. Shelter, the pressure group, earlier this week suggested that mortgage-rescue schemes would not save more than 24,000 homes. That pessimism is shared by Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at the stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, who believes that rescue schemes will have only a marginal effect on the level of repossessions. He is optimistic about repossessions this year, however, because lenders are doing more to help customers manage their finances. 'The building societies and other lenders have achieved a truly remarkable reduction in the number of likely eviction cases. Around two thirds of their serious arrears cases are now under control,' he says. After the activity to set up mortgage rescue schemes the solution may have lain with the lenders all along - in the form of better debt counselling.</p>

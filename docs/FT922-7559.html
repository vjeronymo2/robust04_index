			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: No tax on language Sir, David J Brown (Letters, May 14) points out that employees are taxed on the cost of language lessons provided by an employer. Our experience is different. We have taught many thousands of people to speak a language. These are mostly directors and senior executives of major companies and institutions. As far as we are aware, not one such person has been assessed by the Inland Revenue for any benefit in kind. Geri Stillit, Stillitron, 72 New Bond Street, London W1Y 0QY</p>

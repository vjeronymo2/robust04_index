			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Heron Intl seeks more time to pay interest Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group which completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing last September, is asking lenders for more time to pay interest due on March 31. It blamed 'difficult market conditions in Europe' for its inability to pay on time. It added that declines in European property values meant it could no longer predict that its senior bonds would be repaid in full, and it was proposing that a proportion of the bonds should be swapped into a lower ranking convertible bond. Further it said that its Spanish banking facilities would need to be renegotiated. Heron is due to pay Pounds 16.4m of interest on its senior bonds, which were issued as part of the refinancing, and a further Pounds 16.5m of a new money facility, on March 31. It is seeking to delay payments until June 30. It said it was negotiating property sales which should enable it to pay by then. Part of the problem lies in Heron's complex structure. While much of the group's debt is owed by the head office company, many of its assets are held by subsidiaries. Proceeds from asset sales by these subsidiaries, notably Heron Corporation, cannot be passed up to the head office company until all their debts are repaid. Heron International has raised Pounds 200m through asset sales and has a further Pounds 75m due to complete by the end of March. However, most of this is from disposals from Heron Corporation. Heron International had been making interest payments early as asset sales came through. At the time of the restructuring some lenders believed it to be flawed. They thought there was 'a fairly high probability of default' because it would have taken a rise in property values even to service the senior debt. Bondholders are to meet on March 31 to consider the interest delays. An explanatory memorandum will be issued to bondholders before then.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: CSR rises 40% and forecasts further advance CSR, the Australian building products, aluminium and sugar group, yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in profits after tax but before abnormals to ADollars 296.5m (USDollars 212m) during the year to end-March. CSR, which reported trading gains from all its main divisions and forecast a continued profit improvement in the current year, said the advance was reached on revenues up by 16 per cent, at ADollars 5.36bn. The progress translated into earnings per share of 33.6 cents, compared with 25.1 cents in the previous 12 months (before abnormals). The company incurred no abnormal charges in the most recent 12 months, but suffered a ADollars 35.1m item in 1992-93, leaving profits after tax and abnormals in that year at ADollars 231.3m. The biggest divisional improvement came in the timber operations, where operating profits jumped to ADollars 71.3m from ADollars 28.8m. The core building and construction materials business saw profits of ADollars 241.4m against ADollars 226m, while the North American construction materials division made ADollars 106.3m compared with ADollars 79.1m. CSR said it expected demand in its domestic market to remain close to current levels this year. It acknowledged that Australia's house building improvement might ebb, but suggested that commercial construction should recover. The aluminium division saw operating profits rise to ADollars 76.4m from ADollars 41.5m, largely due to falling production costs. CSR said it was surprised by the recent rise in aluminium prices. Because of the high level of world stocks, it did not expect a significant recovery in price levels until 1995. The sugar division made a profit of ADollars 127.7m against ADollars 118.6m. CSR said it expected 1994 raw sugar production to reach record levels. But it said longer-term prospects for the Australian refined sugar industry were less encouraging, with persistent oversupply. CSR said it was retaining a ADollars 40m reserve against asbestos-related claims, though it suggested legal developments in the US had generally been favourable.</p>

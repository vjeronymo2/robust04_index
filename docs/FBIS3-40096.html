In 1985, the Central Committee proposed the  nationwide selection of various knowledge-intensive areas and  adopted special policies for the step-by-step formation of new  technology industrial development zones, each having different  characteristics. Thereafter, new and high technology industrial  development zones such as Jiechunfeng developed quickly. Today  the country has 52 national-level new and high technology  industrial development zones and 37 province level high and new  technology industry development zones.    Liaoning Province, which possesses a strong industrial base,  scientific and technical forces, and a multitude of institutions  of higher education, has not shirked its responsibilities. One  after another, three high and new technology industry  development zones in Shenyang, Dalian, and Anshan have joined  the "national team," and two province-level teams have been  founded, one at Jinzhou, and the other at Liaoyang. The Nanhu  Science and Technology Development Zone in Shenyang also became  one of the five new and high technology development zones that  the State Science and Technology Commission and State Commission  for Restructuring of the Economic System designated test areas  for comprehensive reform.    "First, sound a clarion call from the heights for an advance  in a blaze of color." A large number of the province's  scientific and technical personnel left research institutes,  institutions of higher education, or large and mediumsized  enterprises to found mew and high technology enterprises in  scientific and technical development zones. These zones turned  into commodities what had formerly been called "samples" or  "exhibits." Incomplete statistics show the founding of more  than 1,200 high and new technology enterprises in the province's  five technology development zones, and more than 630 high and  new technology projects represented by Jinzhou's far infra-red  technology, Liaoyang's qihuamei [1477 0553 5326] technology,  Anshan's static electricity technology, Dalian's hollow fiber  super membrane technology, and Shenyang's bar code technology  have entered domestic and foreign markets one after another for  the preliminary creation of an output value of more than 15  billion yuan. Within the short period of five years, Shenyang's  Nanhu Science and Technology Zone, which got off to the earliest  start, has seen the founding of 25 enterprises making earnings  of more than 10 million yuan, and 126 enterprises making more  than 1 million yuan from scientific industrial commodities. They  have also developed a number of products having an annual output  value of more than 100 million yuan including bar codes, heavy  fire retarding steel wire cable conveyor belts, and dansheng  hubao ye [6130 3932 6233 1405 3210].  <H3>  Like the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Showing  Special Prowess </H3>   Making the most of each region's advantages to shape a  distinctive economy is the outstanding feature of the province's  five major science and technology development zones. This  embodies the party's ideological line of seeking truth in facts,  and it is also in keeping with the development of a socialist  market economy.    Liaoyang is neither along the coast nor along the frontier,  much less does it have the political, economic, and scientific  and technical forces available in large cities; nevertheless,  the municipal CPC committee and municipal government recognized  the cities' special character and seized opportunities  tenaciously. First, Liaoyang began work on three major projects  for which the State Council had approved a total investment of  13 billion yuan, namely the second phase of the Liaoning  chemical project, the Qingyang MDI project, and the Liaoning  linen and polyester project. It coordinated construction of the  three projects, which will bring a large amount of high and new  technology and products into Liaoyang. It's digestion and  absorption of advanced technology, and its in-depth development  of new products have become a major advantage for Liaoyang. In  this connection, the Liaoyang high and new technology industry  development zone established the principle of taking the  chemical industry, chemical fibers, and plastics as the three  main industries to be developed.    Jinzhou City did not attempt across-the-board development.  It  concentrated its energies on the building of high and new  technology industrial parks in an effort to make them into new  growth points for the whole city's economic development. It  developed leading edge forward positions for new and high  technology industries. Currently, a large number of high level  technical products, including membrane separation technology,  quma [2575 7456] multiple analgesia, and titanium dioxide powder  technology have been brought to fruition in the science and  technology parks.    The steel capital, Anshan, has abundant natural resources.  It  has one-fourth of the country's recoverable iron ore reserves,  and one-fourth the world's magnesite reserves. Its talc and soap  stone are renowned in China and abroad. The Anshan Iron and  Steel Corporation has an annual 8 million tons aggregate  production capacity. Therefore, the Anshan high and new  technology industry development zone will make new materials,  new energy, and high performance energy saving technology,  automation technology, electronic information technology,  biotechnology, environmental protection, and static electricity  technology its six major technological areas for priority  development.    The Qixianling Industrialized Base in Dalian's high and new  technology industrial zone is the city's key development  project. Since the famed Dalian Economic and Technology  Development Zone is located in the city, projects coming into  the base start from a higher threshold. Using an overall  development strategy of building a "northern Hong Kong," the  park administration decided during 1993 to attract both domestic  and foreign high and new technology by expanding its opening to  the outside world in order to make major breakthroughs in the  technical fields of electronic information, electromechanical  integration, new materials, high performance energy  conservation, and on environmental, maritime, and biological  projects. It is making an effort to achieve within five to 10  years the formation of an industrial system that is distinctive  to that city and at a substantial scale.    The Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone in  Shenyang  has become outstanding among development zones nationwide. The  development zone emphasizes major high and new technology fields  including electronics and information, electromechanical  integration, biology projects, new materials, energy and  environmental protection. It has already developed more than  2,000 high and new technology achievements that have spawned  1,113 high and new technology enterprises. Gross earnings  realized from technology, industry, and trade total more than 3  billion yuan; high and new technology projects have an output  value of 2 billion yuan; and profits and taxes amount to 470  million yuan. It has created more than $20 million in foreign  exchange. The software center headed by 38 year old Professor  Liu Jiren [0491 4480 0088] of Northeast University's science  park enjoys a reputation in the American and Japanese market.  The bar code series products developed under the aegis of the 38  year old Zhu Junying [2612 0193 5391], a high level engineer at  the Shenyang Engineering Institute, now hold 70 percent of the  domestic market. By comparison with the other four zones, the  Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone plays more the  part of a locomotive for the transformation of traditional  industries. The development zone has successfully created a  "diffusion butt joint project," a "galloping-dragon  changing-into-a-bird project" and a"single plant single role"  project. In this way, the development zone has transformed more  than 3,000 different traditional technologies producing 1  billion yuan in economic returns.  <H5>  Seizes Opportunities To Create Splendor </H5>   The high and new technology development zones not only  possess policy advantages, but skilled manpower and technology  advantages as well. In addition, the investment environment is  being constantly improved, procedures simplified, and publicity  increased. Consequently, foreign traders flock to the province's  five large science and technology industry development zones,  and invest enthusiastically. Today, 157 foreign trader-owned  enterprises are operating in Shenyang's Nanhu Science and  Technology Development Zone, 85 percent of them high technology,  high return, high foreign exchange earning projects.  Foreign-owned enterprises account for 14.2 percent of all  enterprises in the Nanhu Science and Technology Development  Zone. They also account for 35 percent of the development zone's  output value, as well as for more than 75 percent of its export  foreign exchange earnings.    While the science and technology industry development zone  is  expanding, during the first half of 1993 the central authorities  increased macroeconomic regulation and control, and the State  Council also issued a notice on taking a hard look at all  development zones. How to regard the situation being faced is of  crucial importance. Not long ago, leaders from the departments  concerned in the State Science and Technology Commission and  principal leaders from the provincial science and technology  commission headed a group made up of science and technology  directors in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Jinzhou, and Liaoyang, as  well as directors from the science and technology industry  development zone, which visited the science and technology  industrial development zones in Jinzhou, Shenyang, Liaoyang, and  Anshan to hear reports and hold panel discussions.    Comrades attending the meetings unanimously agreed that the  State Council notice made clear requirements for operating the  zones, underscored the solemnity of national policy regulations,  and abolished all development zones below the provincial level.  This is another fist tightening move in the country's economic  development, concentrating material, financial, and, manpower  resources. It is extremely beneficial to the development of both  national and provincial level development zones. Opportunities  are hard to come by. There can be no hesitation. We must move  ahead vigorously.    Comrades attending the meetings recognized that the  technological foundation for all the province's industry was  laid on the achievements of the last industrial revolution, and  that Liaoning Province must carry out "the second creation" to  restore its prowess. This means using new and high technology as  the technological basis for the transformation of industry.  Shenyang's Nanhu Science and Technology Development Zone has  been successful in doing this. All of the province's five large  science and technology industrial development zones must become  primary incubators of high and new technologies for the  transformation of traditional industries.    It is heartening that the fine investment climate and the  abundant intellect available in the province's high and new  technology industry development zones have not only attracted  numerous traders from the United States, Japan, Germany, and  South Korea, but, more recently. The favor of many domestic  financial institutions and large enterprise blocs as well. This  is because they have gradually become aware that the new and  high technology industry development zones are gestating  "tomorrow's sun."    Reportedly, it takes about 10 years for a science and  technology industry development zone to become a success.  Stanford University Science Park, which was founded during the  1950s, became "Silicon Valley" during the 1960s, and during the  1970s, it became the world-renowned "first international park."  The five major high and new technology industry development  zones in Liaoning play a turnkey role in moving the urban area  ahead in the plans of each city in which they are located.  Another five to 10 years arduous struggle, and it will be the  turn of the century. By that time, five new modern urban areas  will have risen on the Liaodong Peninsula. What a magnificent  sight that will be!    Leading comrades in Shenyang, Anshan, and Jinzhou have the  following ardent expectations of comrades in the science and  technology industry development zones: Not all of the millions  of workers, peasants, and others in these cities can go abroad,  but they can go to the development zones. In going to the  development zones, they can feel as though they are in Japan,  Hong Kong, Singapore, or in developed countries of Europe and  the United States. They will be able to see with their own eyes  what economic development and modernization mean.    We look forward enthusiastically to the early arrival of  this  day.</p>

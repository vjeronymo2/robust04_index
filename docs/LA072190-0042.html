			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WHITE, BLACK, LATINO ENROLLMENT DOWN AT  UCLA  </P> <P> UCLA is searching for causes for the decline in the number of white, black and  Latino applicants for this year's freshman class, Chancellor Charles E. Young  told UC Regents Friday.  </P> <P> Because of those drops, about a third of the class at the Westwood campus is  expected to be whites, down from nearly 42% last year; blacks are expected to  account for 7%, down from 8.6% in 1989, and Latinos 18%, compared to 19% last  year.  </P> <P> About a third of the freshmen are expected to be Asian, up from about 26% last  year.  </P> <P> Young said that some applicants may have been scared off by increasingly tough  competition and others by financial difficulties. A committee of faculty,  students and administrators is expected to issue a report on the admissions  changes by September, Young said.  </P></p>

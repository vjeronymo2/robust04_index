			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Elan advances to IPounds 9.44m and enters Dollars 3.5bn market Elan Corporation, the Irish pharmaceutical company which moved up from the USM with a capitalisation of Pounds 892m in November last year, turned in a pre-tax profit of IPounds 9.44m (Pounds 9.25m) for the three months ended June 30, up from IPounds 7.61m for the comparable period. Turnover for the first quarter was ahead at IPounds 28.8m (IPounds 25.3m), with the manufacturing and distribution side contributing IPounds 13.2m (IPounds 12.8m). Revenues from contract development and royalties were down from IPounds 11.2m to IPounds 7.74m, but license and option fees increased sixfold to IPounds 7.79m. Strong future growth is predicted for the company's multiple sclerosis and anti-cancer products, said Mr Donald Panoz, chairman. Earnings per share were 23 per cent ahead at 27p (22p). Elan is also listed on the American Stock Exchange. It is classified as a growth stock and not permitted to pay dividends. Elan has received FDA clearance for its Panoject ambulatory infusion devices, which provide continuous controlled delivery of drugs and analgesics. This positions the company to tackle home infusion, the fastest-growing sector of the US health care industry. This is a market currently estimated at Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.25bn), rising to Dollars 16bn by 1997, driven by the emphasis on controlling health care costs by providing therapy in patients' homes and out-patient departments. Elan also announced an agreement with Syntex, the US drugs company taken over by Roche in May, to market Elan's once-daily formulation of prescription naproxen in the US. Naproxen was discovered by Syntex Research; Elan's formulation uses its proprietary intestinal protective drug absorption system to provide controlled release of the dosage. The drug will be sold by Syntex Laboratories, a US affiliate of Syntex Pharmaceuticals International, which will make milestone payments to Elan.</p>

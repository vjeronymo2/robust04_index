			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte gloom Continued speculation of a dividend cut at Forte, which is due to announce full-year results tomorrow, weakened the shares. They closed 2 adrift at 181p. There were also renewed rumblings over a possible rights issue to reduce the hotel group's high debt, although most leisure specialists believe it is likely to happen until later in the year. However, further evidence of how gloomy the market has become over the short-term prospects for the stock was seen in the traded options market where one leading securities house bought put options suggesting that Forte's shares will be below yesterday's closing price in two months time. Among banks, participation in the BT3 sale continued to boost SG Warburg and the shares improved 9 to 658p. Merchant bank Hambros gained 7 to 331p, with dealers focusing on the improved prospects for Hambro Countrywide which may benefit from the recovering housing market. The composite insurers were carried by the strong market trend with a sell recommendation on Sun Alliance the only noteable feature. Mr David Nisbet at NatWest Securities believes the 'shares are overpriced an should be either switched within the sector or sold.' He suggested that Royal Insurance Holdings and Commercial Union may offer a better investment opportunity and dealers reported switching activity during the course of the day. Sun Alliance closed at 349p xd. Royal hardened a penny to 307p, while CU advanced 17 to 628p. Also wanted was General Accident up 19 at 613p. A detailed research note from Hoare Govett on Granada Group helped the shares gain 2 to 395p. Analyst Mr Hamish Dickson argued that Granada was one of the few companies that offered investors the opportunity to 'deliver two to three years of significant earnings growth regardless of whether or not the UK economy improves.' He believes the shares have an upside of 450p. International drinks stocks were lifted by a combination of confidence over UK, European and Japanese recovery. Allied Lyons gained 10 to 562p, Grand Metropolitan 5 to 428p and Guinness 15 to 482p. Water stocks were among the worst performers in the market as broker advice and press comment drew attention to the sector's relative high rating. This combined with the shift of mood away from defensive and into recovery stocks sent the shares down. Kleinwort Benson was among those advising clients to 'reduce holdings' in the sector. Anglian declined 8 to 538p, Thames 6 to 550p and Wessex 3 to 638p. Oil shares substantially underperformed the rest of the UK market despite big gains in oil shares on Wall Street overnight. The strength of sterling was put forward as one of the prime restraining factors. BP settled marginally easier ar 304 1/2 p after relatively good turnover of 6.9m with the market still reacting to last week's hints that the company's latest well in Colombia has proved dry. Vodafone Group resisted the mood in a positive telecoms sector, the shares standing steady at 388p. Smith New Court revised its profits forecasts, shaving Pounds 5m from this year's to Pounds 320m and moving to Pounds 350m the year after. The securities house blames increased start-up costs overseas for the cut. Bargain hunters were seen in BAT helping the shares gain 13 to 900p. Also in demand were Williams Holdings and Tomkins. The former gained 8 to 335p, while the latter finished 9 better at 253p. The recent overhang of stock in Siebe appeared to have been cleared leaving the shares to move strongly ahead. An initial retreat gave way to good buying and a squeeze was later seen. The shares closed 15 better at 465p, with volume having reached 1.6m. Continued speculation that British Aerospace will soon announce a Pounds 500m order for Hawk aircraft from Indonesia helped the shares finish 5 up at 278p. TI Group added 5 to 310p, boosted by a buy recommendation from BZW. Favourable weekend press comment on VSEL saw the shares jump 15 to 650p. Dividend hunters sought out Booker, shares in the food manufacturing and distribution group bounding forward 11 to 382p. Unilever rebounded from last week's downgradings, the shares closing 11 ahead at 1126p. Food retailers, shunned by investors in recent weeks on price war fears, also caught the recovery mood. Asda added 1 1/2 to 67 1/2 p, with Robert Flemings suggesting that the company's new format stores will produce good trading news. Elsewhere, J Sainsbury lifted 14 to 472p, while Tesco rose 5 to 230p. DIY stocks initially bounded forward but faded as talk was heard that reports of strong sales had been overdone. Do It All owner WH Smith slipped 3 to 420p, while B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher was held to a rise of 5 to 590p. Ladbroke, owner of Texas, added 3 to 175p. In the transport sector, UK airports operator BAA revealed a 6.2 per cent year on year improvement in March passenger traffic. The shares closed 10 better at 793p.</p>

In addition, 30 letters of intent on trade, technical  co-operation and investment were clinched at the symposium, in  which 20 Chinese firms and scores of Sudanese enterprises and  associations participated. Chinese delegates said the results  were better than expected.    Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir said he would pay  attention  to the implementation of the contracts and letters of intent.    Bashir said he expects that co-operation between Sudan and  China, which is strategic to his country, will continue to  develop.    The 44-year-old president said Sudan expects to beef up ties  with China and several other nations to overcome difficulties  caused by boycots from the West.    He made the remarks when meeting with a 53-member Chinese  business group and a Chinese information delegation on Saturday.</p>

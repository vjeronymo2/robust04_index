			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GROVE OFFERS MOLIERE'S 'MISER'  </P> <P> First, the good news. While other theaters give lip service to reviving the  classics, the Grove Shakespeare Festival does it with perseverance and  conviction. Part of that conviction is the notion that a theater's commitment  to the classics only begins with Shakespeare and must include the Ben Jonsons  and Molieres.  </P> <P> Only last year the Grove staged Jonson's "The Alchemist" (a California Gold  Rush version retitled "The Scoundrel"), and its current production of Moliere's  "The Miser" is its second foray with the acerbic French master, after an  earlier edition of "The Imaginary Invalid" (a New Orleans version).  </P> <P> This new "Miser," directed by Deborah LaVine from a Miles Malleson adaptation  at the Grove's Gem Theatre, is a roaring '20s New York version, on a pretty,  sun-drenched Don Llewelyn set, with a glorious array of period costumes by  Laura Deremer. The Grove does the classics, but it likes to see how they play  in America.  </P> <P> There's more good news. "The Miser's" rather contorted plot line -- which  begins with the attempts by two siblings, bullied into obeisance by their  miserly father, to marry against his will -- ends with one of literature's most  outlandishly contrived denouements. LaVine and her cast make clean lines of  what could be a very messy affair. With its timeless moral warnings about the  evils of materialism and the good that comes to those who give, this "Miser"  would make a fine introduction to Moliere for children.  </P> <P> Now, the not-so-good news.  </P> <P> LaVine's production takes a long, long time to get the comedy in gear, and at  the center of it all, Jerome Guardino as the penny-pinching Harpagon is  unthreatening, unfunny and uninspired. It's only when Kimberley LaMarque  arrives as the devious Frosine (there has been no effort made, nor is it  needed, to Americanize the characters' names) that a sense of Moliere's theater  touches down at the Gem.  </P> <P> And only in the second act does most of the cast seem involved in comedy that  requires a balance of verbal and physical wit with a realization that each  character has his or her scheming side -- a darker double that makes the comedy  extraordinarily rich.  </P> <P> "The Miser" also should have a dance-like quality, with characters moving in  and out of Harpagon's sitting room in an increasingly mad roundelay of manners  and plots and delusions. Exits and entrances, though, are generally slow, or  too fast, or ill-timed: From the audience's point of view during one crucial  moment of action, Harpagon's stolen casket of gold coins is in Guardino's clear  view, though the plot demands that it be removed from his sight at the last  moment. If these actors were making double plays, the runner at first would  almost always be safe.  </P> <P> Though much is made of Harpagon's advancing age, especially when he is trying  to woo the woman his son (Paul Read) has his eyes on, Guardino plays him too  old. The price paid: This Harpagon is not terribly intimidating. The threats,  the bodily force, the stare-downs all are fairly hollow, as if the actors were  going through the required paces.  </P> <P> Some of the actors go further. Along with LaMarque's sweepingly polished  Frosine, Rob Monroe's hapless servant Jacques is a towering fool, Marcelo  Tubert's devious Valere gains comic force with every glance and Rudy Nemetz's  street-tough moneylender is one of the freshest ideas in this  red-white-and-blue version.  </P> <P>  The Grove Shakespeare Festival's production of "The Miser" by Moliere will  continue at the Gem Theatre, 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, May 30 through June  23, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m.  Tickets: $16 to $22. Information: (714) 636-7213.  </P> <P> </P></p>

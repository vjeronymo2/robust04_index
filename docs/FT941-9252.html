			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Fujimori 'a political prisoner of the Peruvian armed forces': Sally Bowen on growing disquiet at the role of the military Peru's fledgling democracy suffered a setback last week when the Supreme Court capitulated before the government majority in Congress. Senior judges backed a parliamentary manoeuvre initiated by the executive to shield the military from public investigation into a high-profile human rights case. For many observers, the incident has confirmed their long-standing suspicions that Peru's elected authorities, from President Alberto Fujimori down and including the supposedly independent judiciary, are being manipulated by the country's traditionally powerful military. 'This underlines the relationship between civilian and military power,' said Ms Lourdes Flores Nano, leader of the largest opposition group in Peru's congress. 'Mr Fujimori has become a puppet of the military.' Ms Flores Nano alleges that the armed forces have been, since Mr Fujimori's 1990 election, the power behind the throne. Their hidden agenda has been to install a 'monitored democracy,' she says. Political commentators, in a rare show of unanimity, have dubbed Mr Fujimori a 'political prisoner of the armed forces' and 'the jester at the military court'. Certainly, the influence of Peru's armed forces has grown since they backed the 'self-coup' in April 1992 when Mr Fujimori dissolved congress and suspended the constitution. Emergency legislation has given the military special powers and a relatively free hand in rooting out subversion. At the same time Mr Fujimori has entrusted them with tasks such as road repairs, distributing donated food and helping the population in remote villages. Today, despite the advances in pacification in the 17 months since Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman was captured, more than a quarter of Peru's national territory, containing half of its population, remains classified as 'emergency zones'. Here the 'military-political commander', usually an army general, is the supreme authority. Elected civilian representatives have little or no real role. The military have also acquired wide powers in the administration of justice. Leading terrorists charged with 'treason to the fatherland' are tried by secret military courts. They regularly receive summary life prison sentences from what critics describe as 'faceless' judges and are often denied proper defence provision and the right of appeal. Pro-government congressmen - and indeed many ordinary Peruvians - have applauded the speed and efficiency of these military courts, comparing them favourably with slow, tortuous and frequently corrupt civilian legal practice. But the military also insist on washing their own dirty linen behind closed doors. Over the years, many notorious cases of human rights abuses - including massacres of peasants - have been tried in secret, the findings unpublished and the military miscreants have rarely been punished. The latest controversy began one night in 1992, at the height of the Shining Path offensive against Lima, when a group of nine students and a professor were abducted by hooded gunmen from the university of La Cantuta, not far from the capital. The 10 were shot, their bodies dismembered, burned and buried, to be unearthed more than a year later. Few doubt that armed forces and intelligence service personnel carried out the killings. There are allegations, however, that assassination orders came from the highest levels - General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, President Fujimori's powerful chief intelligence adviser. The allegations have been supported by General Rodolfo Robles, Peru's third-ranking army officer, who fled the country last year. A dispute over who should investigate the killings has dragged on since April last year. Initiatives by the then newly installed congress to call military witnesses were pre-empted when Gen Hermoza brought his tanks on to the streets of Lima and warned elected representatives against meddling in purely internal army matters. Then the army began its own inquiry behind closed doors. The political manoeuvring last week, involving all three branches of government, is just a slightly more subtle move to prevent Gen Hermoza and Mr Montesinos being called to give evidence at the end of this month. A US state department declaration regretted the move and urged the Peruvian government 'to show total respect for the separation of powers and judicial autonomy enshrined in the new constitution'. Human rights are high on the US-Peruvian bilateral agenda. Although disappearances and extra-judicial killings have fallen steadily since 1992, several influential US congressmen have insisted on blocking economic assistance earmarked for Peru until progress is made on cases such as the La Cantuta incident. Now the Dollars 105m Peru was hoping to see disbursed in the wake of a generally friendly recent visit by Mr Alexander Watson, US assistant secretary of state for Latin America, is certain to be withheld, placing further strain on a tight 1994 budget. Even more damaging, analysts warn, is the dissuasive effect on intending foreign investors of this arbitrary judicial move. In times of strong subversive threat, Peruvians have been inclined to tolerate the existence of one law for the military and one for the rest. Those times may be drawing to a close. 'The military must never again run the country, either overtly or covertly,' says Ms Flores Nano. 'We cannot and will not accept a democracy under their tutelage.'</p>

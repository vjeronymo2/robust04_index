			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: 1/2 SLAYER "SEASONS IN THE ABYSS" DEF AMERICAN  </P> <P> In the beginning, there were Metallica and Slayer, and only Metallica and  Slayer, the two giants of new American metal. If Metallica was the Beatles of  the genre, the guys who made heavy rock respectable again, Slayer was the  Rolling Stones: dark, violent and nasty, fascinated with evil, the favorite  group of every bad kid in suburbia (that was Slayer blasting out of the tape  decks in "River's Edge").  </P> <P> Slayer was the most extreme band anybody could think of, and the most intense  stage performers in the world.  </P> <P> Over time, thousands ofother bands copied the Slayer formula, many of them  playing even faster than Slayer, and others -- Carcass, Napalm Death -- relying  on more violent imagery. Slayer slowed things down on its last album, and a lot  of the other bands did too, but sludge-metal had the feeling of an artistic  dead end.  </P> <P> This time out, instead of being imitated, Slayer is imitating, sort of, the  logical direction taken by Metallica when that band evolved from the pure  thrash of "Kill 'Em All." On "Seasons in the Abyss," by far the most accessible  Slayer opus, the songs are riffy instead of droning, the vocals toned down from  howls to snarls, the emphasis shifted from thrash to rock. It's not quite as  impressive as '87's "Reign in Blood," one of the best two or three metal  records ever made, but maybe they'll finally sell more albums than T-shirts.  JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

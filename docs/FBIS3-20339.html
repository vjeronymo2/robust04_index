			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roland-Pierre Paringaux: "The Republican Party's </F> Secret Accounts"]    [Excerpt] Suitcases of banknotes, secret funds, forged  accounts, secret contributions by large companies, and the  ambiguous role of Republican Party (PR) leaders, including three  serving ministers: Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, whose  investigations led him to study the funding of the PR, has just  informed the Rennes Public Prosecutor's Office in writing about  information which could well provide the Right with its URBA  [urban transportation project which was abandoned] scandal.    Indeed, aside from Jean-Pierre Thomas, deputy for les Vosges  and PR treasurer, who has been at the forefront of this scandal  for six months, the document handed to Rennes Public Prosecutor  Jacques Brun on 24 March mentions the names of Gerard Longuet,  president of the PR and industry minister; Francois Leotard,  honorary president of the PR and defense minister; and Alain  Madelin, vice president of the PR and minister of enterprises  and economic development. Their names appear in connection with  financial and property transactions that may result in criminal  charges of forgery, misuse of public property, and influence  peddling. The four-page report drawn up by Renaud Van Ruymbeke  brings to the attention of the Rennes public prosecutor, and the  justice minister, facts which the judge discovered during his  investigations, although they do not come directly within his  sphere of competence.

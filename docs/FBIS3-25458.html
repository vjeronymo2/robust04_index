			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 16 Feb (PANA) -- An Israeli company is  to train Congo's special forces and the president's security  guards, the Congolese interior minister, Martin Mberri,  confirmed on Wednesday [16 February]. He told a press  conference in Brazzaville that the government and the Israeli  company, which he declined to identify, had signed an accord for  the training. Mberri said the Israeli experts were already in  Congo. He said the Israeli experts, who are already in the  central African country, will "help the Congolese public force  adapt to the new demands of democracy."    The Israeli press recently reported that the Brazzaville  government had signed an agreement with an Israeli firm,  "Levdan," specializing in the sale of arms. The Israeli Defence  Ministry, it said, gave its approval for the conclusion of the  50 million-dollar contract which also includes the training of  senior officers in the Congolese Army.    In a statement issued on Sunday in Brazzaville, the  Congolese  opposition described the accord as "criminal" and a waste of  money. The 30 billion CFA contract sum as given by Israeli  sources, the opposition said, was two years pay for 8,000  workers that the government is about to lay off. It said the  accord also "conflicts with the dynamics of peace initiated in  Congo".    The opposition warned the government against the  "consequences on the foreign community, especially whites,  because of the confusion which would be generated by a popular  resistance against repression." However, Mberri defended the  accord saying the government took "a special credit" for the  programme. "The agreement is normal. It will allow the public  force to have new aptitudes and promptly respond to the new  forms of contest," Mberri said, stressing that the Armed Forces  and police have not succeeded in ending recent ethnic clashes.  Mberri revealed that other countries, like France, had agreed  to train and assist the Congolese Army, Gendarmerie and police.  He said that the government was planning "to revitalise the  ageing Army and police cadres."    On the deployment of a buffer force in the quarters of  south-west Brazzaville which have been the areas of factional  fighting, the minister said it would be deployed on Sunday,  after delays due to technical, logistic and financial problems.</p>

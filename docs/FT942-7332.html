			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Poll leaders face up to pitfalls: Labour's popularity has a downside This is the election Labour cannot lose, but may not win. Even Conservative strategists admit privately that Labour will add to the 45 seats it holds in the outgoing European parliament. But the party's campaign managers are painfully aware of the dangers in being so far ahead. Before the formal opening of the campaign on Monday, Labour's senior officials spent much time trying to douse expectations that the party would win at least 60 of the 84 seats in mainland Britain. It was all to no avail. An opinion poll by ICM in the Daily Express newspaper predicts that Labour will win 61 seats; Mr David Butler, the Oxford University psephologist, forecasts a haul of between 52 and 66. Against this background, a result that gave Labour fewer than 60 seats would look disappointing, while a haul of fewer than 50 would cast doubts on the party's ability to translate its opinion-poll lead into support in the voting booths. Labour's strategy is to maximise support by fighting a twin-track campaign focusing on the government's domestic record and its difficulties over Britain's place in Europe. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting party leader, signalled the shape of the campaign at the party's first election press conference when she spent as much time on domestic issues such as tax, crime and health as she did on Europe. When Labour does talk about European issues, it is largely in terms of the government's record: the embarrassing about-turn by Mr John Major, the prime minister, on qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers; the government's failure to take up European Union funds to combat fraud; the cost of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy. The party has blunted Conservative attacks on its own commitment to Europe by insisting on the retention of the British veto in important areas, and by proposing radical reforms of the CAP - the EU's most expensive programme. But it is less keen to discuss its own approach to thorny issues such as the scope of reforms to EU institutions at the 1996 inter-governmental conference and the possibility of a referendum on the next steps to economic and monetary union. Labour's hope is that its robust defence of the British national interest in Europe will make it easier for disgruntled Conservatives to register a protest vote against the government. The big danger, especially in the south of England, is that maverick Tories will switch to the Liberal Democrats. To combat that possibility, Labour has resurrected the 'wasted vote' argument that has served it well in successive general elections. Tactical voting worked largely in favour of the Liberal Democrats in the May local elections. But if its strategy succeeds, Labour could win Conservative seats - including London north-west and south-east, Lincolnshire and South Humberside, Norfolk, and Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes. It has hopes, too, in a batch of southern and Midlands Tory seats which could go to any of the three main parties. These include Hertfordshire, Kent East, Hampshire North and Oxford, Sussex South, the Cotswolds and Hereford and Shropshire. In Hertfordshire, the Liberal Democrats are mounting a strong challenge on the back of a good performance in the local elections. Labour activists in the constituencies are less circumspect about the party's chances than the cautious officials in London. For example, the Conservatives have held Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes for 15 years. Yet local Labour campaigners believe the party may win as much as 41.3 per cent of the vote in the constituency, with the Tories on 33 per cent. Labour is also benefiting from the emergence of anti-Europe candidates, such as the 24 standing for the UK Independence party. Such candidates will almost certainly cream off some votes which would otherwise have gone to the Conservatives. Local activists say another factor is emerging - a surge of sympathy for the party after the death of John Smith, which has galvanised local supporters into canvassing for Labour. More important, it may help ensure that a high proportion of Labour supporters turn out on polling day. That could be the key to victory. But it is a factor Labour would rather have done without.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by George Jones, political editor: "Britain Is </F> Ready, Major Confirms"]    [Text] Mr Major signalled the Government's readiness last  night to support a NATO ultimatum -- backed up by the threat of  air strikes -- for the withdrawal of Serbian guns shelling  Sarajevo.    Shortly before an emergency meeting of the Cabinet's  Overseas  and Defence Committee to consider the options for military  intervention, Mr Major told MPs the Government was prepared to  see air power used "provided the commanders judge it  appropriate."    But he stressed at question-time in the Commons:  "Ultimately,  peace is only going to come at the negotiating table."    Mr Major summoned senior ministers, including Mr Rifkind,  Defence Secretary, who returned from visiting British troops in  Bosnia yesterday, to Downing Street last night.    They were briefed by the military chiefs of staff on the  feasibility of air strikes to destroy Serbian guns which have  been bombarding Sarajevo and are thought to have been  responsible for the weekend's market massacre.    Britain has previously adopted a cautious approach towards  air strikes, fearing they would not prevent the shelling while  leaving United Nations soldiers, including the British  contingent of 3,000, open to reprisals from the Bosnian Serb  forces.    But ministers believe events have reached a "turning point"  and that the UN's credibility will be damaged if it does not  intervene to prevent the slaughter in Sarajevo. Military  chiefs, while still dubious about the effectiveness of  intervention, acknowledge that there may now be overriding  diplomatic reasons to threaten air strikes.    Mr Major acknowledged that the mortar and artillery attacks  on Sarajevo could not await an overall settlement.    The UN forces in Bosnia, with support from NATO, had to  apply  immediate and strong pressure to halt those attacks.    The UN, he said, might need to use force for specific  purposes, to carry out its mandate and protect its own people in  Bosnia. "It may need tactical air support from NATO. We have  always been prepared to see air power used for these purposes,  provided the commanders judge it appropriate."    Mr Major said NATO would meet today to consider what  pressure  can most effectively be applied. But he stressed that if air  power was used, they must be very clear about the objectives of  that action.    The meeting of the Cabinet's Overseas and Defence Committee  lasted two hours 20 minutes, much longer than expected.    Although ministers agreed to back NATO plans for an  ultimatum to the Serbs, there was a lengthy discussion over  contingency plans for ensuring the protection of British and  other UN troops in Bosnia against possible reprisals.</p>

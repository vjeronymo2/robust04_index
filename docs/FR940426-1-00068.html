			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) In those cases in which the indebtedness of a military member has been reduced to a judgment, an application for an involuntary allotment from the disposable pay of the member may be made pursuant to the procedures described in appendix A to this part. These procedures provide the exclusive remedy available under Public Law 103&hyph;94. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Involuntary allotment requests will not be processed for creditors who, either at the time of application for the involuntary allotment or at the time the debt was incurred that forms the basis for the court judgment, are in an ``off-limits'' status, or who have been determined to be practicing unfair consumer or commercial practices detrimental to the morale and welfare of service members, pursuant to applicable directives of the military services, to include the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board and Off-Installation Liaison and Operations regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An involuntary allotment from a member's disposable pay shall not be commenced in any indebtedness case in which: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Exigencies of military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding at which the judgment was rendered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) There has not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the SSCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Only one involuntary allotment pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part may be authorized from the disposable pay of a member at any given time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An involuntary allotment shall not exceed the lesser of 15 percent of a member's disposable pay, or the maximum amount authorized under the garnishment law of the State where the judgment was entered. An involuntary allotment shall not be authorized if the pay of a similarly situated civilian employee is not subject to garnishment under the applicable State law and Public Law 103&hyph;94. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The amount of an involuntary allotment under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part when combined with deductions as a result of garnishments or statutory allotments for spousal support and child support under 42 U.S.C. 659, 661, 662, or 665, may not exceed the maximum percentage specified in 15 U.S.C. 1673. In any case in which the maximum percentage would be exceeded, garnishments and involuntary allotments for spousal and child support shall take precedence over involuntary allotments authorized under Public Law 103&hyph;94 and this part. Involuntary allotments established pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;94 shall be reduced or stopped as necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum percentage allowed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=3 --> &sect;50.6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=3 --> Full disclosure and standards of fairness by creditors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Truth in Lending Act prescribes the general disclosure requirements which must be met by those offering or extending consumer credit, and 12 CFR part 226 prescribes the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and installment credit transactions. In place of Federal Government requirements, State regulations apply to credit transactions when the Federal Reserve Board has determined that the State regulations impose substantially similar requirements and provide adequate enforcement measures. Commanding officers, with the assistance of judge advocates, should check regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether Federal or State laws and regulations govern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Appendix A to Part 50_Processing Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 --> A.

Creditors subject to 12 CFR part 226, and assignees claiming thereunder, shall submit with their request for debt processing assistance an executed copy of the Certificate of Compliance (appendix B to this part), and a true copy of the general and specific disclosures provided the military member as required by the Truth in Lending Act. Requests which do not meet these requirements will be returned without action to the claimant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A creditor not subject to 12 CFR part 226, such as a public utility company (as set forth in &sect;226.3 thereof), shall submit with the request a certification that no interest, finance charge, or other fee is in excess of that permitted by the law of the State in which the obligation was incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

Involuntary allotments will not be authorized without evidence of actual service. In cases where jurisdiction was obtained by substituted service (such as service by publication or by mailing to a last known address), or where the judgment was entered on a confession of judgment, no involuntary allotment will be authorized and the application will be returned to the creditor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Applications for involuntary allotment, must contain the following information, certifications, and acknowledgment: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The full name, social security number, and branch of service of the military member against whose disposable pay an involuntary allotment is sought.

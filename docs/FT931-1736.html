			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Union vote Sir, Mr Julian Smith's example (Letters, March 19) of the ludicrous results possible under the German system of proportional representation should not blind anyone to the obvious merits of the single transferrable vote. This preserves constituencies and ensures that the most popular candidate wins the seat. It is happily accepted and works well in the Oxford and Cambridge Unions.

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Taiwan group plans Pounds 26m plant CMC Magnetics Corporation, one of Taiwan's largest electronics companies, yesterday announced it is to set up a Pounds 26m floppy-disk production plant in Cramlington, Northumberland, creating 550 jobs over three years. The plant will receive Pounds 8.25m in Regional Selective Assistance and is expected to have an annual output of 120m disks. The project is the fifth manufacturing investment from Taiwan in the UK and the third in Northumberland. Mr John Bridge, chief executive of Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body, said: 'We've got a leading edge and we intend to keep it.' The decision by CMC's subsidiary Europa Magnetic Corporation to site the plant in north-east England would give a strong signal to other Taiwanese companies, he said. The main rival for the project was the Irish Republic. CMC holds 10 per cent of the world market for floppy disks and is also a large producer of videotape. Cramlington will be its first big manufacturing plant outside Taiwan. Mr Wilfred Sing, CMC's UK accountant, said the rationale behind the plant was to replace Far East imports with European-made goods. CMC has not yet decided its policy on union representation at Cramlington. Production starts in the autumn at the plant, an English Estates factory built to attract inward investment. A hundred jobs will be created in the first year.</p>

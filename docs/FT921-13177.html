			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Survey of Cheshire (7): New way of training - A scheme to replace apprenticeships TRADITIONAL apprentice- ships have been abolished in parts of Cheshire. The move is not a retrograde step because what is being done instead looks like becoming a model of best practice which is already spreading locally and may well spread wider, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. It began 18 months ago as an experimental joint venture to improve the quality and calibre of young technicians and chemical process operators. ICI Chemicals and Polymers, Shell and Associated Octel launched a new type of 'technical studentship' for trainees aged 16 to 18. The idea was to combine a broader range of full-time education and industrial training than traditional apprenticeships could offer. It also recognised that as big companies have invested in labour-saving plant and pared payrolls to raise productivity, they have less scope to run in-house training economically. Although still in its early stages, the Cheshire experiment is well on its way to getting most of its participants to the higher-level qualification of the Business and Technical Education Council (BTEC) in four years. This is 18 months quicker than many traditional apprentices have been able to achieve by mixing on-the-job learning with block or day release to the local technical college and attendance at night school. The three chemicals companies set up a new company called Technical Training Enterprise (TTE) in 1990. It is based at West Cheshire College, Ellesmere Port, where half of the new four-year course will be spent in full-time education. The companies initially planned to set up their own training school, but were persuaded that better-rounded people would emerge if their trainees were educated in a larger pool of young people and were able to mix with students on other courses. So they put up Pounds 400,000 of cash and equipment for laboratories and workshops at the college, as well as installing their own staff to ensure that all aspects of education and training are integrated and relevant. Some teaching is also done by college staff. The first intake of 90 technical students - all employed by TTE but sponsored by one or other of the companies, came from a rush of 700 applicants from school-leavers, in spite of organisers having only a few weeks to get their initial promotion off the ground. Mr Peter Hyam, engineering manager of ICI in the area, is TTE's chairman. He says that the three companies decided they had to have a long-term view of the chemicals industry's needs. As well as achieving economies of scale and getting trainees up to the ever-higher standards needed by an increasingly capital-intensive industry, the scheme has enabled the companies to get rid of things they did not like about traditional apprenticeships, such as duplication of teaching, irrelevance and lack of integration with the needs of the workplace. 'Other companies have now asked us to train people for them and technical colleges have expressed interest in using the scheme as a model for their own courses,' Mr Hyam says. 'This has encouraged us to expand the idea into other fields, for example, into retraining and developing skills in the existing adult population.' Strong support comes from the Chester, Ellesmere Port and Wirral Training and Enterprise Council (Cewtec), which is chaired by Mr Nick Reilly, plant director of Vauxhall Motors at Ellesmere Port. 'The Tec is looking to spread this as best practice into other sectors this year. Chester's hoteliers have already started a similar scheme, involving 33 trainees each year,' Mr Reilly says. While many of the big hotel groups have long had effective training schemes, similar standards are more difficult to achieve for smaller, independent establishments, for which costs - especially when compared with retention rates - are a bigger problem. Chester's growing hotels sector decided it was in the interests of all the city's hotels to ensure as high a minimum training standard as possible and create a pool of better-skilled service sector workers. The result is a scheme where college training, as with TTE, is pooled, creating economies of scale which make training more efficient for the big hotels and more affordable for the small ones. Two days of each week are spent at college, three in a hotel - and the trainees swap between hotels, so that their practical experience is not confined to their sponsoring employer. 'These are working examples of industry taking training seriously,' Mr Reilly says. Vauxhall, his own company, is another: it is sharing its engineering apprenticeship training with British Nuclear Fuels. More importantly longer-term, half-a-dozen smaller companies will soon be joining in. Of three Tecs in Cheshire, Cewtec may have the most difficult job because it operates in the west of the county, where it is affected by the ailing Merseyside economy. 'It was originally thought there was no problem in Cheshire when compared with Wirral, but that view is changing,' says Mr Alan Moody, Cewtec's chief executive. Cheshire's problem is structural change. Big business dominated Ellesmere Port, in particular, and for decades was responsible for the bulk of craft and technician training. Vauxhall is a prime example of what capital-intensification does to a company: there were 11,000 employees in 1980, but there are under 5,000 now. This is not part of a rundown, for investment in a new engine plant and other parts of the works is running at Pounds 350m. 'But Cheshire cannot depend on its big companies for growth in jobs,' Mr Reilly says. 'We need more growth from smaller companies and more inward investment. Teaching small companies to survive and grow through business planning - and by training their supervisors and managers - is essential, just as it is also our job to ensure that there is a trained workforce available for incomers.' With his Tec's board full of local chief executives from the engineering, nuclear, electrical, shipping, food and chemicals industries, a vigorous, self-determined approach seems assured.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILLS PUSHED TO LET GOVERNOR NAME AIDES TO 3 TOP JOBS  </P> <P> Legislation that would allow Gov. George Deukmejian to appoint top aides to  three high-paying patronage jobs near the end of his term without Senate  confirmation appeared headed for final approval in the closing hours of the  1989 legislative session.  </P> <P> In addition, the Legislature approved a bill that would allow  lawyer-legislators who put their Bar Assn. membership on inactive status to  qualify for judicial appointments.  </P> <P> The jobs in question -- judgeships and positions on full-time state boards --  are regarded as political plums, and the appointments are jealously guarded  prerogatives of gubernatorial power.  </P> <P> Changing the rules for the appointments was part of the last-minute  horse-trading as the Legislature moved toward its Friday recess.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Golden Parachutes'  </P> <P> Some Democratic lawmakers complained bitterly that the Republican governor  would be able to appoint three members of his personal staff to $85,000-a-year  jobs without Senate confirmation. The positions were variously described as  "golden parachutes" or "soft-landing pads" for Deukmejian staffers who will  likely lose their jobs when a new governor takes office in January of 1991.  (Deukmejian announced earlier this year that he would not run for a third  term.)  </P> <P> Deukmejian Administration officials deny that the governor will use his  appointment powers to provide jobs for particular members of his personal  staff.  </P> <P> "The governor has not even focused on those appointments," Deukmejian Press  Secretary Kevin Brett said. "It would be premature to even speculate about who  would fill them."  </P> <P> Deukmejian himself had no comment on rumors that he had specific staff members  in mind for the posts.  </P> <P> Similarly, Democratic legislative leaders deny that the bill that clarifies a  state constitutional restriction on judicial appointments was intended to aid  any specific legislators who would like to be appointed as judges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broad Powers  </P> <P> Two of the Deukmejian appointments that are outside the review of the Senate  would be to a new, full-time solid waste management board with broad powers  over local governments' trash disposal and recycling efforts. The appointments  were negotiated by Deukmejian and legislative leaders, who would also be able  to name members to the board.  </P> <P> The third job would be a seat on the Public Employment Relations Board.  Republican Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia) amended a bill to allow Deukmejian to  fill a position on that board without Senate confirmation. The job becomes  vacant in November, 1990, two months before Deukmejian is due to leave office.  </P> <P> Several legislative sources who asked not to be named said that Deukmejian  officials were "unabashed" about wanting to use the appointments to reward  Deukmejian Administration stalwarts.  </P> <P> Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) was one of several legislators who argued  against exempting the Deukmejian appointments from Senate confirmation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ought to Protect It'  </P> <P> "I don't see any good, valid reason why we in the Senate should give up this  prerogative," Dills said. "I think we ought to protect it and guard it as long  as we can until there is a good and sufficient reason to prove that we don't do  our job properly."  </P> <P> Davis described the exemption to Senate confirmation as a "trade-off." In  return for a one-time exemption for the Employment Relations Board post,  Deukmejian agreed to what Davis described as "a quid pro quo" -- allowing the  Senate to confirm the appointment of the chief of the State Police.  </P> <P> Davis also carried a bill that would allow a number of legislators to qualify  for judgeships under a constitutional provision requiring five years'  membership in the State Bar immediately before appointment to the Municipal  Court bench and 10 years' membership before appointment to the Superior or  Appeals courts.  </P> <P> Rather than pay annual dues of $417 a year for active Bar membership, several  legislators have chosen to switch to inactive status, which costs them $50 a  year, according to Senate Democratic Leader Barry Keene of Benicia. Keene said  he was one of those who had chosen inactive status.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutional Requirement  </P> <P> Pressed by Keene and others, Davis agreed to include language in a bill that  states that inactive membership satisfies the constitutional requirement --  clearing the way for Keene and others to be named to judgeships.  </P> <P> Davis said he expects Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson to be the next governor  of California, which would cut Keene and most other Democrats out of hope for a  judicial appointment.  </P> <P> As originally drafted, the provision applied only to legislators, members of  Congress and law professors. But Davis amended it to qualify any inactive  member of the State Bar.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix by </F> Andre Riche; place and date not given: "Delcroix Unwilling To  Give Up Bosnia"; first four paragraphs are LE SOIR introduction]    [Text] It will be a British general -- Michael Rose - who  will replace Belgium's Francis Briquemont as head of the blue  helmets deployed in Bosnia. The UN decision was made on  Wednesday [5 January].    Belgium had put forward candidates to cover the remainder of  General Briquemont's mandate, but did not insist. The custom is  that this kind of succession is between officers of different  nationalities.    General Rose is the chief of staff of the British Army. He  led the special commandos of the British Army during the  Falklands War. He will face a degree of disquiet within the  United Nations, voiced again yesterday by General Cot who is  demanding "a very firm course" in the talks on Bosnia -- it is  true that just yesterday evening, fierce fighting with heavy  weapons and automatic weapons broke out in downtown Sarajevo  and, according to blue helmet calculations, the city was hit by  a total of 1,353 shells.    Firmness? Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix shares this  view. We questioned him on the reasons for General Briquemont's  withdrawal.    [Delcroix] He is really exhausted, it is a physical reason.  That was true by mid-December. I understand him. Anybody who  has visited Bosnia and Sarajevo can see that it is difficult to  live and sleep there. General Briquemont thinks that you have  to be in good shape to make good decisions. And he thinks that  he is no longer in good shape.    [Riche] The United Nations did not intervene and request his  departure? Did the general's very critical statements not have  an effect?    [Delcroix] No, not at all. I have never received any such  request from the United Nations. If the United Nations had had  problems, it would have been its place to request his  withdrawal. I am in favor of more freedom of speech for the  military. I see nothing very bad in General Briquemont's  criticisms. He is on the ground, he sees what is happening  every day: His opinion is of interest to everybody, even if it  is not always pleasant for politicians or diplomats.    [Riche] But will this withdrawal not undermine the morale of  the 1,000 Belgian soldiers still deployed over there?    [Delcroix] There is no direct link. For instance, in  Baranja, the situation is different and morale is good. But I  admit that this withdrawal and General Briquemont's frustration  may spark off a new process, provide an impetus for seeking  other solutions.    [Riche] There is increasing talk of a general withdrawal of  the blue helmets. How can that be avoided?    [Delcroix] I have always said in good time -- from the  beginning of 1993 -- that some prospect was necessary in this  military mission. Our soldiers have been there for two years.  I do not think that we can continue like this for another two  or three years. Something must change. The April or May  deadline will be very important. It is now winter and we are  still giving the negotiations a chance. But if no new prospect  opens up in two or three months, we will think of other ways.    [Riche] Some countries are considering purely and simply  withdrawing. What would your choice be between a withdrawal or  more offensive action on the ground?    [Delcroix] We cannot all leave this country and give the  warring sides the opportunity to "solve" their problem in their  way. That would be very inhuman. It would be a total failure.  But I think that in two or three months' time, if nothing  changes, we will have to consider more strictly military  methods. But that could go hand in hand with a withdrawal of  ground troops. We will not increase offensive military means  and at the same time leave our people exposed over there.    [Riche] Are you not afraid of shortly being confronted with  the difficult decision of sending more Belgians to be killed for  Bosnia?    [Delcroix] Yes, that would be a very difficult choice. I  know that public opinion is demanding that something should be  done. Even if this impression prevails, it is wrong to think  that we are not doing anything now. We have saved many lives  and prevented many misfortunes in Baranja and in Bosnia.  Moreover, the initial fault does not rest with the Belgian or  other military, but with the local warring factions. It is also  for them to find a solution. I sometimes think that people are  too hard on the military. I am personally in favor of stepping  up the threat. The warring sides must be told that we will  react with increased means. That is the only language they  understand over there.</p>

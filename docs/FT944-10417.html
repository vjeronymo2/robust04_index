			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise on heels of dollar rally US Treasury prices rose on the heels of a rally in the dollar yesterday as traders digested the impact of strong Republican gains in Tuesday's elections and the afternoon auction of 10-year notes. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 93 11/32 , yielding 8.088 per cent and the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 3/4 to yield 6.994 per cent. Prices were volatile, first gaining on the dollar rally then dipping in the early afternoon in a bout of pre-auction jitters and then reapproaching their morning highs by late in the day after a strong auction. Demand at the auction was helped by a strengthening dollar, which rose on news that Republicans will control both houses of the US legislature. Late in the afternoon the dollar was up more than two pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM1.5276 and to Y97.75 against the yen. The recovery helps bonds because recent weakness in the currency has deterred investors from buying US securities. The reaction of the bond markets was somewhat restrained, however, as investors waited for the increase in interest rates expected to come from next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. Most analysts expect a 50 basis point increase in the Federal funds target to 5 1/4 per cent, but some are predicting the Fed might push the target as high as 5 3/4 . Traders were also waiting for today's report from the government on the producer price index. Analysts expect a 0.1 rise in the index for October, but worry that a much greater increase could provoke an early or large increase in interest rates by the Fed. European government bonds were swept up by strength in the US market and closed near their day's highs. However, they shed some of their gains in after-hours trading as Treasuries began to come off their highs. Ahead of next week's FOMC meeting, European markets are expected to continue closely tracking US developments, with today's release of October producer prices expected to be keenly watched. German bunds rose by more than  1/2 point, buoyed by the rally in US Treasuries and the smooth auction of another large chunk of the government's latest 10-year bond. The December bund future on DTB rose 0.58 to 89.98. The Bundesbank sold DM3.99bn of the 7.5 per cent bonds at 99.82 and above. The weighted average issue price was 99.84, with an average yield of 7.52 per cent. Market participants today will be watching the meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council, although most dealers said they were not expecting a change in official interest rates, nor a return to a system of variable-rate securities repurchase agreements. UK gilts followed US and European bond markets higher, with the December gilt futures contract rising by  7/16 to 101 7/16 . Most of the gains were in the futures market, however, with dealers reporting very little investor participation. Apart from awaiting the FOMC meeting, dealers are also looking to next week's raft of UK economic indicators, including retail prices and jobs data. French bonds slightly out-performed bunds, causing their yield premium over the German 10-year benchmark to fall to 69 from 71 basis points. However, political uncertainty and intra-party bickering in the right-wing camp ahead of the Presidential elections in May are likely to continue weighing on bonds in coming months, causing them to under-perform bunds, said Mr Adrian Owens, European economist at Yamaichi. 'There's only one way that spread will go,' he said, adding he expects the yield gap to widen to around 90 basis points by year-end. Italian bonds also rose sharply, buoyed by strength in other markets, the breach of key technical resistance on the BTP futures contract and recent calm on the political front. The December BTP future on Liffe rose 0.68 to 101.03.</p>

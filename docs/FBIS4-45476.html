			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stephen Dodd: "Teenage Drugs Sub-culture Survey </F> Shock"]    [Text] Six out of every 10 Dublin teenagers have been  offered illegal drugs. More than half the young people in the  city know someone who has used amphetamines or ecstasy. A  similar percentage of Ireland's youth believe they would  encounter little difficulty in finding regular suppliers of  drugs.    These disturbing discoveries come from an exclusive survey,  conducted by Irish Marketing Surveys for the SUNDAY INDEPENDENT.  The poll reveals evidence of the existence of an alarming drug  sub-culture among the teenagers of Ireland. It is the first of  its kind to examine the influence of narcotics and alcohol on  the young, and has taken its findings from a representative  sample of teenagers, aged between 15 and 17, at 58 different  towns and cities throughout the country. The survey was  rigorously controlled to ensure no bias against social groups or  classes. Irish Marketing Surveys, the country's leading  statistical analysts, are confident the results are beyond doubt.    That confidence is important, because the results of the  survey clearly demonstrate that the spread of drug and alcohol  abuse among the young has become a widespread problem in  Ireland. Our own investigations have revealed the ease with  which illegal narcotics are imported; the new poll shows the  scale of their impact.    Researchers discovered that awareness of drug-taking has  escalated to the point where it has become an important hurdle  facing adolescents. Almost half the sample group cited peer  pressure as the main reason for young people to take drugs.  Teenagers who use drugs are striving to be accepted into the  sub-culture, to fit into what they see as an intriguing and  attractive group. Others take drugs for kicks; 39 percent of  those questioned said they used drugs to feel good, to get high  or for fun. One in every four teenagers claimed they used  narcotics and alcohol to escape stress and family problems.    Perhaps most worrying is the discovery that drugs are today  readily accessible to young people. Teenagers in Dublin and  Leinster are most likely to know where to find drugs--discos,  night clubs and street dealers proved the most common  sources--while young people on Connacht and Ulster claimed drugs  were rarer. Seventy percent of Connacht/Ulster teenagers did not  know where drugs were sold in their towns.    There was a good degree of recognition of the dangers of  illegal drugs, with more than 90 percent of those questioned  believing that heroin, cocaine, crack and LSD were too dangerous  even for experimentation.    Young people appear to view alcohol in a different light,  with 35 percent of those polled believing there was no real  danger in drinking.    In Dublin, the evidence points to a higher level of drug  abuse among the young. More than half of the teenagers  questioned knew someone who had experimented with ecstasy or  amphetamines, while almost a quarter knew someone who used the  drugs regularly. One in every 10 Dublin teenagers knows at least  one heroin user.    On a positive note, it appears that 85 percent of young  people are being given drug education at school, and most of  those find the information helpful. Professional drug  counsellors are held in the highest regard among the young, with  93 percent claiming they would treat seriously any advice they  gave.    Other sources of advice and example are more alarming. One  in  five teengers admitted that hearing about pop stars' involvement  with drugs might tempt them to experiment themselves.</p>

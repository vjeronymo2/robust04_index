			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADMINISTRATION INSIDERS STICK TOGETHER IN FEBRUARY GROUP  </P> <P> A few months after he resigned, Richard M. Nixon pondered the fate of the  hundreds of former White House employees who shared his dreams, fought his  battles and were then left in the lurch by Watergate.  </P> <P> Some of them had trouble finding new jobs, having been tainted by the scandal.  And many shared an experience from inside the White House that could not really  be understood by an outsider.  </P> <P> "For a long time, those of us who had these connections were pariahs," recalled  Ken Khachigian, who began his lauded presidential speech-writing career with  Nixon. "So you found comfort and solace in being amongst your own."  </P> <P> In January, 1975, Nixon met in San Clemente with a former presidential advance  man and suggested that he keep in touch with the former White House staffers.  The following month, Dewey Clower called together 25 of them and launched the  February Group, named after the month in which its first meeting was held.  </P> <P> Tonight -- 15 years later -- the February Group is scheduled to host one of the  largest gatherings of Nixon Administration alumni since Watergate. Nixon  himself is expected to attend the cocktail reception at his presidential  library in Yorba Linda on the eve of its dedication.  </P> <P> Add all of the longtime Nixon supporters and family scheduled to attend  Thursday's dedication, and "it will probably be the real first and last  conclave of those who have been associated with Richard Nixon . . . since his  second inaugural," said Patrick J. Buchanan, a conservative political  commentator and former Nixon speech writer.  </P> <P> In Washington, where job security is often an oxymoron, an alumni association  for a presidential administration makes sense. But surprisingly, it is the  Nixon White House that has created the largest and most active such group.  </P> <P> From the 25 members who organized on Feb. 10, 1975, the group has grown to  include a mailing list of more than 600, including many members of the Ford and  Reagan administrations.  </P> <P> In fact, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, Clower said, the White  House used the February Group mailing list to locate potential staff. And the  group became big enough that columnist Jack Anderson once called it a  "government in exile."  </P> <P> Today, the February Group meets twice a year, usually for an evening of  socializing over cocktails with about 100 to 150 people at a Washington hotel.  </P> <P> The February Group is essentially dedicated to maintaining a network that Nixon  established as early as his 1968 presidential campaign. To do that, it hosts  the cocktail hours, and from a desktop computer, Clower publishes a periodic  newsletter with updates on the lives of group members.  </P> <P> Clower gladly points out what the group is not -- it does not have a political  agenda, it is not for fund raising and it is not even well-organized, he says.  </P> <P> "It's a loose-knit organization: no dues, no officers," Clower said. "It's  basically just a time for people to get together; it's who is where, who has  had babies, who got married, who has a new job."  </P> <P> Most of the members, especially those who remain active, are middle-level Nixon  White House staffers whose names never reached the newspapers. The former  President's favorite barber, Milt Pitts, is among them.  </P> <P> But Nixon's top officers and Cabinet members are also on the February Group  rolls. Former chief of staff H.R. Haldeman belongs, as does appointments  secretary Dwight Chapin and aide John Erlichman.  </P> <P> "It's for people who worked together and have stayed in touch or have a chance  to renew friendships," said Ron Ziegler, Nixon's press secretary and a group  member. "I think almost everyone who served in those years is on the (mailing)  list."  </P> <P> Erlichman, now a novelist who lives in Santa Fe, N.M., reportedly sent a letter  to one February Group gathering that said: "Sorry I can't be there. I'll be  doing something elsewhere." He was in jail at the time in connection with  Watergate.  </P> <P> Watergate may have been partly responsible for the cohesion of the former Nixon  employees -- at least at first. But Clower also said the Nixon White House was  simply a tighter group than most.  </P> <P> "I worked briefly in the Ford Administration and I think the Nixon people were  closer together," Clower said. "I think the times probably had something to do  with it. It is well known that a lot of people had difficulty finding jobs, and  perhaps things like that draw people together.  </P> <P> "There are times when I just want to drop this (February Group activity), but  then people call up and they really want to keep it going."  </P> <P> Khachigian also said the camaraderie among Nixon's staff is unique.  </P> <P> "The February Group is the Nixon guys who, sort of out the ashes of his  resignation, said, 'Hey, we ain't down, let's stick together.' " he said. "I  call it a sort of gathering of the clan. There's a lot of war stories to be  told."  </P> <P> As for the future of the February Group, Clower said he's uncertain whether it  will dissolve with the aging of the Nixon staff or whether it will evolve into  something bigger.  </P> <P> "Maybe it will continue," he said. "It really has become a group for Republican  administrations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Who's Coming . . .  </P> <P> Patrick J.

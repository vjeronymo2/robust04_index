			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec "prepared </F> by" Jan Bednar; place and date not given: "Our Recipe for  Reform Is `Quicker and Simpler'"]    [Text] Following the recent elections in Hungary, the  Czech Republic is the last country in the former Eastern bloc in  which the left has not yet come to power. We asked Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec to assess the elections in Hungary:    [Zieleniec] The Hungarian elections and their course and  results reflect the complexity of the changes taking place in  Central and East Europe. I think that the consistency of  government policy in the Czech Republic will stand out better  against these elections and also against the elections in the  other countries of Central Europe. Although we have a distinct  "plotted" course, a direction in which our state's  transformation should proceed, we are also pursuing a policy  that will not lead to social tension and social crises. I think  that it is terribly important that the outlook, which a state  undergoing our country's kind of transformation has, is clear  and credible to the voter. On the other hand, the chosen path  must be viable. And there are things a responsible politician  must know how to balance. He must know how to maintain  credibility even under the conditions of complex political  decisionmaking, which concerns not only the far-off vision but  also the immediate future. Perhaps this sounds a little like  praising our policy to the skies. But, believe me, during the  whole of the period I have been in politics, our discussions  have always concentrated on how to go straight after our vision  of society and, at the same time, maintain the prospect of  realizing this vision. This means, among other things,  conducting the kind of policy that will not bring about an  upsurge in left-wing forces, especially the extreme left wing.    [CESKY DENIK] The Hungarian elections, in which the  socialists triumphed, will certainly mean a slowdown in the  reforms in Hungary or, in any case, a shift from a more  right-wing policy to a more left-wing one. We have already seen  something like this in Poland and elsewhere to the east of our  republic. Do you have the impression that we are now isolated?    [Zieleniec] I would not say that we are isolated. I would  like to emphasize one thing: The vision is important for us, as  I have said, and we must measure our path toward it by our  potential. It is the same for the parties now in power in  Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia--their vision is important to  them, and they are choosing the means to achieve it. From the  short-term point of view--that is, for this day, month, and  year--the differences between the Polish, the Slovak, and the  Hungarian, and also, to a certain extent, our policies, do not  have to be of a fundamental nature. Political differences tend  to crop up in the longer-term outlook. If we take economic  development, differences will perhaps crop up in two or four  years, not in a few months.    [CESKY DENIK] The differences between the states will not  perhaps be of a fundamental nature, but our republic will  obviously proceed faster in transformation than Poland or  Hungary...    [Zieleniec] This is the situation regardless. The principle  methodical approach for our reform was always the endeavor to  proceed as fast and as simply as possible. Speed is important  because the faster we leave the transformation stage, the faster  we rid ourselves of its burdens. Otherwise, there is a danger  that these burdens will turn into an avalanche that will crash  down on reform. Simplicity is important from the point of view  of social acceptance of reform. It is possible to think up all  sorts of complex privatization procedures that, in certain  theoretical considerations, may be a bit more convenient. On  the other hand, however, the transparency and intelligibility,  for example, of coupon privatization have made it politically  acceptable to our voters, as opposed to the very complicated,  often dubious privatization schemes being applied in other  countries. From this point of view, the policy of "quickly and  simply" is a recipe we stand by.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Jail sentence in Guinness probe Mr Thomas Ward, the US attorney who advised Guinness on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, has been sentenced to six months in prison for not co-operating with the continuing Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the Pounds 2.7bn bid battle. Mr Ward, who is in the US, was sentenced last month by the High Court in his absence after he did not comply with DTI requests to give evidence to inspectors. He was acquitted at the Old Bailey last year of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness.</p>

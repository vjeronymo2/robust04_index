			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk 26 April TASS -- Belarus does not have  economic conditions for the introduction of a national currency  and its security, Belarussian Vice-Premier and Minister of  Economy Syarhey Linh told a news conference here today.    In his opinion, when introducing a national currency "one  should avoid the mistakes of Commonwealth nations whose  currencies collapsed within several weeks". This measure  requires a hard currency reserve or a gold stock equal to  $500-700 million, which Belarus does not have.    "That is why, we have so far decided on the Russian ruble.  Time will show," said Linh.    Asked whether the treaty on unification of Russian and  Belarussian monetary systems violates the Belarussian  Constitution, Parliament Speaker Mechyslaw Hryb said the  juridical service of the Belarussian Supreme Soviet has made the  following conclusion on the basis of the republican  constitution: "An article of the Belarussian fundamental law on  the Belarussian National Bank says it shall have the right to  monetary emission but there is no indication of the currency  unit. It can be either Belarussian money or money of any other  state."</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Injunction threat silences Frogmore A row over the latest valuation of Southend Properties has been silenced after Southend threatened to seek an injunction against Frogmore Estates, the target of its Pounds 130m bid. Frogmore was quoted in the press last week saying that sample valuations of Southend's portfolio indicated a 30 per cent fall in value, compared with the 8 per cent fall in value that Southend announced at the time of its bid. This estimate was based on information sent to Frogmore by Southend before the offer was announced. After Southend threatened to seek an injunction, Frogmore made a temporary undertaking not to make use of this information. As as result, it said it could not confirm or deny its previous claim.</p>

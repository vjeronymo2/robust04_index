In an interview with Interfax on Friday, he declined to  comment on the legal aspects of Tbilisi's decision but stressed  that "it is for the people of Abkhazia rather than for the  parliament of Georgia -- an aggressor country -- to decide on  Abkhazia's future."    Meanwhile, the Abkhazi lawmaker Yuriy Voronov has remarked  in  an interview with Interfax: "Georgia's parliament could just as  well dismiss U.S. Congress or Russian parliament."    The Abkhazi legislator Lev Damenia, for his part, argues  that  "the Georgian parliament's resolution reaffirms that republic's  further reliance on force as a means to resolve the Abkhazi  issue."    Yet another Abkhazi lawmaker Vladimir Zantaria has suggested  that "the decision was undoubtedly prompted by Georgia's desire  to set up an international administration in Abkhazia, but that  would be occupation already."    Abkhazia's First Deputy Premier, lawmaker Leonid Lakerbaya,  has declared that "any decision to deploy peace-keepers in  Abkhazia would be possible only within the framework of the  Geneva accords. The decision testifies to Georgia's rejection of  constructive political dialogue," he said.    An Interfax correspondent polled 53 Sukhumi residents on  Friday. All respondents declared that the decision was illegal.  85 percent of them regard it as a step toward renewed fighting.</p>

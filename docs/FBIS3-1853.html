The city's 13.49 million long-term residents consume about  2,000 tons of vegetables a day.    According to Meng Jianzhu, deputy mayor of the city,  Shanghai  will increase the area of farmland under vegetables by 2,530 ha  [hectares] this year, to bring the total vegetable-growing area  to 10,000 ha.    According to Meng, the city plans to build a chain of  vegetable and nonstaple-food markets and fairs, and encourage  farmers to directly sell their products in urban areas.    A survey shows that the rapid expansion of urban industry  has  resulted in serious encroachment on farmland in recent years,  causing shortages of vegetables in the local markets.</p>

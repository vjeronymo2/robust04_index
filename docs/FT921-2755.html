			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Decline in naira checks Paterson Zochonis A SHARP fall in the Nigerian naira held back profits of Paterson Zochonis, the manufacturer of Cussons Imperial Leather soap, which yesterday reported a small advance in interim profits from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.6m. Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said a 40 per cent decline in the value of the naira in recent weeks had sliced more than Pounds 1m from pre-tax profits for the six months to November 30. Profits were further depressed by a 10 per cent decline in investment income to Pounds 7.4m, due to lower interest rates. Mr Whittaker said that in spite of the lower investment income, and barring further falls in the naira, he expected the group to report full-year profits in line with 1990's Pounds 25.4m. The interim profits were struck on turnover up from Pounds 108.5m to Pounds 113.9m. Operating profits rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.03m, boosted by an improved contribution from the edible oils business in Greece and the closure of loss-making businesses in Senegal and the Ivory Coast. Africa accounts for about 25 per cent of the group's business, and Mr Whittaker said Paterson had improved there in both volume and local currency profits. However, when the return was translated at recent exchange rates, profits had suffered. Trading in the UK continued to be difficult, with severe pressure on both sales and margins. 'It is as hard as ever as far as we are concerned,' said Mr Whittaker. Nevertheless, the UK division had maintained profits. The group ended the first half with Pounds 140m in cash and soft currency bank overdrafts of Pounds 40m. Mr Whittaker said the group continued to look for appropriate acquisition opportunities in the soap and personal care sector. 'The problem has been that prices have been high with a high goodwill content,' he said. Paterson was meanwhile concentrating on developing its existing businesses. Earnings per share rose from 13.76p to 14.22p. The interim dividend raised from 2.15p to 2.25p.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Minister warns of 'electronic pollution' 'ELECTROMAGNETIC pollution' can kill, a UK industry minister warned yesterday. Mr Edward Leigh, trade and technology minister, has not been converted to the controversial theory that electric fields, for example from power lines, directly damage human health. But spelled out a catalogue of accidents caused by radiation leaking from electrical and communications equipment and interfering with sensitive electronic components. The minister was launching a campaign to help companies satisfy a new European Community directive on 'electromagnetic compatibility'. Among the disasters he listed were: A UK worker died when a computer-controlled crane dropped its load prematurely. In Japan, robots went out of control and killed two human operators in a robotics factory. In Germany, anti-lock braking mechanisms suddenly came into operation on cars speeding along an autobahn as a result of interference from a powerful radio transmitter five miles away. Mr Leigh said the EC directive was intended both to remove technical trade barriers and as an environmental measure to combat 'electronic smog'. Every electrical and electronics manufacturer will have to ensure that its products meet strict limits on electromagnetic interference. The complex rules become mandatory in January 1996. For the next three years, as the electronics and communications industries continue to grow, European governments are hoping that voluntary compliance will prevent the electronic smog becoming any more dense.</p>

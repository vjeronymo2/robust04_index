			<p>BFN     [Text] With its customary warmth and hospitality, Santiago  de Cuba welcomed Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who for  nine hours visited this city accompanied by Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina. Escorted by Esteban Lazo, Politburo  member and first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in  Santiago de Cuba Province, President Chiluba and his delegation  honored Jose Marti at the Santa Efigenia Cemetery. The  delegation visited the Antonio Maceo Revolutionary Plaza, the  Center for African Culture, and toured the museums of the  Siboney farm [Granjita Siboney] and the former Moncada Barracks.    Frederick Chiluba also visited the Santiago Hotel, Cuba's  first five-star hotel, and Santiago de Cuba's modern hospital  which has capacity for more than 1,000 beds, which since its  opening has treated 500,000 patients in 28 different specialties.    [Begin recording, in English with superimposed translations  into Spanish] [Reporter] Mr. President, which have been the main  topics of your conversations with the Cuban government?    [Chiluba] That we share a lot in common as members of the  Nonaligned Movement and, of course, of the Third World. We face  similar economic difficulties and therein lies the need for us  to cooperate. Because of the very heavy social investments made  in the fields of health and education, we have benefited  tremendously. There are Cuban people working in our country who  are helping to improve the living standard of our comrades  there. So I think our coming here is intended further to  strengthen the relations between the two countries. We consider  it a matter of life or death that small nations need to  cooperate and move together to be able to face a bigger world.  We are happy to be here.    [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. [end  recording]    At this moment, Frederick Chiluba and his official  delegation  are on their way back to Havana after having met with Zambian  students who reside here in Santiago de Cuba.</p>

Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for  international trade, told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of  Japan, "It is no secret that these negotiations are moving  slowly, no secret that the U.S. and Japan are extremely far  apart on virtually all the issues."    Garten said that while the U.S. is looking for ways to  measure progress and concrete results in the opening of Japan's  markets, Japanese negotiators want to focus on process and  further studies, resisting the setting of any measuring criteria.    He said the question of measurement, however it is defined,  is certainly seen differently by Japanese negotiators and the  U.S. side.    As to auto trade, a priority sector of the framework talks,  Garten said, "There is not even an agreement on the nature of  the problem."    "We haven't moved an inch," he said, indicating  subcabinet-level talks this week have not made any progress.    The U.S. side has taken up trade imbalance and the question  of market access as the main problems, but Japanese negotiators  have insisted that Japan's markets are open and the problem is a  lack of effort by American companies, Garten said.    Garten said, however, there will be maximum effort on both  sides to make the negotiations a success since the results in  February will color U.S.-Japan relations for some time.    "This is for the (Bill) Clinton administration a first real  sort of benchmark of U.S.-Japanese trade relations," he said.    He said he was not sure how the negotiations will turn out,  but expressed hope that the pieces fall into places as they get  close to the deadline of February 11 when Clinton and Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meet on the issue.    "The history of U.S.-Japan negotiations that I know shows  that there's a lot more progress if the top leaders get  involved," he said.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue hit The world's largest bank note manufacturer, De La Rue, was the biggest casualty in the FT-SE 100 after announcing a small acquisition and also suffering a bout of profit-taking. On the first day of its return to the Footsie index of leading UK companies, De La Rue's shares fell 41 to 980p on comparatively high turnover of 1.1m. The shares have recently risen sharply following a rumoured upgrade by Cazenove. The company also announced that it had bought MB-Clarke, the cheque printing arm of conglomerate Caradon. Caradon shares eased 4 to 392p. Finally, there was some concern over the rising price of paper, which was highlighted by an encouraging statement from paper merchant Bunzl as well as newspaper comment. However analysts said printers such as De La Rue would find it easy to pass on the higher prices to customers and would not suffer. Bunzl shares lifted 2 to 183p. Bank shares were among the market's worst performers as dealers fretted about increased interest rates in the US and their impact on European markets. NatWest's acquisition of Citizens First Bancorp of the US for Dollars 500m unsettled NatWest late in the session with the bank's shares closing 13 down at 472p. The latest slide by the Hong Kong market triggered a fresh burst of selling in the leading Hong Kong related stocks such as HSBC, finally 32 off at 772p. Standard Chartered dipped 36 to 1124p. Schroders was again the pick of the merchant banks with the market still responding to last week's bumper profits and the 50 per cent dividend increase and also picking up suggestions that the bank may be interested in absorbing US associate Wertheim Schroder. Schroder shares climbed 24 to 1193p. Other merchant banks, however, fell back as dealers continued to worry about potential market losses during the recent upheavals in bond markets across the globe. SG Warburg dipped 17 to 748p. A weekend Press story suggesting that Liberty Life, the international insurance group, is preparing a mega-bid, triggered a short-lived mark-up in Sun Alliance shares, which touched 338p before slipping back to close unchanged at 329p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo held its ground after a recommendation from NatWest Securities pointed out the yield benefits of the stock. The shares were higher but finished 1 1/2 off at 683p. The note also recommended Zeneca, up 2 at 756p. USM-listed ML Laboratories improved 9 to 234p after a new product received approval from the EU medicines approval body. Press reports that results pending from Wembley will include large property write-downs, as well as some gloomy speculation over trading prospects, saw the shares slump 25 per cent, closing 3 1/2 down at 10 1/2 p. There was further media comment on Forte, up 2 1/2 at 262 1/2 p, and Savoy, 10 ahead at 1125p. Forte owns a large minority share of the Savoy and there has been speculation of an impending deal between the two. Results from Argos, the catalogue stores group, came in line with market forecasts, with the shares, up 4 at 359p, being helped by an upbeat trading statement. Boots and WH Smith moved in opposite directions, although analysts put this down to technical reasons rather than reaction to reports that a restructuring announcement about the groups' joint Do It All home improvement subsidiary was imminent. Boots shares were steady at 536p, while WH Smith retreated 10 to 514p. Reuters was firm on reports that the German Stock Exchange might be prepared to take on Globex, Reuters' electronic futures and options system. The shares added 10 at 2020p. Elsewhere, the sector was hard hit by bearish press comment that it was overvalued. Reed International, which disappointed with its figures last week, fell a further 21 to 848p. Some analysts began to feel the shares now represented a buying opportunity. United Newspapers, which is expected to show margins under pressure when it publishes figures on Thursday, fell 17 to 671p and Carlton Communications lost 23 at 940p. Advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi slipped 6 to 143p on reports that the chief executive might quit this week. Other statistics, Page 31</p>

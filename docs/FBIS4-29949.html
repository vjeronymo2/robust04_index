			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Expanding the Playing Field of the `Advanced </F> Nations Club"]    [Text] Is it an exaggeration to say that "the boundaries  between East and West and North and South have vanished?" The  East Asian nations are undergoing spectacular economic growth.  The wave of market economies is now pushing onto the shores of  former socialist nations. The economies of advanced nations have  been withering and distinctions from energetic developing  nations are becoming vague.    The question now is how will advanced nations transform  themselves in the world economy which has been significantly  changed after the Cold War, and what sort of order will they  establish? The theme discussed at the cabinet-level directors  meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) in Paris concentrated on this one point.    The joint statement of the cabinet-level directors meeting  gave the impression that difficulties will be encountered in the  solution of issues spreading on a global scale such as  unemployment and environmental pollution. However, some progress  was manifested in the formulation of a major policy statement  concerning a new global economic order.    Unlike last year, when the world was struck by widespread  recession, this year's global economy is enjoying a fledgling  recovery. The U.S. economic expansion is being accompanied by a  widening economic bottoming out in Europe. The OECD  Secretariat's revision of the outlook for growth in member  nations as a whole for this year--from 2.1 percent predicted at  the end of last year to 2.6 percent--in itself provides support  to the brightening prospects.    It is only natural that the concerns of the respective  nations shifted from near-term economic measures to chronic  unemployment of increasing intensity. The joint statement  states, "Unemployment represents a waste of potential human  capabilities and is a threat to the unity of society."    There is no disagreement in the perception that solution of  the unemployment issue requires not only economic measures, but  an indispensable structural reform of the economy. The problem  is whether such actions are feasible.    Chronic unemployment in European nations emanates from an  unemployment system which provides for generous jobless  insurance benefits, extended payment periods, and the capability  to survive somehow without acquiring a stable job. Such  practices are a cause for inflating the fiscal deficits of  concerned nations. However, it is not easy to convince the  public of the need to reduce payments and conserve in the area  of welfare.    The unemployed in OECD nations as a whole total 35 million  because they have lost their jobs owing to an onslaught of cheap  industrial products flowing in from developing nations and East  European countries. The view has been voiced in Europe and the  United States that imports should be banned from developing  nations where environmental regulations are lax and labor  conditions are inferior. However, we should not embrace  protective trade practices which split the world economy in two.    OECD strategy calls for the import of developing nation  products on the one hand while implementing deregulation and  technological reform on the other hand to increase employment  through the creation of new markets which do not compete with  developing nation products. This represents sound logic, but  regretfully we still lack new investment sectors which lead to  significant increases in employment. We should probably face the  reality that it will take time for advanced nations to recover  economic vitality.    In that respect, we can appreciate the OECD position of  withdrawing from the erstwhile "club of advanced nations" and  seeking other means for expanding its economic activities. This  month's affiliation of Mexico has been followed by preparations  by South Korea and four East European nations to join the OECD.  Aside from signing an economic cooperative agreement with  Russia, it is actively pursuing dialogue with China and Central  and South American nations.    The OECD has assumed a new role in which it strives for  equalization of competitive conditions by establishing mutual  affinity for working conditions and environmental standards with  newly industrialized nations and former Eastern bloc nations as  well as advanced nations.    Although the excuse given was the preoccupation with Diet  budget deliberations, it is regrettable that not even a single  Japanese cabinet member attended the OECD conference. It was an  exceptional opportunity for Japan to demonstrate its resolve to  expand domestic demand, just when European and U.S. attention is  focused on Japan's lagging economic recovery and growing current  accounts surplus.    The Naples summit of principal world leaders will be next.  We  would like Japan to awaken to its grave role in formulating a  new world economic order and to spare no effort in preparing for  the summit.</p>

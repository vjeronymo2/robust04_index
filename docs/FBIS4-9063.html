			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The seven  Central European presidents meeting in the Litomysl chateau for  two days of informal talks took part in a televised debate on  questions concerning the region and the individual states.    Most presidents agreed it was very hard to define Central  Europe. Polish President Lech Walesa said it would be better to  talk about united Europe. A number of problems, like "Chernobyl  and other nuclear power stations", surpass national borders and  so [as received] be discussed in a pan-European context.    Czech President Vaclav Havel, who is hosting the summit,  said  Central Europe's idiosyncrasies should not be a reason to  consider the region a "special independent political entity" of  some kind.    German President Richard von Weizsacker said Germany  considered it vital that all the countries of Central Europe  enter the European Union [EU]. Only then would the Union  justify its name, he said. While discussing relations with  Russia Weizsacker said the West did not want to provoke it but  to cooperate -- though not on terms Russia would dictate.    Walesa emphasized that Central European countries had to act  together and defend their common values together to deprive  "certain groups in Russia" of the possibility of exploiting  Central European irresolution. He said Russia "does not  understand what partnership is" in reference to Moscow's  cautious attitude towards the Partnership for Peace project.    Havel stressed the need to "categorically reject" elements  on  the Russian political scene which believed "Russia has a special  right to advise us on what we may and may not do".    Slovenian President Milan Kucan said the international  community had made some errors which significantly influenced  the course of the war in the former Yugoslavia. The fundamental  mistake had been the inability to understand that the federation  had to fall apart. The military pressure NATO was now applying,  he said, could only continue till the three warring sides,  Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb, come together at the negotiating  table.    All the presidents speaking in the debate, which was hosted  by French public affairs commentator Jacques Rupnik, agreed  admission to the European Union was desirable but accepted  Havel's observation that EU entry was less important than the  adoption of the values and principles on which the EU was  founded and the willingness to bear their share of  responsibility for the fate of the world.</p>

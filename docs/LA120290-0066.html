			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOMEOWNER HAS ONGOING BATTLE WITH DISTANT LOAN SERVICING  FIRM  </P> <P> QUESTION: Our home mortgage is less than 2 years old, but it has been sold  three times. We now have to make loan payments to a loan servicer in a small  Texas town I've never heard of and where the Pony Express apparently delivers  the mail once a week. This company claims our escrow impound account was  under-funded by $454, which we were asked to pay in a lump sum.  </P> <P> When we refused, the lender agreed we can spread out the extra payments over 12  months. But for the last two months we have been assessed late charges even  though I mail our mortgage payment on the first day of the month. The loan  company says our payment is due by the first, even though there is a 15-day  grace period. What can we do about these mortgage problems?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Your situation is not uncommon. The sale of home mortgage servicing is  a multibillion dollar unregulated business. Abuse by loan servicers is  shocking, yet Congress refuses to step in. To make matters worse, some loan  servicers do not have toll free phone numbers and require borrowers to write  all complaints, which often go unanswered.  </P> <P> It sounds like your loan servicer is playing the "late payment scam" on you by  claiming your payments are not received until after the 15-day grace period  expires. Yes, it is true your loan payment is "due" on the first day of the  month, but most lenders give a 10- or 15-day grace period. As long as your  payment is received within the grace period, the lender cannot give an adverse  credit rating on you. Some of the biggest loan servicers plan this late payment  scam. The only way to protect yourself is to get a proof of mailing receipt at  the post office or send your payments via certified mail with a return receipt  requested.  </P> <P> As for the escrow impound account rip-off, that is another tactic some loan  servicers use to increase balances in borrower impound accounts for property  taxes and insurance. The best you can do is double check the loan servicer's  estimates of required payments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Is the 'Catch' on a Lease Option?  </P> <P> Q: In the school district where we want to buy a home, there is an oversupply  of new and resale homes. The ads of several realty agents and builders say  "lease option." One agent advertises "rent to own, all rent applies toward  purchase price." It sounds too good to be true. What is the catch?  </P> <P> A: A lease with option to purchase can be a very good deal for both home buyer  and seller. But the buyer should watch out for an inflated option price which  is above the fair market value for the home. Be sure to check comparable sales  prices to be certain the option price is not too high.  </P> <P> Although you will not receive any income tax deductions until you purchase the  home, the 100% rent credit toward the purchase price is a major benefit that  more than offsets the lack of tax deductions. For further details, please  consult your tax adviser or attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retiree Appreciates 2nd Mortgage Income  </P> <P> Q: I started reading your columns years ago when I used to live near  Washington, D.C. You said it is smart to buy real estate when you are young and  when you are old sell it on installment sales and carry back mortgages for  retirement income.  </P> <P> That is what I did about five years ago. Every month the payments come in like  clockwork. But a few months ago one of my buyers was going to pay off my loan.  I had to talk fast, but I persuaded her not to pay me off. Where else could I  earn such high interest?  </P> <P> A: I greatly appreciate your sharing that success story. When I sell property I  love to carry back a first or second mortgage for the income. Once in a while,  if the buyer doesn't make the payments, I have to foreclose and either get paid  off at the foreclosure sale or get the property back to sell for a second  profit.  </P> <P> I can't understand why more property sellers don't help finance their buyer's  purchases. Sorry, I don't know any place else you can earn as high interest as  you can by financing a real estate sale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Praise for Eager New Real Estate Agent  </P> <P> Q: A young real estate agent had been "farming" our neighborhood for several  months, so we decided to give him the listing. I think it was his only listing,  so he really worked hard.  </P> <P> He got lots of other agents to tour our home, even served them fancy food.  Every week his company ran nice ads for his Sunday open houses. And he  delivered flyers to our neighbors about our home being for sale. It turned out  one of the neighbors had a friend who wanted to move to our neighborhood, so we  sold our home to her.  </P> <P> The purpose of my letter is to let you know sometimes the new agents work  harder than the old-timers. I know you advocate listing with experienced agents  who have good references, but don't you think it pays to give the new kid a  try?  </P> <P> A: Of course. Occasionally, I get irate letters from new real estate agents who  criticize me for recommending home sellers interview at least three local real  estate agents before selecting the best one.  </P> <P> Part of that interview process involves phoning each agent's client references  to ask, "Were you in any way unhappy with your agent and would you list with  the same agent again?" I still think that is the best way to select an agent.  But, of course, there are exceptions to every rule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carpenter Can't Get Construction Loan  </P> <P> Q: For the last 12 years I have been a union carpenter. My wife and I bought a  nice lot where we want to build our new home. We have about $25,000 cash, but  we need a construction loan to finance our house until we can get a permanent  mortgage.  </P> <P> We have contacted at least 20 lenders about construction loans. None will loan  to us because I am not a licensed contractor and I want to do all the  sub-contracting without hiring a general contractor. Any ideas how I can get a  construction loan?  </P> <P> A: Look at your situation from the lender's viewpoint. You may be a great  carpenter, but the lender is worried that you will run into trouble on the  construction project which you can't handle. The possibilities are endless.  </P> <P> As a remodeler of older homes who hires licensed general contractors, I know  even the experts with many years of experience often run into unexpected  problems. Fortunately, they are always able to solve them (usually with more  money!).  </P> <P> But lenders are reluctant to loan to non-licensed do-it-yourself home builders.  I suggest you hire a general contractor to supervise your home building, so you  can get a construction loan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prospective Seller Seeks Market Forecast  </P> <P> Q: We have owned our home many years and are thinking of selling, perhaps early  in 1991. Is there any rule of thumb as to how much home prices are expected to  appreciate in the next 12 months? Our home has been our best investment, so we  are wondering if we should sell or if you expect home prices to go up  substantially next year?  </P> <P> A: I have no idea how much home prices might appreciate in the next year. If  you find a person who knows for sure, please let me know. Nationally, home  prices have appreciated about 5% annually in recent years. But that includes  appreciation of 20% to 30% annually in some areas, as well as major declines in  states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska.  </P> <P> In the current buyer's market which prevails in most of the nation, home prices  are stagnant or rising only slightly. If you have a good reason to sell next  spring, that should be a good time to sell. But if you have no compelling  reason to sell, then you might be better off keeping your home. Sorry, I can't  be of more help, but real estate is a very local industry, so it is difficult  to give specific answers to a general question.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beware the Seller Who Offers No-Down Loan  </P> <P> Q: I am 26 and anxious to earn real estate profits. At a property management  class I met an elderly gentleman who owns several downtown apartment buildings  which are very management intense. His tenants are retirees, welfare  recipients, drunks and even a few prostitutes. The gentleman offered to sell me  one of his buildings for nothing down (he knows I don't have any money) and  says he will carry back a second mortgage for his equity at 5% interest. The  building will break even if I can keep the vacancy rate below 10%. Do you think  this is a good or bad deal?  </P> <P> A: Please be careful. That "nothing down" offer might be too good to be true.  If you decide to go ahead, be sure there is no personal recourse on the second  mortgage. I presume the existing first mortgage has no due-on-sale clause. If  it does, forget the sale because it could be very dangerous to buy subject to a  first mortgage with a legally-enforceable due-on-sale clause. Consult a real  estate attorney for more details.  </P></p>

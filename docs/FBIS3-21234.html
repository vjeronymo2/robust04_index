			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Aerospace Industry Bureau Director Neymark of the  Russian Federation Committee, has been invited to Japan by the  Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC) (Chairman,  Fuji Heavy Industries President Isamu Kawai). He emphasized the  importance of Japan-Russia exchange in the area of commercial  aircraft development at a press interview on 26 January at a  hotel in Tokyo. First he mentioned the status of the Russian  aircraft industry in which non-military demand is increasing  rapidly, while military demand has dropped from 70% of the  total in 1989 to 25% today. ``It is possible to develop  jointly  with Japan on a wide scale, including everything from smaller  100-seat aircraft to larger 500-seat aircraft,'' he added.    He said ``the Russians do not have enough information as of  now'' to be able to judge at exactly which technological level  the Japanese aircraft industry is. However, he expressed high  expectations in onboard electronic equipment to which  sophisticated electronic technologies have been applied.    Prior to the press interview, the Director paid a courtesy  visit to MITI's Aircraft and Ordnance Division of the Machinery  and Information Industries Bureau and proposed wide-ranging  technical exchanges including joint basic research efforts.    SJAC had signed a memorandum of understanding concerning  four  items during their delegation's visit to Russia in May 1993.  They include:    1) information exchange and evaluation on joint commercial  aircraft development;    2) invitations to Russian aircraft industry officials.    The visit by Director Neymark to Japan this time was  arranged  as part of that MOU.</p>

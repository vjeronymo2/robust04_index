			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRAQ;  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE FIGHTS BAGHDAD SANCTIONS  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials told a Senate committee they oppose trade  sanctions against Iraq despite its "abysmal" human rights record and its use of  chemical weapons, saying such measures would hurt U.S. farmers more than the  Baghdad government. Both Democratic and Republican members of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee reacted angrily to the Administration position.  Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said Amnesty International reports that  Iraq has tortured and executed children left her in tears, and that just  because U.S. sanctions might not work is no reason not to give them a try.  </P></p>

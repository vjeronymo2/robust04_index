			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TOLLIVER TO START FOR CHARGERS  </P> <P> Rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver will get another start for the San Diego  Chargers next weekend when they play the Washington Redskins, Coach Dan Henning  said.  </P> <P> Henning also said Monday that he has not considered whether Tolliver will start  San Diego's final two games. The Chargers play at Kansas City on Dec. 17 and  end their season at home Dec. 24 against Denver.  </P> <P> "The main idea is to win football games and at the same time find out as much  about players as you possibly can," Henning said. "In both games that Billy's  been in, he's done some things you would expect from a rookie. He's also made  some plays. The results haven't been a lot different from some of our other  games."  </P> <P> Tolliver made his second start of the season Sunday in the Chargers' 20-17 loss  to the New York Jets.  </P></p>

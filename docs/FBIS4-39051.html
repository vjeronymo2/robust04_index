			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Refugee? Get Running!"] </F>   [Text] In Moscow and Moscow Oblast the militia have  started "hunting" refugees from countries of the near abroad and  certain Arab regions. Organs, following a decree from the  Moscow City Government, are to locate citizens in this category  and unambiguously "request" that they leave Moscow Oblast.    There are currently 6,000 refugees (it is thought) in the  city. Not one of them is registered, since there is no relevant  legislation covering this. These people are not even entitled  to look for work or seek hospital treatment. Consequently, they  are often forced into crime in order to earn money for food.    Incidentally, the other day the Russian Federation  president's Human Rights Commission prepared a report, which  nobody has as yet examined, on the need to grant automatic  Russian citizenship to any refugee who requests it.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland bid terms disappoint TERMS of the agreed takeover of Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) disappointed the market yesterday. The shares were further weakened by an apparently huge amount of stock waiting to be sold. The two banks said jointly that HSBC was making a recommended paper offer offer for Midland valuing it at Pounds 3.1bn or 378p per share. Analysts had expected an offer well above 400p. The lower than expected offer revived speculation that Lloyds Bank would come in with a higher bid. Potential pressure on Lloyds' balance sheet prompted its shares to slip 5 to 390p. There was also a strong belief in the market that the Kuwait Investment Office was trying to place 60m Midland shares, a stake of 7.64 per cent through securities house Hoare Govett at 362p - worth Pounds 217.2m. The KIO is the only shareholder apart from HSBC with a stake above 5 per cent. The KIO said it never commented on market talk and Hoare Govett declined to respond to questions. Market dealers said Hoare was trying to place the shares in an 'all or nothing deal' but only managed to pre-place up to a third of them yesterday. They believed the deal was competitively valued and would probably be taken up by arbitrageurs - dealers who trade off relative differences in markets - who would wait to see how HSBC shares would react when they opened in Hong Kong Midland lost 7 to 365p on heavy turnover of 29m shares. Hopes that the worst may be over boosted the battered building materials and construction sector, while talk of a possible bid supported Tarmac ahead of today's results. The shares rose 10 to 145p, despite expectations of a very sharp fall from the previous year's profits of Pounds 190.7m. Analysts suggested that if this results in a passing of the dividend, it may bring the balloon created by bid speculation down to earth. RMC climbed 22 to 606p after reporting profits at the top end of market expectations and paying an increased dividend of 20p against 19.3p. The 1991 profit of Pounds 167.4m was down from Pounds 216.2m, but was viewed favourably when compared with forecasts of Pounds 150m to Pounds 170m and resulted in analysts upgrading forecasts for the present year. Blue Circle was cheered by the news from RMC, rising 7 to 285p, ahead of today's results. Taylor Woodrow gained 9 to 129p, as the dividend was held at 9 1/2 p on a 1991 loss of Pounds 2.7m. The payout followed statements made at the time of last year's rights issue and was regarded as 'a matter of honour', but the company said it made no promises for this year. The loss was in line with forecasts and followed a profit of Pounds 83.4bn previously. John Mowlem rose 9 to 157p, despite Monday's announcement of sharply lower profits, after County NatWest said the shares look cheap long term. Wellcome fell 21 to 1110p on a US press report suggesting that its anti-Aids drug Retrovir (AZT) might soon face competition from rivals. The article said Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug, DDI, which received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, had emerged in a new study as equal to or better than Wellcome's AZT. Analysts said an FDA advisory committee would soon meet to discuss Bristol-Myers' DDI as well as aids drug DDC, which is made by the Swiss pharmaceuticals group Roche. Bid rumours pushed discount food retailer Kwik Save up 15 to 568p, on higher than usual turnover of nearly 1m shares. Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm holds 25 per cent of Kwik Save and is looking to diversify ahead of 1997. Argyll, the third largest UK supermarket group, eased 3 to 341p but was not regarded as likely to mount a bid in the short-term, while Tesco and J. Sainsbury would probably be prevented by legislation. Stores group Dixons rose 3 to 242p, continuing to benefit from the general election result. Analysts were impressed by a company presentation, which concentrated on forthcoming technolgy and buying trends. A positive and in-depth analysis from SG Warburg Securities helped lift Pearson despite its already high share price. Warburg recommended buying the shares on weakness and Pearson climbed 11 to 845p. Bowater, which joined the FT-SE 100 Index two weeks ago, advanced 16 to 769p as the stock returned to favour after a recent downward correction. Whitbread, hit on Monday by comments from the Office of Fair Trading about beer supply agreements, gained a little relief from news that it is to lease 115 pubs to Devenish, free of tie for eight years. Whitbread 'A' improved a penny to 426p, while Devenish rose 3 to 248p. Cable &amp; Wireless jumped 12 to 570p with sentiment boosted by a BZW buy recommendation and news that the company is to form a joint venture in Russia. Kleinwort Benson, however, was said to be advising investors to switch out of Cables and into Vodafone, 2 better at 358p. Bid speculation continued in Delta. The shares added 12 to 469p as County NatWest reiterated its buy recommendation. The market's first cash call since the general election was well received as shares in Laird Group recovered from an early decline to end a penny firmer at 275p. The company which reported a Pounds 10.5m fall in its final figures to Pounds 28.4m is making a 1 for 5 rights issue to raise Pounds 41.4m. British Aerospace gained 10 to 350p as turnover rose to 5.8m on reports that Saudi Arabia is to put aside a further 200,000 barrels of oil to meet payments under the UK/Saudi al-Yamamah defence pact. Television company Central put on 20 at 1285p. SG Warburg Securities new chart analyst Mr Richard Lake believes the stock is ready to break out of its trading range. Aviva Petroleum, which recently had a one-for-fifty consolidation of its shares saw its price virtually halved yesterday before rallying to close 38 off at 111p. Marketmakers said they had seen no big sellers in the market and knew of no apparent reason for the falls. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (140).

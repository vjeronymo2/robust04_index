Witnesses told officers that four men pulled up  in front of the house in a brown-paneled station wagon and began firing at  three men standing in the driveway. A bullet grazed the back of Nickolas  Decorse, 24, of Ft. Ord, and other bullets entered the house, nearly wounding  an infant and two adults. Decorse's car was also struck. Police had been called  to the house earlier to break up a fight, officers said.  </P></p>

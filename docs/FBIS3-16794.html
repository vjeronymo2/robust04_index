			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 19 Mar -- "The parliamentary hearings  at the Federal Assembly and the closed session of the Federation  Council are yet another attempt to settle relations between  North Ossetia and Ingushetia by peaceful means, North Ossetian  President Akhsarbek Galazov said today.    Speaking at a republican government session, members of the  North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Presidium, and heads of local  self-government bodies of Vladikavkaz and regions, he stressed  that the Republic of North Ossetia was extremely interested in  establishing normal relations with all its neighbors in North  Caucasus and the Transcaucasus. However, the multi-ethnic  people of the republic denounce the use of force in resolving  these issues. The issue of refugee return to Prigorodnyy Rayon  should not be forced either. This problem should be tackled by  conciliatory commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk  Agreements.    The North Ossetian president reiterated his readiness to  meet  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev to discuss the settlement of  relations between the peoples of the two republics.    Speaking about the position taken by the commission of  deputies that worked in the state of emergency zone and who  reported to the parliament on the results of its trip to North  Caucasus, Akhsarbek Galazov said that it had gathered vast  material but had made hasty and nonobjective conclusions which  may cause the situation in the region to explode and may bring  to naught all earlier peace-making efforts by the North Ossetian  leadership and the interim administration.    He added that at the proposal of Russian Federation Council  Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, a special commission would be set up  to draw up objective solutions aimed at settling the situation  in the conflict zone.</p>

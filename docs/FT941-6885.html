			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Caracas imposes economic curbs The government of President Rafael Caldera suspended at the weekend the constitutional provisions of freedom of economic activity without government restrictions. This initiative, arising from what the government sees as an economic and financial 'emergency' for Venezuela, gives the executive broad powers to issue decrees in economic and financial matters that would usually be the responsibility of the Congress. The first presidential decree under the new emergency powers suspended the application of value-added tax (VAT) on retailing. It was not immediately clear what other areas might be affected, but a cabinet member said it was not the government's intention to maintain this or any other suspension of constitutional rights indefinitely. The last suspension of economic liberties in Venezuela lasted 30 years, and was revoked in 1991. The Caldera government, in office since February 2, faces an economic recession, low prices for the country's principal export (petroleum), a large government deficit, demand for greater spending from various sectors, high inflation and a banking system in crisis. The government took action on the retail VAT, which took effect on January 1, to clear up widespread confusion in business about its application, and to avoid possible protests - and violence - due to a wave of retail price increases since January. On February 27 five years ago, price increases sparked three days of rioting and looting that left some 300 dead. The administration which stepped down this month also tried to suspend retail VAT but did not enact this properly. The Caldera administration plans to replace VAT at all levels with a new sales tax and other taxes. Mr Berend Roosen, president of Consecomercio, which represents Venezuela's commercial sector, said the government's decision to suspend economic rights was 'a step backward. A market economy is really what favours the country.' In the presidential decree ordering the suspension of the economic provisions, the government said it was motivated by 'serious conditions affecting the economic and fiancial stability of the country', and 'speculative tendencies that could upset public order'.</p>

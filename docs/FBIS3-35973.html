It  carries good ideas and will boost our rapprochement with NATO,"  head of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff Colonel-General  Mikhail Kolesnikov told NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe  General Henning von Ondarza at the Russian Defence Ministry  today.    According to the colonel-general, the Russian Defence  Ministry hopes the contacts will "improve planning,  organization, preparation and implementation of peace-keeping  operations that involve Russian units".    "The Russian Armed Forces General Staff and the Defence  Ministry pay much attention to the peace-keeping operations. We  analyze the experience of our peace-making battalion in former  Yugoslavia and that of our military observers acting under the  U.N. aegis," he said.    The official informed the NATO general of a peace-making  role  of Russian troops in the Trans-Dniester region, Tajikistan and  other areas of the commonwealth.    In his turn, General von Ondarza said NATO plans to discuss  details of cooperation with Russia.    The general arrived in Russia on Monday on a four-day visit.  He has met Russian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General  Vladimir Semenov, visited the Kantemirovskaya Guard tank  division and acquainted himself with combat training and the  military routine.    A draft program of Russian-NATO military cooperation for  1994  was discussed at a meeting of representatives of the Russian  Defence Ministry and NATO last week in Moscow. The draft  includes 50 military arrangements, namely exchange visits of  Russian and NATO military command and experts, joint exercises  and training, training of Russian officers at NATO units and  educational establishments and mutual invitations to military  exercises.</p>

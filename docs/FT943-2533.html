			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Cameroon strike Cameroon's new international airport was open again on Wednesday after a one-day strike by air traffic controllers, firemen and meteorologists claiming five months of unpaid wages. Strike leader Vincent Baleba said he had called off the stoppage after government officials told him on Tuesday evening that four months arrears had already been transferred to workers' bank accounts. But he warned that the strike would resume immediately if the full amount was not paid by September 20.</p>

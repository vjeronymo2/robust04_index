			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Reuters calls for trading to be open Reuters Holdings, the international information and news provider, has joined the lobbying for securities regulators to insist on greater transparency for trading on the London Stock Exchange. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, has asked market participants whether the exchange should alter rules which allow long delays before the markets generally are told about large transactions. Also, the SIB is questioning whether marketmakers who deal with each other anonymously via inter-dealer broker screens ought to have their deals made public. In the US, Reuters was instrumental in persuading the Justice Department to require inter-dealer brokers in US government bonds to make their prices available to the public via information providers such as Reuters itself. Reuters is the parent company for several information providers such as Instinet, which in the US has gained significant market share from the New York Stock Exchange by acting as a bulletin board for the buyers and sellers of shares. In a long submission to the SIB from officials at its Instinet subsidiary, Reuters argues that lack of transparency has raised transactions costs, effectively discouraging the growth of so-called quantitative fund management in the UK.</p>

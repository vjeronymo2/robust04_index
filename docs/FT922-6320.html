			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPG issues writ against Morgan Grenfell MORGAN GRENFELL has been served with a writ by one of its former fund management clients, GPG, charging that the securities firm placed its own interests above those of its client and failed to meet its fiduciary duties. The writ was served late on Friday by GPG, a UK-based investment company. GPG alleges that Morgan called in loans to Egerton Trust, because of fears about Egerton's financial stability, but did not consider the interests of GPG, whose funds Morgan had invested in Egerton. The writ says GPG lost Pounds 4m invested by Morgan in commercial paper or short term securities of Egerton Trust, a housebuilding and construction company now in receivership. GPG notes in its writ that Morgan Grenfell, which was allowed to select investments for GPG without consulting the client, was at the same time a lender to Egerton and a dealer in the commercial paper which it purchased on GPG's behalf. The writ says that just weeks after Morgan Grenfell's treasury management division increased GPG's investment in Egerton's commercial paper, Morgan Grenfell's corporate finance division declared the company in default of an earlier loan, demanding - and receiving - repayment in full. Morgan did so despite a warning from Egerton that such a move would force it to default on commercial paper falling due shortly. The case raises questions about whether the so-called Chinese Walls intended to insulate the corporate finance and fund management arms of securities houses from each other actually undermine the interests of investors. Morgan Grenfell did not return phone calls on Friday about the matter. On December 15 1988, Morgan Grenfell agreed to be a lender to Egerton Trust. It was party to a multi-currency loan facility under which it would lend Egerton up to Pounds 4m. Seven months later, in July 1989, Morgan Grenfell acted as arranger and joint dealer for a Pounds 50m commercial paper programme on behalf of Egerton. The securities did not carry a credit rating - a characteristic of riskier debt - and the investing circular warned buyers that the dealers had not verified the accuracy of information. Each purchaser was warned that it would have to evaluate the credit of Egerton on its own. In January 1990, Morgan Grenfell became the discretionary fund manager for GPG, a role which gave it full authority to invest funds on GPG's behalf without prior approval. The funds under management ranged from Pounds 18m to Pounds 32m over time, and among the initial investments chosen by Morgan Grenfell for GPG was Pounds 3m in Egerton's commercial paper. When that paper matured on June 1, Morgan Grenfell rolled it over on GPG's behalf and purchased an additional Pounds 1m worth. But just three weeks later, Morgan Grenfell told Egerton's management that it was in default on its loan agreement, that it wanted immediate full repayment of Pounds 4m and that no more funds would be extended. On July 6, Egerton told Morgan Grenfell that if no further funds were extended, it would be unable to repay commercial paper maturing shortly. In its writ, GPG charged that Morgan Grenfell, by insisting on repayment of its own loan, allowed its interests to conflict with those of GPG. GPG said it knew nothing of Egerton's financial difficulties until August 1, when it was told that the company was unable to repay commercial paper maturing that day. Mr Blake Nixon, managing director of GPG, said on Friday that because of the 'health warning' in the circular, even if Chinese walls were in place, Morgan Grenfell's investment arm had a duty to investigate the creditworthiness of Egerton. This duty should have involved more than usual scrutiny because of Morgan Grenfell's own involvement with the company. GPG was only one of several investors who recorded losses on Egerton's commercial paper. Mr Russell Wells, finance director at Coats Viyella, said that Pounds 10m of the company's treasury funds had been invested in the securities. While Morgan Grenfell did not advise the company to make the purchase, Mr Wells said it was 'a disappointment' that his company had not been advised of Egerton's deteriorating financial position. He also said that he did not realise that Morgan Grenfell had been a lender to Egerton at the same time as it had been arranger and joint dealer on its commercial paper programme. On June 8 1991 receivers were called in at Egerton.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AND U.N.  </P> <P> President Bush's Sept. 25 address to the U.N. General Assembly ("Bush Offers  Cut in Chemical Arms" and related stories, Part I, Sept. 26) signals a new  American recognition of the value of an effective United Nations in helping the  United States and other nations achieve their foreign policy goals. Yet for  several years, the U.S. unilaterally cut its assessed contributions by one-half  as a way of pressuring the U.N. to adopt fiscal and administrative reforms. Now  satisfied that the reform process is under way, the Reagan and Bush  administrations have requested Congress to approve near full-funding.  </P> <P> However, still at issue are $460 million in arrearages that have accumulated  over the past five years. The Senate Appropriations Committee has rejected an  initial first-year down payment of $46 million. For $460 million -- a fraction  of the cost of one B-2 bomber -- the United States could help re-establish its  role as a leader at the United Nations and provide much needed support for  essential and cost-effective actions that benefit all Americans.  </P> <P> JOHN W. OSBORN JR.  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Southern California Division  </P> <P> United Nations Assn.-U.S.A.  </P></p>

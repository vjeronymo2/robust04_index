			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE READERS RESPOND TO 'MOVIEMAKERS, MOVIE CRITICS AND YOU';  </P> <P> SCREENING OUT THE TRASH  </P> <P> Some newspapers or TV network, someone, has got to have the guts to perform a  fundamental classification even before a review is written. Films that are  blatant in their profit motive must not be discussed.  </P> <P> These would include 99% of all movies that are into their third sequel or  beyond. It would include Steven Seagal movies, death movies, teen-age murder  movies.  </P> <P> I admit the call could be a bit complicated, particularly if we define the  movie business as fundamentally a business. But we could at least recognize the  semblance of an honest effort or an attempt toward integrity, and we could  reward those efforts with a review. The others would not qualify.  </P> <P> Film criticism is, after all, part of the total process in the evolution of  film art. Film critics adulterate that process by reviewing waste material.  </P> <P> ROBERT B. CANAAN, West Hollywood  </P></p>

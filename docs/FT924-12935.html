			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Nostalgia rules in 'Radio Times' - Malcolm Rutherford on the revival of Noel Gay's music at the Queen's NOEL GAY, the composer who died in 1954, is enjoying a remarkable revival. Me and My Girl has been running at London's Adelphi Theatre for the last seven years and thoroughly deserves its success. It has an irresistible song in 'The Lambeth Walk', as well as a romantic Pygmalion-type story to go with it. Now we have Radio Times at the Queen's which, judging by the reaction of the first night audience, could equally well be a hit. Whether it will survive as long as Me and My Girl, taking it almost to the second millennium, depends on the strength of the market for nostalgia, which in Britain should not be underestimated. For nostalgia is what Radio Times is about. There is a slight play on words in the title. This is not Radio Times, the magazine: it is the time when radio was dominant, there was practically no television and very little independent broadcasting. Like the old wireless, the show takes a while to warm up. The year is 1941. The BBC Light Programme, a piece of nostalgia in itself, is transmitting its Variety Bandwagon on the short wave live to the United States of America. There is a political purpose: namely to enlist American support for the British war effort. Yet there is, as always, a British bureaucracy which gets in the way, especially of the BBC. The newly appointed producer is really the censor from the Home Office who wants all scripts submitted in advance. The programme goes ahead only when the censor turns native and agrees to appear in it himself. There are also some romantic attachments - just enough to keep the story alive. But forget the plot, such as it is. Radio Times is primarily an excuse to revive some of that Light Programme music, with biggish bands, jaunty and sentimental songs, corny and sometimes risque jokes. 'What do you get if you cross a leopard and a detective? A spotted dick.' The star moment comes towards the end when Gary Strong, the British-born Hollywood movie star who has returned to England to join the RAF, delivers an address to the Americans on how the British are coping with the blitz. Yes, it is sentimental; it is also moving. The movie star, played by Jeff Shankley, has already shown in the first half that there is still a place for the conventionally handsome, impeccably mannered straight male lead. It might be hard to imagine this in 1992, but Shankley pulls it off. Other pleasures include the appearance of the 12-man band on stage at the end of the first act: previously the musicians had been mysteriously hidden. Then there is the sound of the bombing after the interval. Sound effects play a large part in the show. There is a wonderful part for a man called Jeeps (played by James Buller) who looks every inch like a BBC recruit circa 1940 in pullover and baggy trousers. He is responsible on stage for the amateur sound effects that accompanied the Light Programme. He turns out to be a hero, of course. Not the least attraction, and another part of the nostalgia, are the long, shapely legs of the BBC chorus. I was less drawn by the love interest between the show's anchorman, played by Tony Slattery, and his fellow performer and girl friend (Kathryn Evans). This is soap before it reached television. Still, they acquit themselves very well and they marry in the end. As in the nature of musicals some songs are better than others. You cannot quarrel, however, with 'Run, Rabbit, Run' and 'There's Something About a Soldier'. Less well known, but strikingly effective, is Gay's 'Just Once More'. The show is directed by David Gilmore. He should speed up the start and realise that sometimes that it looks about to be the interval and even the end when it is not. Otherwise, his direction is pretty well without blemish.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensions with a hidden twist - Group plans that may not be what they seem When you sign up for a company pension scheme, it is tempting to assume that the employer will see you right. But under a group personal pension (GPP) - now the fastest-growing company pension arrangement - the employer does not have to take any responsibility whatever. Nor does he have to pay a penny. Since 1988, when GPPs first became available, life offices have marketed them as the cheapest alternative to traditional pension schemes. Certainly, a well-funded GPP can provide excellent benefits. At their most basic, however, these group plans offer a subsistence-level pension based on a rebate of National Insurance contributions. Moreover, GPPs claim to offer flexibility and portability to younger employees who are likely to change jobs. What providers often fail to point out is that a typical regular contribution contract is completely inflexible, while portability is available only at a price. A GPP actually is a collection of individual 'money purchase' personal pensions selected by an employer. Unlike traditional final-salary schemes, which link the value of the pension to the employee's salary at retirement, the investment risk rests with the employee under a GPP. Contributions are invested to provide an individual pot of money at retirement; this is used to buy an annuity. The level of annuity income depends on investment returns and the provider's charges, among other factors. The main point to remember with a GPP is that although the employer selects the plan, the onus lies with the employee to decide whether it is a suitable investment. Clearly, then, it is important to find out what benefits you are likely to get and whether you need to boost your contributions to provide a better pension. The following questions apply to most group money purchase arrangements, not just GPPs. How was the provider selected? The employer should receive advice on a fee basis from an independent consultant, rather than from a commission-based salesman or adviser. This ensures that the selection is free from bias, and that competitive plans are considered from low commission and non-commission-paying providers. It means also that the employer has paid for the cost of advice. If he does not pay, the provider will deduct these costs from your early premiums. What are the provider's credentials? If the adviser has done a thorough job, he will have checked the provider's financial strength, administration facilities, investment options and past performance. Information on performance should come from an independent source, either the adviser's own research or from independent surveys such as those published in such FT group magazines as Pensions Management and Money Management. Several direct sales organisations do not take part in these surveys; if the provider is one of these, you should ask why. They may well say that, since they do not sell through independent advisers, the surveys are irrelevant. Often, though, the real answer is that they have a combination of poor performance and high charges and, therefore, are not competitive. What are the charges? The level of charges will have a significant impact on the final return. The adviser should be able to explain what the charges are, how they compare with those of competitors, and if the employer has negotiated reductions for economies of scale and contribution collection. If your employer does not check for flexibility, you could be locked in to regular payments until expected retirement date. If payments stop, particularly in the early years, most of your contributions will disappear in the provider's administration costs and the adviser's commission payments. What happens when I change jobs? This follows on from the last point. In theory, you can take your personal pension with you from job to job. In practice, if you have a commission-based regular premium plan, you will incur a penalty when payments are reduced or stopped. If your new employer offers a good company pension scheme, then almost certainly you should join to benefit from the employer contributions, the guaranteed pension, and other family protection benefits. By law, however, you cannot be a member of a company scheme and maintain payments to a personal plan. Some providers allow clients to re-direct personal pension payments to a free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan, which is used to top up company pension benefits. This arrangement is fine if the employee can afford to keep up the company pension and FSAVC payments. But many younger people cannot afford this luxury and, even if they could, the employer's AVC scheme might offer better value than the individual FSAVC plan. Those who become self-employed can continue their personal pension plan, although there might be a penalty for short contribution gaps if initial cash flow is poor. The unemployed may be covered for a short period by a 'waiver of premium' clause in the contract but the long-term unemployed will have to drop out as they will have no earnings on which to base contributions. Given the unpredictability of career patterns, the only way to guarantee complete flexibility is to avoid regular contribution contracts unless they are on a nil-commission basis. If you have to pay commission, opt for a recurring single-premium plan which avoids the heavy up-front charges. Is the plan contracted out of Serps? If you are sold an 'appropriate' personal pension plan, you will contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In return, the Department of Social Security (DSS) will send to the plan provider a rebate of your own and your employer's National Insurance contributions. A decision to opt out of Serps should be made each year and will depend on your age, sex and salary. As a rough guide, if you are a man under 40 or a woman under 35 and earn at least Pounds 8,500 a year, you should consider opting out. Otherwise, stay in Serps because it is likely to provide better benefits than the personal pension. The contributions The reason most group personal pensions do not provide good benefits is that the amounts invested are too small. Whether you opt out or stay in Serps, it is essential to pay additional premiums in order to build up a decent pension. Under a personal plan, the combined employee and employer contribution must not exceed 17.5 per cent of earnings (more for older employees but there are restrictions for high earners). Where the employer does make a contribution, this is likely to be about 3 per cent. But most pay nothing at all. Compare this with the level of contributions needed to match the benefits provided by a good final-salary scheme and you can see why GPPs are attractive to the more cost-conscious employers (see table). Life assurance Find out if there is any life assurance linked to the plan and who is paying for it. A close examination often reveals that it is not the employer who pays; instead, premiums are deducted from employees' contributions. Caveat emptor The fact that your employer offers a GPP should not deter you from scrutinising the provider's terms and credentials in the same way you would for an individual plan. Whether you get value for money depends, above all, on the quality of your employer's research and the depth of his pocket.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- How much should you and your employer pay in to the group personal pension?  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Age       Total annual contrib*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 25                15% 35                17% 45                18% 55                20% 60                21%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Estimated contributions required to match a typical final salary scheme where one-sixtieth of final salary is earned for each year of service. The figures assume 9 per cent per annum investment return, 7 per cent per annum salary growth, 4.5 per cent per annum pension increases and 50 per cent spouse's death after retirement pension. No explicit allowance has been made for the effect of the provider's charges which could reduce the investment return by 2-3 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Watsons  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>   [Text] Morristown (New Jersey), 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice  Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua, who is now in the  United States, visited the world-famous American Telephone and  Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and International Business Machine  Company (IBM) on 28 April. He also attended signing ceremonies  for cooperation agreements and memorandums between relevant  Chinese departments and those two companies.    AT&amp;T, based near Morristown, New Jersey, is known as  the top  leader in world telecommunications technology. It has branch  companies and business operations in over 140 countries and  regions. The total number of its employees exceeded 380,000 and  its business turnover topped $67 billion in 1993.    When arriving at the Bell Laboratory, which is called "The  Jewel on the Crown" of this company, Zou Jiahua and his party  were warmly welcomed by company's executives, director of the  laboratory, and other staff members. Nobel laureate in Physics  Dr. Arno Penzias, who is vice president of AT&amp;T and in  charge of  the company's research work, briefed the Chinese guests on basic  research and new product development of the Bell Laboratory.  Dr. (John Mayo), director of the laboratory, accompanied the  Chinese guests to tour the sites of the laboratory where  materials such as laser semiconductor, optical fiber, and  submarine optical cable were developed. At noon, Zou Jiahua  went to Park Ridge, headquarters of AT&amp;T, and met with Robert  Allen, president of AT&amp;T. They attended a signing ceremony of  an agreement in principle on implementing the memorandum for a  comprehensive and long-term cooperation between China's State  Planning Commission and AT&amp;T. They agreed that the signing of  this agreement would lay a foundation for long-term and friendly  cooperation between relevant Chinese departments and AT&amp;T.  Allen  said that AT&amp;T is striving to become China's "most reliable  strategic cooperation partner" in the area of communications  technology and computer. Zou Jiahua praised this company's  consistent friendship toward China and expressed the hope that  the pace of the development of such a cooperative relationship  would "be further accelerated."    On the same afternoon, Zou Jiahua and his party traveled  about 160 km by cars to White Plains in the State of New York  and held talks with Louis Gerstner, chairman of IBM, and others.  Both sides carried out in-depth discussion on technological  cooperation. China's Ministry of Electronics Industry signed a  letter of intent on technological cooperation with this company  there. Gerstner expressed the hope that the signing of the  letter of intent on cooperation would become a new starting  point for cooperation between IBM and China and would contribute  to the development of the United States and China.</p>

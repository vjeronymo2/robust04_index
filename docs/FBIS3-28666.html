The 10-day exercises,  directed jointly by Japanese and U.S. military officials,  involved some 3,400 Japanese and 3,200 U.S. participants, the  USFJ reported in a news release.    Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council  of the Self-Defense Forces, said the exercises gave the  commanders a "comprehensive assessment of the ground, navy, air,  joint and combined operations." In addition to operational  capability, the exercise also "enables us to develop the very  comprehensive and capable logistics and support functions we  will need to win the war," Nishimoto said.    USFJ Commander Lt. Gen. Richard Myers said the simulator  "proved its ability to realistically test procedures and  logistics support for simulated air, land, and sea operations,  and in doing so, increased the training value of the exercise  for both the U.S. and Japanese participants."    "This exercise was a great test of the U.S. and Japanese  military staffs' ability to conduct crisis action planning and  to practice commanding and controlling the simulated movement of  equipment and forces," said Myers. "I am absolutely confident  both staffs are now able to do a better job of defending Japan  should the need ever arise," he said.</p>

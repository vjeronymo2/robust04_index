			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Klockner-Werke The rescue plan agreed by Klockner-Werke's creditors yesterday will doubtless come as a great relief to the company and its workforce in Bremen. But what is good for the company is not necessarily so for the broader European industry. Klockner is closing a blast furnace yet its crude steel capacity will be cut by only 20 per cent and its hot-rolled output by a mere 12 per cent. Cancellation of 60 per cent of its debts effectively gives it a substantial subsidy from German banks into the bargain. It may be tempting to regard such a solution as sufficient, since European steel prices have been rising this year while production is down. But that has been possible only because of voluntary restraint by west European producers while those in east Europe have taken fright at the threat of protection. With the German recession deepening, there is not much chance of demand reviving this year. When it eventually does, there is a strong chance that the battles for market share will begin all over again. Supporters of the Klockner solution argue that it is preferable to bankruptcy, which would have allowed its assets to be sold off on the cheap  -creating a cost advantage to the buyer. There are echoes of this in the present scheme, though. Klockner is talking of writing down the value of its Bremen mill and selling a 50 per cent stake in it. Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch have already expressed an interest. If the German industry can be revitalised in this way, subsidised producers in Spain and Italy will be more determined to hold their ground.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Caught with its defences down - Weakened by financial difficulties, Scantronic is ripe for takeover The alarm bells are ringing at Scantronic Holdings as potential bidders prepare to raid the security components group. Shares have plunged from a high of 89p this year to 20 1/2 p at the end of last week, as Scantronic's net debt climbed to Pounds 11.2m last June, up from Pounds 3.5m in March 1993. Two weeks ago the company won shareholder agreement to raise Pounds 2.8m in new equity and borrowings. The deeply discounted offer of 16.1m shares at 10p is expected to raise Pounds 1.2m, and was a condition of new banking facilities of Pounds 1.6m. The board announced there would be pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.4m for the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 1.4m last year. It also declared there would be no dividend payments, including preference dividends, for this year. Last week Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer, announced its interest in making a bid for Scantronic. The company - which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.36m on turnover of Pounds 70.3m in the year to April - purchased 550,000 Scantronic shares to raise its stake to 1.64m shares, or 4.49 per cent of the company. Ruth Keattch, analyst at Granville Davies, said: 'I don't think the Scantronic board enjoys any sympathy with the institutional shareholders. 'They had a good business in the UK: a leading brand with probably 50 per cent of the intruder alarm systems market. But they took their eye off the ball and went on a mission to expand in the US, which was truly disastrous.' Scantronic's cash difficulties began last year with the acquisition of Alarmexpress Holdings, the UK security equipment distributor. In December, Scantronic placed 1.73m shares to fund growth at the new subsidiary. By April the board acquired 20 per cent of Arius, the US distributor of security products. The investment, along with the Alarmexpress acquisition and expansion, cost Scantronic Pounds 5.3m. In July the company announced the departure of its finance director, Mr Ray Dias, claiming that he had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions. The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 1.27m) for the year to March 31, compared with a statement in July that it would make profits of at least Pounds 2.75m. Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 50.2m, but the core UK manufacturing business saw operating profits fall from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 2.59m, primarily due to lower sales to the Continent. Patrick Hickey, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'At the end of the day, this is a case of management overstretching its ability. The tragedy is that it is basically a good business in the UK, but it is not a product for the US. 'Earlier this year they ran into problems because of a lack of financial controls. They ended up with a lot more stock and a lot less cash than they thought. 'There are also very heavy borrowings. Given the history of the past six months, there has to be a consideration that there may be financial holes.' However, Mr John Singer, finance director, refused to comment on the company's financial position. Alongside Menvier-Swain, there are rumours that Silvermines, the Dublin-based electrical services and property group, is interested in making a bid. In February, Silvermines made an agreed offer of IPounds 5.17m for Molynx Holdings, the closed circuit television and security systems maker. 'Menvier-Swain would be a perfect buyer because they are big in emergency lighting and fire alarms, which is very similar to intruder alarm technology,' said Ruth Keattch. 'Silvermines would also love to be bigger in the security systems market. If Menvier-Swain are serious they are the most credible bidder, but it could evolve into a bit of an auction if someone like Silvermines makes a bid.'</p>

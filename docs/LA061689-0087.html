			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Merced County farmer whose foreclosed ranch is being considered for a kit fox  sanctuary says the proposal would destroy his chances of rebuilding the farm.  Tom Castle of Morgan Hill says he legally has the first right to buy the  683-acre ranch he defaulted on last fall. But if two government agencies get  their way, the land will be converted to permanent pasture and then restored as  a habitat for the endangered fox. "That's a real good idea, except nobody's  ever seen a kit fox on this land," said Castle's lawyer, Karen Russo of  Woodland.  </P></p>

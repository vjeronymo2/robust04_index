			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO OIL SPILL ALONG COAST  </P> <P> In the sidebar "California Oil," on Page T6 of The Times' Special Report on the  Huntington Beach oil spill, the first words of the text are "California is a  net exporter of oil . . . " That simply isn't true, as is clearly shown by the  pie chart at the left of the same piece.  </P> <P> The facts are: 1) California, onshore and offshore, produces about a million  barrels of crude oil per day. 2) California consumes about 2 million barrels of  crude oil per day. 3) Virtually all of the million-barrel-per-day difference  enters California by tanker, either from Alaska or Indonesia. 4) More oil  spills, by number and by volume, come from tankers than from offshore drilling  and production.  </P> <P> Despite the facts, a parade of political demagogues has used the occasion of  the Huntington Beach spill to come out against offshore drilling. If we had  more offshore oil production, we would be less likely to have large oil spills.  </P> <P> MICHAEL E. UTT  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Refund Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Atlantic Richfield Company/Phoenix Steel Corporation, 3/29/94, RF304&hyph;12974  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying an Application for Refund filed by LK, Inc., on behalf of Phoenix Steel Corporation in the Atlantic Richfield Company Subpart V special refund proceeding. The Phoenix Steel Application was denied because LK, Inc. failed to show it was authorized to represent Phoenix Steel and the DOE was unable to contact Phoenix Steel or an employee of the company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Atlantic Richfield Company/Small's Garage, et al., 4/1/94, RF304&hyph;4881  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning six Applications for Refund filed in the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) special refund proceeding. The DOE determined that the refund claims be denied, because the individual who filed the Applications, Nic Schnettler, admitted that they were fraudulent. After pleading guilty to mail fraud, Mr. Schnettler was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay $7,000 in restitution by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Although the ARCO proceeding was closed on December 3, 1993, five of the six Applicants were given thirty days from the date of the Decision to file Applications on their own in the ARCO proceeding. The other Applicant has an Application pending.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corp./New York Telephone Co., 3/30/94, RR300&hyph;256  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI) in the Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding on behalf of New York Telephone Company (NYT). RRI, in filing the Motion, requested that the DOE reverse its earlier decisions dismissing NYT's Application for Refund because it was filed after the final filing deadline in the Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding. RRI further alleged that certain staff members of the DOE were prejudiced against RRI and that the prejudice influenced the DOE's decision to dismiss NYT's Application for Refund and deny NYT's first Motion for Reconsideration. The DOE, as a discretionary matter, reviewed the Motion and determined that it should be denied. The DOE found that RRI had presented no new information or compelling reason that warranted reversing the previous decisions. The DOE also found RRI's allegations of bias to be unfounded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Murphy Construction Co., et al., 3/28/94, RF272&hyph;91456 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting seven Applications for Refund filed in the crude oil refund proceeding. This Decision and Order incorporated simplified language as part of an ongoing attempt to improve service to the DOE's stakeholders and customers. With respect to one application, the DOE noted that the applicant had included purchases of asphalt concrete. The DOE held that asphalt concrete did not qualify as a covered product and therefore reduced the applicant's gallonage to reflect the exclusion of asphalt concrete. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Standard Oil Co. (Amoco)/Indiana, 3/29/94, RM21&hyph;265 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The State of Indiana filed a Motion for Modification of a previously-approved second-stage refund plan. The Motion, if granted, would allow the State to use $123,750 of Amoco monies to fund its Fuel Saver Van Program. Under Indiana's proposal, up to three vans containing automobile diagnostic equipment will travel to thirty cities in the State of Indiana. The equipment in the vans will be used to inspect motorists' vehicles free of charge. Once an analysis is completed, each motorist will be given a detailed description of all items inspected and their condition. The analyses will focus on problems affecting excess gasoline consumption and vehicle emissions. The State predicts that the Program will help injured consumers improve the energy efficiency of their automobiles and save them money by reducing the amount of fuel they consume. The $123,750 that Indiana proposes to use for this program has not previously been allocated to another program. However, since Indiana had not been reflecting in its oil overcharge account all of the interest earned on Amoco monies previously transferred to it, the State itself has supplied $123,750 which would have been the total amount of interest earned on Amoco monies received by the State, but was not previously posted to its account. The DOE has previously approved funds for state support of the Fuel Saver Van Program. Accordingly, the Motion for Modification was granted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./J.H. Rose Truck Line, Inc., 4/1/94, RF321&hyph;19063 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> LK, Inc. filed an Application for Refund on behalf of First Interstate Bank of Texas (First Interstate), requesting a refund based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products made by J.H. Rose Truck Line (Rose). The Application stated that First Interstate was a secured creditor in Rose's bankruptcy proceeding. In considering this request, the DOE found that First Interstate had not demonstrated that it had a clear and undisputed right to Rose's Texaco refund. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order denying the Application for Refund filed on behalf of First Interstate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./M &amp; M Transportation Co., 4/1/94, RR321&hyph;150 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> LK, Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that had denied its Application for Refund in the Texaco refund proceeding with respect to purchases made by M &amp; M Transportation Company (M&amp;M), a bankrupt firm. The DOE determined that the Motion did not present any compelling reason to reconsider the earlier decision. Specifically, the DOE found that the purported assignment of M&amp;M's right to a Texaco refund to LK in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding did not meet the strict standard adopted for approving such assignments in the precedential case of Gulf Oil Corp./Spector Red Ball, Inc.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23 DOE &para;85,011 (1993). The DOE further found that there was no reason for applying a more lenient standard in this case since the assignment did not expressly convey the right to apply for a product refund in the Texaco proceeding and LK's payment to M&amp;M was unconscionably low. Accordingly, LK's motion was denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Mike's Texaco on Henry Kevin's Texaco, 4/1/94, RF321&hyph;8931, RF321&hyph;9514 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund filed on behalf of two indirect purchasers, Mike's Texaco on Henry and Kevin's Texaco, in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Each applicant stated that it had no records from which to determine the number of gallons of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order period and submitted estimated figures obtained from a chart labelled ``Information compiled from the National Petroleum News Fact Book'' (Chart). The DOE rejected the use of the Chart in estimating the applicant's gallonage figures because it failed to differentiate between different types of retailers and because the Chart defied established historical trends in petroleum sales during the consent order period. Because neither applicant could establish the volumes of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order period, the DOE determined that granting the applicants a refund would not constitute restitution for Texaco's alleged overcharges. Consequently, the DOE denied the Applications for Refund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Tiger Oil Company, 3/29/94, RD272&hyph;68538, RF272&hyph;68538  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund to Tiger Oil Company (Tiger), an oil drilling contractor, in the Subpart V crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. The application was submitted by Edward Mike Davis, owner of Tiger, through Federal Refunds, Inc. (FRI), a private filing service. In the application, FRI estimated that Tiger purchased 204,529,860 gallons of refined petroleum products during the crude oil price control period. Neither Davis nor FRI submitted any documentation to support this estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE later learned that Tiger is the subject of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. The DOE contacted the trustee in bankruptcy, who had Tiger's records examined by two petroleum engineers. The petroleum engineers calculated from the records that Tiger purchased 18,729,672 gallons of refined petroleum products during the price control period. The DOE adjusted Tiger's gallonage claim in accordance with the petroleum engineers' estimate, and directed the refund check to the trustee to provide appropriate restitution to Tiger. In addition, the DOE denied a motion by a group of States and Territories, which argued that Tiger had passed the crude oil overcharges onto its customers. The total volume approved in the Decision and Order is 18,729,672 gallons, and the total refund amount granted is $14,984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

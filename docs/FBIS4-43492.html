			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- The election of Michael Bashford as the  new federal chairman of the Instead Party was declared void by  the Augsburg Land Court on Thursday [16 June]. The eighth  chamber of the court says in its ruling that there were grave  procedural mistakes in the 4 June election by the federal  convention. This decision sustained the claim by Munich law  professor Bernd Schuenemann, the previous chairman.    Under the threat of an administrative fine of up to 500,000  German marks, Bashford and party founder Markus Wegner were  forbidden to claim that Schuenemann was voted down by the  federal convention. The claim that Bashford is the new federal  chairman must not be made or spread either.    At the meeting in Hamburg, Bashford had won a majority. The  court's ruling states that some of the land organizations had  not been invited. Although the Hamburg Land Court had ruled  prior to the convention that the North Rhine-Westphalian land  organization must be invited, the North Rhine-Westphalian  delegates had not had the right to vote, speak, or submit a  motion. This is a clear violation of the delegates' rights, the  ruling says.</p>

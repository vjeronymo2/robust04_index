			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government agencies are reportedly split in their  opinions as to who was responsible for Tuesday's railway bomb  attack in Songkhla.    Well-informed Interior Ministry sources disclosed that  Fourth  Army Region Commander Lt-Gen Kitti Rattanachaya has told the  Interior Ministry that "a third party" was responsible for the  attack.    However, the police and the southern authority have  submitted  preliminary reports to the Interior Ministry blaming southern  separatist bandits.    The sources said Lt-Gen Kitti, in his report to the Interior  Ministry, said the bomb attack was not the work of members of  Pattani United Liberation Organisation [PULO] but that of a  "third hand" who wanted to create more problems for the  government.    However, Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre  Director Wisut Singkhachonworakun and the police said PULO  separatists were behind the attack.    Mr Wisut said it has yet to be established which faction of  the group was responsible for the attack on the railroad track  in Chana District of Songkhla Province.    Local officials have been instructed to gather information  to  find out if this faction is a new or old group of the PULO, he  said.    Mr Wisut said no promises had been made to the separatist  bandits, as suggested by some news reports. It was reported  that the group claimed in a letter left at the scene of the  attack that the Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre  had promised the bandits they would speed up the investigation  into the torching of schools in the south last year.    He said the centre would try to prevent a similar recurrence  but admitted that the task would be difficult.    Police Department deputy chief Phongamat Amattayakun said it  was believed that the separatists might have received support  from overseas.    Pol Gen [Police General] Phongamat said local politicians  should be able to help play a role in solving the problem of  subversive activities in the south as they were familiar with  local problems.    "The incident (the bomb attack) is a political problem. The  local politicians should know it well and should help solve it,"  Pol Gen Phongamat said.    Meanwhile, Deputy Police Department Chief for Crime  Suppression Phot Bunyachinda yesterday ordered security to be  beefed up at public buildings and bus and train terminals after  Tuesday's attack.    In his order to the regional police headquarters in the  south, policemen are to set up highway checkpoints and conduct  random searches of vehicles of suspicious-looking people around  the clock to prevent another attack.    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday ruled  out speculation that the bomb attack at Songkhla was designed to  discredit him.    Gen Chawalit said the police have submitted a preliminary  report but he would have to wait for a detailed investigation  and analysis to determine if the attack was really conducted by  the PULO, as stated in the letter placed at the blast site.    Gen Chawalit said it was probably the work of certain  movements that have been operating for 40-50 years already,  which have begun using weapons. [passage omitted]    Gen Chawalit said it is noticeable that the groups are  beginning to come out of the woodwork. "The people should  carefully watch their movements without being shaken about it."    The Interior Minister said one should understand that the  bomb blasts have occurred in many places and would continue to  happen because there are many kinds of people in society, where  there are different kinds of conflicts, both concerning personal  issues and business.

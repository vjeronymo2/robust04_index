			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Porsche to cut workforce by a quarter as sales fall PORSCHE, the troubled German luxury carmaker, yesterday announced a swingeing round of job cuts, the second during the current business year, which it said were unavoidable if it was to preserve its independence over the long term. The company also warned of deteriorating conditions in markets which had hitherto been strong, for example in Germany, Italy and Japan, together with continuing problems in the US and the UK. It said export sales would be made even more difficult because of the recent turbulence in European currency markets and the strengthening of the D-Mark. The bleak statement, which gives the first indication of the circumstances leading up to the surprise replacement of Mr Arno Bohn as chief executive by Mr Wendelin Wiedeking last week, concluded by saying that Porsche was expecting a further fall in profits and sales during the current business year, following sales down from DM3.1bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to DM2.7bn in the year to end-July. Porsche explained yesterday it intended to cuts its workforce by a further 1,000 people this year, in addition to the 850 job cuts already announced. This means that during 1992-93 the workforce will shrink by almost a quarter from the 8,062 employees at the end of July. The job cuts, which are intended to fall equally on all areas of the business, will go hand in hand with restructuring measures which are designed to lead to a sharp improvement in efficiency. 'The management board has decided that this package of measures is unavoidable if the company is to remain independent over the long term,' the statement said, emphasising that the family shareholders which control the company were determined to preserve its independence despite its current difficulties. While the statement provided the background to the change of chief executive, it gave no indication of the precise problems which lead to Mr Bohn's departure because of disagreements over 'matters of business policy' last week. In response to questions, the company said Porsche and Mr Bohn had agreed to keep quiet over the circumstances of his departure. Porsche said that in the year to end-July it sold 22,481 cars, down from 26,486 in the previous year. The share taken by exports fell from 61 to 49 per cent, with unit sales rising by 9 per cent to 11,404 in Germany but falling by 30 per cent to 11,077 abroad. In the mid-eighties, sales amounted to 50,000, with 30,000 cars sold in the US alone.</p>

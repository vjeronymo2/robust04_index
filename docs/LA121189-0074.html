			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> NEW 'DINNER AT EIGHT' A STYLISH DELIGHT ON TNT  </P> <P> The 1933 "Dinner at Eight" is such a cherished Hollywood classic that one can  only approach a remake with trepidation. Yet TNT's new production, which  premieres at 5 and repeats at 7 tonight, is a sparkling delight, thanks to an  apt cast and especially to writer Tom Griffin.  </P> <P> His updating is shrewd: His imaginative array of contemporary references  underline what is timeless in playwrights George S. Kaufman's and Edna Ferber's  observations of human nature. (Griffin was also able to draw upon the original  screenplay by Frances Marion and Herman Mankiewicz, with additional dialogue by  Donald Ogden Stewart.)  </P> <P> The cast is such a pleasure that they deserve your attempt to try to forget who  originally played their parts. Lauren Bacall sets the tone for the occasion  with her elegance and sophistication. She is a glamorous, self-described trash  novelist who has lived beyond her means.  </P> <P> She is to be the most glittering of the guests invited by Marsha Mason, the  social butterfly wife of New York shipping company owner John Mahoney, an old  flame of Bacall's. Mahoney is a gentlemanly Establishment WASP whose  100-years-plus family concern is threatened with a takeover.  </P> <P> Almost every one of Mason's invitees is in the grip of some kind of crisis.  Worst off is Harry Hamlin, playing an egotistical ex-TV series star wired on  coke and hitting the skids hard. Mason and Mahoney haven't an inkling that  their spoiled daughter (Stacy Edwards) is in love with him. Then there's  Charles Durning's loud, coarse (and very shrewd) tycoon, who is at war with his  flashy wife (Ellen Greene), who sees Mason's invitation as a longed-for chance  for social acceptance.  </P> <P> Ron Lagomarsino's direction is more theatrical than cinematic, and that suits  the material and the medium just fine. Durning and especially Greene play  broadly, but that's part of the fun. Mahoney emerges as a figure of dignity and  sympathy, and Mason gets the chance to show us that the wife has some substance  after all.  </P> <P> This "Dinner at Eight" is a very stylish affair, with settings designed by Jame  Osmann and costumes designed by Rita Ryack. It will encore Sunday at 1 p.m. and  Dec. 21 at 5 p.m. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

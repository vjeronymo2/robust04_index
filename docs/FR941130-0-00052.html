			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In establishing Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, the FAA carefully evaluated the relevant design parameters of the BAe Model 4100 and determined that the main aisle configuration is clearly not what was envisioned by the regulations. The regulations do not specifically prohibit the arrangement proposed; however, the policy in effect is predicated on a largely straight aisle which has only one or two lateral deviations; in other words, a traditional cabin arrangement. Therefore, special conditions were developed to establish design criteria which result in a level of safety equivalent to configurations on which the regulations were based. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has requested that the FAA amend Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45 to allow a maximum passenger seating capacity of 30, to account for a new customer demand, and be responsive to the market. In their request Jetstream contends that there is no technical basis for the limitation on passenger capacity, and that the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) have, in fact, already granted such approval. Jetstream has proposed that on the basis of harmonization with the JAA, the FAA should consider their request favorably. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream further contends that the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions for the 29 passenger Model 4101 illustrated that there is no impediment due to the aisle arrangement for 30 passengers. Jetstream argues that the concern that prompted the requirement was therefore demonstrated not to exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the special conditions, the FAA took account of the several favorable cabin safety features that the 29 passenger Model 4101 incorporates. One of the major features was the good exit-to-passenger ratio for the number of passengers requested. That is, one pair of Type II exists and one pair of Type III exists for 29 passenger seats, where the regulations allow up to 39. In this regard, 29 passenger seats was the largest arrangement proposed for a US customer. Consequently, the FAA did not consider a greater passenger seating capacity, and the issue of harmonization with JAA requirements did not come up. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the evacuation demonstration conducted in accordance with the special conditions, this demonstration was a modified version of the demonstration specified in part 25, Appendix J. The principal modification was the use of a single exit (in this case, the forward Type I exit) instead of one half of the total number of exits installed. The demonstration was conducted this way in order to provide for maximum usage of the aisle, by the maximum number of passengers. While this demonstration was completed in 54 seconds, the resultant overall rates of egress were not particularly fast for this type of exit. In addition, the evacuees appeared to steady themselves on seatbacks to a higher degree than is typically seen in such demonstrations. Thus, while there was no clear obstruction due to the aisle, the overall egress rates did seem to be somewhat reduced. The FAA therefore considers that the aisle arrangement should result in a limit on maximum passenger capacity that is reduced over the theoretical limit in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30 passenger seats in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted for approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for the JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of amending the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passenger seats is somewhat arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger arrangement proposed by Jetstream is consistent with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located on the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the passageway for the aft exit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate, requirements were drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve the level of safety that is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that an additional passenger seat would not invalidate the basis for the original finding of equivalency. It is noted however, that any further increase in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result in more than ten seat rows on at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would very likely require the development of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered aisle should limit the passenger seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations. Under the terms of these special conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

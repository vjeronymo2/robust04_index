But at a North Ossetia Security council sesion Akhsarbek  Galazov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, stated that  "a number of instructions which North Ossetia is now being  obliged to fulfill were not examined at all at the Nalchik  conference." In the opinion of local observers this divergent  interpretation of the documents adopted in the capital of  Kabardino-Balkaria is connected with the forthcoming 16 January  elections of the North Ossetia president. If the public finds  out that a representative of North Ossetia has nonetheless  approved the final document in Nalchik, he will lose support  among voters..</p>

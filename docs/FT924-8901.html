			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Labour criticises 'missed chance' THE LABOUR party has accused the government of missing an opportunity to use Thursday's Autumn Statement to boost jobs, investment, training and education, Ralph Atkins writes. As the party prepares today to launch its 'national recovery programme' it is anxious to draw maximum political capital from the curbs to be imposed on public spending. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will call for cuts in interest rates, an employment package, a co-ordinated European recovery policy and tax incentives for industry. He will also stress Labour's commitment to boosting co-operation between the private and public sectors on infrastructure projects amid signs that the government will steal some of the party's political clothes with its own proposals for joint projects. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said yesterday that the Autumn Statement would consist of 'betrayed pledges and broken promises'. It would mark 'lost opportunities for education, for training, for investment, for transport infrastructure and much else'. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the health department would try to disguise cuts planned in its spending by 'tricks' including deliberately underestimating health-service inflation.</p>

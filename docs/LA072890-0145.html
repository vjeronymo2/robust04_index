			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLASS GLASS;  </P> <P> MEDIUM OF KNICKKNACKS RISES TO FINE ART  </P> <P> Back East they probably have a joke about Californians who live in glass  houses. No doubt the punch line involves earthquakes.  </P> <P> And though Eileen Kremen has lived in a glass house of sorts for 17 years, she  says she isn't worried. As owner of the Eileen Kremen Gallery in Fullerton, she  knows that glass doesn't always live up to its fragile image.  </P> <P> "It's sensuous and tactile," says Kremen, fingering the edge of a sculptural  piece she has just installed for her summer show. "But it's not fragile. It  doesn't frighten me."  </P> <P> Since she began stocking glass paperweights and kaleidoscopes to show along  with the painting and sculpture that characterized her gallery, Kremen's  interest in glass art has grown with its supply. She beams about the current  glass renaissance that has lined every available pedestal in her place with  glass objects. The paperweights and kaleidoscopes have been relegated to a  cabinet in the gift shop, and the paintings are gone.  </P> <P> "Glass art has changed in the last two decades," Kremen says. "The artists have  become more experimental, courageous and diverse, and they're integrating  things like wood, metal and stone into their work."  </P> <P> The art glass movement began in the early '60s when Harvey Littleton, an  engineer working with a large commercial glass manufacturer, devised a  small-scale method of producing blown glass. Littleton then had a show of the  first crude vessels he produced, along with the furnace, tools and formulas he  created to bring glass art into the realm of the individual artist. Suddenly,  it seemed every artist was working in glass.  </P> <P> Studios sprang up throughout the country using Littleton's technique. Among  them was Correia Art Glass, a Santa Monica studio that produces original  hand-blown glass for gallerys such as Lippe/Waren Fine Crystal in Laguna Beach  and Pacesetters in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Bruce Sharp of Lippe/Waren says a problem for the collector of art glass is  that old dichotomy: does one buy art for art's sake, or should the art object  be capable of holding a fruit salad? He admits that the most popular glass art  for the consumer is functional.  </P> <P> So many glass artists choose lamps, goblets and vases as structures for their  designs.  </P> <P> Artist Joan Irving of San Diego has gained some notoriety for her hip  functional art glass -- coffee tables, picture frames, bowls and bottles that  have been cut, polished, slumped, sand blasted and then reverse-painted.  </P> <P> "Magical things happen with glass," says Irving. "I'm fascinated by the quality  of light that reflects from it and through it. It's very, very seductive."  </P> <P> And as the vanity makes a comeback in home furnishings, so do the little  perfume bottles that are displayed there, and Irving makes a lot of those. But  this is only one way to collect glass, says Efrem Zimbalist III, chairman of  Correia.  </P> <P> "Glass should be collected like any fine art, because you love the piece --  because you respond to it. Not for its investment value," says Kremen.  </P> <P> Zimbalist agrees, especially since art glass is generally not regarded as a  mature art form. Though its presence on the secondary market is usually  represented by Lalique crystal vases, Zimbalist says glass art can fetch as  much as $100,000 in the galleries.  </P> <P> Which would indicate that glass's status as a serious art form is indeed  beginning to mature. Another indication could be the recent move of New York's  premier glass dealer, the Heller Gallery, from its uptown Madison Avenue spot  to Soho, the ephemeral downtown district where new art is being made and shown.  You might say glass art is on the cutting edge.  </P> <P> Artists and collectors alike are beginning to see new potential in glass, says  Zimbalist.  </P> <P> "The technology today is far superior to earlier glass art that is turning up  at (major auction houses) Sotheby's and Christie's," he says, referring to the  works of such glass heroes as Tiffany, Carter and Daum. The artist must grasp  the physical properties of glass to manipulate its color and form. "Today's  glass artist has to be both an aesthete and a technologist," Zimbalist adds.  </P> <P> Glass is basically sand heated to its melting point, then cooled, a process  discovered about 3,500 years ago. Its first applications were utilitarian, but  the artistic possibilities inherent in blown glass resulted in decorative  touches almost immediately.  </P> <P> Sculptors like Toland Peter Sand use a high-tech coating on glass originally  developed as lenses for heat-seeking missiles. Dichroic glass has been coated  with thin metals that reflect certain wavelengths of light while allowing  others to pass through, resulting in a color that is constantly changing.  </P> <P> Artists and collectors are realizing that the play of light and color make  glass a versatile and original material for art. And today's art patron is more  sophisticated, opting for the wire/corrugated steel of a Frank Gehry design  rather than the overwrought stained glass of building materials past. As an  architectural element, glass can sometimes stand up to earthquakes.  </P></p>

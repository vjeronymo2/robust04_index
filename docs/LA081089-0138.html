			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL SIZE LIMIT WOULD NOT AFFECT GAY EVENT  </P> <P> A proposed size limit on all festivals in Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana  would not prevent the Gay Pride Festival in September but would ban any future  event that attracting large crowds, including the Mother's Day Festival and the  Cinco De Mayo celebration, city officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young has asked the city attorney's office to draft an  ordinance that would prohibit events that attract more than 5,000 people to the  87-acre park at Fairview Street and Edinger Avenue.  </P> <P> "Any crowd that reaches above 5,000 people doesn't belong in a neighborhood  park," Young said Wednesday. "They belong in a stadium or a facility larger  than a park."  </P> <P> Young said the long-term controversy over the gay festival prompted him to ask  for the ordinance.  </P> <P> "That festival made me think whether the park is an appropriate setting for  such a large number of people," Young said.  </P> <P> The mayor also said the ordinance is directed against profit-making groups that  charge fees for events held in the park. Those groups, he said, usually have  concession stands selling beer and attract a rowdier crowd.  </P> <P> "My motivation is to get beer-drinking events out of Centennial and into some  place where they can be controlled easier," Young said.  </P> <P> City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said the city can set a limit on crowd size as long  as the ordinance does not discriminate against any group.  </P> <P> Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural Pride, said the proposal  reflects the pressure on the City Council from the controversy over the  festival.  </P> <P> "I guess if I was on the City Council, I would be scrambling as well to prevent  this sort of controversy in the future," Avery said.  </P> <P> Avery estimated that 4,000 people will attend the festival the first day, Sept.  9, and that about 6,000 will attend on Sept. 10.  </P> <P> But Councilman John Acosta said the ban proposed by Young would be unfair to  all the nonprofit groups that have traditionally held their festivals in the  park. Only the gay festival, he said, should be prohibited.  </P> <P> "We're going to hurt these other groups just because we want to stop one  undesirable element from having their festival," Acosta said.  </P> <P> Acosta said he would support the proposal only if it was enacted as an  emergency ordinance, which would take effect immediately and therefore prevent  the gay-pride festival, he said.  </P> <P> But Cooper said an emergency ordinance can only be proposed if public peace,  health or safety is jeopardized.  </P> <P> "I've seen no facts to suggest that this proposal should be considered an  emergency," Cooper said.  </P> <P> Serjio Velazquez, editor and publisher of the Spanish-language weekly  Miniondas, which sponsors the Mother's Day Festival in May, said the newspaper  plans to look for alternative sites and talk to city officials. The Mother's  Day Festival, which has been held in Santa Ana for four years, attracts a crowd  of about 45,000 annually.  </P> <P> "We can do it in other cities. But it has been a nice park to hold the  festival. We don't want to change places," Velazquez said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Moira Whittle, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] A British aviation company director tonight  condemned the seizure of one of the firm's planes in Yemen as an  act of "air piracy".    Andy King, director of Gatwick-based ANA Aviation, said the  Boeing 707 aircraft's cargo contained nothing more sensitive  than torch batteries.    The aircraft was on route for Aden with a cargo for the  Southern Yemen airline al-Yemda when it was forced to land at  al-Hudaydah airport near Sanaa, by the military. The four-man  crew, which included a British engineer, left Britain with the  cargo on Saturday night.    After the Ugandan-registered plane was forced down they were  held at the airport for 18 hours before being released.    "This is air piracy as far as we are concerned," said Mr  King. "The plane had permission to go to Aden. You can't force  airplanes out of the sky. It's against international law. We  are being used as a pawn between the North and South Yemenis,"  he said.    "There was nothing dangerous or of a military nature on  board. There were just batteries and some pharmaceuticals,"  added Mr King.    He said various diplomatic efforts were being made and it  was  hoped the plane would be able to take off again with its cargo  tomorrow.    A Yemeni interior ministry official said the plane was  seized  because it was carrying batteries for military equipment and  communications sets and had entered the country's airspace  without the knowledge or approval of the authorities.    Tension has been growing recently between the formerly  Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) and  the north.</p>

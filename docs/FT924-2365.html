			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reducing CGT bill I AM A British citizen married to a French national and we own a house in France. We lived there for six years until my employer transferred me and the family to work in Italy, where we have lived in rented accommodation for the past seven years. The French house was rented out, and still is, to a third party. Now my employer is transferring me to Britain and I wish to buy a house there. Would I have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the French house? If so, is there any way to reduce or mitigate it? It is probably not possible to mitigate the prospective CGT bill on the sale of the French house. Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, United Kingdom WC2R 1LB, for copies of the free pamphlets CCT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and IR2O (Residents and non-residents: liability to tax in the UK). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

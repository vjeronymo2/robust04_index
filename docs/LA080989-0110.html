			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOSS CALLED TO FACE COURT FOR POLLUTION;  </P> <P> PENNWALT EXECUTIVE FORCED BY JUDGE TO APPEAR, ENTER PLEA  </P> <P> The chief executive of the Pennwalt Corp., making an extraordinary court  appearance at a judge's demand, entered a guilty plea on his company's behalf  today to charges of polluting a waterway in 1985.  </P> <P> Edwin E. Tuttle, Pennwalt chief executive and chairman, assured U.S. District  Judge Jack Tanner that the chemical company will do all it can to avoid another  toxic spill.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and legal experts have said Tanner, by requiring Tuttle to  appear in person, could set a precedent for punishing corporate negligence.  </P> <P> The charges against Pennwalt grew out of the spill of at least 75,000 gallons  of bleach into a waterway opening onto Puget Sound. The bleach, sodium  dichromate, contained hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1.1-Million Fine  </P> <P> In May, Pennwalt agreed to pay a $1.1-million fine and to plead guilty to five  misdemeanor counts after criminal charges against four company officials,  including three executives, were dropped. Tuttle was not charged.  </P> <P> Twice, however, Tanner refused to accept guilty pleas from attorneys and  lower-ranking executives of the Philadelphia-based company, demanding instead  that the "top man" appear before him.  </P> <P> Prosecutors have said the case is one of the first in which the government  based its prosecution on corporate negligence rather than deliberate  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> It may also be the first instance in which a corporate executive has been  ordered to plead the guilt of the corporation.  </P> <P> In close questioning during a one-hour hearing, Tanner today repeatedly asked  Tuttle who would be accountable for the spill and for preventing a recurrence.  </P> <P> "I'm here to tell you that as chief executive officer of Pennwalt that I'm here  to represent Pennwalt and say that Pennwalt is responsible" for the events that  occurred, Tuttle said.  </P> <P> Prosecutor David Marshall, questioned extensively by Tanner about the terms of  the plea agreement and why the government agreed to it, pointed out that  Pennwalt was paying a higher fine than called for under the law.  </P></p>

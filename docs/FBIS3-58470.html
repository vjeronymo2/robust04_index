			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard says France will  continue to sell motorized armored vehicles and nonoffensive  secondary military materiel to Taiwan. Taiwan has said it has  no doubt that France will respect the contracts for deliveries  that have already been signed, but it is worried about future  deliveries of spare parts.    Jean-Marie Le Pen says France has acted dishonorably by  abandoning Taiwan to normalize its relations with China.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> THE REAL BRITAIN WAS NOT SEEN IN ARTS FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> THE ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRATION WAS MORE A RETAIL PROMOTION THAN A CULTURAL  EVENT.  </P> <P> Item: British crafts people who gambled a chunk of money to fly overseas and  rent booths at "Chelsea Comes to California," a Festival of Britain event at  South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, watched glumly while a trickle of visitors  gawked politely at what they assumed was a museum show.  </P> <P> Apparently, no one had informed Orange County viewers that the jewelry,  clothing, furniture and objets d'art on view, selected by a panel of British  crafts professionals, were for sale. Although the confusion eventually cleared  up, a week after the event opened several booth occupants were only guardedly  optimistic about whether the event was worth the trip.  </P> <P> At the original Chelsea Crafts Fair in London, named for the chichi district  where the event has been held for the past decade, there is no confusion.  People come to buy, just as they do at any other crafts fair.  </P> <P> It is amusing that the Festival of Britain -- whose marketing folks kept  insisting they were putting on a real arts festival, not a just a consumer  goods promotion -- managed to obscure the straightforward commercialism of  "Chelsea" in a misty haze of high culture.  </P> <P> Item: About half of the objects in "British Design 1790-1990" -- an exhibit of  British crafts organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London -- were  made during the past two years, and many were lent directly by the designer or  manufacturer, not the museum.  </P> <P> Since the 1988 appointment of Elizabeth Esteve-Coll as director of the museum,  the revered institution -- founded in 1852 and known for its extraordinary  collection of medieval-to-modern objects and preparatory studies for works of  art -- has suffered radical changes.  </P> <P> The changes include exhibitions revealing closer -- some would say incestuous  -- ties with commercial firms, a far greater stress on pop culture and  contemporary life in general (the current show is a 40-year retrospective of  couturier Pierre Cardin), and a reorganization of the staff that overrides the  expertise of trained and experienced curators.  </P> <P> In a 1989 article in the New York Review of Books, "The Fall of a Great  Museum," eminent scholar John Pope-Hennessey, a former director of the museum,  accused Esteve-Coll of being "a relentless vulgarizer," an administrator  (rather than an academic) who is merely a tool of the philistine trustees of  the museum, appointed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> For an annual visitor to Britain, the notion of a Festival of Britain poses a  conundrum: Which Britain are they celebrating -- the real one or the fond  concoction of some PR office?  </P> <P> Is it the average American tourist's rose-colored set of half-truths -- a land  where a Queen still rules, tweedy individuals with fancy titles own rambling  country estates packed with chintz-covered furniture, universities are  ivy-twined bastions of plummy privilege, people drink tea and pick daintily at  clotted cream and crustless sandwiches every afternoon, judges in the courts  still wear wigs, fancifully costumed guards stand at attention at the Tower of  London and trilling accents make every word sound like Shakespeare?  </P> <P> Or is it the Britain where centuries of stuffy privilege have ceded authority  to a legion of go-getters and self-starters? A country where, as many critics  allege, Conservative Party leadership has introduced a cynical dog-eat-dog  mentality -- in which government funding of social welfare and arts  organizations is dramatically slashed, a poll tax is levied on homeowner and  poverty-level renter alike and yuppie greed has replaced altruistic concern?  </P> <P> Is it a country fighting a civil war with inhabitants of Northern Ireland? A  country serviced by Third World street cleaners and dishwashers? A land where  artistic vitality is fueled at street level by the descendants of '70s punk  bands and the dogged survival of anti-Establishment "fringe" theater groups?  </P> <P> Unsurprisingly, the noisiest emphasis in the festival was on hoary tradition  and snazzy contemporary trends.  </P> <P> The rose-colored crowd got its "300 years of British pomp and pageantry" at  South Coast Plaza in the guise of a group of ceremonial royal robes, a sampling  of teatime treats, a Rolls-Royce balanced on Wedgwood teacups, an "authentic  London taxicab" and a visit from Princess Alexandra.  </P> <P> The Orange County nouveau riche contingent -- who'd likely be Thatcher  supporters if they lived Over There -- presumably got their jollies from  various consumer goods events, including the British design show, a model house  equipped with British goods, and a series of lectures on business-related  topics.  </P> <P> But anti-Thatcher voices were in notably short supply, despite their  significant role in British arts today. We heard from their corner only in  indirect ways.  </P> <P> Tony Cragg's sculptures at Newport Harbor Art Museum are often made of  fragments of industrial refuse, sometimes resembling distorted natural forms or  science lab tools. With the exception of his vast wall relief, "Riot" -- a  brilliantly "common" reconceptualizing of a type of imagery found in ancient  Roman reliefs, using bits and pieces of old plastic objects -- Cragg's work may  appear to be apolitical.  </P> <P> But despite the diverse appearance of the sculptures Cragg has produced over  the past 15 years, his work overwhelmingly indicates a belief in a  relativistic, unpredictable universe, knowable only by direct personal  experience.  </P> <P> Some of the sculptures are made of humble castoffs reimagined into new forms.  Other pieces are large-scale bronzes that -- contrary to the solid majesty of  the medium -- have a loosely experimental quality. In his refusal to  acknowledge hierarchies of subject matter and materials or assumptions of  stylistic integrity, he flies in the face of the conservative preference for  works of art (and social groups) that are neatly defined and know their place.  </P> <P> Gordon Onslow-Ford, whose visionary paintings (in "Pursuit of the Marvelous" at  the Laguna Art Museum) have as little as possible to do with things of this  world, loathed the strictures and stuffiness of England of the 1920s, as he  said in a recent interview. As a young man he happily turned his back on his  native land for the delights of Paris, Mexico and Northern California.  </P> <P> Stanley William Hayter, a painter and experimental etcher also in "Pursuit of  the Marvelous," was an avowed leftist who used his art to support the  Loyalists' cause during the Spanish Civil War. He died in 1988, a year before  Thatcher took office.  </P> <P> Calum Colvin and Ron O'Donnell, showing installations and large-scale  photographs at Cal State Fullerton, send up some ingrained attitudes of their  fellow Scots in gentle ways. But the biting edge of Scottish nationalism, the  barely controlled fury at what is perceived as economic favoritism of Southern  Britain, is not discernible in their work.  </P> <P> The one imported British theater offering, Alan Plater's "Sweet Sorrow" at the  Irvine Barclay Theatre, performed by the Hull Truck Theatre, had a distinctly  literary theme (the poetry of Philip Larkin) without significant political  overtones.  </P> <P> And of course the tripping melodies and devilishly clever rhymes of Gilbert and  Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The Pirates of Penzance" -- the D'Oyly Carte Opera  Company's offerings at the Performing Arts Center -- are products of the 19th  Century. Even back then, the benign anti-Establishment digs that pepper the  lyrics were perceived as simply jolly good fun.  </P> <P> It looks like the only place we can hope to hear the authentic voice of British  liberals looking for a return of basic values will be South Coast Repertory's  West Coast premiere of David Hare's "The Secret Rapture," which I saw a couple  of years ago in London.  </P> <P> At the center of the play is a genuinely saintly woman, Isobel, who owns a  small commercial art firm. Her sister Marion is a coldly calculating junior  minister in the Conservative Party; Marion's husband is an impossibly unctuous  born-again Christian who runs an outfit called Christians in Business. When  Isobel's and Marion's alcoholic mother needs help, everyone's true colors are  revealed.  </P> <P> Hare has said that he doesn't see the play in political terms, which doesn't  mitigate its power: Art is most effective when it doesn't clobber viewers over  the head with a bag full of propaganda. But Isobel's painfully lonely position  -- her refusal to make life easy for herself by capitulating to the  opportunistic folks around her -- says a lot about the temper of the times in  today's Britain.  </P> <P> Maybe you're thinking it would have been unrealistic to expect a festival  partially sponsored by the British government and British corporations to bite  the hands that feed it. But that's one of the difficulties of having a cultural  festival enrobed within a retail promotion (in itself, a concept that reeks of  Thatcherism).  </P> <P> Had the festival been the brainchild of a cultural group or a Peter  Sellars-style impresario, had it been conceived solely as an arts event -- with  input from a broad range of British arts groups, large and small, radical and  mainstream -- we'd have stood a better chance of understanding the real  Britain, and the overwhelming social tensions confronting it today.  </P></p>

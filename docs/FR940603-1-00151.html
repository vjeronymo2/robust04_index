This section includes the miscellaneous assembly units as shown on the respective underground construction drawings. Where miscellaneous units consist of or include a primary cable termination, the unit includes the preparation of the cable to accommodate the termination, the stress cone and the connection of the cable to the terminal equipment. Pad assembly units are in this section and include the site preparation, bedding, drainable material when specified, cable slot, backfilling, tamping and the pad in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,tp0,i1,xls32,7,7,7 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Unit No.  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1 Unit price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Labor  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Materials  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Labor and materials <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> UM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section UR_Underground Excavation Assembly Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> UR1&hyph;S (D) Plowing Assembly Unit, Soil_Consists of one (1) lineal foot of plowing in soil, measured parallel to the surface of the ground, to a specified depth (D), in inches, including the compacting, except as specifically provided for in other units. This unit includes all material and labor required in the repair and/or replacement of streets, roads, drives, fences, lawns, shrubbery, watermains, pipes, pipelines and contents, underground power and telephone facilities, buried sewerage and drainage facilities, and any other property damaged during the plowing of the cable, except as specifically provided for in other units. This unit does not include underground cable facilities installed in the slot.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Where in the judgment of the Owner greater than normal difficulty will be involved in plowing because of the presence of underground facilities of other utilities, this unit will be suffixed by the letter ``T''. This will be applicable only in those areas predesignated by the Owner on the detail maps herein. All plowing outside of the predesignated area on the map, regardless of the difficulty in placement actually experienced, will be inventoried as the regular UR1&hyph;S (D) units. If field conditions show the existence of rock to prevent the placing of the cable in soil to the depth required in the specifications the Owner may specify UR2&hyph;R units. Where more than one cable is to be installed in the slot, the UR1&hyph;S unit designation should be modified by a suffix corresponding to the number of cables installed. For example, UR1&hyph;S (D)3c for 3 cables plowed at one time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR2&hyph;S (D&amp;W) Trenching Assembly Unit, Soil_Consists of one (1) lineal foot of trenching in soil, measure parallel to the surface of the ground, to a specified depth (D) and width (W), in inches, including the excavation, and backfilling and compacting. This unit includes all material and labor required in the repair and/or replacement of streets, roads, drives, fences, lawns, shrubbery, watermains, pipes, pipelines and contents, underground power and telephone facilities, buried sewerage and drainage facilities, and any other property damaged by the trenching, except as specifically provided for in other units. This unit does not include underground cable facilities installed in the trench or cable bedding assembly units, when required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Where in the judgement of the Owner greater than normal difficulty will be involved in trenching because of the presence of underground facilities of other utilities, this unit will be suffixed by the letter ``T''. This will be applicable only in those areas predesignated by the Owner on the detail maps herein. Where more than one cable is to be installed in the trench, the regular UR2&hyph;S unit designation should be modified by a suffix corresponding to the construction drawing for the type of cable placement desired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR2&hyph;R (D&amp;W) Trenching Assembly Unit, Rock_Consists of one (1) lineal foot of trenching in rock, measured parallel to the surface of the ground, to specified depth (D) and width (W), in inches, including the excavation, and backfilling and compacting to place cable to the depth specified in the Specifications. This unit will be specified by the Owner only when field conditions at the site show the existence of rock at a depth preventing the placing of the cable in soil to the depths required in the Specifications. This unit includes all material and labor required in the repair and/or replacement of streets, roads, drives fences, lawns, shrubbery, watermains, pipes, pipelines and contents, underground power and telephone facilities, buried sewerage and drainage facilities, and any other property damaged by the trenching, except as specifically provided for in other units. This unit does not include underground cable facilities installed in the trench or cable bedding assembly units, when required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UR&hyph;3 Cable Bedding Assembly Unit_Consists of one (1) lineal foot of a two-inch bed of clean and or soil placed in the trench under the cable and a four-inch layer of clean sand or soil backfill over the cable to the width of the trench. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The exact location and number of units shall be determined by the Owner after the trenches are open in those areas where rock or other conditions make special bedding necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

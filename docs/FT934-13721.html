			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Santos accepts Boral's offer for Sagasco SANTOS, the Adelaide-based gas exploration and production company, yesterday announced that it was accepting the takeover offer by Boral for Sagasco, in respect of its 19.9 per cent interest in the target company, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Santos was a previous bidder for Sagasco but ran into opposition from the Australian Trade Practices Commission. Litigation between Santos and the TPC ensued. While this was still under way, Boral, the building materials group, put in an offer. Last week, with the support of the South Australia government which holds a controlling stake in Sagasco, Boral gained control of its target.</p>

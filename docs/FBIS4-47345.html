			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.N. Matichuk, engineer, and B.V. Solukha, </F> doctor of biological sciences, Power Generation Equipment Design  Institute (Energoproyekt) and VNIITAG (expansion not given); UDC  621.039+502.7]    [Abstract] A flowchart outlining a plan for ensuring  Ukraine's radiation safety has been presented. The proposed plan  calls for developing a monitoring system that is based on an  automated system of current information and that includes five  main components as follows:     -  ecological monitoring;    -  nuclear power plant monitoring;    -  an emergency control point;    -  a crisis center;    -  an automated radiation situation monitoring system.     The ecological monitoring component calls for developing an  automated system of up-to-date information on Ukraine's  environment and forecasts of any changes therein. The nuclear  power plant monitoring will, through an automated system,  provide current information regarding the condition of the  environment of rayons with nuclear power plants and will also  forecast changes likely to occur therein. These forecasts will  be based on numerous data sources, including meteorological,  geophysical, hydrological, geochemical, hydrogeological,  aerologic, actinometric, radiometric, biological, and special  medical observations. These forecasts will be used to plan  environmental protection measures and measures to recover  materials released from nuclear power plants. The emergency  control point will serve as the site where recommendations are  formulated regarding emergency measures to be taken at nuclear  power plants and from which technical and organizational  assistance can be provided to individuals managing emergency,  rescue, and restoration operations during the clearing of  accidents, catastrophes, natural disasters, or damage inflicted  on nuclear power plants as a result of sabotage or military  actions. The control center will also maintain communications  with government and social organizations. The automated  radiation situation monitoring system will monitoring and  forecast radiation situations at nuclear power plants, in  exclusion zones, and in observation zones during normal plant  operations and in the event of an accident. The routing of  information from source to user will vary depending on the type  of monitoring being conducted (i.e., regular, operational,  special). The exact interaction between the various monitoring  system elements is still being worked out. Figure 1.</p>

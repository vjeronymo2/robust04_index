			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Union concern after roof collapses at another pit A SECTION of roof supported by roof bolts at Ellington Colliery, Northumberland, collapsed earlier this week, British Coal confirmed yesterday. There was 'no comparison' between Tuesday's fall and last week's accident at Bilsthorpe Colliery, Nottingham, in which a roof supported by bolts collapsed, killing three men, British Coal added. Nobody was injured in the Ellington incident, 1,000 feet down and six miles out under the North Sea, in a fenced off area abandoned in May due to poor geological conditions. Mr Ian Lavery, Ellington branch secretary for the National Union of Mineworkers, said the incident had heightened concern already voiced by Ellington miners at the increasing use of roof bolts as a means of support. 'We fear for the safety of the members,' said Mr Lavery. 'We're not convinced roof bolts are safe.' He called for an independent inquiry into Tuesday's incident. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick who visited the colliery yesterday, urged a rigorous investigation. At a meeting today with Mr Tom Watson, pit manager, arranged before Tuesday's fall, the union will urge British Coal not to extend the use of roof bolts at Ellington. British Coal yesterday insisted the roof fall would probably have occured with traditional arched girders. It was pointless to install girders and they would not waste materials on an abandoned and sealed area. Men were working 100 yards from the disused Number Three roadway when a 45 foot long, 12 foot thick roof section of rock and coal crashed down. Mr Lavery said Ellington miners were still working in another area where roof bolts were the main support but were concerned about the situation.</p>

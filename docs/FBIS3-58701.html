			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stephen Goodwin under the "Inside Parliament" </F> rubric: "Major Exercises Very Considerable Caution"]    [Excerpt] John Major yesterday refused to extend the  commitment of British troops to help with humanitarian aid in  Bosnia. Reporting to the Commons on the NATO summit, the Prime  Minister parried repeated demands for air strikes, maintaining  he had the political will to order an attack if commanders near  at hand deemed it wise.    Displaying his customary contempt for the interventionist  approach of Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and  agreeing with Tory backbenchers who urged caution, Mr Major said  it was easy to say "all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or  two and all is well."    "It may well not be a wise policy. It may be necessary at  some stage, but it is a policy that should be entered into with  very considerable caution."    The 16 NATO leaders reaffirmed a readiness to carry out air  strikes to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo. They  threatened force to break the Serb siege of Srebrenica--so that  a contingent of Dutch troops can relieve the Canadians--and to  open Tuzla airport for aid flights.    Mr Major made plain a growing impatience with the warring  factions. Co-operation with Serb, Croat and Muslim commanders  on the ground was "very patchy indeed," he said. "There is  great frustration building up amongst governments, particularly  who have troops on the ground, at what does seem to be a  complete double standard, with the participants saying they want  peace in Geneva and acting in a fashion which denies every  single word they utter in the peace negotiations."    John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was "intolerable"  that  a defenceless population in Sarajevo should be shelled so  relentlessly. "Repeated declarations which are not followed  through risk undermining the credibility of NATO and the UN  operation and strengthen the hands of the those who have become  adept at defying the wishes of the international community."    Mr Smith urged the Prime Minister to put an end to  suggestions that British forces might be withdrawn from Bosnia  when the winter was over. "Don't we need a commitment to  increase ground forces, as requested by the UN to make a greater  effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?"    But Mr Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to assist  with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I  am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the  security of the British troops working for the UN there."    Mr Ashdown said the Prime Minister had been warned on many  occasions that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN was at  risk on Bosnia and cited President Clinton's words: "If we  cannot show the determination to deliver our promises, then  don't make promises."    Biting back, Mr Major said that unlike Mr Ashdown, he had  been careful about making promises. He has shifted and  manoeuvered through this whole operation from everything to  all-out war to apparently "pulling out immediately." Labour MP  Andrew Faulds, decried the "mumblings and bumblings" of Douglas  Hurd and other EU [European Union] foreign ministers and asked  if Mr Major personally had the will to take military action.    "Yes, every head of government had the will," the Prime  Minister replied. "What we need to be sure of is that it is  wise to do so." Practical decisions on air strikes were best  made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand -- and on  the sanction of the UN secretary general. [passage omitted]</p>

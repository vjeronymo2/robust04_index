			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hector Sandoval: "Wasmosy Might Get Burned in </F> the Blazing Fire"]    [Text] The peasants' quasi-revolt enabled nearly all  independent pundits and some qualified government experts to  warn that unless there is an turnabout in economic policy soon,  the fire could spread to the rest of the country. It goes  without saying that the government cannot publicly acknowledge  that its economic policy would unavoidably lead to social  upheaval. Therefore, it inverted the terms of the progressive  theory asserting that only an "adjustment" would eliminate the  risk of a debacle.    If there is a virtue that is said to characterize every  statesman, it is constant self-criticism, a periodic assessment  of his actions. [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy does not excel  in this quality.    Whether it was scared or not, by the change of the social  sectors' tune in the face of the negligence shown by those who  wield power, the government had recourse to an old scheme that  is as threadbare as it is hardly believable -- it claimed that  demonstrations were fostered by professional agitators. For  lack of socialist governments that support subversion in the  interior of the country (communist regimes barely survive amidst  their misfortunes), it began to point accusingly at the press.  It assured time and again that there are no social problems.    A well-known face looms up in this climate pregnant with  pressures -- violence from above. The signs are clear. [Public  Works and Communications] Minister Carlos Facceti himself took  the liberty of adopting, to everybody's dismay, the "guerrilla"  fashion when stating that tire busters and all sorts of barriers  were going to be used because there were indications of  impending dangers in the peasants' march.    It is obvious that the intelligence service's game is  fanning  the flames of this whole affair. Otherwise, it would be  impossible to account for the similar remarks uttered by nearly  all the men close to the president. They cannot or do not want  to believe that starving peasants can actually get organized.  The same underestimation of peasants was and is a good  justification for the government to postpone the solution of  social problems. The same prejudgment leads the government to  lend more credit to the existence of professional incognito  agitators behind the disturbance.    We should then reflect that here, as well as in many other  countries, there are individuals who would hail the replacement  of democracy with other systems that are more "thrilling."  There is no reason to believe they will be able to do so if the  rest refuse to collaborate. For the time being, the danger is  in the possibility that key sectors of the ruling class will let  themselves be persuaded that violent conflicts are unavoidable  and that appropriate repressive "precautions" against this  should be taken. The murder of a peasant leader is a clear  symptom of this.</p>

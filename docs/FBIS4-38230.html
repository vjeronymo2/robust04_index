			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--Information Minister Safwat  al-Sharif denied press reports that an Egyptian ship carrying  Saudi weapons to Aden was stopped in the Red Sea before reaching  its destination.    In a statement made today, al-Sharif said: No Egyptian ship  has been stopped either in the Red Sea or in the Mediterranean  Sea. He stressed that this report is entirely baseless and  contradicts Egypt's firm and principled stand on the Yemeni  problem. He said that Egypt believes the need to immediately  stop the fighting and to move to the dialogue table. He added  that Egypt also believes that it is not right to side with one  party against the other in this problem.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press for scrutiny of security services A CALL from a Commons committee for parliament to scrutinise Britain's security services was not rejected outright by Downing Street last night - in spite of past objections from Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary. After a report from the home affairs select committee, the prime minister's office said the contents of planned legislation remained undecided. Its reaction came although Mr Clarke had told that committee during its inquiry: 'I do not believe that it would be right to make the security service accountable to a select committee of this house.' The report says inquiries into value-for-money of security services and its general policy 'are proper subjects for parliamentary scrutiny as long as (it) does not damage the effectiveness of the service'. The MPs proposed that they should take responsibility for overseeing MI5, the domestic security service, but indicated that they would accept a special Commons committee covering overseas security operations and the electronics eavesdropping operations of GCHQ as well. The planned legislation is to put overseas security services on a statutory footing but could be extended to include parliamentary accountability. Security operations will cost at least Pounds 185m in 1992-93, the report says, and increasingly MI5 is taking over responsibilities - such as for countering IRA terrorism. But they are accountable to parliament via ministers who usually refuse to answer questions about their operations. The committee rejects the setting up of a committee of privy councillors, inside or outside parliament, as a watchdog for the security services. Sir Ivan Lawrence, Tory chairman, said his committee already had powers to scrutinise MI5 because its terms of reference covered 'the Home Office and its associated public bodies'. By convention, however, questions had not been asked and he did not want to provoke a confrontation. Attempts by the committee to call Mrs Stella Rimington, head of MI5, to give evidence have been blocked by Mr Clarke. Instead, six of its members are to meet her for lunch.</p>

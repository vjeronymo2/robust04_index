			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methods recommended for promoting aerobic decomposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> livestock waste include: aerating manure storage piles every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three to seven days; scraping feedlots at least three times per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year; and spreading oxidizing agents on feedlots. For waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practices using a dry method, the proposed FIP measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will require the periodic aeration and removal of manure storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> piles. This measure is estimated to reduce VOC emissions by 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methane recovery and utilization systems are considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential control method for reducing VOC and methane emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methane is considered an important greenhouse gas and also a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential energy source. Depending on the size of the livestock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste operation, methane recovery systems can pay for themselves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over time and result in cost savings for large-scale dairy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations. Methane recovery systems are currently operating at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23 sites in the U.S., including at a swine facility near Tulare,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CA and a dairy near Modesto, CA. Near Chino, CA, a recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system is under development which would process an estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2,500 tpd of cattle waste and 600 tpd of chicken waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technologies for methane recovery include covered lagoons, plug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow digesters, and complete mix digesters. Although these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery systems represent a viable, demonstrated technology,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some systems have not been as successful as expected because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper design or other factors. For these reasons, EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment and information on any examples, circumstances, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons why a previously installed recovery system may not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved its full expectations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP rule will require that at least 55 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the manure generated be collected and managed through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methane recovery system. These systems are estimated to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by 80 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technical and economic feasibility of this technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depends on farm size, climate, and energy process. The off-gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., methane) collected can be utilized in the dairy operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for processes such as: electricity production (e.g., to fuel an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine generator); heating (e.g., to fire boilers and/or space  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters); and cooling (e.g., to fire chillers or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigeration equipment). This in turn can create farm profits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from avoided energy costs or sales of excess electricity to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local utility. Although methane recovery systems would require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large initial investment, estimated annual costs range from $100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to $1,300 per year (for a 400 head dairy) to a cost savings of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $10,000 per year (for a 1,400 head dairy). The initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment could be recovered within six to fourteen years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on dairy size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The overall emission reductions from livestock waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations will depend on the percentage of waste which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managed via the dry method (e.g., placed in storage piles)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to the handled through a wet method (e.g., sent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered lagoon or digester). For purposes of the FIP reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates, it is assumed that a minimum of 55 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> livestock waste would be sent to a lagoon or digester. Assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a hypothetical dairy farm would install a recovery system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for liquid management and use the dry method for the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraction of the wastes not sent to the recovery system, overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected cost per ton of VOC reduced is estimated to range from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about $2,100 per ton for a 400 head dairy to a $400 (cost) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $100 (savings) per ton for a 1,450 head dairy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminary evaluation of the environmental, economic, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other impacts of the proposed rule are discussed in EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical support document. VOC Emission reductions expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from this proposed regulation are estimated at 1.0 tpd in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area and 6.0 tpd in the South Coast. No reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expected in Ventura County because all livestock waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations are believed to be less than 200 head. Additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions could be achieved if the requirements were extended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller livestock waste operations, such as 250 head or greater. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is requesting comments and information on a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues related to this proposed measure. Comments are requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the proposed FIP requirements and/or other potential emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction strategies not addressed in the proposal. Because each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dairy operation is unique and can vary in its waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices, comments are specifically requested on alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction methods and/or more cost effective strategies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which might achieve equivalent results to those proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also requests comments and information on the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dairy farms in the FIP areas which contain at least 400 head and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the percentage of dairy farms which manage at least 55 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the livestock waste through a wet method. Because the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors used to estimate VOC emissions from these sources should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be updated, EPA intends to explore options for additional testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to verify that VOC emission factors accurately reflect emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected from both wet and dry waste management methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)(1) Fugitive Emissions from Oil and Gas Production Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Conveying Stations (Sacramento, South Coast, Ventura). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(t) controls VOC fugitive leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from valves, flanges, fittings, pumps, compressors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> open ended lines and/or other components at oil and gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production facilities and conveying stations. <FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>  1990 VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from these fugitive sources were estimated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 0.9 tons per day (tpd) in the Sacramento area, 4.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tpd in the South Coast, and 3.8 tpd in Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Conveying stations include any compressor station, metering station, or other transfer station located between the extraction well and the refinery or gas processing plant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule builds upon current regulations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthens and improves existing rules through retrofits on gas-operated control valves, lower allowable leak thresholds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction of rule deficiencies, and improved inspection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair programs. The proposed regulation is based on: CARB RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance for the control of fugitive emissions of VOCs from oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas production and processing facilities, refineries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical plants, and pipeline transfer stations; Santa Barbara  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APCD Rule 331; SCAQMD Rule 1173; and new information regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas-operated control valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, gas-operated control valves are not regulated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP areas. These valves are designed to bleed upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actuation, resulting in the release of uncontrolled VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. The proposed FIP rule would require that these valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be retrofitted using a control valve which would reduce gas bleed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by an estimated 95 percent. EPA has estimated a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California population of 10,000 gas-operated control valves and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed that these valves are evenly distributed throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state. EPA has also assumed that the control valves are only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in natural gas conveyance and petroleum production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically requested on the number of gas-operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control valves in the FIP areas and whether these valves are used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in other operations besides those described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP rule will establish a fugitives regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for oil and gas production and conveying stations within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento FIP area. Previously, these fugitive sources were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unregulated. The majority of expected reductions will be from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Yolo-Solano portion of the FIP area. In the Ventura FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, the rule builds upon requirements in VCAPCD Rule 74.10 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower the number of allowable leaking components and leak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition to requirements consistent with existing rules and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB's RACT guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

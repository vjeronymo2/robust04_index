			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> THE RANGER BULLPEN TURNS A RYAN SHUTOUT INTO A 6-3 LOSS TO RED SOX  </P> <P> As far as the Boston Red Sox were concerned, they played two games Tuesday  night -- one against Nolan Ryan and another against the Texas Rangers' bullpen.  </P> <P> "We didn't do anything against Nolan, then we looked out there and suddenly he  was gone," Nick Esasky said after Boston rallied with six runs in the eighth  inning and beat the Texas Rangers, 6-3, at Boston.  </P> <P> Ryan gave up four hits and struck out six in seven innings. After throwing 115  pitches, the 42-year-old right-hander left with a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> "He did a great job, but he said he had had enough," Texas Manager Bobby  Valentine said. "A shutout for seven innings, you can't ask for anything more  than that. He knew what he had to do, and the other guys knew what they had to  do."  </P> <P> But Kenny Rogers and Jeff Russell (3-2) gave up four hits in the eighth and  errors by second baseman Julio Franco and shortstop Scott Fletcher led to an  unearned run.  </P> <P> Rogers walked Jody Reed to start the eighth. One out later, Wade Boggs doubled.  Russell then relieved and Greenwell doubled to pull Boston to 3-2.  </P> <P> After Dwight Evans walked, Esasky tripled in two runs and scored when Franco's  throw to third sailed wide, making the score 5-3.  </P> <P> Kansas City 8, Milwaukee 2 -- Bo Jackson hit his 17th homer of the season in a  six-run 11th inning as the Royals beat the Brewers at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Bob Boone opened the 11th with a double off Mark Knudson (2-3), and  pinch-runner Rey Palacios scored the go-ahead run on Frank White's single.  </P> <P> Kevin Seitzer walked and George Brett hit a two-run double before Jackson  homered to center field for a 7-2 lead.  </P> <P> Jim Eisenreich singled, went to second when Pat Tabler walked and scored on  Palacios' single to make the score 8-2.  </P> <P> Tom Gordon (9-2) gave up the tying run in the eighth before pitching two  scoreless innings. Steve Farr pitched a perfect 11th.  </P> <P> Minnesota 7, Cleveland 4 -- Jim Dwyer had his first four-hit game in six years  as the Twins defeated the Indians at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Allan Anderson (8-4) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings, struck out one and  walked one, and Jeff Reardon finished for his 13th save. He relieved with a 4-2  lead and runners on first and third, got Joe Carter on a pop-up and Pete  O'Brien on a fly.  </P> <P> Tom Candiotti (7-5) saw his nine-game home winning streak end. Candiotti, who  last lost in Cleveland Stadium on June 9, 1988, is 14-3 at home since the start  of the 1988 season. He gave up four runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> With the score 1-1 in the third, Dan Gladden singled and Kirby Puckett walked.  Dwyer singled in Gladden with the go-ahead run and, one out later, Randy Bush  hit a two-run double to make the score 4-1.  </P> <P> Dwyer, who singled in the ninth for his fourth hit, had not had a four-hit game  since July 17, 1983, against the Angels.  </P> <P> Chicago 13, New York 6 -- Dan Pasqua and Harold Baines each hit three-run  homers and had four RBIs and 40-year-old Jerry Reuss won his fifth consecutive  decision as the White Sox defeated the Yankees at New York.  </P> <P> The White Sox had 17 hits, three each by Dave Gallagher and Ivan Calderon, who  tripled, singled, and doubled in his first three at-bats. Pasqua suffered a  bruised left elbow in the third inning when he collided with catcher Don  Slaught while trying to score and was removed as a precautionary measure.  </P> <P> Reuss, who celebrated his 40th birthday Monday, overcame a three-run first  inning to improve to 7-2 and win his 218th career game. He gave up eight hits  in five innings, striking out one and walking one.  </P> <P> John Davis, purchased from Vancouver on Monday, worked the last four innings to  earn his first save, giving up Slaught's second homer and Rickey Henderson's  RBI single in the ninth.  </P> <P> Oakland 6, Detroit 4 -- The Athletics ended a season-high four-game losing  streak as pinch-hitter Terry Steinbach's home run broke a sixth-inning tie at  Oakland.  </P> <P> Mark McGwire's three-run homer tied the game in the third as the A's ended  their longest losing streak since July 5-7 of last season.  </P> <P> McGwire led off the sixth with a double off reliever Brad Havens (0-1) and  Steinbach connected one out later for his fourth homer and the first by an A's  pinch-hitter since last June 19.  </P> <P> A crowd of 30,184 pushed Oakland's season attendance over the one million mark  after 33 home dates, the earliest in the team's history.  </P> <P> Baltimore 8, Seattle 6 -- Mike Devereaux drove in three runs as the Orioles  overcame a five-run deficit and beat the Mariners at Seattle for their fifth  consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Seattle scored five runs in the first inning to knock out starter Jeff Ballard,  who got only one batter out. But Baltimore scored one run in the third, three  in the fourth and four in the fifth to take an 8-5 lead.  </P></p>

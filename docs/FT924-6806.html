			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Flotation proceeds lift Anglian Group ANGLIAN GROUP, the maker of double glazing which floated on the stock market in July, yesterday reported only a slight dip in interim operating profits despite the continuing low level of consumer confidence. But at the pre-tax level profit for the six months ended September 26 1992 rose from Pounds 8.86m to Pounds 10.3m, on sales down marginally at Pounds 71.4m, compared with Pounds 72.5m. This pre-tax profit growth disguised a much higher interest charge in 1991 - Pounds 2.53m against Pounds 597,000 this time - before the proceeds of the flotation. Earnings per share were up from 8.9p to 9p and an interim dividend of 3.7p is declared. Mr Bill Hancock, managing director, said in the first seven weeks of the current period retail sales had improved year on year, despite the shock of a collapse in sales in September around the departure of sterling from the ERM. During the first half retail sales fell from last year's levels while public sector sales in the commercial division increased from 10 per cent to 11 per cent. By year-end they were expected to account for up to 15 per cent of sales. Mr Hancock said the margins on the public sector side were only slightly lower than they are in retail sales. Overall, group operating margins fell from 15.7 per cent to 15.2 per cent. On a pro-forma basis - restated to take account of the issue of the new shares - pre-tax profits rose in the period from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 11.4m and earnings were 0.5p higher at 8.5p. The group reached the half-year stage with net cash in hand of Pounds 16m. COMMENT Anglian has had a chilly reception since coming to the market. But the results suggest it has weathered the storm remarkably well, thanks partly to its vertical integration and partly to the foresight of developing the local government market. An acquisition in this area would be an obvious use for some of its post-flotation cash pile and would use spare manufacturing capacity, although taken too far expansion in this area must lower overall margins. But Anglian is still faced with what to do with its cash. Diversification carries with it risks that this management team may not have previously met. Meanwhile, Anglian is likely to produce profits of Pounds 22m before tax this year, or earnings of 17p per share, giving a prospective multiple of under 13 that is undemanding.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tim Miles, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Excerpt] Iran is expelling a British diplomat from Tehran,  the [British] Foreign Office said today. Britain's deputy head  of mission, Hamish Cowell, had been asked to leave the country,  a spokesman said. Iran gave no reason for what the spokesman  described as an "unjustified" request, but the move appears to  be a tit-for-tat response to Britain's expulsion of an Iranian  diplomat last week.    The Foreign Office today for the first time officially  confirmed that expulsion had been ordered and named the Iranian  diplomat as first secretary Vahid Belourchi. He had been asked  to leave because of false allegations about British policy in  Bosnia. Members of the Iranian embassy in London had been  distributing forged documents purporting to show Britain's  policy in Bosnia was directed against Muslims, the spokesman  said.    Until today the Foreign Office would only confirm that a  meeting had taken place last Thursday [26 May] between Foreign  Office Minister Douglas Hogg and Iran's charge d'affaires in  London, Gholamreza Ansari. Diplomatic sources said the Foreign  Office's refusal to confirm the expulsion was aimed at trying to  forestall a tit-for-tat move by Iran.    The Foreign Office would not say today whether Britain would  respond further. "We will keep the situation under review. We  are looking at it very closely at the moment," the spokesman  said. He confirmed the expelled Iranian diplomat had not yet  left the country but said there were no signs that Iran was  dragging its feet.    Mr Cowell was not expected to be packing his bags yet  either.  "His departure would not necessarily be immediate," the  spokesman said. Yesterday, Mr Cowell himself referred inquiries  from PRESS ASSOCIATION News about the possibility of reprisals  against British diplomats in Tehran to the Foreign Office news  department in London.    Although Iran gave no official reason for the move, the  Iranian news agency IRNA quoted a radical Iranian newspaper  which accused Britain of launching a propaganda offensive in the  country.

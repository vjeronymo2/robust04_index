			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 17, BNS -- Withdrawal of the Russian  troops is the priority of Estonia's foreign policy, Foreign  Minister Juri Luik said before the parliament today.    He said it was vital for Estonia to reach a situation when  an  attack against the country would be as impossible as, for  instance, against Austria.    The minister expressed his concern about a virtual stoppage  in the pullout of Russian troops from the country in the past  weeks. He said about 2,500 Russian military were still remaining  on the Estonian territory.    Addressing a parliament meeting that discussed Estonia's  foreign political concept, Luik said the country needed a boost  in its political activity toward the East. He said it was  possible that "people who have successfully managed in the West  will have to change their jobs and start working in the East."  Luik said Estonia was not viewing the CIS as a "faceless and  weak-willed union of states." He said visits by high-ranking  Estonian officials to countries of the CIS are due soon.  Estonian President Lennart Meri is to visit Ukraine in the near  future, he said.    "It is important to mention that the European Union [EU]  views the Baltic states as potential members of their union,"  Luik said. He didn't rule out the possibility that Estonia may  become a member of the EU still before the end of the century.    The foreign minister mentioned Toomas Tiivel as the  country's  new ambassador to Latvia. He also expressed the hope that  Latvia would send its ambassador to Estonia soon.    Tiit Made of the opposition Entrepreneurs Party at today's  discussion characterized the country's foreign policy in the  past year as "toothless, unprofessional and inept."    The former foreign minister, MP Trivimi Velliste, in his  remarks said that if "in the foreign policy of Finland one  speaks of a Paasikivi-Kekkonen line, in the case of Estonia a  line of Meri-Manitski-Luik can be spoken about, which is a  straight."    Also speaking before the MP's today was the chairman of the  parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission, Vello Saatpalu.</p>

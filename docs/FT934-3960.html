			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Groundwork for devolved government nears completion The government is on the verge of completing its groundwork on possible structures for devolved government in Northern Ireland, David Owen writes. This brings the resumption of all-party talks between the province's constitutional parties a step nearer. Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, is understood to be close to completing the delicate task of identifying an outline that could form the basis for an eventual settlement. Resumed talks are expected to focus on the creation of an 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in talks last year. Under a blueprint agreed by a working group including all four constitutional parties, an assembly with some legislative powers would be elected by proportional representation. In a separate move the government yesterday announced plans to prune the 29,000-strong Northern Ireland civil service with the help of a voluntary redundancy scheme. Ministers expect that civil servant numbers will have to fall by between 600 and 700 by March 1995, representing a 3 per cent cut in non-industrial staff.</p>

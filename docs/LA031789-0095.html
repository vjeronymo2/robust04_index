			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PENGUINS END A 7-YEAR PLAYOFF DROUGHT  </P> <P> Tom Barrasso stopped 32 shots, and Rob Brown scored the game-winning goal late  in the second period as the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the New Jersey Devils,  2-1, Thursday night at East Rutherford, N.J., to clinch their first playoff  berth in seven years.  </P> <P> The last time Pittsburgh reached the Stanley Cup playoffs was in 1981-82, two  years before it drafted superstar Mario Lemieux. The NHL's leading scorer,  Lemieux injured his groin in a pregame skate Thursday morning and did not  dress.  </P> <P> The win gave the Penguins 79 points and moved them into second place in the  Patrick Division, one point ahead of the New York Rangers and one behind the  first-place Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> New Jersey, on the verge of playoff elimination, lost its third straight game.  </P> <P> Quebec 2, Boston 2 -- Robert Picard's goal at 5:53 of the third period lifted  the Nordiques into a tie at Boston and kept their hopes alive for a playoff  spot.  </P> <P> Picard's goal came only 1:11 after rookie Greg Hawgood's power-play goal gave  Boston a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> The game marked the return of 25-year-old defenseman Gord Kluzak to the Bruin  lineup. He missed 71 games following surgery on his left knee on Sept. 17 --  his eighth operation. Kluzak sat out two of the last four full seasons with  knee trouble.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Brett Hull's second goal of the game, at 1:39 of  overtime, gave the Blues the win at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The Blues are 4-1-1 in their last six games, while Philadelphia dropped to  1-3-4 in their last eight and fell to 32-32-7, the latest in the season they  have been at only the .500 mark since 1971-72.  </P> <P> St. Louis beat the Flyers for the third straight time this season and second in  a row at the Spectrum. Previously, the Blues had not won in 34 games at  Philadelphia. Vincent Riendeau has been in goal for St. Louis in all three  victories.  </P> <P> Buffalo 6, Hartford 1 -- Mike Foligno scored his 300th career goal, goaltender  Clint Malarchuk remained unbeaten since being traded to Buffalo March 6, and  the Sabres blitzed the Whalers at Hartford.  </P> <P> The victory clinched a playoff spot for Buffalo.  </P> <P> Minnesota 6, Chicago 1 -- Rookie Don Barber had his first NHL hat trick, Mike  Gartner scored his 400th career goal, and Mark Habscheid had four assists to  lead the North Stars at Bloomington.  </P> <P> Vancouver 3, Edmonton 0 -- Petri Skriko scored twice in the second period, and  Kirk McLean recorded his fourth shutout of the season at Vancouver as the  Oilers' winless streak reached six (0-4-2).  </P> <P> Vancouver is 9-0-2 in its last 11 outings and beat the Oilers for the fifth  time in seven meetings.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: Tailored aid to Russia crucial to success of transition process Sir, The present situation of the Russian reformers holding a plebiscite could, if the outcome endorses Mr Yeltsin, result in a considerable increase in presidential power. A strengthening of the power of the presidential office has attractions in the present climate but carries the risk of a military-backed dictatorship if opponents seek to overthrow Mr Yeltsin. While the strengthening of the presidential office seems the most compelling short-term remedy to restore the momentum of the Russian reform programme it is a view that must be held with trepidation because it raises the spectre of a militarily mismanaged economy. On the other hand, without increased presidential powers the Russian Federation is likely to disintegrate and civil disturbances proliferate as the reform programme collapses and regional differences accelerate; the latter would have global implications. Confronted with the possibility of political repression and global adverse consequences the west faces a serious dilemma vis-a-vis its political support and assistance programmes ('The choice over Russia', March 17). It has been argued by some, such as presidents Clinton and Mitterrand ('US and France seek early G7 talks', March 10), that by speedily increasing aid it will result in support for the reformers. However, increasing short-term western aid may exacerbate problems, as it is likely to be poorly targeted, and being a panic like measure it could serve to strengthen the position of those opposed to Mr Yeltsin who will seize on it as further proof of Russia's decline under Mr Yeltsin. The resolution to the problems of Russian transition will rest largely on internal politics and for this reason short-term financial measures designed to influence the outcome of the forthcoming plebiscite will at best play a marginal role. Nevertheless, carefully tailored support of the kind suggested by Professor Nuti (Letters, March 23) will be crucial in ensuring the success of transition in Russia.

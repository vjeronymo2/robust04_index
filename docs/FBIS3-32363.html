The voting, which will continue until 1800 (0000 GMT), began  with absolute normalcy, a large turnout, and great enthusiasm at  the 8,363 polling tables throughout the country.    Initial results will begin to be known by 2000 (0200 GMT)  and  shortly thereafter the winner, who will govern the country for a  four-year period beginning 8 May, replacing Rafael Angel  Calderon, will be announced.    On the eve of the elections, the two main presidential  candidates, Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez and Social  Democrat Jose Maria Figueres maintained a close tie, according  to several surveys.    As part of the elections, besides electing a president and  two vice presidents, Costa Ricans will reelect members to the  Legislative Assembly, composed of 57 deputies, and authorities  of 81 municipalities throughout the country.    Approximately 3,000 policemen will guarantee order during  the  process. All through the day and until tomorrow, a "dry law"  banning the sale of liquor will be enforced. The restriction  began Friday night, when electoral propaganda also stopped to  give voters a 48-hour reflection period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Head of State Geydar Aliyev told a meeting of the  presidential staff that the Armenian offensive which began in  the Karabakh conflict zone straight after the CIS summit in  Moscow was "the worst of recent times." The president said "the  character of the offensive proved that the Armenians are  receiving outside help."    The Azerbaijani leader considers the fact that the Armenian  attack began the day after the meeting of heads of states in  Moscow was proof that the negotiations process was being used as  a tactic to "prepare and step up aggression."    Aliyev pointed out that the "Azerbaijani army was doing more  than ever before to rebuff the aggressor."    The president again called for stronger measures to defend  the republic. He had in mind the radical upgrading of army  discipline above all. He said the military enlistment offices  in all districts should improve and resolve all aspects  concerning the army call up. He referred to the many signals  received on serious irregularities in that area, and said there  would be a presidential decree to merge the three heads of the  district military enlistment offices. The defense minister  would, under the document, be instructed to send military  commissioners guilty of irregularities to the front line and  demote them.    The Azerbaijani leader said that henceforth all personnel  issues connected with the activities of enlistment offices would  be resolved by the presidential staff on presentation by the  defense minister. He requested the state councillor for  military affairs to assess the suitability of personnel in the  enlistment offices within a ten-day period.    Aliyev announced that from now the local departments of  power  ministries in districts would be subordinate to local heads of  administration.    The president stressed that Baku would still use every  opportunity to settle the conflict peacefully.    As had been announced at the meeting of the heads of states  in Moscow, a four-party meeting had been planned on Moscow's  initiative with the presidents of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan  and Robert Kocharian, the chairman of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Defense Committee, who was also in the Russian capital while the  summit was being held. However, the Armenia-Azerbaijan meeting  did not take place due to disagreements surrounding the  settlement plan for the Karabakh conflict.    One top member official in Aliyev's staff told INTERFAX that  the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Moscow on April 15 had  been marked by increased political pressure from both Russia and  Armenia on Azerbaijan with a view to securing the latter's  consent to the Russian initiatives.    INTERFAX's interviewee said that the Russian side had hinted  that if Russia's plan was not accepted, "Azerbaijan could lose a  few more districts."    The official did say that Baku's official line on the Moscow  initiative was "by and large positive." However, he stressed  that the Moscow plan would be fully accepted only in the event  demands for the release of Azerbaijani territories seized and  the return of refugees, to Nagorno-Karabakh, Shusha and Lachin  in particular (the latter are towns in Nagorno-Karabakh which  were populated by Azerbaijanis before seizure by Armenian  soldiers) be satisfied. The official pointed out that the  Russian plan lacked any reference to the return of refugees to  these populated areas.    He concluded that the CIS summit in Moscow had demonstrated  yet again that "Azerbaijan must rely on its own strength to free  occupied territories."    (INTERFAX Note: Levon Zubranian, advisor to the Armenian  president, is of the view that the CIS summit in Moscow on April  15 provided an "excellent chance to achieve peace in Nagorny  Karabakh which, regrettably, was lost through Azerbaijan's own  fault." He continued: "If Azerbaijan were to accept Russia's  peace initiative, each party to the conflict would receive what  it wants: Armenia the lifting of road blocks, Nagorno-Karabakh  the guarantee of safety for its population and Azerbaijan its  territory." The advisor assumed that Azerbaijan's rejection of  the Russian option for settling the conflict was proof of the  desire of the Azerbaijani party "to achieve a settlement by  force.")</p>

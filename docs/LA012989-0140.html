			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HATTEN SCORES 37 AS LONG BEACH BEATS UC IRVINE, 75-70  </P> <P> John Hatten scored a career-high 37 points and led Cal State Long Beach to a  75-70 victory over UC Irvine Saturday night in a Big West Conference game  before 1,900 in the 49ers' gym.  </P> <P> "He should have had more," Coach Joe Harrington said.  </P> <P> Hatten, averaging 14 points per game, missed his first 4 shots and had another  streak of 3 misses in the first half. In all, the senior center made 17 of 31  shots.  </P> <P> Hatten, who has been told by Harrington to take over and be more of a scorer,  said he was overanxious at the beginning.  </P> <P> "Coach said to relax," Hatten said. "I knew they were easy shots; it just took  time for them to drop."  </P> <P> And for a while, it seemed as if they all dropped -- baseline jumpers,  turn-arounds in the lane, inside banks, lay-ins after grabbing rebounds. By  halftime Hatten had 23 points and his 20 field goal attempts were only 4 fewer  than Irvine had.  </P> <P> In the second half, after the Anteaters took a 49-48 lead on 6 straight point  by Jeff Herdman, the 49ers went on a 12-5 run, Hatten getting 10 of those  points.  </P> <P> "I thought Hatten had a great game," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. "We tried  to play him different ways."  </P> <P> But if Hatten was the night's hero, reserve Rudy Harvey was a close second.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize Rudy Harvey would get 16 points," Mulligan said.  </P> <P> Harvey did that on 6 of 9 shooting from the field and 4 of 4 from the foul  line. After stealing the ball, he made a driving dunk to extend the lead to  62-53. When Irvine pulled to within 62-59, he made a 3-point play. And when his  two free throws with 4:47 to go increased the lead to 69-61, it looked as if  Long Beach was home free.  </P> <P> But after a 3-point play by Ricky Butler on a power move over Hatten, another  inside basket by Butler and a baseline jumper by Kevin Floyd, the 49er lead was  down to 69-68 with 46 seconds left.  </P> <P> Jeff Eastin made both ends of a one-and-one with 36 seconds left for a 71-68  lead.  </P> <P> The victory enabled the 49ers (8-10 overall, 5-4 in the Big West) to stay in  fourth place. Irvine (6-11, 3-5) remains in seventh place and is 1-8 on the  road.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Alexandrova, </F> Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- Russia so far does not link  the Bosnian situation with the Russian joining of NATO's  Partnership for Peace program, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  told a news conference here today. However, Russia does not  hurry to sign the program.    Speaking of relations with the Serbs, the president noted  the  most important now is to prevent them from greater confrontation  and further combat operations. Yeltsin said they are working in  this sphere and Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is  permanently staying in the conflict zone. As need be Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev may leave for the conflict zone  on Thursday.    If greater confrontation is prevented and the crisis is  discussed at political negotiations, there will be no more  bombing. A political way out of the situation should be found  through negotiations; "force will not solve the problem, it will  be an eternal war. Those who did the bombing will be  responsible in case of aggravation," stressed the president.</p>

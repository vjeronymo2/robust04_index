			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Season average prices for Washington summer non-storage onions decreased 31 percent to $16.60 per hundredweight in 1992. Prices reached a record high in 1991 at $23.90 per hundredweight. The 1992 crop was valued at $6.5 million, which was an 8 percent decrease from the previous season. Monthly prices generally decrease during the peak harvesting in the State of Washington. There are no separate price data available for Umatilla County. However, given the small production area, such prices from the Walla Walla Valley area of Umatilla County should be similar to those of the adjacent area of Washington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly prices received for Washington summer non-storage onions decreased 9 percent from June 1992, to August, 1992 ($17.50 per hundredweight to $16.00 per hundredweight). Prices for 1991 were considerably higher, beginning at $29.40 per hundredweight and ending at $20.00 per hundredweight. The five-year average non-storage onion prices in Washington (1988&hyph;1992) for the period June through August, respectively, was $20.94, $16.94, and $14.06 per hundredweight. This compared with total U.S. five-year non-storage onion average prices of $12.22, $14.20, and $12.16 per hundredweight for the same period. U.S. summer non-storage prices in June of 1992 were 37 percent lower than Washington summer non-storage prices during that period, but prices began to even out in August of 1992 at $16.00 per hundredweight for Washington summer non-storage onions and rose 23 percent to $15.80 per hundredweight for the U.S. total for non-storage onions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to testimony, a major share of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion market is being lost to two major competitors, South Texas onions and those from Vidalia, Georgia. Onions grown in these areas are covered by Federal marketing order programs that fund promotion and advertising activities and, therefore, help to make buyers and consumers more aware of the favorable attributes of the onions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marketing order programs for Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions regulate the handling of onions grown on approximately 17,600 acres; the South Texas program has about 14,200 acres; and the Vidalia program covers about 8,000 acres. The industry believes that a research and promotion program is necessary to expand Walla Walla markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Witnesses attributed the recent downward trend in Walla Walla Sweet Onion prices in part to increasing competitive pressures from other, larger onion growing areas. Testimony indicated that while the Walla Walla Sweet Onion is considered unique in its sweetness, other areas have or are developing sweet varieties of onions to capitalize on the strong consumer demand for sweet onions. For example, the South Texas onion industry has funded, through a Federal marketing order, varietal research to develop an onion variety with the desired characteristics of being mild tasting and sweet. This variety, called the Texas Grano 1015 Y, has been actively promoted. The record indicates that the South Texas onion industry budgeted funds for research and market development activities through its marketing order. Additionally, handlers in Idaho and Eastern Oregon, also under a Federal marketing order program, budgeted funds during the same period for promotion and research of its sweet Spanish onion. Witnesses attributed the success these other growing areas have had to their ability to pool available resources under their respective marketing orders. Proponents testified that the research and promotion activities conducted by competitors have assisted those competing industries in developing and promoting sweeter onion varieties that are challenging the Walla Walla Sweet Onion for its share of the onion market. It is believed that a similar program is necessary for Walla Walla Sweet Onions to remain profitable in this competitive industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record indicates that most Northwest residents are familiar with the taste and origin of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion. The record also indicates that they are aware of its unique flavor characteristics and are loyal customers. However, as the Walla Walla industry has grown, the development of new markets has become necessary. Testimony demonstrated the need to differentiate the Walla Walla Sweet Onion from other onions available in the marketplace to garner customer loyalty in markets located outside Washington and Oregon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

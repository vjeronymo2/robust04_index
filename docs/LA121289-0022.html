			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDES PONDER BRADLEY DEMANDS ON PORTER RANCH  </P> <P> Responding to Mayor Tom Bradley's warning last week that he would veto the  proposed Porter Ranch development if it is not changed to his satisfaction,  aides to Bradley and City Councilman Hal Bernson said Monday they are near  agreement on all but one of the mayor's suggested changes.  </P> <P> "They see eye to eye on a lot of it," said Jane Blumenfeld, the mayor's  planning adviser. "It's just a matter of working out the specifics. The  concepts they mutually agree on."  </P> <P> Today's meeting of the City Council's Planning and Land-Use Management  Committee should reveal more about Bernson's willingness to compromise on the  project to mollify Bradley, who chose last Friday to discuss in public the  concerns his staff had raised with the Porter Ranch developer as early as  August.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell's $2-billion proposal for 2,195  single-family homes, 1,200 townhouses and nearly 6 million square feet of  commercial space in the hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway is scheduled to  be heard today by the planning committee, which Bernson chairs. The  development, which would be in Bernson's district, would be the largest in the  city's history.  </P> <P> In a letter to the council and at a news conference Friday, Bradley urged  several changes in the plan, such as inclusion of affordable housing and an  internal transit system. Bradley also called for distribution of neighborhood  retail stores throughout the project's residential areas.  </P> <P> Bernson was not available for comment Monday but his chief deputy, Greig Smith,  predicted that nine of Bradley's 10 suggested changes can be resolved in  committee hearings. The lone sticking point for Bernson, he said, was Bradley's  recommendation that the amount of parking in the project's office complex be  cut in half in order to promote ride-sharing and public transit.  </P> <P> Some form of an internal transit system, the planting of trees, the  installation of dual plumbing in office buildings to promote the use of  reclaimed water and programs for recycling and yard composting all can be  included, Smith said.  </P> <P> Of Bradley's recommendation for affordable housing, Smith said: "We'll have to  probably live with something on that issue. I don't know what it is."  </P> <P> Bradley rarely has intervened in a development issue before council action on  it. Bradley aides said Friday's news conference signaled a willingness by the  mayor to become more involved in local planning matters.  </P> <P> Bradley's letter to the council said he had "reservations" about the  1.5-million-square-foot regional shopping mall that would be part of the Porter  Ranch development. But the letter did not call for specific reductions in a  proposed mall, or in the overall size of the commercial complex, where office  buildings would be as high as 10 stories.  </P> <P> "What the mayor did really wasn't that significant in terms of the  development," said one city planning official familiar with the project. The  official, speaking on the condition that he not be named, added: "If he really  wanted to come down on it, the main issue is transportation and the amount of  commercial (development). . . . I found most of the things, with the exception  of the parking, pretty cosmetic stuff."  </P></p>

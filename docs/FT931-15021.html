			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / US businesses plan a return to Vietnam: The war is nearly over and the trade embargo may soon be dropped AMERICAN companies are beginning to weigh up business prospects in Vietnam following a White House move last month which paves the way for eventual removal of the long-standing US embargo on the Communist nation. In one of the clearest signs of growing US business interest, a group of executives from some two dozen US companies will visit the country early next month under the auspices of the new Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce. It will be the first US business mission to be formally received by the Hanoi government, according to the chamber's president, Mr Irwin Robinson, a New York lawyer. The aim, he says, 'will be to maximise knowledge of opportunities for US companies.' The US has enforced its trade ban since the Vietnam war but over the past year the White House has allowed a few exceptions. For example, a ban on telecommunications links was lifted in April 1992. The biggest move yet came on December 14 when President George Bush signed an order permitting US companies to sign contracts with Vietnamese parties and open offices there. However, contracts can only be executed if relations are normalised. There has been speculation that Mr Bush could do this before he leaves office on January 20, if Hanoi meets the White House's demands for the fullest possible accounting for missing American servicemen and prisoners of war, including repatriation of their remains. However, there remains very little time for Vietnam to make these concessions, while Mr Bush may be reluctant to stir up the right-wing outcry such a move would provoke. The new Clinton administration, for its part, is likely to have much more pressing concerns, and President-elect Bill Clinton may be wary of normalising relations rapidly, given the election campaign controversy over his Vietnam draft record. Whenever the ban is lifted, it is bound to provoke a sharp increase in US business interest, not least because this will also trigger a wave of aid to the country from institutions such as the World Bank, creating opportunities for capital equipment and construction contracts. However, Mr Nicholas Ludlow, managing director of Development Bank Associates, a Washington-based consultancy, says the economy is so under-developed that it has limited capacity to absorb new trade and investment. 'I think there will be a wave of excitement, then tempered by a more realistic view of the prospects,' he says. 'Companies will do best which realise Vietnam is a long-term prospect.' Guocang Huan, of the emerging markets group at JP Morgan, the New York bank, says the country's extremely low wage costs, currently about a tenth of Taiwan's and Korea's, could make it attractive for investment by labour-intensive US companies. He argues that industries such as electronics and textiles are most likely to prosper in Vietnam, together with tourism. However, companies from across the US business spectrum are starting to focus on the country. The 21 members of the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce include Federal Express, the package delivery company, Honeywell, the controls group, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, and ITT. Sectors likely to be particularly interested in Vietnam include: Airlines. A number of US carriers may be interested in serving the market - particularly those such as United and Northwest Airlines, which have a strong presence in the Far East already. Procedurally, the first step would be for the Department of Transportation to negotiate a bilateral aviation agreement, setting permitted levels of service and agreeing the number of providers, with the Vietnamese. The aviation authorities would then seek applications to serve the route. Minneapolis-based Northwest makes no secret of its enthusiasm. 'We've been interested in serving Vietnam for several years. We see it as a growing and promising market,' it says. Banks. A number are interested in returning to Vietnam, including Bank of America, Chase Manhattan and Citibank, each of which had branches in Saigon before the Americans were driven out of South Vietnam in 1975. The Bank of America says: 'We have definitely expressed our interest in a return to Vietnam.' The bank said that as a preliminary step last summer it had opened an Indochina representative office in Hong Kong, whose operations would be moved to Vietnam if the US embargo were lifted. One matter that will need to be sorted out before banks return is the the issue of unresolved claims by depositors dating back to Communist takeover of South Vietnam. Oil. US companies are keen to explore the South China Sea, with three companies - Amoco, Chevron and Mobil - giving the most active consideration to a business plan. Chevron said it had held discussions with the Vietnamese 'on and off with regard to possible opportunities for exploring and producing offshore in the South China Sea, but we don't have any contracts.' Chevron said it had examined geological data and was 'interested in the possibilities.' Mobil was more direct: 'Should the embargo end we would be most interested to be there. In the meantime we will explore some potential opportunities by talking to potential partners.' Telecommunications. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and MCI Communications, the two largest long-distance US carriers, have begun to provide long-distance services to Vietnam following the relaxation of the ban last April. MCI says it is sending a team to Vietnam in the first quarter to discuss additional services, such as allowing customers to call the US collect. But it says it has no interest in the domestic Vietnamese market. Consumer products. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola says it 'would certainly look at Vietnam' if trade relations normalise - in line with a general policy of examining all potential new markets.

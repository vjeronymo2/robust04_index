			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Brazil central bank may go it alone PRESIDENT Itamar Franco of Brazil yesterday announced his intention to make the country's central bank independent, to reinforce the measures announced in his economic plan on Saturday. He gave no details of the decision but aides said that he was meeting economists yesterday to prepare draft legislation to present to Congress. Analysts were confused by the move, which followed Mr Franco's announcement on Saturday that interest rates on short-term investments would be cut to below inflation, so as to deter financial speculation and stimulate growth. The surprise interest rate cut will be brought in gradually, according to Mr Eliseu Resende, finance minister. It is the most radical part of the package of measures he will present today to the International Monetary Fund, in the hope of a new stand-by accord. A senior IMF official, speaking last week before the measures were announced, warned that the fund's patience with Brazil's 'six years of gradualist approach' was running out. The IMF was not willing to jeopardise its credibility by supporting what it saw as 'an overly gradualist and minimally ambitious programme'. The official described the country's record as 'a scandal that has to be corrected'. The IMF is expected to question the plan's concentration on spending to stimulate growth and alleviate poverty rather than on tackling inflation, now 30 per cent a month. Mr Resende insists 'the government will only spend what it can raise', but the measures seem unlikely to achieve his target of removing the deficit, now at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn). The plan includes considerable cuts in spending by state companies and revenue-raising exercises such as acceleration of the privatisation programme and cracking down on tax evaders, but the measures will need time to have any effect. The plan leaves real fiscal reform to be tackled during the debate on constitutional revision in October. 'It is hardly a frontal attack on inflation,' commented Mr Roberto Macedo, a former secretary of economic policy. 'It is more something to gain time.' There was also criticism over the decision to raise money through the sale of preferential shares in so-called strategic state companies, such as the electricity utility Eletrobras and the telecoms entity Telebras, with analysts pointing out that the government would be selling cheaply. But Brazil's financial markets reacted positively to the Franco plan, relieved by the absence of heterodox measures which have characterised previous Brazilian economic packages. Traders said they believed it signified the end of the paralysis which has marked the first six months of the Franco government. Banks operated normally yesterday, in sharp contrast to the panic that has greeted previous plans, and the main Sao Paulo stock market rose 5 per cent before lunchtime. The director of a leading bank said: 'It is not a messianic plan, it doesn't promise zero inflation and it doesn't confiscate anything. It's basically a 'let's stick by the budget' plan. What matters now is whether the government has the political will to execute it.' The new measures need Congressional approval.</p>

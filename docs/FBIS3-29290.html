The move would amount to final acceptance by Thailand that  its petrochemical industry cannot handle the swifter lowering of  protectionist barriers originally envisaged under AFTA's "fast  track". But Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin indicated  yesterday that Thailand was not seeking permanent withdrawal of  the sector from AFTA, not even on the list of exclusions that  will be subject to review after eight years. He said that to do  so would be a backward step that would run counter to Thailand's  leadership in cutting tariffs under the AFTA programme.    The Thai petrochemicals industry has been seeking a delay in  the reduction of AFTA barriers ever since the basic agreements  were signed at the ASEAN summit in Singapore in January 1992.  The industry argues that it cannot compete without the  protection of tariff barriers because the natural gas that it  uses as a raw material is considerably more expensive than the  supplies used by Malaysia and Indonesia, partly because of the  length of the undersea pipe that brings the gas from the Gulf of  Thailand to Rayong.    Some industries that use petrochemicals as raw materials,  such as textiles, have argued strongly against retaining  protection for petrochemicals. They say that the retention of  tariff barriers makes their costs higher than those of their  competitors in other ASEAN countries where petrochemicals  supplies are cheaper.    Officials say privately that Thailand under the first Anand  Panyarachun government initially agreed to put petrochemicals on  the "fast track" as a result of a challenge from Indonesia and  Malaysia.    During negotiations on the creation of the free trade area,  the other ASEAN countries are said to have argued that Thailand  was the most protectionist of the six. They therefore  reportedly challenged Thailand to demonstrate its seriousness by  agreeing to put the sensitive petrochemicals sector on the fast  track.    All along, some sections of the bureaucracy have questioned  whether the Anand government's position was justified, and  yesterday's decision by a Finance Ministry-led subcommittee  appears to reflect the feeling.    The sub-committee decided to send delegates to negotiate  with  Indonesia and Malaysia to keep petrochemical industries on the  "normal track" list. Mr Tharin admitted the two countries are  opposed to the idea.    An alternative proposal would be for all three countries to  put petrochemical industries under AFTA's exclusion list. This,  in effect, protects their petrochemical industries for another  eight years until the exclusion lists are reviewed.    Officials from several countries have warned that putting  sectors on the exclusion list will require swifter adjustments  since the present intention is for tariffs to drop sharply back  on schedule after the eight years of exclusion. Under the  regular "normal" and "fast" tracks tariffs are cut gradually in  steps of five percentage points over the relevant periods.    Mr Tharin said yesterday he believes that keener competition  over this sector would not affect Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs  are capable of competing with neighbouring countries provided  that the competition is on a level playing field.    The conclusions reached by the sub-committee have been  submitted to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, who  is in charge of international trade negotiations, he said.    Mr Tharin added that Dr Suphachai's compromise proposal to  protect petrochemical industries for another five years would be  considered as a backup proposal if Malaysia and Indonesia  disagreed with the Ministry of Finance's initiative. But Mr  Suphachai's proposal would adversely affect Singapore as its  petrochemical industry is more open than any other ASEAN country.    The sub-committee also considered revising the taxation on  raw materials, including LPG. The move was aimed at reducing  the costs of raw materials which would enhance the sector's  chance of competing.    In the long run local plastic industries should be able to  compete with imported products, and Thai tariffs should not be  too high, Mr Tharin said. He would submit the sub-committee's  proposals to the Board of Investment at its next meeting.</p>

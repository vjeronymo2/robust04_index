			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE may relaunch raw sugar contract THE LONDON Commodity Exchange board will discuss the reintroduction of raw sugar futures tomorrow following calls from some traders for a product to replace the contract that was withdrawn in April. The exchange's sugar futures market committee met yesterday to discuss the possible launch of a new contract, which would be designed to trade at a premium over New York's raw sugar futures . Support for listing raw sugar futures in London has increased following a dispute in the New York market over the delivery of Brazilian crystal sugar as raw sugar. The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange decided to allow crystal sugar to be delivered although many traders do not consider it to be raw sugar. 'A lot of people in London would love to see another raw sugar contract, but it would take a great deal of push to convince the rest of the world to use it,' said Mr Chris Pack, sugar analyst at C. Czarnikow, the London trade house. Some traders fear that the LCE has lost the initiative by de-listing its previous raw futures contract and that a new one will be hard to get off the ground. But by cashing in on disaffection in the New York market, the LCE could garner international support for the new product. The previous raw futures contract was withdrawn after it failed to make the transition back from screen to floor trading and volume steadily dropped off.</p>

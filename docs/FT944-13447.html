			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble 18% ahead Accelerating volume growth produced a record quarter at Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, with net earnings up 18 per cent to Dollars 792m on sales up 8 per cent at Dollars 8.2bn. Earnings in the US were up 12 per cent, and outside the US by 23 per cent. Procter said unit volume worldwide in its first quarter had risen by 10 per cent, or 7 per cent net of acquisitions. This compared with 5 per cent growth for the previous fiscal year as a whole. US sales and volume both rose 6 per cent. Outside the US, volume rose 13 per cent but sales only 8 per cent. Procter said the slower growth in international sales was partly due to price competition, and was not significantly affected by currency movements. The company attributed its better US earnings to its laundry and cleaning, paper and food and drinks sectors. It said this was primarily due to volume growth and cost control. Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.12. The shares continued their stronger trend of the past two months, rising 1 1/8 to 62 1/4.</p>

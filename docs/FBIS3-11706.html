The "strengthening of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]  capability and combat readiness" is the principal conclusion  reached by the Military Council Session of the Defense Ministry,  which was presided over by Defense Minister Raul Castro, the  second in the island's political hierarchy.    The effort and initiative displayed despite the special  period's limitations "have allowed the country to be in a  position to victoriously wage, if necessary, a peoples war," the  official report emphasized.    Referring to the economic issues, the 50 percent reduction  in  the military budget is important proof of the FAR members' will  to make the FAR cost the nation as little as possible, which  would also help reduce the national budget deficit, it was added  in the note prominently displayed by the Cuban communist  newspaper.    The article also emphasizes that "the important results  achieved in all areas of military activities would not have been  possible without proper discipline and the troops' high  political and moral condition."    Moreover, the newspaper reports Enrique Carrera was promoted  to the rank of division general on his 50th anniversary as a  combat pilot. It says that, "to everyone's satisfaction, he is  one of those generals who will die with their boots on," and he  is still an active member of the FAR at the age of 71.    During the promotion ceremony, General Ulises Rosales de  Toro, chief of the Armed Forces Supreme Command, said Carrera  "became a master of the air, and he modeled and forged character  and ethics standards that represent an example of human virtue,  trustworthy military honor at the service of his people,  patriotism, and revolutionary and communist spirit."    Gen. Enrique Carrera is one of the pilots who participated  in  air combat during the 1961 Bay of Pigs (Playa Giron) invasion.</p>

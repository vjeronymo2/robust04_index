			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: PAIR OF TIJUANA SHOWS TOO NARROW IN VISION  </P> <P> San Diego hardly deserves the epithet of a sleepy border town, but in terms of  recognizing artists living just on the other side of the line, this city has  slumbered long and deep.  </P> <P> Like the country at large, however, the city awoke with a start last year and  began to make up for lost time. Regular exhibitions of Mexican art have shown  at the Iturralde Gallery (formerly La Casa del Arte), and the La Jolla Museum  of Contemporary Art organized a show of Tijuana artists for its downtown space,  Sushi gallery played host to two shows of Tijuana artists, and an exhibition of  contemporary Mexican art has been seen at Mesa and Palomar colleges.  </P> <P> Each had its share of compelling work, and each introduced a local audience to  currents of activity that had not passed through San Diego with such vigor  before. None, however, claimed to be a comprehensive survey of its territory,  and viewers were left to wonder what else may have been overlooked while the  city's attention to the south lay dormant.  </P> <P> Two current shows at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (Paseo de los Heroes, Tijuana)  address that curiosity by presenting the work of more than 40 artists living in  Tijuana -- all of the "serious" artists there, according to a representative of  the center.  </P> <P> One show, "Elogio a Tijuana," delivers a eulogy, or declaration of praise, for  the city through a survey of its artists. The other, "Grupo Centenario,"  presents work made specifically in honor of the city's centennial this year by  10 artists working loosely as a collective.  </P> <P> Both shows contain work that is broad in range but overall narrow in vision.  Except for a handful of engaging paintings, the shows threaten to lull even the  most eager visitor back into the sleepy ignorance that characterized our  southward gaze for so long.  </P> <P> Tijuana's own dynamic growth, its status as a thoroughfare for immigrants  heading north, its extremes of wealth and poverty and numerous facets of its  history would seem to be fertile subjects for the artists in the "Grupo  Centenario" show. Most, however, adopt a static, shallow approach to their  theme, representing the city through images of its architectural landmarks  nestled within decorative compositions.  </P> <P> The bland tone of these works is broken only briefly, by the thoughtful work of  Manolo Luis Escutia and a collage by Alejandro Chanona. An Escutia triptych  pays homage to the anonymous women who work in maquiladoras; in another work,  he visualizes the city's history as a montage of human and material products,  both bearing strong imprints of American influence.  </P> <P> In "Las Cien Tes" ("One Hundred Ts"), Escutia examines the letter T, finding  its vertical and horizontal lines to be symbols of hope and frustration and,  together, an appropriate emblem for the city of Tijuana. He repeats the letter  on 100 sheets of paper, forming each with a different pattern or image that  represents an aspect of the city. This approach, with its political,  agricultural and cultural references, encourages a multifaceted reading of the  city, not one limited to its physical appearance.  </P> <P> Chanona's collage, "T. J. Cien Anos" ("T.J. 100 Years"), also provokes thought  about the city's character and the challenges it faces. All but one corner of  the collage is smothered by a dense patchwork of clothing tags, references to  Tijuana's status as a haven for American bargain hunters. In the one quiet  corner, only two labels appear. One bears the words One Way and an arrow  pointing up to the jumble of tags, and the other advertises a "Total Selloff,"  to which the artist has added the emblem of the Mexican flag and the words T.J.  100 Anos.  </P> <P> Through this small intervention, Chanona expresses a sharp note of concern  about the Americanization and exploitation of Tijuana. In the accompanying wall  label, he shares his cynical hope that in 100 years, when the city celebrates  its bicentennial, people will still be speaking Spanish and eating tacos.  </P> <P> The adjacent exhibition, "Elogio a Tijuana," is crowded with weak, facile  imagery, forced enigmas and failed fantasies. Only a few of the artists  included manage to convey a strong personal vision or style.  </P> <P> Felipe Almada's "El Jaguar," for instance, a simple yet bold rendering of a  jaguar being struck down by an anonymous, all-powerful hand, evokes a narrative  of mythic proportion. In an untitled photograph by Ana Maria Herrera, a  sculpture of a male torso stands amid the deep shadows of an abandoned  building. The surrogate human presence exudes a mystery and surreal magnetism  akin to the subjects of Mexico's photographic patriarch, Manuel Alvarez Bravo.  </P> <P> The soul of the show is not to be found in these scattered impressions,  however, but in the grouping of 2 dozen paintings by Benjamin Serrano Banuet,  who died last year. The exhibition begins with his relatively staid,  environmental portraits of a prominent Tijuana family, then jumps abruptly to a  whimsical self-portrait.  </P> <P> Here, the artist playfully pinches the conventions of dignified portraiture  that rule the preceding paintings by appearing shirtless, wearing a folded  paper hat and false nose, and playing a violin to an oversized green apple.  </P> <P> Serrano was a prolific artist whose paintings, prints and sculptural  assemblages embody the wisdom of dreams and the whimsical spirit of games.  Though this selection of his works is spotty and includes none of his  brilliantly funny sculptures, it does hint at the richness of his personal  vocabulary. Impossible flying contraptions sputter about among turtles with  wings, fish with human heads, people with paper-doll tabs and women ripe with  sexuality.  </P> <P> Several of the artists in "Elogio a Tijuana" emulate Serrano's spree through  the realms of fantasy and dreams, but none matches his passion and wit.  </P> <P> "Elogio a Tijuana" was organized by the Centro's new director, Pedro Ochoa  Palacio, to mark the first visit by the director of the Consejo Nacional para  la Cultura y las Artes. Both shows continue at the center through Aug. 14.  </P></p>

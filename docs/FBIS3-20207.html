			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Turkey Faces Its Worst Economic </F> Crisis"]    [Text] The economy is clearly on the rocks. Turkish  newspapers have been complaining for the past few days that the  economy has been sacrificed for the sake of the elections.    It is true that the government, despite claims to the  contrary, did not take the necessary steps to fend off the  current financial crisis which is systematically draining  Turkey's remaining economic resources. Yet, we feel this  coalition government would never be capable of preventing an  economic crisis, simply because it lacks both the leadership and  the competence to do so.    We do not want to say that this government or that prime  minister would be better for Turkey. We are merely stating the  fact that the coalition partnership between the True Path Party  (DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is not  equipped with the staff or the know-how to overcome the current  crisis.    The surge of major foreign currencies against the Turkish  lira [TL] is pushing the economy into utter chaos. The central  Bank and the Treasury seem completely incapable of making a move  to avert the collapse of the Turkish currency.    This in return is creating some very serious problems in the  market.    The traders of many industrial inputs which have to be  imported have shut their shops and are refusing to supply the  industry with these vital inputs. Traders say the foreign  currency situation is so unsettled they will wait for the  situation to return to normal before they start operations again.    That is why many industries are temporarily packing up. The  auto and textile industries, which are the driving force of  Turkish industry, are completely paralyzed.    We have to add to all this the current stagflation, which  further complicates the industrial crisis.    We are aware the prime minister and the deputy prime  minister  are too busy with the election campaign to attend to the  economic crisis. But we feel the local elections are an alibi,  and that even under normal circumstances there is not much the  leaders of the coalition are capable of doing to salvage the  economy.    This situation cannot continue even a few weeks more. Those  who do not have fund reserves, those who have foreign currency  debts and even those who have domestic bank loans will all be  facing some very hard times in the not too distant future if the  slump of the TL continues at the current rate. This means the  ranks of the jobless will swell. It also means that all the  economic balances of the country will be disturbed, which in  turn will lead to domestic upheaval.    What we are facing is much more deadly than the murderous  PKK  terrorist organization...</p>

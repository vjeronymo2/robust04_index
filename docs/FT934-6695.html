			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / French welfare in terminal state: Recession has added to the woes of a system in need of reform For more than 500 days and nights a small group of nurses has maintained a protest sit-in outside the Ministry of Social Affairs on the Avenue de Segur in Paris, with a tenacity matching the persistence of the crisis in France's welfare state. Neither the nurses nor the crisis will go away. The nurses, who are protesting at understaffing and poor pay in French hospitals, promptly bought themselves a new tent when 'someone' set their old one alight in early November. For his part, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, warned this week that the deficits in the country's various welfare schemes  -pensions, unemployment and health insurance, and family allowances - were worse than he planned for six months ago. The chief reason is not that French welfare benefits are lavish, though they are so in the medical field. The crisis has, rather, been brought on by the recession and the fact that the funding of the French welfare state is still little changed from its origin as a series of schemes co-financed by employers and employees. Welfare contributions by employers and employees accounted in 1990 for no less than 44 per cent of total French tax receipts, compared with 17.5 per cent in the UK, and a paltry 3.1 per cent in Denmark, which funds its generous welfare provisions out of general taxation. The recession, the worst France has experienced for 20 years, has shaken the financial foundation of its welfare state. The 3.24m people without jobs (11.7 per cent of the work force) no longer have anything to contribute to the system, which in turn seems to be part of the reason for their unemployment. High social charges have helped price workers, especially those with relatively low skills, out of the job market. There is now a consensus that for reasons of equity and efficiency the burden of France's welfare state must be shifted off company payrolls and on to taxpayers. A start was made in 1990 when the Socialist party introduced the CGS tax, levied on all forms of income (not just wages), paid by virtually all French households (rather than just the 50 per cent who pay income tax) and designed to top up the various welfare schemes. Mr Balladur has since doubled the CGS tax rate, and begun in his 1994 budget to shift the cost of family allowances that employers have to pay for their lower-paid workers on to the national budget. The prime minister said this week he wants to shift health insurance charges in the same direction. The recession's most obvious impact has been on the Unedic unemployment insurance scheme, which has fallen steadily deeper into the red. The prospect that the scheme might actually go bankrupt at a time of rising unemployment brought action in July. The government agreed to put in FFr10bn (Pounds 1.14bn) a year, the employers chipped in with a further FFr9.35bn, employees are contributing an extra FFr6bn, and though they did not have a say in the matter, the unemployed themselves in effect contributed FFr4bn through a reduction in dole payments. 'In theory, this is enough to keep the scheme going up to a level of 3.6m unemployed,' says an official of the Patronat employers' federation. That figure is not a total abstraction, since even Mr Balladur does not foresee unemployment coming down until late 1994. An ageing population, coupled with a rising level of structural unemployment, made reform of the state pension system inevitable, with fewer people in work to pay the pensions of more people in retirement. The government did not change the legal retirement age of 60, but instead this summer introduced legislation extending from 37.5 to 40 years the period which people need to work to qualify for a full state pension and recalculated this full pension on the average of a person's 25 best-paid years, rather than his or her 10 best-paid years. 'Strangely, pension reform which many thought would rock the system passed very quietly,' says a senior aide to Mrs Simone Veil, the social affairs minister. 'One reason was that the change has been staggered over 10-15 years.' To supplement reduced pay-as-you-go state pensions, and also to create the big pension funds which play such a big role in other countries' financial markets, the government aims to present a plan next year to introduce capitalised private pensions. It may be only then that the magnitude of this year's changes to state pensions sinks in, as the French of working age realise that they are being asked to contribute twice over - once to those currently retired and once to their new private pensions. The biggest scope for savings is in health spending, which is higher than anywhere else in Europe and second only to the US. The French system is an expensive combination of freedom of choice (patients can pick their doctors, doctors can prescribe what they like) and of financial intervention by the state (which reimburses patients 70 per cent of what they pay doctors and a bit less for medicines, while picking up virtually the entire tab for hospital treatment). Mrs Veil is trying to get a handle on the soaring spending which this system produces. Aiming to save some FFr30bn next year, she has set the rise in hospital spending at 3.35 per cent in 1994 (compared with 5 per cent this year), while trying to oblige hospitals to 'pay' for new equipment like scanners with a compensatory saving like eliminating unnecessary beds. Of the country's 500,000 hospital beds, 60,000, mainly in rural areas, are said to be surplus to requirements. She has less direct leverage over general practitioners working outside hospitals. But the latter have agreed with the state health insurance agency to aim at limiting the rise in overall health spending to 3.4 per cent next year (compared with a 7 per cent increase this year). Criteria are being drafted on what constitutes 'unnecessary' medical treatment, with the threat of financial sanctions on doctors who ignore such guidelines. But so far it is the carrot, rather than the stick, that has been applied. To reduce their financial incentive in prescribing pills, doctors had their consultation fees raised on November 1.

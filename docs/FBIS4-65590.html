			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that the  government of the country is in control, and has called for an  end to the arguments. Stressing that she will always make use  of President Demirel's years of experience, Ciller stated that  she and the president are in full accord and that nobody should  be concerned about this issue. Ciller said: There are no  disputes at the top of the state, and I will not permit any.    Demirel received Ciller at Cankaya Mansion and conferred  with  her for approximately one and a half hours. Ciller answered  reporters' questions on various issues after her meeting with  Demirel.    [Begin recording] [Ciller] I am not offended by Demirel.  The president is a person for whom I have great respect. Our  honorable president is at the top of the state, and there is no  place for dispute. A very beneficial dialogue took place during  the meeting. We assessed all the issues facing the country. We  will continue to hold such meetings. We discussed various  issues, from internal politics to foreign affairs and the  economy. I have a very positive dialogue with the president.    [Unidentified correspondent] How do you interpret Demirel's  news conference this morning and his criticism of you?    [Ciller] He has not informed me of any such criticism. He  presented me with a summary of his news conference. I read it.  I did not find any criticism there. I cannot comment on this  issue, because I do not know the contents of the news  conference. I repeat: There are no disputes at the top of the  state.    [Correspondent] Did the president advise you on any issues?    [Ciller] He had various ideas and advice. There were issues  to which I listened carefully. I would like to point out that  this kind of dialogue has always existed between the president  and myself. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you still hold the view that the former  government's mistakes play a role in the present economic crisis?    [Ciller] There are a series of problems which have existed  since 1986. We cannot ignore those issues. I am determined in  this view. My job is to find solutions, and that is what I am  doing. Let there be no doubt that this country will emerge from  this situation healthier than ever. We are going to reestablish  the balance and, within a short time, everybody will notice the  changes. I fully believe that the future of our country is  bright. It has only been a month since we started to implement  the measures. If it were possible to solve all these issues in  one month, they would have been resolved in 1987. What the  other governments could not do while they were the only ones in  power, we are determined to achieve with a coalition government.  The worst is over. We are going to start witnessing favorable  developments. I must point out that once we emerge from this  situation, the country will have achieved a balance that will  enable us to compete with the most developed countries in the  world. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What do you think of the president's view  that the life span of coalition governments is not long?    [Ciller] The coalition emerges from the Assembly. In the  1991 elections, the people voted for a coalition. We are going  to solve this issue in the Assembly. The regime will function.  There will be important developments regarding the regime and  democracy. Let nobody have arguments regarding the regime. Our  democracy will also develop. We will continue with the  coalition.

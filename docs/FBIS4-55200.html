			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime </F> ministerial candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats; place  and date not given: "There Is No Sense in Talking About A  Liberal-Dominated Coalition"]    [Text] We are now drawing the voters' attention to the  fact that only votes for the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]  can prevent an absolute majority for the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] -- Gabor Kuncze told us. Kuncze told us that the  SZDSZ did not give up the idea of becoming a governing party  after the elections.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will the SZDSZ election strategy change in  view of the fact that the three parties participating in the  liberal cooperation fared far worse than expected in the first  round of the elections?    [Kuncze] We want to continue to conduct a positive campaign  in which we would like to win over as many voters as possible  for our program. At the same time, it is no longer sense to  talk about the emergence of a liberal-dominated coalition after  the elections, because the results of the other parties that  signed a cooperation agreement with us do not make such a  coalition possible. In any case, the aforementioned agreement  continues to be valid.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In addition to replacing the current  government, the SZDSZ also aimed at creating a liberal-dominated  coalition. After failing to achieve this, what is the major  goal of the SZDSZ?    [Kuncze] We are now drawing the voters' attention to the  fact that only votes for the SZDSZ can prevent an absolute  majority for the MSZP. For this, we highlight the differences  between the election programs of the SZDSZ and the MSZP. We  call upon the voters to give us the authority to represent our  program adequately in the coming period.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It is hardly possible to efficiently  represent a program from the opposition. Therefore, what you  have just said means that the SZDSZ wants to participate in the  next coalition.    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not given up the idea of becoming a  governing party if it can adequately represent itself in  Parliament after the elections.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What if the MSZP gets an absolute majority?    [Kuncze] This would harm the chances of a coalition between  the two parties. Our previous position on the possibilities and  conditions of a coalition is unchanged. The SZDSZ will  participate in a coalition if it can represent itself with an  adequate weight. I would stress once more: We ask the voters to  give us a mandate for this. All the questions about the future  coalition can only be answered after 29 May, when we know the  results of the second round.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you agree with the conclusion that the  "national cooperation" declared by the Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] to contain the further advance of the MSZP will harm  the election chances of the SZDSZ?    [Kuncze] On the one hand, such a cooperation does not add to  the chances of the conservative bloc. On the other hand, such  an attitude on the part of the right-wing parties could  facilitate an absolute majority for the MSZP. The MDF has  already contributed greatly to the success of the MSZP, and we  think it would be unfortunate if the MDF continued this mistaken  policy between the two election rounds.</p>

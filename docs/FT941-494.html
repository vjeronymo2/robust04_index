			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / BBC Arabic news service is planned More than 200 broadcasting jobs will be created in London following yesterday's announcement that the BBC has signed a 10-year agreement to supply programmes for a new 24-hour Arabic-language television channel. The satellite channel, aimed at the Middle East and north Africa, will be launched from BBC Television Centre in west London in the next few months. The service, from BBC World Service Television, is being financed by the Mawarid investment and industrial group of Saudi Arabia. The programme supply and distribution agreement - worth about Pounds 200m - is with Orbit Communications Company, a Rome-based subsidiary of Mawarid. The BBC will initially offer six hours a day of international and Middle East news and then move to a 24-hour schedule before the end of the year. The channel was the subject of threatened litigation between the BBC and Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV in Hong Kong. Star TV saw the new Arabic channel as a breach of its contract with the BBC because the two satellite services overlapped geographically. It is likely, however, that Star TV had wanted to terminate its contract with the BBC for some time, and a compromise deal was agreed last week. The BBC will next month vacate its slot on the northern beam of the Star satellite system aimed at China in return for an extension on the south beam. This means that the BBC will be able to continue broadcasting to India until 1995. BBC World Service Television has also recently signed a deal for a joint venture in Japan.</p>

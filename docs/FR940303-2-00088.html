			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All documents executed in connection with the Capital Advance must be listed regardless of whether the document is required by HUD. The appropriate HUD or FHA form number, if applicable, must be indicated in parens after each document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the Documents must be reviewed. The following HUD guidelines should be followed in preparing or reviewing the Documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. HUD Handbook 4571.5, Supportive Housing for the Elderly_Conditional Commitment_Final Closing, dated July 1992, should be followed. This Handbook provides copies of most of the Documents required by HUD to be used in the 202 Program Closings. Until HUD publishes a similar Handbook for the Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program, section 811 Capital Advance closings shall follow the 4571.5 Handbook. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. All 202 and 811 Owners must adopt the model Certificate of Incorporation (HUD-91732-A-CA) except for Field Counsel modifications related to State law or modifications required by the Internal Revenue Service. All other modifications must be approved by HUD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The HUD field counsel have not been consistent in requiring HUD to be named in the Financing Statements as a secured party or as its interests may appear; consequently, the requirement that HUD be so named is now being standardized. This should be clarified through appropriate language in the Security Agreement. The purpose is to clarify that, under certain circumstances, HUD may assert some rights in the personalty arising under the Regulatory Agreement which would precede an assignment of the mortgage. This is desirable in the event HUD exercises some of its remedies under the Regulatory Agreement in cases where the mortgage has not been assigned to HUD. It will not be necessary for HUD to consent to every UCC termination, renewal, assignment, etc. until HUD's rights as a secured party are established. HUD is being named ``as its interests appear'' so that, for example, where HUD obtains a court order, HUD will be able to establish a paramount interest in the Project income stream, and other personality pursuant to the Regulatory Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. UCC searches: The UCC Search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search firm, the counsel to the Owner or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction. One or more UCC searches performed not more than 30 days prior to the date of the opinion of Owner's counsel must be made and retained by the field counsel in the Capital Advance file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Evidence of zoning compliance: The evidence of zoning compliance will vary depending on the circumstances. The evidence should establish that the building, if constructed according to plans and circumstances, will comply with all zoning requirements. The evidence may be in the form of a letter or certificate from the appropriate local official stating that, if the building is constructed according to the plans and specifications submitted for review, the building will comply with all zoning requirements. If the locality has no zoning ordinance, a letter should be submitted from the chief executive stating such. In those circumstances, it may be necessary to obtain a letter from the local planning body of the county in which the project is located, that the proposed development is compatible with the county's comprehensive plan. If the zoning approval is based upon a variance or other special action, the closing may have to be delayed until the time for appeals has run. In extremely complex cases, an opinion may need to be obtained from legal counsel specializing in local zoning matters. Such letter must be attached as an exhibit and referenced in the appropriate paragraphs of the Opinion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Survey: the survey must be signed, sealed and dated within 90 days of the closing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Docket search: The Docket Search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search firm, the counsel to the Owner or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. If any UCC Financing Statements have been filed on the Personalty in conjunction with any transaction other than the Capital Advance, they must be identified to the HUD field counsel as well as details with respect to how such Financing Statements will be terminated at the time of closings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. If the Owner or any principal of the Owner is involved in any litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> such litigation matter(s) must be disclosed in writing to HUD field counsel. If the litigation involves HUD's compliance with civil rights requirements, it must immediately be brought to the attention of appropriate Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity personnel. As an example, it is not uncommon for neighbors of a proposed site for a group home for persons with disabilities to harbor discriminatory attitudes toward persons with disabilities and to sue to attempt to block the establishment or operation of a group home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Acceptability of Counsel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Owner's counsel must opine as to the law of the Property jurisdiction and the state of Owner's organization, if different from the Property jurisdiction. HUD requires that Owner's counsel be admitted to practice law in each jurisdiction in which such admission is required by the laws or ethical considerations of the bar to be able to give the opinion. If multiple jurisdictions are involved, two opinions may be required: one with respect to the organization of the Owner and another with respect to the real property and Capital Advance issues. A combination of the Owner's regular counsel and special local counsel may be required to satisfy this requirement. If counsel's satisfaction of these requirements is not evident from the letterhead of the firm, the field counsel should include a written explanation in the Capital Advance Closing File. In all events, each provision in the Guide must be addressed whether one or more opinions is required to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Signatures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The opinion may be signed by an authorized person of the law firm, in that person's name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Owner's Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A form of Owner's Certification is attached. The form represents the minimum amount of information that should be obtained from the Owner (but additions, revisions and rephrasing are acceptable so long as the Owner is certifying as to factual matters and not legal conclusions). The Owner's Certification must be dated the same date as the Capital Advance Documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

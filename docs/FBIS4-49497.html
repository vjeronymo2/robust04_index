			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing met with participants to the 1994 Scola world conference  here today.    Scola, based in McClelland, Iowa, U.S.A., is a global  language- teaching TV station. Its programs cover North and  South Americas and other countries and regions.    Since 1991, China's Yellow River TV station has been  providing the Scola station with news program and features about  China.    During today's meeting, Li congratulated the opening of  Scola's annual conference in China, saying he was pleased to  learn that Yellow River TV station's programs are welcome in the  U.S.    Describing Scola's teaching-language via satellite TV as "a  great cause", Li said foreign-language teaching enhances mutual  understanding, promotes friendship and cooperation as well as  economic and cultural exchanges among different countries and  peoples.    Scola President Lee Lubbers said he was proud that his TV  station beams Chinese news programs to North America.    It is important to let U.S. students to know about China and  spread Chinese language in that country, he said.    On May 2, Scola convened its annual meeting in Taiyuan,  capital of Shanxi Province, where the Yellow River TV station is  headquartered. Television and educational experts and scholars  from the U.S., Germany, France, Japan and China's 15 provinces  and municipalities attended the conference.    Zeng Jianhui, director of the State Council's Information  Office, and Zhang Weiqing, vice governor of Shanxi Province,  were present at today's meeting.</p>

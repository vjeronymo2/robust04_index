			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Hospital closures proposal today CLOSURE of several famous London hospitals and rationalisation of many others will be proposed in a report published by the government today. A version of the report leaked last night by London Health Emergency, a pressure group, identifies St Bartholomew's - London's oldest teaching hospital, in the heart of the Square Mile - as the most famous casualty. Other hospitals on the closure list, according to the leaked document, are Charing Cross, Queen Charlotte's, the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Two other famous teaching hospitals - Guy's and St Thomas' - would be rationalised on a single site. The contents of the document leaked by London Health Emergency are consistent with the expected recommendations of Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern regional health authority, who has conducted a year-long government-commissioned study of London's hospital provision. Health service union leaders reacted angrily last night to the likelihood of the report recommending widespread closures. They estimate that up to 20,000 jobs might be at risk from the proposals. Mr Hector MacKenzie, general secretary of Cohse, said that the Tomlinson proposals threatened to do for the health service in London 'what the government has tried to do for the mining industry'. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said Labour 'totally' rejected the Tomlinson proposal to 'subject London's health care to the chaos of market forces.' He promised to resist 'any hospital closures' which were not proceeded by the development of alternative facilities. According to London Health Emergency, other recommendations will include reducing the Middlesex and University College teaching hospitals to a smaller unit on the UCH site, and scaling-down St Mary's teaching hospital, Paddington. The government will make final decisions in the new year following consultation.</p>

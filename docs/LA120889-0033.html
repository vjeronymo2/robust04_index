			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Margaret Honda, a young San Diego artist, is intrigued with "found" structures.  Her "Traps" are precisely that: mechanical devices used by fishermen and  trappers. These are modest objects made with the honest materials (wood and  metal, mostly) and austere, clean-lined silhouettes that get good marks in  contemporary art. They are also, of course, instruments of killing. In precise,  matter-of-fact descriptions -- surely as important as the three-dimensional  components -- Honda explains how each of the seven pieces achieves its ends.  </P> <P> We've been brainwashed with the notion that the utilitarian objects of many  cultures also have strikingly "aesthetic" aspects; Honda stands this truism on  its head. The traps are attractive tools, admirable for their elegant  combination of simple physics and time-tested observation. But they also have a  deadly power. The canniest viewer-traps are the trickiest looking pieces, like  "Deadfall," a pair of boards propped at a 45-degree angle with a delicate  rigging of bamboo, bait wire and tin tack, or "Box Snare," in which airy curls  of wire prove to be coldly efficient nooses.  </P> <P> The real zinger in this work is its tacit invitation to contemplate the  mysterious ways of animal and human psychology -- not only those of trapper and  beast but also that of the viewer, who is enticed (via alluringly  "contemporary" forms) to investigate the relationship between the hunter and  his prey.

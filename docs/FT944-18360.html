			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Warburg stumbles SG Warburg could have done without more bad publicity after its embarrassing spat with Swiss Bank Corporation over the Enterprise bid for Lasmo. It has given scant detail of what appears to be a slump in its trading income this year. Yet it would be wrong to assume that this fresh disappointment implies a misguided strategy. If there are flaws, they have more to do with implementation. Warburg has laid itself open to the charge of complacency in two areas. With its market-making and proprietary trading activities, it aimed to enhance its profitability by focusing on the revenue line. But costs matter too, and those at Warburg are high: average staff costs per employee last year were Pounds 105,000 compared with only Pounds 81,000 at Kleinwort Benson. Second, market-making is a mug's game in weak markets, but the risks can be reduced by judicious use of derivatives, an expertise which Warburg has been slow to develop. Had management paid more attention to these points, its strategy might now escape scrutiny. After all most investors seemed happy to accept the notion that global aspirations were natural for a bank of Warburg's size. Securitisation of financial markets is creating more business for investment banks, so Warburg is in a growth industry. The snag, as yesterday's announcement showed, is that this means greater focus on trading with all its inherent risks. For a bank like Warburg, the price of ambition is a fall in the quality of earnings.</p>

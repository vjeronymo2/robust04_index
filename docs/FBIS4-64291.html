			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S.N." report: "Felipe Gonzalez at Lowest Level of </F> Popularity Since He Arrived at Moncloa Palace"]    [Text] Gonzalez' popularity has fallen appreciably.  According to a Gallup poll for ABC, only 30 Spanish people out  of 100 now approve of his political conduct, as against 35 in  August 1993. The loss of popularity is confirmed by the  increase in the number of Spanish people disapproving of his  conduct, which rises from 37 percent last year to 45 percent.  These figures put him at the lowest level of popularity since  he took office.    The figures obtained in the Gallup poll for this newspaper  on  people's assessment of the main political leaders show that only  30 out of every 100 Spanish people approve of Spanish Prime  Minister Felipe Gonzalez' political conduct.    These figures confirm an appreciable decline in the head of  government's popularity with respect to last August's figures,  when approval stood at 35 percent, and disapproval was much less  than at present, with 37 percent in 1993. This decline in  popularity can be seen in the fact that 45 percent of Spanish  people now disapprove of his conduct.    On the other hand, these results are very similar to those  obtained in December 1992, when Gonzalez' popularity stood at  the lowest level since he had taken office.    Critical assessments of Felipe Gonzalez' role are made with  a  significantly higher percentage by men and individuals under the  age of 35, belonging to the upper middle class, with higher  education, and living in large cities.  <H5>  Less Critical </H5>   On the other hand, support for his conduct comes from the  group of people characterized in the sample as older than 54,  having incomplete primary education, and living in medium-sized  cities. These interviewees place themselves as lower middle or  lower class.    As far as People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar is  concerned, the percentage of approval of his work in opposition  is 25 percent, while the disapproval figure is 45 percent.    When these figures concerning the political performance of  the opposition's chief representative are compared with those of  a year ago, a slight fall in the percentages is seen, with the  number of those disapproving of his conduct being lower.    The profiles of those supporting and criticizing Jose Maria  Aznar's performance cannot be defined in terms of an absolutely  clear tendency. At most, it can be said that the most critical  assessment of his conduct comes from citizens placing themselves  in the lower middle and lower class.    As far as United Left Coordinator General Julio Anguita is  concerned, it must be emphasized that, according to the Gallup  figures, he is the politician with the least bad rating among  those subjected to this assessment. Proof of this is the fact  that the percentage of those assessing his conduct favorably is  33 percent, while this figure was just 30 percent only a year  ago.    These figures represent an appreciable improvement in the  Spanish people's perception of the United Left leader.  Moreover, those who now disapprove of his political conduct are  35 percent, as against the 40 percent who did so in 1993.    For Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, 21 percent is the  figure of those approving of his political activity, while those  disapproving of it total 40 percent.    According to the poll figures, the trend in the Spanish  people's political assessment of Serra in the course of the past  year should be deemed slightly negative, since at the beginning  of last year 25 percent of citizens approved of his performance  and 41 percent disapproved of it.  <H5>  Negative Ratings </H5>   The politician who receives the highest percentage of  negative ratings of his conduct is Alfonso Guerra, with 53  percent of citizens as a whole. On the other hand, the  favorable ratings stand at 17 percent.    There is a marked rise in unpopularity for People's Party  politician Rodrigo Rato. Today, 12 percent of the interviewees  assess his conduct favorably, as against the 10 percent who did  so at the beginning of 1993. Those who disapprove of it have  risen from 18 percent a year ago to 32 percent at present.    In addition, it is important to point out that these  assessments are completely different from those made by the  various parties' voters. Thus it must be emphasized that 88  percent of United Left voters approve of Julio Anguita's conduct.    Among People's Party voters, approval of Jose Maria Aznar  stands at 71 percent. But Felipe Gonzalez secures the approval  of only 59 percent of those who voted for the Socialist Party in  June 1993.    In addition, the ranking order of the best known politicians  is headed by Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar, who both have  95 percent. Immediately after them come Julio Anguita and  Alfonso Guerra, with 94 percent, respectively. A little further  behind in the classification come Narcis Serra with 89 percent,  and Rodrigo Rato with 65 percent.</p>

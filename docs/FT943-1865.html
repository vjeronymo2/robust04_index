			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Jews win right to 'eruv' in London North London Jews will soon be able to visit friends on a sabbath and will not have to leave their homes unlocked. The first London 'eruv' - an area within which aspects of Jewish law are relaxed - is to be established in Barnet in north London. This follows a decision by the Department of the Environment to overturn Barnet Borough Council's refusal to allow the eruv on planning grounds. The council felt the poles and wires used for boundaries would be an eyesore in the area, which embraces Hampstead Garden Suburb. However, a department inspector, Mr David Rushby, decided after a public hearing last year that the proposals would not seriously harm the character and appearance of the area. Jewish sabbath laws forbid carrying anything out of doors, even keys carried in pockets. Pushing prams or wheelchairs is also prohibited. Strict adherence to the law can be severely limiting for disabled people and families with small children, who cannot attend synagogue services or visit relatives on what is traditionally a family day. The law is waived within an eruv. Many Jewish communities around the world already have eruvs, but this the first substantial one the United Synagogue Eruv Committee has managed to establish in Britain. The London eruv covers 11 square miles in the Golders Green and Hendon areas. Barnet Borough Council will not appeal against the decision.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (2): Ripples in a haven of tranquillity - The island has had great success in obtaining funds from the European Union. But there are clouds on the horizon. Dominick Coyle and Peter Wise report To its devotees, who return again and again as long-stay tourists, Madeira is heaven, or at very least an acceptable proximity. To less frequent visitors, and to first-time arrivals, the island is still a haven of tranquillity in an extremely agreeable year-round temperate climate. The regulars, many of whom have spent their winters there for 20 years and more, tend to be what retail bankers love to call clients of high net worth, and they are prepared to pay for luxury. Others will settle for less luxurious four and three star hotel accommodation, itself none too cheap. In a word, Madeira can be expensive for all visitors, but for companies setting up in free port operations there, it is one of the cheapest labour markets in Europe. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, nestles in the Atlantic off the African coast and almost 1,000km from Lisbon. An area of some 700 sq km - not a great deal larger than the Isle of Man - Madeira sits on top of an extinct volcano rising some four miles from the sea. It is the dominant part of the Madeiran archipelago, which includes the much smaller island of Porto Santo to the north and the uninhabited islands of Desertas and Selvagens. The discovery of Madeira in 1419 by the Portuguese explorer, Joao Goncalves Zarco, was almost a chance event since, like his successor, Christopher Columbus, he thought he was on a different navigational voyage. Claiming it for Prince Henry the Navigator, he named his discovery, A ilha de madeira (the wooded isle), and the name took root. (An island legend that Madeira was discovered almost 75 years earlier by an Englishman, one Robert Machim, said to have been shipwrecked there with his mistress, contains more romance but, apparently, less historical accuracy. It is still touted by souvenir sellers in the capital, Funchal.) Madeira's international airport near Santa Cruz is well to the north-east of Funchal, and the landing there is no great joy, for passengers and pilots alike. The runway rests deep between two mountain ridges which can generate alarming cross-currents. Fortunately, the island's charms and its spectacular scenery quickly reduce the pulse rate of new arrivals, and a glass or two of Madeira wine can soon complete the process. But the airport is a problem, and according to Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the colourful president of the regional government since 1978, its planned expansion by some 500 metres on stilts out into the Atlantic, coupled with a two degree realignment of the existing runway 'is the key to the development of the Madeiran economy'. It will cost an estimated Es60bn (Pounds 233m), some two-thirds of the cost being met by the European Union. But it will allow widebody aircraft to land and considerably reduce transportation costs  -for both passengers and freight. In fact, Brussels has been a veritable breadbasket for Madeira in recent years, ever since Portugal joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1986. As one of Europe's most deprived regions, and allowing for the additional economic disadvantages of its island status, Madeira has been raking in EU money under its regional, structural, training and any other fund for which Brussels can be tapped. Even his detractors on the island acknowledge that when it comes to extracting money from the EU, Mr Jardim is a past master. The signs of this largesse are everywhere. Virtually all major infrastructural developments carry the 12 gold stars against the European blue background, proclaiming who is really paying the piper. The internal debate, and it is considerable, is not about getting Brussels money, but on how it should be spent. The Jardim regime says it should go on more and better roads, new hospitals and education. Its critics would like more of the EU support to go towards modernising industry and in developing tourism. Mr Antonio J. Trindade, a hotelier and head of the tourism section of Madeira's chamber of commerce, believes there should be a better relationship between the regional government and the industrial and services sectors, and a more even distribution of the cash cow from Brussels. Other critics think that new highways are important for opening up much of the island outside Funchal to tourist development, but they ask rhetorically whether getting from A to B five minutes faster on a small island amounts to a great economic achievement or the best use of resources. Mr Jardim will have none of this, claiming that his critics are the few remaining big landowners and some long-established British families, whom he seems to view as a somewhat lower order than the natives, or the small farmers who are seeking subsidies 'but who just want to spend it in the tavern'. All are agreed on one thing: as long as Brussels will pay, let us get as much as possible. Madeira has definitely benefited from the subventions from Brussels. In the mid-1970s, the island's per capita income was less than one quarter of the European average; today it is close to half, and not all that much behind that of Portugal itself. The Lisbon government has been generous to the island whose population of around 254,000 is less than 3 per cent of Portugal's. Nevertheless, Madeira is getting some 6 per cent of all EU support going to Lisbon. The fact that the political structure of Mr Jardim's regional government mirrors that of the ruling centre-right Social Democratic Party on the mainland may also have helped. Impressive infrastructural developments apart, EU funds have assisted in the establishment of the main activities now being co-ordinated by the Madeira Development Company. These include an industrial free trade zone, an offshore financial centre, an international services facility and a new shipping register. An extensive range of attractive tax and support concessions through to the year 2011, provided under Lisbon legislation and approved by the European Commission, is the magnet to attract new industry, banking and related financial services. In essence, the industrial free trade zone is the regional government's main instrument for creating jobs, not just for the existing unemployed (under 5 per cent of the island's workforce), but for the thousands more who are underemployed in the declining agricultural sector. It is early days yet, and the development company's promotional activities have been held back by the slow progress of the enabling legislation through the Lisbon parliament, but the initial signs are encouraging. Add in the sizeable revenues from the tourism sector, despite two poor years since the 1991 peak, and the island's economic performance is impressive. Provisional figures estimate last year's growth at around 6 per cent, compared with a sharp recession in Portugal itself. On Madeira how the regional government allocates the funds from both Lisbon and Brussels is inevitably the main driving force in the economy, together of course with the dynamics of the tourist industry. The immediate outlook is positive, but there are some in Funchal who see a possible dark cloud on the horizon, although the majority view is that their forecast is too pessimistic. It touches on South Africa after last month's general elections. Folk of Madeira origin, either born there or first-generation settlers in South Africa, are estimated to outnumber the entire population of the island by two to one. What if they were all to come back, or even some of them, many of whom would almost certainly be of the older generation? Such an influx would produce extraordinary economic and social strains, but the signs are that preliminary planning by South African Madeirans is focused more on Canada and Australia than on their original homeland. Madeira is keeping its fingers crossed, although it is known that the Lisbon government has made contingency plans, just in case.</p>

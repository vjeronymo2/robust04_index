			<p>BFN     [Text] According to an opinion poll by the Institute for a  Multiparty Democracy, the estimated support for the ANC in the  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region has shrunk by  almost 8 percent in the past three months, while the National  Party [NP] has gained almost 3 percent. The poll shows that the  ANC can now bargain on 38 percent support and the NP on 18.  Sixteen percent of respondents have refused to say for whom  they plan to vote, and 8 percent have not yet made up their  minds. The poll has revealed that the situation in at least  half of the black residential areas is such that voters are  unable to make political choices without interference. A survey  released in Natal yesterday showed that the ANC enjoyed 37  percent support, Inkatha 18 percent, and the NP 14.</p>

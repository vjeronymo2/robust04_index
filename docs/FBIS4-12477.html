			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Husayn in Washington] </F>   [Excerpt] The United States has conveyed urgent information  to an Arab capital, thus foiling an assassination plot just a  few days before its implementation.    According to the information, a plot targeted Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, along with certain military and  civilian leaders. The plot was to be linked to the current  differences between Yemeni leaders, whether this was revealed  before or after its implementation, in a manner that would pave  the way for wide- scale fighting--not just a possible clash  between the north and the south--that would drown the whole of  Yemen in waves of fighting.    The source of the information at the U.S. Department of  State  refused to give more details on the plot, but hinted that  regional quarters were aware of the plan and supported the  assassination plot, which was due to be carried out during the  first half of this month.    The source declined to reveal whether the Yemeni capital,  Sanaa, was informed of the details of the plot or if only the  Arab capital in question was asked to withdraw its support for  the assassination plot and its sponsorship of those  masterminding it.    The source also refused to draw a link between the current  military buildup in Yemen and the exchange of accusations  between the two main parties on one hand, and the assassination  plot that was exposed on the other. It seems that the Yemeni  leadership in Sanaa was not directly informed about the plot.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, January 19 (LETA) -- At the news conference  the Chairman of the Latvian High Court, Gvido Zemrbo, made a  statement on the report released by the command of the  North-Western military groups of the Russian Army. He said that  the President and the Latvian Government officially apologized  to Russia for the incident on January 10, when two Russian  generals were for several hours detained. However, the command  of the North-Western forces ordered the use of weapons in the  case of assault of the facilities and servicemen of the Russian  Army, stationed on the Latvian territory.    Besides, Gvido Zemribo stressed that the Latvian Republic is  an independent and democratic state, where only its laws and  court may work. Anyone, who commits a crime on the Latvian  territory will face the penalty provided by the criminal code of  the Latvian Republic. If crimes would be committed by diplomats  or other foreigners their cases will be reviewed through the  diplomatic channels or in accordance with the mutual agreement  between the countries. There is no such an agreement between  Latvia and Russia, saying Russian servicemen are not subject to  the Latvian jurisdiction. Therefore, the above mentioned deeds  and actions by the command of the North-Western military groups  violate Latvia's sovereignty, said Gvido Zemribo.    In case Russian servicemen unlawfully use weapons against  Latvian residents, they will have to answer for their reactions  as it is provided by the Latvian legislature. This refers both  to those who used weapons and to those who ordered to use them.  Moreover, such crimes will be investigated by the Latvian  investigatory bodies and not by the Russian Military Office of  Public Prosecutor.</p>

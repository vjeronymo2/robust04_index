			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts: Don Quixote is sadly well off tilt - Ballet 'Remote and ineffectual Don' wrote Hilaire Belloc - in different circumstances, certainly, but under no less real provocation. The Royal Ballet has marked its return to Covent Garden after an American jaunt by offering us Don Quixote. Is it bravado, menopausal caprice, desperation, that dictated this choice? The staging is wrong on every count. Text, score, performances, design, are equally dreadful, equally guilty in deforming a jolly old ballet and showing the company at a total loss, facing drama and dance with the desperate air of people trying to cope with a plague of hornets. Nothing must save this insolently inadequate production from the breaker's yard, although on Saturday night Sylvie Guillem seized gladly upon it as a show-case for her best qualities. That, in the process, her performance - witty, exultantly brilliant, amused and amusing - made the rest of the cast look even more funereal, like a convention of disaffected corpse-washers and plague-nurses, is no surprise. She darted and flirted, cut every step with exactly the right sophistication (how dowdy our local misses looked by contrast) and enjoyed herself hugely. So did we - when she was on stage. Mlle Guillem understands how much too far to go in galvanising a ballet which must be lit by a kind of charming sauciness in step and in playing. Russian ballerinas - Plisetskaya, Maximova, Kurgapkina, Semenyaka - have taken this choreography and by their own pleasure in the piece have fired their colleagues to join in the fun. Mlle Guillem did her very best on Saturday night, and her partner, Oliver Matz from Berlin, matched her in vivacity, but they could not strike sparks from the dank activities surrounding them. I do not think I have ever seen the Royal Ballet look less like a national ensemble: muffed dancing (the matadors in the first act on desperate form; the Queen of the Dryads and her girls trudging through their dances; mimsiness of style an epidemic), and comedy that was about as amusing as a baby's coffin. Matz, returning as a guest partner for Mlle Guillem, provided breezy virtuosity, and made Basilio unabashedly cheerful - there's little else to do with the role - with a neat line in groping during his supposed death-scene (albeit this Kitri knew how to keep him under control). The only other performance worth considering is that of the mysterious drunk, master of tremulous balance, who skirts the edges of the stage in Act 1. He is funny, which no-one else in the ensemble remotely is, but entirely unconnected with Petipa's Don Quixote. He is, unjustly, not identified in the programme. Don Quixote is in repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.</p>

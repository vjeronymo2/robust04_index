			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Relief expressed in Seattle at Nafta victory Ministers and officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Seattle expressed relief at President Bill Clinton's Nafta victory in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, George Graham reports from Seattle. Although delegates have avoided saying that a Nafta defeat would turn Mr Clinton into a lame duck host for this 15 country gathering, officials clearly believe the US president will now be in a much stronger position to give leadership to Apec. 'He'll come here as a stronger duck,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade minister. 'Certainly, it seems to me to strengthen President Clinton's presentation of himself as a man committed to freer trade and liberal trade on a global basis,' said Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's minister for international trade.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: ACCLAIMED FATHER, DAUGHTER TEAM UP FOR  PERFORMANCES  </P> <P> Growing up, trumpet and fluegelhorn player Stacy Rowles was jazzed early on.  Her father, pianist Jimmy Rowles, played host to a steady stream of famous  visitors at their home in Culver City.  </P> <P> "Ben Webster used to sit me on his knee when I was 4. Billie Holiday held me  when I was 6 months old," said Rowles, who takes the stage with her father at 8  p.m. Friday and Saturday at All That Jazz, the new club adjoining the Wall St.  Cafe in Rancho Bernardo.  </P> <P> Jimmy Rowles is 72 and in precarious health. He seldom plays clubs, so this is  a rare opportunity to hear an authentic original who came up in the big bands  of Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Bob Crosby. He went on to  accompany such great singers as Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> During the 1960s, Rowles spent a good portion of his time working on movie  soundtracks before going back to jazz full-time in the mid-'70s and building on  his reputation for Ellington-inspired piano work on a variety of compositions  by the Duke and his associate, Billy Strayhorn.  </P> <P> Rowles has recorded as a leader and with Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Ray Brown,  George Mraz and others. He's been up for a Grammy five times, including a  nomination for his 1982 solo piano album of music by Ellington and Strayhorn.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, his daughter's career is picking up steam. Stacy Rowles' resume is  almost as extensive as her father's, including work with bandleader Herman, Joe  Pass, Marian McPartland, Red Callender and Tommy Flanagan. In September, she  toured Europe with the Jazz Tap Ensemble and during October, played several  dates in France.  </P> <P> She alternates between fluegelhorn and trumpet. She likes the rich, velvety  sound of the fluegelhorn, and when she plays trumpet, she usually tempers its  bite with a mute. She names Freddie Hubbard, Clark Terry, Art Farmer and Chuck  Mangione as influences.  </P> <P> Her last album "Looking Back," released a year ago, includes her father plus  Donald Bailey on drums and Eric Von Essen on bass.  </P> <P> Rowles said she expects this weekend's fare to consist primarily of standard --  "jazz standards, not pop, rooted in be-bop. Dad has such a great knowledge of  tunes that he has written me a beautiful library of tunes you just don't hear  anymore, standards most people don't remember."  </P> <P> Elario's makes a significant break with tradition this week by featuring fusion  keyboardist Rob Mullins for five nights, beginning tomorrow. Actually, Mullins  doesn't like to label his music, and considers himself a jazz player first and  foremost, but this is the first time Elario's has headlined an electric jazz  band with a commercial radio following in one of its prime five-night slots.  </P> <P> "I enjoy playing a lot of different styles of music," Mullins said. "I'm sure a  lot of people are going to come in and wonder, 'Can these guys play?' and 'Is  this jazz?' We would say 'Yes' to both. The way that I look at jazz, I think  it's still growing and didn't stop developing in the '50s.  </P> <P> "There's a great amount of cultural diversity in America, and I try and draw on  everything I've been exposed to. The first two albums I bought when I was 13 or  14 were 'Big Swing Face' by Buddy Rich and the debut album by the Doors."  </P> <P> Mullins said he has been most influenced by artists who are "great technicians  but play with a lot of heart," naming Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner  and Bruce Hornsby.  </P> <P> His newest album "Tokyo Nights" marks a return to electric jazz following last  year's "Jazz Jazz," an all-acoustic album. At Elario's, his band will include  former Crusaders saxman Wilton Felder plus bassist Dave Carpenter and drummer  Joel Taylor. Mullins will play both acoustic piano and electric keyboards.  </P> <P> Shows begin at 8:30 and 10 Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday nights and at 9,  10:30 and midnight Friday and Saturday nights.  </P> <P> Now settled in Portland, Ore., after a September move from San Diego, pianist  Randy Porter teams up with fellow Portlander bassist Leroy Vinnegar and San  Diego flutist Holly Hofmann this Friday and Saturday night at 8:30 at the  Horton Grand Hotel downtown.  </P> <P> Porter reports a lively jazz scene in Portland. He has already picked up  regular work including Tuesday night date at a club called The Hobbit.  </P> <P> Vinnegar, 62, is a polished player and composer. He has recorded several albums  of his own and played on many others, including the incredibly popular late  1960s album "Swiss Movement" with Les McCann and Eddie Harris. Vinnegar has  never worked with Porter and Hofmann, so the music will consist primarily of  standards.  </P> <P> RIFFS: A recent article by this writer reported that Steve Allen wrote the song  "South Rampart Street Parade." While Allen is multitalented, his publicity  material exaggerated his credits a bit, as was pointed out by local musician  and jazz critic Murray Davison. The traditional jazz number credited to Allen  was actually penned by bassist Bob Haggart, a former La Costan. . . .  </P> <P> Fluegelhorn player Burnett Anderson, the ex-Texan now in Daniel Jackson's Real  Jazz Band at Croce's, which is featured at Croce's Monday nights, also plays  with a trio on Friday and Saturday nights at La Maze in National City (1441  Highland Ave.). . . .  </P> <P> This Friday and next at 8 p.m., guitarist Peter Sprague and a few friends play  jazz at The Roxy restaurant in Encinitas. . . .  </P> <P> Hollis Gentry takes a break from touring with guitarist Larry Carlton to appear  Saturday nights at 8 during November in the Grant Lounge at the U.S. Grant  Hotel downtown. . . .  </P> <P> Tobacco Road plays traditional jazz during its Thursday night "Let The Good  Times Roll" shows this month beginning at 8 at Top of the Kingston, 1055 1st  Ave. downtown.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Beatriz Padron from the "Evening Information Review" </F> newscast]    [Text] Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are the only Latin  American countries with nuclear installations. Right now, Cuba  has such an installation under construction and it is fostering  an extensive program for sustained progress in the nuclear field  on the basis of the promotion of general progress in the nuclear  field in area countries.    Under the administration of the Executive Secretariat for  Nuclear Affairs [SEAN], Cuba's nuclear program and the  implementation of this technology for peaceful purposes, include  quite a few achievements in various economic and industrial  fields.    Cuba makes these achievements available to other countries  of the continent through ARCAL [Regional Cooperation  Arrangements for the Development of Nuclear Science and  Technology], a program sponsored by the Atomic Energy  Organization, to contribute to the peaceful utilization of  nuclear energy in the region. Cuba has participated in 12  projects since it joined ARCAL in 1987.    Let us listen to Daniel Codorniu, deputy coordinator of  Cuba's SEAN:    [Begin Codorniu recording] To give you an example of the  projects being developed, I will tell you that there is one that  has to do with the utilization of nuclear technology for animal  feeding and reproduction. This has to do with everything  related to immunoanalyses for the development of livestock.  This project is now in its fourth year. Last year, Cuba, in the  framework of this project, conducted seminars on the diagnosis  of brucellosis using nuclear and related technology. Four Latin  Americans, not counting Cubans, participated in this seminar.    Another project being developed is one on the development of  nuclear techniques to study environmental contamination.  Lately, this project has also received a lot of support in view  of recent global awareness of the need for protection of the  environment. From the analytical and chemical points of view,  nuclear methods are very precise and very effective.    Last year, within the framework of this project, we held a  seminar in Cuba on the subject of the utilization of nuclear  techniques on the environment. Three Latin American scholars  participated in this seminar and benefitted from it. [end  recording]    One of the most important projects of the ARCAL program in  Latin America involves the industrial utilization of radioactive  isotopes as tracers to further improve the quality of industrial  processes.    As in previous cases, Cuban experts and technicians are  obtaining precious experience in the implementation of these  techniques and plan to pass it on to other regional countries  through meetings, scholarship, and specialization courses in the  future.    [Begin Codorniu recording] This year, 1994, we plan three  important regional projects within the framework of ARCAL. One  project involves a regional seminar on nuclear progress and  instrumentation.    One objective of this seminar is to share with other Latin  American countries experiences -- especially Cuban experiences,  although those of other regional countries will also be  presented -- regarding progress in developing equipment for  nuclear programs.    That seminar will be followed, right here, by a final  meeting  on nuclear instrumentation. This is a five-year project that  has concluded. The coordinators of this project will come from  all countries involved in it. The participating countries will  take advantage of the seminar to analyze the results of the  project. One of the most positive aspects of this project, in  our opinion, is that it has enabled the acquisition of spare  parts by Latin American countries.    We are going to have another regional seminar from 28  November to 11 December. This seminar will be an advanced  course on the synthesis of modern radiopharmaceutical products.  As you know, one of the main objectives of our current program  -- and this is also an objective of other Latin American  countries, each focussing on its own development and national  policies -- is to produce in our country the radioactive  substances necessary for the program. Radiopharmaceuticals, as  you all know, are the substances used by doctors who practice  what we call nuclear medicine to make medical diganosis.    By 1995, the work of the Cuban nuclear program will be  directed toward research to complement research already being  done in agriculture. One aspect of this research, which has a  broad participation from all the research centers in the  country, has to do with the combined used of nuclear and  hydrotechnology for improved agricultural production of items  important to Cuba, such as rice, sugarcane, and beans.    We firmly back this program. We are calling for very active  participation by our center in this program, which is being  planned on the basis of coordinated research, that is, on the  basis of the idea that various research centers in various  countries of the region tackle one single problem from various  angles. For example, the problem of how to produce more and  better rice, suitable for the various regions of Latin America.  Various research centers of the region would then have specific  tasks in that program and their information would be shared, so  that regional resources may be utilized in a more rational way,  realizing, for example, that my laboratory may have some  techniques that Mexico does not have and Mexico may have things  that I do not have. This way we could complement each other.    Another very interesting program we believe Cuba could  participate in is the improvement of vegetables and the handling  of soil and water resources using nuclear techniques.    This program is very much linked to agriculture. It is like  guaranteeing the best and most inexpensive -- speaking from the  point of view of the cost of fertilizers, irrigation, and so  forth -- growing of certain crops. Our country also has  experience in the use of radioactive istopes, such as stable  isotopes like nitrogen 15, to determine the amount necessary and  the adequate moment for using a fertilizer or to determine,  using nuclear techniques, when an irrigation effort has not been  effective.    This program has an objective. It has been designed in a way  similar to that of Peru's, that is, through coordinated research  among countries. This particular program relies, basically, on  four countries. This does not mean that they will be the only  ones that participate because other countries will participate  also, but basically, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, will be  the four countries on which the program will rely. [end  recording]    Cuba's efforts through ARCAL in favor of Latin America and  the rest of the developing countries to secure the latest  information on nuclear science and technology enhance the  prestige of the island. Cuba's nuclear achievements have been  praised by well-known international experts.    Cuba's nuclear program continues developing in the midst of  shortages and limitations the country is enduring and it is  expanding its ratio of action to include research that may offer  new alternatives for national progress.</p>

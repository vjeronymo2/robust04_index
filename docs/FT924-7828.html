			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / S Africa to seek closer EC links SOUTH AFRICA will propose a co-operation agreement to the European Community within the next seven months, South Africa's new ambassador to the EC, Mr Neil Van Heerden, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Van Heerden said South Africa hoped there would be 'clarity' on an accord by the middle of next year. About half of South Africa's trade is with EC states, with Germany and Britain the dominant trading partners. He said the time had come to forge a formal agreement with the EC, which dropped all sanctions against South Africa, except for arms sales, following Pretoria's moves to scrap apartheid. 'Previously there were political obstacles in coming up with a special EC accord. Now we are in the post-sanctions period and many of the political disabilities are gone,' he said.</p>

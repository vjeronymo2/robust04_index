This will be brought up for discussion as a major topic at a  summit meeting among Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata; EU Commission  President Jacques Delors; and Helmut Kohl, chancellor of Germany  (the host country of the EU); when they attend the Naples Summit  (the major industrialized nations' summit talks) in July. In  response to the EU's proposal, Japan and the EU reached a basic  agreement at a working-level meeting on 1 June. At the Japan-EU  summit talks, the participants will confirm that "both sides  will hold continuous dialogue, particularly on deregulation,  which should be steadily implemented," and announce their policy  to other countries. With regard to Japan's deregulation, the EU  informed Japan this spring of its "concern" for 32 specific  items, such as distribution and telecommunications. On the  other hand, the EU has judged that "in light of the EU's  experience in deregulation in the process of promoting market  integration, Japan's deregulation requires mid- and long-term  programs," (as stated by a high-ranking EU official). This is  why it suggested strengthening channels of dialogue. The EU  also aims to prevent Japan from giving special treatment to the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, and to make Japan reaffirm  the importance of Japan-EU economic relations.    Confirmation will be made at the summit talks "to lay the  foundation for frutiful dialogue, and not merely meant to decide  the framework of regular consultations for formality's sake,"  (according to a Japanese Government source). Therefore, in line  with progress in Japan's deregulation, dialogue at various  levels will be held.</p>

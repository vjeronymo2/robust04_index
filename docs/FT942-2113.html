			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television The last in ITV's impressive series 20 Miles From Piccadilly Circus follows the final weeks in the life of 86 year old Flo Martin whose family have lived and worked in Eynsford for two centuries (7.30). Television's love affair with all things royal is now such that there is rarely a week when 'unprecedented access' is not being given to one sycophant or another in order to slide another great slab of Windsor PR on to the screen. Next week Prince Charles gets two and a half hours to himself, be warned. Today BBC1 manages a 'rare opportunity' to go inside The Other House Of Windsor: the one in Paris occupied by the former King Edward VII and Wallis Simpson (8.30). Given the way that South Korea managed to score twice and force a draw in the last few moments of their match against Spain, who knows what may happen when Spain play Germany tonight in World Cup 94 (8.30 ITV). There will almost certainly be more excitement in the final episode of Quantum Leap (9.00 BBC2). Not long after that ends you can switch to C4 for the third episode in a rather good drama series about local government: Little Napoleons (10.00).</p>

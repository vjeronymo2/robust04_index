			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICY MEETING AIMED ATTACKS AT GORBACHEV  </P> <P> When Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ousted a quarter of the members of  the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee this week, he appeared to  have won another of his stunning political victories, removing many of his  critics from the party leadership and replacing them with supporters.  </P> <P> When his strong reaffirmation of thorough-going reforms was published after the  meeting, he seemed, from the initial reading, to be putting the country on a  course of rapid and more radical change and committing the party to break out  of the present stalemate between reformers and conservatives.  </P> <P> But when the full debates of the Central Committee meeting were published  Thursday, Gorbachev appeared surprisingly beleaguered, under attack from the  right and the left within the committee, criticized both for his policies and  his style of leadership and winning only two half-hearted endorsements from  presumed supporters.  </P> <P> Such are the complexities -- and the very sharp divisions -- of current Soviet  politics.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's mastery of the deft, swift Kremlin maneuvering, all of it behind  the scenes, that is necessary to hold power here was clear at the Central  Committee meeting, and Gorbachev's political skills on this level are unrivaled  today.  </P> <P> Over the past year, he had already realigned the ruling Politburo, bringing in  supporters and easing critics to the sidelines. He had led the party through a  soul-searching conference last summer to win broader agreement on the scope of  the needed reforms. And he had brought in a new parliamentary system and last  month put the country through its first contested elections since the earliest  days of the Soviet state, receiving a strong popular mandate.  </P> <P> This is important for Gorbachev because it secures his flanks from attack,  particularly by party conservatives concerned about his flouting of political  orthodoxy. The recent changes in the Politburo and Central Committee, moreover,  help ensure that he is not ousted, as was Nikita S. Khrushchev, another  reformer, by a conservative party coup.  </P> <P> But little of Gorbachev's political strength has translated into direct,  tangible change -- the improved living standards that people expect, the  takeoff in economic development that Gorbachev's advisers had predicted, the  "modern socialism" that he himself had spoken of.  </P> <P> And the reason, long suspected but never so clear, was evident in the sustained  attacks on the reforms by the Central Committee members who spoke at the  closed-door Kremlin meeting on Tuesday.  </P> <P> There, all the doubts, the misgivings, the fears, the anger spilled out as 20  speakers took the floor to endorse the retirement of 110 members and nonvoting  members of the party Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission, a  watchdog body, and then to appraise, sometimes in almost tragic terms, the  present state of the party and country.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev dominates but does not control the Central Committee members," said  a senior Soviet journalist who has close contacts with the leadership. "This  means that he can move them around, even beat up on them, but he cannot  necessarily make them do what he wants."  </P> <P> Even the purge of most of the conservative rump of the Central Committee, the  political leftovers from the "era of stagnation" under President Leonid I.  Brezhnev and those already moved out of top positions within the party and the  government, does not guarantee immediate or enthusiastic implementation of  Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> While he can command enough support within the Central Committee for proposals  he puts before it, Soviet sources said, he has no way, short of a massive  purge, of ensuring their implementation.  </P> <P> And a major reason, perhaps the principal one, lies in the conservative  character of the Central Committee, most of whose members, now 251, are  longtime members of the party, government or military bureaucracy and identify  with its interests.  </P> <P> One speaker after another at the committee meeting criticized the scope, the  speed and the implementation of Gorbachev's reform program, known as  perestroika. The need for reform was not disputed, but the way that Gorbachev  was implementing change was sharply criticized.  </P> <P> "Today, people do not have confidence in tomorrow," Vladimir I. Melnikov, the  outspoken party leader from the Komi region in northern Russia, bluntly told  the meeting, blaming poor implementation of the reforms.  </P> <P> Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin, who lost in the parliamentary elections when he  was unable to defeat a challenge from the forewoman of a team of house  painters, said, "The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, and have lost their  optimism."  </P> <P> The country's mass media, suddenly alive with criticism, exposes and  provocative new ideas under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, after  more than 50 years of deadly direct government censorship, were repeatedly  attacked for going too far, for abusing their new freedom, for causing people  to question government policies and doubt the party's leadership.  </P> <P> The intelligentsia, whose early support was critical for Gorbachev in breaking  with past policies, was accused of propelling the country into changes that had  not been fully thought out, that so far had created many more problems than  they had solved and that suited them but not the working class.  </P> <P> Last month's parliamentary elections, a key Gorbachev reform, had been foisted  upon the country, the critics charged, as the road to democracy; yet the  results -- meaning the extensive losses by party officials, even when unopposed  -- proved that they were against the party's interests and undermined its  authority.  </P> <P> "The minuses here significantly exceed the pluses," Yuri F. Solovyev, the  Leningrad party leader and a candidate, or nonvoting, member of the Politburo,  said, perhaps reflecting as much on his defeat in the elections, although he  was unopposed, as on the political reforms in general.  </P> <P> Cooperative businesses, an important if only an initial step toward a mixed  economy advocated by Gorbachev, were characterized as legalized "speculation"  because of their readiness to charge whatever price the market will bear and to  pay whatever price was required to obtain materials, equipment and skilled  labor in competition with state enterprises.  </P> <P> New legislation, which will not only implement the reforms but which will be  the foundation of a shift toward what Gorbachev calls a "law-governed country,"  was harshly criticized as unworkable half-measures. A strong preference was  evident for continuation of the old system in which the government was based  largely on party decisions, elaborated by occasional decrees of the leadership  and administrative regulations promulgated by the bureaucracy.  </P> <P> On ideological issues, many serious questions -- issues that involve the  country's basic political orientation -- had arisen for which party officials  complained they had no answers because of drift within the top leadership.  </P> <P> "Various generations of people, separate social lawyers and even regions are  quarreling among themselves," Saikin said, adding that the popular loss of  faith in the party was such that it no longer exercised its "vanguard role."  </P> <P> The Central Committee Secretariat, which Gorbachev has reduced in size and  restaffed with his own people, was denounced repeatedly for its alleged  isolated from the people, its orientation toward intellectuals rather than the  working class and its theoretical approach to problems.  </P> <P> And Gorbachev's own political conduct as the party leader was criticized as  well. He had become isolated from the people, the outspoken Melnikov said, and  the Secretariat was "protecting him from the severity of the situation that  exists down below."  </P> <P> On and on, the criticism rolled -- the speeches filled seven full pages of the  Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Thursday -- as Gorbachev and his opponents  on the Central Committee compressed into a day the sharpening struggle over the  future of the country.  </P> <P> Delivering one of his most brilliant expositions of perestroika at the end,  Gorbachev not only defended the need for reform but also challenged critics to  stop looking through "yesterday's eyes."  </P> <P> "I do not agree with the extreme judgments that the party is nearly losing its  position in the country or that it has turned into a debating society," he  said. "The party's dialogue with working people is not a weakness, nor is it  making the party a debating society. If it is weakness to conduct a dialogue  with all segments of society, then I do not know what courage is."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The types of products ingested were described as iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets, iron pills, prenatal vitamins, vitamins for anemia,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multivitamins, and children's vitamins. Children's vitamins were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the most numerous and were involved in 56 percent (45/80) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, followed by prenatal vitamins in 23 percent (18/80).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sixty percent (48/80) of the iron products were nonprescription  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items, and 25 percent (20/80) were prescription items. (The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder were not described.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average number of tablets ingested by the children was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 20 tablets, and the greatest number was 80 tablets. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child was taken to the emergency room as a precaution, but it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discovered that the child had not actually swallowed any tablets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The iron potency of the product was documented only in 13 case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports and in those, it ranged from 15 to 65 mg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the iron products (80 percent, 64/80) were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reportedly packaged in CRP, whereas 10 percent (8/80) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products were reportedly not packaged in CRP. In the remainder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the cases, the iron products were in packages with lost lids,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product had been removed from the original container, or no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> details were reported. The victims opened the CRP in 45 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (36/80) of the cases. In 16 percent (13/80) of the cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> victim was able to open the CRP because the lid was not secured tightly, whether by intent or accidentally, by an adult. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family member such as a sibling, cousin, or mother opened the CRP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 18 percent (15/80) of the incidents, allowing the victim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to the iron product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elevated iron serum levels were reported in 18 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14/80) of the reports, and normal levels were reported in 3 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cases. However, most of the cases (79 percent, 63/80) did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not report test results for serum iron. Eighty-six percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (69/80) of the cases were treated and released from the hospital,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while 14 percent (11/80) were admitted to the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Symptoms, or lack of symptoms, were reported for 34 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80 children. The symptoms included diarrhea, vomiting, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lethargy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vomiting occurred 18 times, diarrhea occurred 8 times, and 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children suffered both vomiting and diarrhea. Fever and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constipation were reported only for the 3-month old victim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cramps, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, hyperactivity, and profuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sweating were other symptoms that were documented only once each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A combination of at least two symptoms were documented for eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the pediatric iron poisoning incidents, including one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fatality, occurred after an adult removed several dosage units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from their original container and stored them in nonchild- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistant containers, as follows: (1) ``The aunt took the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prenatal vitamin pills out of their original container and placed them in a tin can that was half full of pennies.'' (Ref. 22, case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report No. 23.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``For reasons as yet unknown, she (the mother) took them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the original container believed to be equipped with a child- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistant closure, and put them in a container that was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with a child-resistant closure, possibly a vitamin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottle.'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 21.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> D. Response to the Epidemic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Petitions Submitted to FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA has received three citizen petitions requesting that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency take various actions concerning labeling, packaging, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation for iron-containing products. One of the petitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the agency undertake efforts to educate the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the danger of pediatric iron poisoning. The petitions were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by the American Association of Poison Control Centers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the AAPCC petition) (Docket No. 91P&hyph;0186/CP1) (Ref. 12); the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attorneys General of 34 States, Commonwealths, and Territories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the AG petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP1) (Ref. 13); and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (the NDMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP2) (Ref. 23). The principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues in these petitions are summarized in Table 7 and discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

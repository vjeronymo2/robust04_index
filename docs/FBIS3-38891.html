			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the French </F> Central Bank, by Lorenz Winter in Paris; date not given:  "`There Must Not Be a Brutal Break When Euro-Currency Is  Introduced'"]    [Text] Since the beginning of the year, the French Central  Bank, the Banque de France, has been independent -- that is, it  is no longer subject to directives from the Paris government.  WELT AM SONNTAG was the first German newspaper to be granted an  interview by the head of the French Central Bank, Governor  Jean-Claude Trichet.    [Winter] Mr. Trichet, the French economics minister said  that the Banque de France's new freedom of action is "at least  equal to that of the German Bundesbank." Do you regard this  evaluation as justified?    [Trichet] Well, the minister certainly did not want to say  that the Banque de France would have more powers than the  Bundesbank in the future. However, one thing is clear: The new  statutes of the French Central Bank guarantee its independence  with rigorous strength. The law neither allows the governor nor  his deputy or the members of the banks' monetary advisory  council to receive instructions from the government or anyone  else or request such instructions.    [Winter] So, can one say that the Banque de France will  speak with the same authority as the Bundeswehr?    [Trichet] Authority cannot be decreed; it has to be gained  in practice. Yet, one can now say with certainty that the  credibility of the Banque de France has made a quantum leap  thanks to its new status. Besides, I believe that observers of  the French economy and currency have noticed an constant  increase in credibility of our house for several years.    [Winter] Really? Is this credibility, particularly in  Germany, not still suffering from France's reputation of being a  country with inflationary tendencies and an instable currency --  caused by years of index-linked incomes and a -- at least  consciously tolerated -- deterioration of the exchange rate of  the franc?    [Trichet] I should be most surprised if such ideas were  still widespread in the German public after many years of  monetary stability, which asked great efforts from our country  and its citizens; in fact, I can hardly believe it.    The instruments and methods that you mentioned might have  played a role in the postwar era, whereas today they have been  absolutely eliminated from the French economy. Besides, in the  long term, monetary stability has had a great tradition in  France. Not only has France never experienced hyperinflation  comparable to Germany but between 1700 and 1914, the value of  the French currency remained unusually constant. This proves  how strongly our country was committed to a culture of monetary  stability.    [Winter] Still, before the first independent resolutions of  the Banque de France's monetary advisory council of late  January, requests were increasing again for abandoning the  policy of a "strong franc," and Banque de France was asked to  use its new freedom of action "generously" from the very  beginning.    [Trichet] True, but as you know, such views ultimately  failed to get sufficient support -- and, in my opinion, this is  what matters.    [Winter] Are some observers not simply waiting for a  possible budget crisis or a new monetary crisis to see whether  the Banque de France will not lose its balance on the slippery  path of virtue?    [Trichet] No, I do not think so, because there is one thing  that you must not forget in this connection: In France you do  not have, on the one hand, a government that is lax in terms of  monetary policy and, on the other hand, a central bank that  thinks and acts along orthodox lines. I believe that the idea  of a conceptual conflict that might erupt openly one day is  wrong.    [Winter] Is this a consequence of the disciplinarian corset  of Maastricht?    [Trichet] Maastricht certainly played an important role for  drawing up our new statutes, even though it was by no means the  only reason for releasing the Banque de France into  independence. The liberalization of our economy and the  increased international credibility of our currency came  together to encourage the French Government to present an  amendment of statutes that was adopted by a majority in the  National Assembly and the Senate.    [Winter] How would you now assess the position and the tasks  of your house in the concert of European central banks?    [Trichet] Please, let me say just one thing in this  connection, and that is that in the circle of European central  banks, there are institutes today that have their independence  guaranteed by law as we do, while others do not. Yet, the  latter are also trying just like the Banque the France to boost  their credibility and authority and -- if you will -- their  prestige toward the inside and outside.    [Winter] What about the central banks of countries seeking  European Union membership?    [Trichet] These countries will be required to respect the  Maastricht Treaty, including all rights and duties. So, if  their central banks have not -- or not yet -- been granted  independence by law, one of the duties of these countries is to  make them independent under the treaty.    [Winter] How will the Banque de France fashion its own  monetary policy under this aspect in the future? Along a German  or rather an English pattern?    [Trichet] Instead of risking a possible inappropriate  comparison, let me just point out the following: The very first  lines of our statutes commit us to preserve price stability.  The first resolution of the monetary advisory council set a  clear limit of 2 percent both for 1994 and the following four  years. Our strategy could have hardly been formulated more  explicitly.    [Winter] At the first meeting of the European Monetary  Institute in Frankfurt, its president, Alexandre Lamfalussy, was  skeptical about a single currency by the year 1997. Do you  share his pessimism?    [Trichet] Everyone has the right to make his or her own  judgment and assessment of the chances of this difficult issue.  So, what can be said objectively? For the commission, the  council of economics and finance ministers, the European  Council, and the central bank governors, Maastricht provides a  detailed list of mandatory criteria, decision procedures, and  rules of conduct.    There are two crucial years: 1997 and 1999. The first one  requires a majority of countries that must fulfill all  Maastricht criteria to permit the issue of a single currency.  Particularly if one looks at the public deficits of many EU  countries, I understand that some observers are skeptical  regarding 1997. As far as 1999 is concerned, a majority is no  longer a condition. Then even a "hard core" of countries that  fulfill the convergence regulations might introduce a single  currency among them.    [Winter] People, particularly in Germany, keep asking what  this day X should look like. Will everyone get 40 ECU in their  hands comparable to what was done at the time of the German  monetary reform in 1948?    [Trichet] When I recently gave a lecture on the future of  the European Monetary Union to the Finance Committee of the  German Bundestag, I was dazzled by similar questions asked even  by committee members. This is why I think that the following  information can be quite useful. First of all, governments and  central banks must define and settle the transition process as  precisely as possible from the very beginning so that all future  users of a single currency -- and senior citizens, in particular  -- will not get confused. Moreover, it has to be clear that by  issuing a currency of its own, Europe will not draw a line under  its past or will even try to punish a failure but, by merging  its best currencies, it is simply taking one step ahead --  toward more economic prosperity and more personal freedom of  movement within the Union, and more monetary authority toward  the outside.    [Winter] So the transition to the European currency would  take place gradually?    [Trichet] That is what I personally expect. As far as I am  concerned, there must no be a brutal break; for a certain  period, the national and EU currencies might even circulate side  by side. Particularly also regarding German fears about he  future of the mark this would have the advantage that one could  demonstrate to everybody that the new currency is not "worse"  than the old one, but at least as good. Otherwise, the  experiment of issuing a European currency would not make any  sense at all.    [Winter] What would be a conceivable name for the "new"  currency?    [Trichet] All parties still have to think about this  important issue together. Regarding the name of the future  single currency, one should proceed as pragmatically as possible  and, if possible, ask the users for their opinion, and, respect  it -- whenever technically possible.    Personally, I am saying this also with a view to the worries  of the German population regarding the future of the mark, of  which I know, and which, incidentally, are shared by others.  After all, people in other countries are also emotionally  attached to their individual national currencies.    This is why I did not rule out the simultaneous circulation  of national and EU currencies during a transition period before.  The Maastricht Treaty provides for such a period. Its authors  also wanted to make sure that the old and the new currencies  were equally good. Germany and France, together, should now  make sure that this will is respected.</p>

The Administrator will issue the exporter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances equivalent to the level of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances that the Administrator determined were exported. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant of the consumption allowances will be effective on the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notice is issued. If the Administrator determines that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirming documentation does not satisfactorily substantiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the person exported controlled substances as claimed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator will issue a notice that the consumption allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A person may obtain consumption allowances for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance equal to the amount of a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance either produced in, or imported into, the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was transformed or destroyed in the case where consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances were expended to produce or import such substance in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1996, consumption allowances will not be granted for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I controlled substance (except class I, Group VI) produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in, or imported into, the United States that was transformed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed. However, a person producing or importing a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance (except class I, Group VI) that was transformed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed must submit to the Administrator the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described under &sect;82.13 (f)(3) (i) and (ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A company may also increase its consumption allowances by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving production from another Party to the Protocol for class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I, Group I through Group V and Group VII controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until January 1, 1996, and for class I, Group VI controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances until January 1, 2001. A nation listed in Appendix C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this subpart (Parties to the Montreal Protocol) must agree to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer to the person for the current control period some amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of production that the nation is permitted under the Montreal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol. For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the United States a signed document stating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate authority within that nation has established or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised production limits for the nation to equal the lesser of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum production that the nation is allowed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol minus the amount transferred, the maximum production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national production level for the three years prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer minus the production allowances transferred. The person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must submit to the Administrator a transfer request that includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a true copy of this document and that sets forth the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The identity and address of the person;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The identity of the Party;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the person and for the Party;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The chemical type and level of production being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) On the first day of each control period the Agency will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant consumption allowances to any person that produced and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported a Group IV controlled substance in the baseline year and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was not granted baseline consumption allowances under &sect;82.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The number of consumption allowances any such person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be granted for each control period will be equal to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of production allowances granted to that person under &sect;82.7 for that control period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any person granted allowances under this paragraph must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold the same number of unexpended consumption allowances for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period for which the allowances were granted by February  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 of the following control period. Every kilogram by which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person's unexpended consumption allowances fall short of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount the person was granted under this paragraph constitutes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan  [NASDA] announced on 17 January that Japan's first domestically  produced large rocket will be launched at 0700 on 1 February at  the Tanegashima Space Center, located in Tanega-cho.    The launch window had been from 0500 to 0900 on 1 February,  but was officially set after NASDA observed that the fueling  rehearsal held on 14 January was successful. Thus, the window  was narrowed by two hours, from 0700 to 0900.    The reason given by the Tanegashima Space Center for  narrowing the launch window and moving it back two hours from  the initial schedule was that "we set it after taking into  consideration the ease of the rehearsal operations."    A fueling rehearsal in preparation for the launch was held  on 23 December 1993, but problems were discovered at eight  points, including leaks in the helium [as published] pressure  valves on the LE-7 main engine that resulted in insufficient  pressure. So parts were replaced and another rehearsal was held  on 14 January. There was some trouble with the movable nozzles  on the solid rocket boosters during the second rehearsal, but  this was not a major problem.</p>

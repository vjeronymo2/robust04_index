			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: River crossing in Bangladesh The USDollars 500m (Pounds 267m) Jamuna Bridge project in Bangladesh has been given the go-ahead by the World Bank after a further internal review of the economic return of the project. Tender documents are expected to relate to a bridge designed for road, but with the potential to be adapted to road plus rail at a future date and at minimum extra cost. This evaluation was in broad agreement with the conclusion reached earlier by the bank's consulting engineers, RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON together with Dutch consultants NEDECO and BANGLADESH CONSULTANTS. The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the Jamuna river in Bangladesh. The river forms a 15km barrier, separating the western side, with its fertile north-west zone, from the eastern side containing the commercial centre, Dhaka and the country's primary port, Chittagong. The only fixed crossing of the river to date in Bangladesh is the power line interconnector supported on caissons 110 metres deep, believed to be the deepest in existence and for which RPT were the engineers. The crossing will comprise a bridge structure about 5km long, major river training works and road embankments on the flood plain between the river training works and the high banks. Mobility of the river banks is such that the final location of the 2,700 metre long guide bunds, and hence the length of the bridge can only be determined at the time of construction. Cost estimates, design and the proposed contract documents have been set down to accommodate this somewhat unusual situation. The bridge is 4,800 metres long, bounded by the guide bunds of the river training works. The substructure will be 80 metres long, 2.5 metres in diameter raking steel piles in bents of two or four. These will support a composite steel box girder and concrete slab superstructure in spans of 100 metres. An alternative design including a segmental pre-stressed concrete box girder of similar span will be included in the tender documents.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Further charges against executive MR TONY COLE, former chairman of Bestwood, the industrial and property holding company, has been sent for trial at the Old Bailey on 20 charges including the alleged theft of Pounds 1.2m. Fresh charges were made against Mr Cole when he made his second appearance at City of London magistrates' court yesterday. He was arrested a month ago and charged with 13 offences of false accounting, perjury and theft. He now faces six charges alleging theft from Atlanta Fund Managers, the pension fund of British Drilling and Freezing, and Bestwood Securities, six alleging offences under the 1985 Companies Act, three of false accounting, two of perjury, and one each of conspiracy, theft of share certificates and procuring the execution of a valuable security. Yesterday the magistrates transferred the case to the Old Bailey where four other people, charged last year as a result of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into Bestwood, are awaiting trial. They are Mr Charles Wilkinson, a senior partner in London solicitors Lawrence Graham, and Mr Jeremy Colson, a financial director, both charged with Companies Act offences, Mr Peter Southgate, an accountant, charged with theft, aiding and abetting an unauthorised loan and false accounting, and Mr William Collins, a stockbroker, charged with theft and false accounting.</p>

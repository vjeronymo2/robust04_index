			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Britain to return Pounds 90m of gold to Baltic states BRITAIN is to return to the newly independent Baltic states gold they had on deposit with the Bank of England in 1940 at the time of the Soviet takeover. The gold was sold on the open market by the UK government in 1967 for Pounds 5.8m. Today it is worth about Pounds 90m. Mr John Major said yesterday after meeting Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian president, that the Baltic states could have either the gold or the cash equivalent. Mr Landsbergis said Lithuania would prefer gold and for the gold to be kept in the Bank of England. A Bank of England official said that, under the terms of yesterday's settlement, Lithuania was entitled to Pounds 19m or 94,748 troy ounces of gold; Estonia to Pounds 31m or 154,754 ounces and Latvia to Pounds 42m or 210,719 ounces. Mr Douglas Hogg, Foreign Office minister, said the settlement 'closes a shameful chapter in Britain's history'. He recalled that the gold had been sold by Mr Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1967 and this was 'a betrayal of the people of the Baltic states' as well as 'an act of appeasement towards Moscow'. Most of the proceeds from the 1967 sale was paid to British citizens to settle claims for assets lost in areas which became part of the Soviet Union. Britain also gave the Soviet government Pounds 500,000 from the proceeds. The total, roughly 14 tonnes, represents about 2.5 per cent of the UK's official gold reserves. Other bankers suggested the UK government might use gold from the estimated 620 tonnes in its reserves or might simply buy it in the London bullion market. It is widely expected the other Baltic states will opt for gold to be kept in the Bank of England to provide credibility when they launch their own currencies. The precious metal could be used as collateral for loans or for swaps - where gold is sold for cash but the seller also contracts to buy the metal back at a future date. The amount of gold is relatively small in bullion market terms and gold's price was unaffected by the announcement. Gold closed in London last night at Dollars 357.30 an ounce, down 70 cents.</p>

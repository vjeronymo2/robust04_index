			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDING GERRYMANDERING BY POLITICIANS: PROS AND CONS OF PROPOSITIONS 118-119  </P> <P> Shame on Jack Lemmon! As the world turns toward democracy and perestroika, as  it expresses its yearning for every individual citizen's rightful voice in the  affairs of state, he has bought into the big-lie technique in his appearance in  television commercials as a spokesman against Propositions 118 and 119,  propositions which aim at guaranteeing us a fairer apportionment in our federal  and state legislative districts. Does he think that the people of California  are so naive and gullible that they would give credence to his cynical,  simple-minded blathering that the movement to reform the current apportionment  system is but a corporate conspiracy?  </P> <P> There is something sinister in this attack. No informed person of good  intentions could possibly argue that the current apportionment situation in  California is fair, and would support efforts to make a change in the process  the next time around. Either of these propositions would be a strong corrective  to the present de facto under-enfranchisement under which we are suffering.  </P> <P> As from Mr. Lemmon, while I have disagreed with his politics in the past, I  have always given him credit for being a person of integrity and conviction.  With this infamous performance, I regret I can no longer feel that way.  </P> <P> DEXTER THOMPSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

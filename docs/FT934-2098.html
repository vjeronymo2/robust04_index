			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Shareholders at Volvo to elect new board Volvo shareholders, whose revolt triggered the collapse of the Swedish group's plan to merge with France's Renault, will meet on January 19 to elect a new board, it was announced yesterday. The meeting will be the first step in reshaping Volvo after Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former chairman, and four fellow board members resigned earlier this month after bowing to shareholder and senior management pressure to call off the controversial agreement with Renault. Swedish institutional shareholders have signalled their intention to take a more active role in the way Volvo is run.</p>

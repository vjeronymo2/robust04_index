			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi by Sana' </F> al-Sa'id; place and date not given]    [Text] [Al-Sa'id] Can the idea of holding a national  dialogue in April have any credibility without the participation  of all the country's political forces?    [Sidqi] All the legitimate forces will take part in this  dialogue, regardless of their inclination. Naturally,  illegitimate forces are excluded from this dialogue and will not  participate in it. The dialogue, which will open in April, will  be on political, economic, and social issues. Therefore, as  President Husni Mubarak said, all the national forces and  legitimate parties will participate in it. The basic aim of the  dialogue is to arrive at an agreement that will enable us to see  the issue of security and stability in the right perspective.  Stability is the foundation that will allow Egyptian society to  advance in all fields. The national dialogue also aims to draw  a scientific and comprehensive vision of Egypt's future in the  coming century.    [Al-Sa'id] Does this classification of forces as legitimate  and illegitimate mean that the Muslim Brotherhood will not take  part in the national dialogue?    [Sidqi] As I just said, only the legitimate forces will take  part. The Muslim Brotherhood is an illegitimate and illegal  force. Besides, the Egyptian Constitution does not allow the  formation of religious parties.    [Al-Sa'id] Some people have voiced the fear that the  national  dialogue would turn into an aimless ramble [maklamah]. These  people say that change is, in essence, a matter for deeds, not  words.    [Sidqi] They are wrong. Dialogue is the main course for  finding the truth and improving reality. This is our aim; to  better ourselves in everything: politics, economy, and social  relations. We seek solutions to problems that we all recognize:  education, health, and development, among others. Therefore,  it is very useful to have a dialogue on these issues. It is  possible for us to reach an agreement on a number of principles  that will shed light on how to resolve these problems.    [Al-Sa'id] Some people are afraid that the dialogue will  turn  into a solo performance by the National Democratic Party [NDP]  and its sympathizers.    [Sidqi] The dialogue will not turn into an NDP monologue.  Representatives from all the national and party forces will be  present. How can it turn into a solo performance? There is no  doubt that the dialogue will be an opportunity to exchange  opinions, formulate a comprehensive vision of our national  priorities, and draw police guidelines. Egypt, as President  Mubarak said, does not aim to blur the distinction between  opinions but to uphold the principles and prerequisites of  democracy.    [Al-Sa'id] Is terrorism one of the proposed subjects in the  dialogue?    [Sidqi] Of course. It is a major issue. The call for  dialogue is also an attempt to rally efforts to formulate a  national action plan to support stability and development, and  to strike at terrorism to uproot it completely. But, at the  same time, we should not exaggerate the extent of terrorism.  Such an exaggeration is not needed. It is true that there is  terrorism; this is an undisputed fact. But I say that the  terrorism movement in Egypt has never been and will never be  similar to the movements in other countries. The criteria here  makes the difference between the two. Terrorism here is within  narrow limits when compared to other countries. The terrorists  certainly have their instigators and backers abroad. We know of  the remnants who have left Egypt and have gone to other  countries.    [Al-Sa'id] The remnants that went to Afghanistan?    [Sidqi] They went to more than one country where they  settled  down, trained, and carried out their activities by communicating  with their cadres in Egypt. The latter received their  instructions from them to carry out their criminal acts against  the state and its citizens.    [Al-Sa'id] Why do you not mention specifically the countries  that support terrorism?    [Sidqi] We have exposed them and there is no need to mention  them again. They are known forces that do not want stability  and progress for Egypt but want our country to remain burdened  by poverty. They are tools of destruction and sabotage.    [Al-Sa'id] Are they Sudan and Iran?    [Sidqi] I do not want to accuse a specific country and I do  not want to assert anything. But there are very strong  possibilities that there are people residing in some surrounding  countries or in countries near us.    [Al-Sa'id] There are opposition voices which say that  political reform is the basis for eliminating terrorism and is  the main door to dialogue.    [Sidqi] What do they mean by political reform?    [Al-Sa'id] One aspect of political reform is the guarantee  of  honest elections.    [Sidqi] Elections are always honest in Egypt. The current  laws ensure the honesty of elections and no one here can dispute  our elections.    [Al-Sa'id] Some of these voices are also demanding the  amendment of the Constitution and believe that this Constitution  is not being applied and is merely ink on paper. From this  comes the call to amend it so that it can conform to current  conditions in Egypt.    [Sidqi] Who has made the Constitution merely ink on paper?  We are living in a state that respects law and this means that  the Constitution is respected and the law is respected. There  is no distortion or bypassing of the law. I do not understand  what they mean when they talk about the Constitution in the  manner suggested by your question. As to the amendment of the  Constitution, I say that the current one is completely suitable  for Egypt's current conditions.    Tampering with the Constitution is not an easy matter. The  above-mentioned Constitution was drawn up in 1971 and therefore  it has been in existence for only 22 years. This is not long  enough for judging and amending the Constitution. It is not  reasonable for us to change the Constitution each period,  otherwise the whole process will turn into chaos.    [Al-Sa'id] Terrorist operations have not been eliminated  or contained yet, despite the enforcement of the emergency law.  On the contrary, they have become a serious phenomenon  threatening society.    [Sidqi] We cannot consider terrorist incidents a phenomenon.  Egypt is more stable and secure than other states. If some  wicked terrorist elements appear every now and then, they are a  misled group unaware of Egypt's interests. They are elements  who have rebelled against the situation, law, and legitimacy.  They are trying to impose their deviant opinion and thought on  others by force and with violence. This runs counter to the  simplest rules of freedom and democracy, which are the pillars  of the regime in Egypt. They are a group that must be confronted  firmly and decisively. We cannot describe its actions as a  phenomenon because the overwhelming majority of the Egyptian  people reject its unsound and illogical practices. The Egyptian  people are among the most moderate people and adhere to their  sound Islamic and Christian religious ideals.    [Al-Sa'id] However, more than one incident has shown that  terrorism still exists, including the unsuccessful assassination  attempt against you.    [Sidqi] The emergence of extremist groups that practice  violence and terrorism is not confined to Egypt. There are  terrorist groups in our region, Europe, and elsewhere. These  groups lack sound logic, correct thought, and wisdom.  Therefore, their attempts to impose their custodianship and  ideas by terrorism and violence are confronted by the people and  government. These groups must not be allowed to pose a threat  to Egypt's security. We are all confident that terrorism has  no future on our land. It will remain besieged and will be  eradicated, God willing, because its elements are a small  fugitive group that is motivated by a desire to destroy. God  willing, they will disappear thanks to national consensus.    [Al-Sa'id] It is being said that confronting terrorism can  be done without resorting to security measures, such as  eliminating the shantytowns.    [Sidqi] We are using all security and legal methods, as well  as development projects, to put an end to terrorism. We are  implementing a comprehensive program to remove shantytowns in 11  governorates. We have adopted serious steps and have allocated  3.03 billion pounds to remove these shantytowns.    [Al-Sa'id] Some believe ideological dialogue can be held  with these misled groups.    [Sidqi] There is a difference between extremist thinking and  terrorism. Dialogue can be held with the first. However,  dialogue with terrorism is useless. There can be no dialogue  with terrorism because you cannot speak to someone who is aiming  a gun at you. There can be no dialogue between two sides, one of  which uses words while the other uses firearms. Is this  possible? Of course not.    [Al-Sa'id] Speaking of corruption, some people accuse the  government of ignoring the issue, especially when it affects  some big names.    [Sidqi] We do not ignore any corruption case; we promptly  refer it to prosecution. I stress here that we will not be  lenient toward corruption; we will expose and pursue every  corruption case no matter who is involved. President Mubarak's  instructions are clear in this regard. Deviation from the right  course may occur anywhere in the world, including Egypt. We and  no one else can prevent it. This is why we have laws that combat  deviation and treat people equally without discrimination  between the big and the small.    [Al-Sa'id] The fact that the state's control authorities,  such as the Administrative Control Organization, are affiliated  with the Council of Ministers may raise concerns that the  government colludes with those authorities to crush its  adversaries and protect its friends.    [Sidqi] Had this been true, we would not have brought many  big and resounding names to trial. All are equal before the law.    [Al-Sa'id] Like whom?    [Sidqi] There is no need to mention names!    [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that corruption files are not  opened selectively? Some say that while light is shed on some  cases to discredit certain people, other cases remain on the  shelf.    [Sidqi] I would like to say first that there are not that  many corruption cases. We are against all kind of corruption,  major, or minor. Everybody must be sure that the state is  against any deviation from the right path. All the cases that  came to light were discovered by the state services, such as the  Administrative Control Organization, the intelligence services,  state security, the public funds authority, and the central  agency. Officials of the state's administrative service inform  the government of any corruption case. All these agencies play  their roles in full. I would like to draw your attention to a  very important point here: People should not be considered  guilty for mere suspicion. People have their entities and  personalities. It is noted that some newspapers publish  allegations to discredit public figures without any evidence  against them. This, I believe, is encroachment on people's  reputations. This is more like intellectual terrorism and a  call to harm others wrongfully. If the government did all it  can, referred corruption cases to courts irrespective of who is  involved, and never interfered to affect the normal course of  those cases, then we all must wait for the results of  investigations so that innocent people are not condemned and  defamed. It is a sin to wrong innocent people and condemn them  on the basis of tendentious rumors. We are alert, and we do not  remain silent over any corruption or deviation. We watch,  follow, and pursue any corruption case regardless of who stands  behind it. When suspicion about the Madinat al-Nasr millionaire  grew and a citizen filed a complaint, we did not hesitate; we  took prompt action.    [Al-Sa'id] There are many people demanding that the  emergency law be lifted.    [Sidqi] The emergency law is for the public good, especially  because Egyptian society faces the danger of terrorism, which  must be confronted and uprooted. The emergency law is only  applied to terrorists and drug dealers; it is the least that can  be done to protect Egypt. Dangers to society posed by these  terrorists require deterrence and decisiveness. The emergency  law does not affect anyone's freedom or creed, nor does it  affect the parties. The law is used against outlaws and,  therefore, there is no fear from the emergency law because it  cannot harm any innocent citizen.    [Al-Sa'id] But someone may ask why the emergency law exists.  Although it has been in force since 1981, it has not contained  or eradicated terrorism.    [Sidqi] Why should the emergency law bother anyone if it is  applied only to terrorism and drugs, each of which is a damned  disease that must be resisted with all possible means? The  emergency law has not been used against any other party and has  not undermined democracy. Had it not been for the democratic  climate we are experiencing, the opposition voices would not  dare to say one tenth of what they say now. As to the question  of why the need for it, I say that we are in dire need of it to  protect Egypt's stability and the lives of its citizens, and to  secure its economy.    Once again, I ask why the alarm about the emergency law,  which has not been used against any honest citizen, parties, or  press, or to undermine democracy? There are no excesses in the  application of the emergency law.    [Al-Sa'id] The opposition parties are part of the state's  political system under the Constitution's Article 5, which  considers the multiparty system to be the basis for the  political regime in Egypt.    [Sidqi] Naturally, pluralism is the basis of the political  system in Egypt and no one says otherwise.    [Al-Sa'id] But the parties do not sense this fact and feel  that they are excluded from politics. They do not feel they are  part of the political system and feel that the government is  uneasy with the opposition, although it does not show it.    [Sidqi] How can they feel that they are not part of the  political system with all the state's and ruling party's  assurances that the opposition should indeed be part of the  political system?    As a general rule, a genuine opposition is heeded, but still  we find some opposition elements trying to portray everything in  Egypt as very black. This is unreasonable and unacceptable  because everything has two faces--beautiful and ugly, good and  bad.    You saw some opposition papers recently reporting everything  as bleak, which is untrue. Therefore, I say that the opposition  parties are not separated from the political arena and they  enjoy democracy in Egypt, which we see everywhere. We can see at  the People's Assembly that the opposition enjoys the full right  to speech and dialogue. The same applies to the Consultative  Council, where the opposition takes more than its share of  rights, and we do not go by the proportion criteria in allotting  the majority and minority. The opposition parties receive every  regard and respect, but the opposition should stick to objective  opposition. It is not sensible for anyone to level accusations  without evidence that the person is corrupt or bad. This is  unlawful and I am very sorry about this situation. However, we  deal with the opposition differently and I personally have  numerous friends in the opposition parties, in al-Wafd, Labor,  and other parties.    My criticism of the opposition is that it tarnishes people's  images haphazardly; it tarnishes the image of everyone and the  system, which is unacceptable.    [Al-Sa'id] People complain about high prices. They are  afraid these prices will increase in the next few months.    [Sidqi] There will be no price increases for any commodity,  including gasoline, in the coming period. Prices have increased  recently but they will not increase in the future. I want to  say that we do not interfere in raising prices. Part of the  reason for the price increases was a correctional measure and  the other part was higher production costs, especially of  imported goods. We are a part of the world market. Matters  related to prices in world markets affect us eventually.    [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by saying that part of the  reason for the higher prices was a correctional measure?    [Sidqi] The prices that prevailed in the past did not  reflect the real cost or the real value of the commodities. Our  major problem is that for a long time we have been behaving like  an ostrich, which buries its head in the sand. While prices  were rising in the whole world, Egypt was putting a "brake" on  prices through subsidies. Therefore, a collapse was going to  happen if prices remained as they were. In other words,  commodities were subsidized and sold at less than their real  cost. It was necessary to reconsider this policy of subsidies,  the continuation of which would have emptied the state's coffers.    [Al-Sa'id] Some call for rationalizing public expenditures  to curb government spending.    [Sidqi] There is no government overspending. Spending is  being done within the narrowest limits. Government expenditures  have been squeezed to the minimum.    [Al-Sa'id] What is your explanation of the discrepancy in  the views of Egyptian officials regarding GATT? The ministers  of economy, planning, and foreign affairs have different views  on GATT. I ask: Why this discrepancy in views, given that the  government has participated in the GATT negotiations over the  past eight years?    [Sidqi] Yes, Egypt has participated in the GATT  negotiations for eight years. I see no differences on GATT.    [Al-Sa'id] The foreign minister's statements look as if we  have been surprised by GATT, as if it has been a shock to us,  and as if it will negatively affect us as a developing country.    [Sidqi] I do not believe this has happened. It is true that  some statements have given this impression. What I say is that  GATT has good privileges for the developing countries. At the  same time it has some negative effects. Every official looks at  the subject from a different angle. This in itself is a healthy  phenomenon and not a discrepancy. It is not correct to say GATT  is all good or all bad.    [Al-Sa'id] But is it more negative or positive?    [Sidqi] GATT will definitely affect us in the short run, but  not in the medium or long run because the state opted to be part  of the world economy. Therefore, we must respect and observe  international systems. Anyway, GATT will not remain GATT; as of  1 January 1995, it will be named the World Trade Organization  (WTO). The GATT that will be signed in the next few weeks will  liberate foreign trade throughout the world. This means GATT  will cover not only commodity trade, but also trade in services,  copyrights, and patent rights. The last two are new to Egypt,  and perhaps they are more worrying than commodity trade.    The new system will therefore have a much wider scope than  that of GATT, which covers only commodity exchange. I am not  worried, although I have to take several precautions in the  short run. Why am I not worried? Because our policy of  liberating the national economy largely conforms with the new  trends in the organization of international trade.    [Al-Sa'id] How long can our products stand fast in the face  of foreign competition?    [Sidqi] GATT will give our products new opportunities. Talk  about positive or negative impacts is linked to our ability to  compete and improve our production. As a developing country,  therefore, we must work to increase our ability to compete. We  are able to have good and competitive products.    [Al-Sa'id] When the unified tax bill was discussed in the  People's Assembly, you were criticized for threatening to resign  if the bill was not approved.    [Sidqi] I did not threaten to resign. I only said that if  the bill was not passed, we would withdraw it.    [Al-Sa'id] Does this not mean the confiscation of democracy?  The bill should have been given enough time for discussion.    [Sidqi] The unified tax bill took more time for discussion  than any other bill. Indeed, the bill itself is not new. The  bill was issued in 1978 upon the People's Assembly's  recommendation; it was then called the tax justice law. In 1980,  I chaired a committee to work out the bill on the basis of a  unified tax. Several years later, I presented the bill to the  finance minister, and it was similar to the current unified tax  bill. In 1986, we also discussed the possibility of its  implementation.    [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that you are committed to the  bill?    [Sidqi] The bill is one of the fairer and best laws, but  regrettably some people regarded it from the beginning as  additional taxation, which is not true. We intended the bill to  include and incorporate all taxes and general revenue in one  tax, and the law is fair and takes low incomes into  consideration.    [Al-Sa'id] But the bill's exemption limit is not  satisfactory.    [Sidqi] This is just a social expression and there are many  other countries that do not offer exemption on family burdens.    [Al-Sa'id] But what about the talk that it was the United  States that drafted the bill and that it was imposed on you by  international financial institutions?    [Sidqi] This is baseless because the law is 100 percent  Egyptian. We embarked on it a long time ago and it has nothing  to do with the United States.    [Al-Sa'id] What about the Middle East market, for the idea  and feasibility of which you formed a committee of many  ministers? What are your conclusions?    [Sidqi] We are examining not the Middle East market but the  current circumstances that resulted from recent political  developments in the region. These are the Palestinians and the  Gaza-Jericho accord, Jordan and the understanding about a  declaration of principles, and Syria, which is on its way to  reaching an understanding. All this will have gigantic effects  on the region in all aspects, particularly in the economic  sphere.    Therefore, the committee was set up to follow these  developments and measure their effects on all aspects,  especially on the economic side.    [Al-Sa'id] What is your own view on the Middle East market  and on the possibility of including Arab countries in it?    [Sidqi] Like it or not, we are bound to adjust to new  circumstances and we cannot distance ourselves from them because  they are a reality. Failure to deal with reality is a grave  mistake. We must adapt to reality and adjust our economy and  ties to be in line with this fact. Today we cannot exclude  certain facts; Israel exists and we must normalize ties with it  as much as possible. Large world economic groups exist--NAFTA,  Southeast Asia, and the European Union. We also must go in the  same direction.    [Al-Sa'id] Concerning foreign policy, what are the main  lines  of Egypt's foreign policy?    [Sidqi] Two main lines are peace and development and they  are  integrated.    [Al-Sa'id] What about our relations with other countries?    [Sidqi] Our relations are excellent with all world  countries,  except a country or two, and this is no problem.    [Al-Sa'id] What is your assessment of the U.S. role in the  region?    [Sidqi] We cannot deny that the United States has become the  sole superpower in the world following the collapse of the  Soviet Union. Therefore, it would be illogical on my part to  deal with the region and the world without realizing or taking  this new situation into account. The United States is now the  sole superpower. It has influence all over the world. It is  playing a role in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and  Africa. I must have full and good relations with it. Thank  God, our relations with the United States are very good.    [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States put pressure on you to  adopt certain policies toward regional problems?    [Sidqi] No one puts pressure on us. Our decisions emanate  from our willpower and not the willpower of others. We depend  on ourselves in making decisions that do not antagonize the  world. The pivots of our policy are peace and development. I  believe peace was rejuvenated in the region only when the United  States showed interest in it. It is true that the superpowers  were represented in the past by the Soviet Union and the United  States. The situation has changed after the collapse of the  Soviet Union, which drowned in its own problems. The only  superpower in the world now is the United States.    [Al-Sa'id] Some say that the Gaza-Jericho agreement is in  the intensive care unit.    [Sidqi] We view the agreement as a step toward a  comprehensive, permanent, and just peace in the Middle East. It  is a step on the road to peace. We hope that the gap between  the Palestinians and Israel will be bridged in a way that will  lead to the honest and accurate implementation of the  Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September.    [Al-Sa'id] But Israel does not want to implement the  agreement honestly and accurately.    [Sidqi] The negotiator always keeps some "cards" to himself.  However, if Israel wants to live in the region, it must  normalize relations with its neighbors in general and the  Palestinians in particular. It is in the interest of all  parties for peace to prevail in the Middle East.    [Al-Sa'id] Israel deliberately speaks about unilateral deals  with one party without the other and looks forward to measures  that primarily safeguard its security without caring about the  security of the Arab parties.    [Sidqi] Let it be known that the basis of any peace is the  return of the Arab territories Israel occupied in 1967 to their  owners. This has been acknowledged by the international  community in an almost unanimous manner. I believe UN Security  Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the starting and reference  points. Since the peace conference began in Madrid in October  1991--and even the efforts that preceded it--these two  resolutions have been the cornerstone of any just and  comprehensive settlement in the region. Resolution 242 is clear  regarding the need for the exchange of land for peace and the  inadmissibility of the seizure of the land of others by force.  President Clinton affirmed this during the Geneva summit with  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Clinton affirmed his  determination to establish a comprehensive and just peace in the  region.    [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate the al-Asad-Clinton summit  in Geneva on 16 January?    [Sidqi] It was undoubtedly a tremendous step that gave  impetus to the peace process. It also helped clarify positions.  The statements to journalists by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad  showed clearly that the summit produced positive results. But  these could not appear overnight. We will see these results  gradually in light of the current Arab-Israeli talks in  Washington. The results of the Geneva summit will affect all  negotiating tracks. The results of the meetings between Yasir  'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin must also affect the Arab-Israeli  talks.    [Al-Sa'id] How emphatically can we say that this year can  bring peace to the Middle East and to the domestic front?    [Sidqi] Domestic peace, praise be to God, is at hand. The  incidents that take place in the country are only individual  ones. I stress this although I myself could have been one of the  victims, but I am not really worried because of these incidents.    I believe that before the year ends, God willing, we will  have put things on their right course. The state's arm is  strong and able to eradicate terrorism.    As regards peace in the Middle East, I say that this year,  God willing, will usher in a new era toward the achievement of a  just and comprehensive peace and the attainment of the full  rights of the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Each  party must be given its rights. Arab territory will return to  its rightful owners. Neither Israel nor any other country in the  region can live in peace and stability unless all pending issues  concerning Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians are  resolved on the basis of a land- for-peace exchange.    [Al-Sa'id] Do you not feel annoyed with the persistent  criticism of government policies in daily press caricatures?  Does this not indicate a loss of government prestige?    [Sidqi] This never annoys me. I only feel annoyed when  people are harmed as individuals. Criticizing policies is no  problem; different views do not disturb cordial relations. One  feels annoyed when comics or jokes harm people as individual  persons with independent entities, values, and beliefs. A  slanderous caricature may disturb one for an hour or two, but  not more; one has no time to be annoyed day and night.  Political criticism is acceptable any time and from any person,  whether a government or an opposition reporter. I absolutely do  not feel hurt.</p>

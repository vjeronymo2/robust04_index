			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARBARA WALTERS REGALES WOMEN OF JEWISH FUND  </P> <P> "You're not going to find out I had an abortion of a baby by Frank Sinatra,"  Barbara Walters says of two unauthorized biographies coming out later this  year, including one by Jerry Oppenheimer, co-author of an unauthorized book  about Rock Hudson in 1986. "In a strange way I'm curious," Walters said of  Oppenheimer.  </P> <P> "I'm thinking, what can he write to make it juicy?"  </P> <P> A chatty Walters regaled a luncheon gathering of 62 women who belong to the  elite Chai Committee of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Fund in Los  Angeles. The event kicked off the organization's annual fund-raising effort,  which Walters noted was impressive. Last year, members of the Chai Committee  donated a total of $2.5 million to the UJF, supporting social service agencies  in Los Angeles, Israel and throughout the world.  </P> <P> "Barbara Walters, without question in my mind, is the most prestigious Jewish  woman in the country and probably the world, and certainly the most  recognizable," said Harriet Hochman, campaign chair of the Greater Los Angeles  Women's Division, adding that the newswoman "practically moved mountains to be  with us." On Saturday, Walters departs for Czechoslovakia to interview  president Vaclav Havel.  </P> <P> Lunch took place in and around a recently built Chinese-style Beverly Hills  mansion said to be an exact reproduction of a Suchow province country estate,  save, of course, for the two tennis courts.  </P> <P> When guests, including event chairman Beverly Mitchell, Sylvia Hirschfield,  Dorothy Corwin, Diane Glazer, Dorothy Goren, Annette Shapiro, Elaine Goldsmith,  Sally Kurtzman, Marion Smooke, Edna Weiss and Dorothy Lyon, weren't marveling  over the mansion's contents they were marveling over Walters. Recounting her  meetings with world leaders, Walters divulged that the most charismatic was the  late Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat. "Even if I were speaking to another  group, I'd still say the same thing."  </P></p>

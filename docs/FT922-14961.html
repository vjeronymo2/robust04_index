			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Survey of Milton Keynes (8): Evidence of a special attachment - Open University and Polytechnic NOT many towns in Britain have gained a higher education institution in the past 23 years. Milton Keynes must be unique in landing not one but two - the Open University, and a campus of Leicester Polytechnic, opened by the Queen earlier this month, whose title has just been upgraded to De Montfort University, Milton Keynes. It also boasts a six-year-old further education college which is expanding rapidly. The Open University (OU) is ancient by comparison. Opened in 1969 as a novel experiment in distance learning, it is now one of the largest universities in the world. It has more than 125,000 registered students. Including purchasers of study packs, a total of about 210,000 people come within its ambit. Few of them ever see Milton Keynes, however. No teaching takes place on the campus, which is strictly an administrative and broadcasting headquarters. Summer schools and the face-to-face parts of courses take place in hotels and the campuses of other higher education institutions. The locals evidently feel a special attachment to the OU: about 1,200 of its students come from the Milton Keynes postal district. But according to Mr John Daniel, the university's vice-chancellor: 'Although we have those students, they are invisible, and the town does not consider us it's university.' Nonetheless, with more than 2,500 academic and back-up staff, the OU is one of Milton Keynes's largest local employers after Abbey National. Mr Daniel, who took the top job two years ago after 20 years in Canada, is enthusiastic about his base: 'The transition was easy: if you have lived in North America, Milton Keynes is just the place to return to. You can park, there's lots of greenery, and communications are excellent.' The OU's future is assured. At present, Pounds 90m of its Pounds 154m annual budget is in the form of a direct government grant. From next year, the OU will forfeit its special earmarked grant and become dependant on the new Higher Education Funding Council. But Mr Daniel is confident it won't lose anything thereby: 'Our unit costs per undergraduate are 40 per cent lower than in conventional universities, so even if the gradient is slightly against us, we should do OK in the funding contest.' Expanding overseas links is the OU's current priority. Within a few months, students will be able to register from throughout the European Community and Mr Daniel is expecting an influx. The Open Business School, started in 1982 and now generating an annual turnover of Pounds 17m, already markets itself actively in eastern Europe and Russia. It has also joined the Master of Business Administration bandwagon, with a course particularly tailored for public sector employees. The first 211 MBAs graduated this year. De Montfort's 50-acre campus is a stone's throw away - symbolically as well as geographically, since the OU helped to get the new polytechnic-university off the ground. It took off with lightening speed. It is just two years since the Milton Keynes Development Corporation invited higher education institutions to tender to operate a new campus in the town. The winner was Leicester Polytechnic (now styled De Montfort University), whose governors appointed Professor Peter Thewlis, dean of its school of computing, to oversee the new project. 'When I arrived last January', he recalls, 'I had a car, a phone, a dictaphone and a temporary office in the Citizens' Advice Bureau.' He also had a large field, which now boasts three large warehouse-style buildings - the first of a projected dozen or so - only one of which is yet open. Inside is a plushness most polys only dream of: wall-to-wall carpets, spacious lecture theatres, every other room replete with word processors or computers. The first 400 students and 30 lecturers - a third of them transfers from Leicester - arrived last October. Student numbers are planned to rise to at least 5,000 by the turn of the century, with the lecturing staff expanding accordingly. More than a fifth of the first intake of students come from the locality - a higher proportion than typical for a poly - and De Montfort is pioneering 'compact' schemes and the like with local schools to strengthen links. But it is also building accommodation blocks (on a different site) and the proportion of students from beyond the town is likely to increase once it becomes fully part of the Polytechnics and Universities Central Council on Admissions system next year. 'You wouldn't, perhaps, expect to do archaeology at Milton Keynes', says Professor Thewlis. 'We chose our disciplines to match people's expectations and imagery for a Milton Keynes university.' The emphasis is resolutely applied and high-tech: schools of computing, business, engineering and the built environment are up and running; social work and 'modular arts' - whose plans include a broadcast journalism degree, subject to validation - follow. Some of the courses are offered on collaborative and franchising agreements with Milton Keynes Further Education College, which is keen to offer a seamless route from A-level through to degree. The college - a merger of FE colleges at Bletchley and Wolverton with a new and expanding campus in the town centre - has nearly 7,000 students, and is building a Pounds 5m extension at its town-centre site at Chaffron Way. The concept of a 'distributed university' lies at the heart of De Montfort's plans for its offspring. Constrained on its home site at Leicester, the poly-university was eager to expand, and is doing so through a network of colleges, each intended to have its own specialisms and 'centres of excellence.' Milton Keynes is the first of the outposts. Bedford College of Higher Education - which has a strong emphasis on education, sport and the performing arts - is likely to join; the Lincoln Colleges of Agriculture and Art and Design have also expressed strong interest. The end-product will be a 30,000-strong university on four sites within a 50-mile radius of Leicester, with many students moving between campuses for different parts of their courses. 'The whole structure will be complementary, not just in disciplines, but in locations - a truly distributed system,' enthuses Professor Thewlis. Taking it to heart, he lives half way between Milton Keynes and Leicester.</p>

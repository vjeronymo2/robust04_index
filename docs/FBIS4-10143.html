			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Workers Federation Secretary General Pedro  Ross Leal has announced that there will be people's marches on  the occasion of 1 May only in the municipalities of Pinar del  Rio, Artemisa, and Matanzas and in one of the two capitals of  Havana Province [sentence as heard]. Here is journalist  Diosdado Maso with further details on the 1 May celebrations:    [Begin Maso recording] Ross explained that the reason the  marches of the militant Cuban people are not being held in both  the capital and municipalities is the economic situation the  country is going through. How can we hold ceremonies when there  are workplaces and sugar mills that need the labor force and the  resources we might use in holding such ceremonies? Ross gave the  construction of the two grandstands at the national ceremony  held every year in Revolution Square as an example. He said just  one of these grandstands uses up more than seven cubic meters of  wood, without counting the nails, the fuel, the fabric -- in  short, great expense.    Concerning the political justification for not holding the  march of the militant Cuban people here in the capital, Ross  said that holding the special session of the National Assembly,  where the suggestions made by the workers during the Parliaments  in the Workplace were discussed, is the best acknowledgement of  the Cuban trade-union movement by its government and its people.

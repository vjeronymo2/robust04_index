			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Plan to 'end welfare as we know it' bears heavy cost President Bill Clinton may have to scale back his plan to 'end welfare as we know it' because of the greater-than-expected cost of overhauling the US social safety net. The welfare reform plan drafted by a White House task force could cost as much as Dollars 58bn (Pounds 39.7bn) over 10 years, according to yesterday's New York Times. The report, citing a memorandum written by the task force, says a 'Cadillac version' of welfare reform could cost Dollars 18.4bn during its first five years, but might cost over Dollars 7bn a year more than the current system once fully phased in. Officials said the administration was likely to adopt a more limited version that would still cost Dollars 35bn over 10 years. The core of the Clinton welfare reform plan - which is designed to fulfil one of his most popular campaign promises - is a proposal, with which several states are already experimenting, to require welfare recipients to work for their benefits after two years. This is expected to increase the overall cost of welfare substantially, because of the need to create more training and work programmes, as well as to provide child care and health cover for participants. The memorandum showed a 10-year cost of Dollars 12bn for expanded training programmes, Dollars 14.7bn for new work programmes and Dollars 16.3bn to provide child care for poor people who work. It also foresees savings of Dollars 8bn over 10 years from improved enforcement of child support payments, and of Dollars 2.15bn from allowing states to cap benefits to those who have more children after they enroll for welfare payments. Under US budget rules, additional spending will have to be offset either by other spending cuts or by tax increases. A rival Republican plan aims to finance itself largely by cutting off benefits to immigrants - a measure that has also been eyed by many states seeking to cut their welfare budgets, but which will draw fire from key Democratic constituencies, including Hispanic members of Congress and church groups.</p>

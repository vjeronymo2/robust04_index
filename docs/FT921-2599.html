			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: GPA reveals cast for flotation GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, which is due to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in June, has announced the full cast of country lead managers for the deal. The flotation could value GPA at between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 3.75bn, based on a share price of Dollars 20 to Dollars 25. GPA is expected to issue 30m new shares, bringing the total number in the company to 150m. Since GPA made its preliminary filing with the US Securities Exchange Commission last week, the various country managers have started to build up a book of investor demand for the issue. Allocations will then be decided according to demand from the various investor centres, rather than being set in advance. Nomura is global co-ordinator and lead manager for the equity offering in Japan. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers are co-leads for the US, while Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Schroders are sponsors for the UK offering. The managers for the remaining centres of investor interest are: Swiss Bank Corporation (Switzerland); ScotiaMcLeod (Canada); Dresdner (Germany); Banque Indosuez (France); ABN-Amro (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg); and Nomura and SBC (the rest of the world). The IPO is intended to increase GPA's equity capital base, provide a public market in its shares, and help finance the group's aircraft acquisition programme. The group is committed to paying a total of Dollars 21.6bn for new aircraft - if options to buy further aircraft are included - up to the year 2000. Full details will be announced after the publication of GPA's fourth-quarter results in May, and the IPO will take place about a month later.</p>

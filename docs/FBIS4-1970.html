			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Beijing is to train  more high-level specialists in the next three years, which are  urgently needed by the booming economy, under the latest  on-the-job training program.    These personnel will be trained in such fields as modern  enterprise management, foreign trade and commerce, finance and  insurance, real estate development, urban construction projects  management, revenue and taxes, auditing, international law and  foreign trade, rural economy management, tourism, foreign  languages and computer technology.    Candidates to be trained will be professionals with a  college  degree and those with intermediate professional titles as well  as management personnel and technicians who have a bachelor's  degree.    Beijing municipal adult education officials said that by  1997, more than one million people will have to change their  jobs. The job-switchers will get training at local vocational  schools and radio and television universities.    The local economy in Beijing, including the rural areas, has  been growing as one of the fastest in China. On-the-job  training has become increasingly urgent in some enterprises and  rural ventures.    There are so far more than 170 adult vocational higher  education institutions in the city, and more than 3,500 other  kinds of training centers.    Last year, a total of 3.01 million people received adult  education and on-the-job training, officials said.</p>

It involved overseas-based flying corps including  nuclear-capable F-16 fighter-bombers plus fighter-bombers,  assault planes and observation planes belonging to the U.S.  Airforce in South Korea and the South Korean puppet Airforce,  more than 300 in all.    An RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane flew over the  military demarcation line (MDL) area that day for photographing  and electronic espionage on the whole areas of the North.    On the same day, formations of helicopter gunships and  transport helicopters of the puppet army staged exercises for  supporting ground units in an attack and airlifting in the air  above Paju and Yonchon Counties, Kyonggi Province, while 105 mm  artillery units fired scores of shells at an area adjacent to  the Demilitarized Zone of the MDL.    The war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets against the North are driving the situation of the  Korean peninsula to the brink of war.</p>

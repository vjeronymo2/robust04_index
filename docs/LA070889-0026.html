			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT OKS ABORTION LIMITS  </P> <P> Hold it! Before we get into an all-out civil war between the pro-lifers and the  pro-choicers that consumes the rest of the century, let's ask if either side  can really win.  </P> <P> The positions of both sides are so rigid that any laws passed in state  legislatures will be widely violated. In a democracy, any law to be effective  must be generally accepted by the populace. Abortion laws will take the  imposition of a police state to enforce.  </P> <P> The debate will consume our society, and divert attention from other pressing  needs. Not only will judges and legislators have to pass one or the other  side's "litmus test," but such a test will influence selection of executives  and other positions. We will be lucky if the U.S. doesn't become one giant  Beirut.  </P> <P> The reason: Attitudes towards abortion are primarily religiously based and the  judicial and legislative branches of government are out of their element in  finding a solution. Any government finding is meaningless, and may be dismissed  as having no content.  </P> <P> So butt out, government. Come on in, churches, and help your flocks. But one  request. After coming to your insights, do not try to proselytize. Respect  other people's rights to find the truth as they see it.  </P> <P> FLOYD A. OLIVER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

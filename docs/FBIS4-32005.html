			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- "Big trade union  confederations -- Alfa Cartel especially -- gave us notice about  a lot of union actions to be developed on June 14-21," said  Octavian Partenie, secretary of state, head of the Government's  Office for relations with trade unions and employers'  organizations.    Referring to the union claims and the dialogue of government  and unions, Octavian Partenie said "that their claims reached us  through media." He added that "many of the claims are already  settled or in the process of settlement, some are to be  negotiated as they can not be settled on the spot and other ones  cannot be even discussed." In the unrealistic claims ranking,  the official mentioned a 50 per cent salary increase, a claim  which means that "if we proceed to a 50 per cent salary rise  today, we will have tomorrow a 60 per cent price increase and  followed by a new salary increase, unemployment increase rate  and a population increase rate who cannot live a decent  life...and again a spiralling inflation."    At the end of his interview, Octavian Partenie expressed his  confidence in a reciprocal wish for dialogue. "Only in a  receptive and responsible dialogue can we find the proper  solutions," he underlined, noticing that at the present stage  unions should look towards the employers' organizations. "It is  with the employers' organizations that they are conducting talks  now and so it will be in the future too," said the Romanian  official.</p>

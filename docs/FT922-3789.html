			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / US utilities to merge in Dollars 2.3bn deal ENTERGY Corporation, a large Louisiana-based electric utility, is making a Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) cash-and-stock offer to acquire Gulf States Utilities (GSU), a Texas-based utility, in an agreed takeover that could help rationalise the electricity market in the region. The terms of the deal - which would make the combined group one of the top five utilities in the US - call for Entergy to offer up to Dollars 250m in cash and the remaining Dollars 2.05bn in stock. The takeover values GSU at Dollars 20 per share, representing a 38 per cent premium over its closing price last Friday. Yesterday the GSU share price rose by Dollars 1 1/4 , or 8.6 per cent, to close at Dollars 15 3/4 . Entergy's share price declined by Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 27. Entergy is a large New Orleans-based utility serving more than 1.7m customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The company, which employs 12,500 people, made a Dollars 482m net profit last year on Dollars 4bn of revenues. GSU of Beaumont, Texas, is a smaller utility with 579,000 customers in south-east Texas and southern Louisiana. Its 1991 net profit was Dollars 102m on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn. GSU has 4,500 employees. The deal may be seen as a resolution of GSU's long-standing woes. The company invested about Dollars 3bn in the 1980s in a 1,000MW nuclear power plant in Louisiana, but said yesterday it was only earning a return on about half the investment because of a lack of customer demand. Analysts said yesterday the merger seemed promising. But they warned approval could be lengthy. Entergy said yesterday it would raise the price of the transaction if it had not been completed by June 1994. Mr Edwin Lupberger, chairman of Entergy, said the deal would create a more competitive and efficient company and would lead to fuel-cost savings, operational advantages and cost efficiencies. Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham, said GSU had faced threats from competition in the past. 'By going with Entergy, a larger company with a more diverse fuel base, they will be able to lower prices to keep their industrial customers, such as the petrochemical and oil refining business,' he said. Salomon Brothers is advising Entergy. GSU's adviser is Goldman Sachs.</p>

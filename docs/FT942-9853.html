			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: Nice example After yesterday's story about the good life atop the African Development Bank, a visitor to the recent Asian Development Bank annual meeting in Nice has more reassuring news. Apparently ADB officials were so keen to ensure that they weren't criticised for having a good time at shareholders' expense that they shunned the upmarket hostelries, such as the Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais. Instead, they checked into a handy Novotel, a concrete block house frequented by travelling salesmen and other second class citizens. That's the spirit.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Part two of a three-part traveling exhibition of prints by artist Bruce Nauman  is a hard-to-fathom glimpse of his work spanning 1974-1981. The graphics are  only part of the artist's output in those years, so you can't get a sense of  his career. But if you know something about his mildly sinister neon texts or  his stubbornly contrary objects that defy perspective logic, you should be able  to negotiate this chunk of the artist's unpredictable oeuvre.  </P> <P> For an artist who works in so many mediums, from videos to holograms, Nauman  evidently finds printmaking particularly suited to the quirkiness of his  message. He plays with the mirror reversals of printmaking.  </P> <P> Occasionally he goes for the conceptual jugular as in "Silver Grotto/Yellow  Grotto," a threatening message about hidden motives buried between lines of  text and image.  </P> <P> Not known primarily as a printmaker, Nauman's are nevertheless thoughtful out  and well executed. Some of the boldest images are the most congested with line  and mark, purposely confounding readability. But even the simplest imagery like  the box within a box in "No Sweat" can have a chilling sense of menace and a  perverse sense of humor. (Earl McGrath Gallery, 454 N. Robertson Blvd., to Dec.  14.)

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: BRYANT GUMBEL TALKS HIS HEAD OFF TO WALTERS  </P> <P> "I WOULD say that Bryant Gumbel is an emotional guy, and where possible we  should capitalize on it, and where it hurts us, we should try to minimize it .  . . and he's not the one who should be the heavyweight, and so we should make  the heavyweight decisions, and make sure that Bryant stays in the background,"  says Bryant himself to Barbara Walters in an evaluation of -- Bryant Gumbel!  </P> <P> You can see this exchange and a lot of other stuff this Friday night on ABC's  "20/20" when Gumbel talks his head off to Walters. They address the infamous  "Today" show memo, the one that caused Willard Scott's toupee to stand up all  by itself.  </P> <P> They ramble over Bryant's alleged "arrogance" and how he gets along with his  mom and dad and what his future hopes are and, of course, the Jane  Pauley-Deborah Norville question. (A question, let's not forget, that the NBC  peacock caused to be raised all by itself and created into a tangled web.)  </P> <P> BARBARA ASKS Bryant: "Did you want Jane Pauley to stay?" He says, "I wanted  Jane Pauley to be happy in what she did." (I guess we might say that Bryant  doesn't exactly answer Barbara's question.)  </P> <P> Barbara leads hims, saying maybe Jane would have been happy staying at the main  desk and letting Deborah do the news. She remarks rather aggressively to  Gumbel: "You could have made it happen." He demurs: "I'm not sure I could have  made it happen, Barbara, I mean, you know, hindsight's perfect." Gumbel asserts  that if he'd interfered, it might have been interpeted as trying to stunt  Norville's career. Then he says "No" three separate times to the question of  whether there is any truth to the rumor that NBC is thinking of putting Jane  back on the "Today" show.  </P> <P> Barbara asks Bryant: "If they could bring Jane Pauley back, if she would come  back . . . would you like that? Would it help?" Gumbel again steps over the  query and counters with another one: "To take my place or Deborah's?" They spar  a moment, then he says: "Oh, I don't know. I think it's always difficult to  rewrite history, Barbara. I think the idea of bringing Jane back right now,  while certainly a pleasant one for a lot of people to consider, would be  fraught with so many difficulties involved, and so many hurt feelings, and so  much discomfort for all included, including Jane, that I think it's kind of an  unrealistic thing to even consider."  </P> <P> You'll have to tune in for the rest. As it is, I more or less "stole" this  portion and am breaking a release date.  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about Jane Pauley's new persona these days. This girl is  literally walking on air. Nobody has ever seen her quite like this before.  Nobody has ever known a Jane Pauley who went about popping out her chest and  busting her buttons with pride and joy. So if you are a Jane Pauley fan, that  should make you feel good for Jane.  </P> <P> And maybe our darling old peacock, NBC, will decide that they've made an  inadvertent star out of Jane and give her all those night-time slots I told you  the other day might not happen. It would be nice to be wrong here.  </P> <P> BOB HOPE is rounding up the Sports Illustrated swimsuit lassies for his NBC  special on April 9. And he'll feature a special bathing beauty -- Phyllis  Diller. Someone asked Bob if he likes bathing beauties? Hope said, "I don't  know. I've never bathed one."  </P> <P> BABY LOVE: Muscleman Lou Ferrigno, who IS "The Incredible Hulk," and his wife,  Carla, named their new son, Brent. He's their third child. . . . Lawrence  Olivier's son, Richard, not only is producing "Abra-Cadaver" at the Wyndham  Theater in London, but is handing out cigars for his and wife Shelley's new  daughter.  </P> <P> AFTER JUDITH Exner talked so frankly to Vanity Fair's Gerri Hirshey for this  month's blockbuster article (comments never before made about John F. Kennedy),  Gerri hooked her up with CAA agents Sonya Rosenfeld and Sally Willcox. Now  Judith has five movie offers!  </P></p>

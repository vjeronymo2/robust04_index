			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Arts: Le nozze di Figaro - Opera in Amsterdam Since the advent of period instruments Mozart's comic operas have become ever more sprightly on stage. The authentic brigade has literally set the pace with faster speeds, a quicker sense of humour, a twinkle in the eye, which has made even conductors who work with conventional orchestras hurry along to keep in the running. At least, that is usually the case. Nikolaus Harnoncourt was himself once in the vanguard of the authentic movement, but more recently he has taken his standard and headed off in a direction all of his own. For the new production of Le nozze di Figaro at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam he has neither period instruments, nor the theatre's usual orchestra, but the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in the pit - a real luxury, as the lovely wind playing in the introduction to the second act showed. Unfortunately, he squanders the glory of this situation fairly completely. Harnoncourt seems to have set out in this production with the express intention of wanting to prove a point. There is a theory that speeds in Mozart have become exaggerated over the years, the fast getting faster, the slow getting slower, and Harnoncourt is determined to do the opposite, no matter how perverse the results may be. At the very apex of its tension and excitement, where the second act finale should set the pulse racing, the music slumped into an enervated, low-blood-pressure jog-trot. It may seem impossible, but for the first two acts Harnoncourt and his producer, Jurgen Flimm, actually managed to make this ever-fresh masterpiece of comic opera boring. If the musical numbers were lifeless, the recitatives were positively deathly - long gaps between every sentence, meaningful looks, pregnant silences. The second act opened with a scene in which the characters sat around on the Countess's giant white bed with long faces, sighing deeply, stretching their limbs, the very picture of a bored household lazing around with nothing to do all day. Whatever happened to Beaumarchais's 'folle journee'? If the remainder of the evening was better, it was no thanks to the production. Although he may have been inhibited by the pacing of the drama which was emanating from the pit, Flimm himself showed little inclination to get any comic sparkle into the action. The Act 3 sextet when Figaro learns the identity of his mother and father (Mozart's own favourite comic moment) was drawn out at tedious length. One would not want to be around when this producer was telling a joke. The saving grace of the latter half of the evening was the greater prominence of arias in the opera's structure. Here the singers were able to dictate their own terms with some success. Olaf Bar's Count, in good voice, burst into violent anger in his Act 3 aria. Charlotte Margiono's previously unaffecting Countess found new depths in hers. Alastair Miles, asked to portray Figaro as a dolt and unflatteringly costumed, suddenly came to life late in the day with his trenchant final act solo scene. With Iris Vermillion adding a nicely touching Cherubino, this was potentially a fine cast. Best of all was the delightful Susanna of Isabel Rey, who worked hard from curtain up to curtain down (a long evening) to inject some spontaneity into the performance. When she was singing 'Deh vieni', stretching out limpid soprano lines over the orchestra's tenderly phrased accompaniment, the magic of Mozart's opera momentarily worked afresh. At the end I checked the programme. Yes, it did say that we had just seen a 'commedia per musica'. Somebody should tell the conductor and the production team. Further performances until May 29</p>

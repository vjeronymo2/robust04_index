			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER SHORTFALL FORCES OXNARD TO CUT BUDGET AGAIN  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council made more budget cuts this week after disclosing a  shortfall of almost $350,000 in its estimate of revenue for the 1989-90 fiscal  year.  </P> <P> The official announcement of the revenue shortage came Tuesday in a midyear  financial report that adjusts revenue according, in part, to receipts from the  first six months of the fiscal year.  </P> <P> "No matter what we do, we get all these shortfalls that keep coming in to us,"  Councilwoman Ann Johs said. "It's very discouraging."  </P> <P> After re-evaluating estimates of other revenue, the Oxnard budget department  calculated that the net effect is a $346,960 decrease in revenue expected  during the current year, said Bill Mayer, management and budget director.  </P> <P> After much discussion, the City Council cut $317,000, including $51,000 in  travel and training funds for city employees.  </P> <P> With those savings added to money saved from cutbacks in the fall, the city  again balanced this year's budget.  </P> <P> The budget decrease is primarily the result of a change in the revenue expected  from a franchise tax the city receives from the Southern California Gas Co.  </P> <P> The gas company has advised the city that revenue is down from one of its major  gas customers, Southern California Edison, because that company has begun  buying gas from gas companies elsewhere to avoid paying the Oxnard franchise  tax.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, city officials are trying to determine whether they can impose the  tax on Southern California Edison anyway because the gas, while bought outside  of city limits, is delivered to the electric company by way of lines in the  city right of way.  </P> <P> This week's shortfall comes just months after the City Council discovered that  estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were $2 million too high.  </P></p>

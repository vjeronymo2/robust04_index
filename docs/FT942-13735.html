			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Heseltine considers insolvency sell-off The head of the government's Insolvency Service has been asked to draw up plans for contracting out the bulk of the agency's work in handling bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations, John Willman writes. The main union in the agency believes that up to 1,200 of its 1,800 staff will go. A consultants' report by Stoy Hayward, the accountants, said last year that it was 'unclear' whether contracting out would yield significant savings or improve value for money. A further report from Stoy Hayward is due in July on the cost of privatising the work. The final decision on privatisation is expected to follow. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has asked Mr Peter Joyce, chief executive of the Insolvency Service, to draw up contingency plans to 'downsize' the agency. This will involve contracting out clerical and administrative work, under measures in the de-regulation bill now before parliament. The Insolvency Service's main offices are in London, Croydon, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 16 (XINHUA) -- United Nations  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has said it has not been  decided whether NATO or the U.N. should order to carry out the  threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around  Sarajevo when the NATO ultimatum expires.    In an interview published by the German weekly magazine "DIE  WOCHE," the U.N. Chief said there will be no hesitation in  implementing relevant Security Council resolutions by means of  air strikes.    "If NATO grants me full powers, I can act immediately,  because I already have the full power of the U.N.," he was  quoted as saying.    When asked whether Germany should send troops to participate  in proposed U.N. actions, the secretary general said that in  strengthening the status of the U.N., Germany plays a very  significant role in the world.    NATO issued a 10-day ultimatum ordering Bosnian Serbs to  withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo by midnight  GMT on Sunday [20 February], or face allied air strikes.    The ultimatum came after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo  street  market in early February killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200.    Over the past few days the international community has tried  to avert an escalation of the Bosnian war in hopes that the NATO  ultimatum will be able to end the Bosnian war.    In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton administration officials  have reiterated that the Bosnian Serbs must turn over their  artillery and mortars to the United Nations, move the weapons  out of range of Sarajevo, or render them "inoperable."</p>

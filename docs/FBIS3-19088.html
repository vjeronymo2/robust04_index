			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Inger Jagerhorn report: "EU Stamp on Nordic Meeting"] </F>   [Text] The specter of the EU [European Union] hovered over  the opening of the Nordic Council's meeting in Stockholm on  Monday [7 March].    The Nordic prime ministers all emphasized that the Nordic  Council is now working under a new constellation of stars. It  was almost as if it were possible to see the blue and gold  banner of the EU fluttering alongside the eight Nordic flags in  front of the Riksdag building.    According to Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the Nordic area will  be a strong voice, but not a bloc in European cooperation. No  Scandinavian politician was prepared to say on Monday precisely  how this would be achieved, for the enlargement of the European  Union to include three of the Nordic countries is still an open  question.    On 1 March Sweden and Finland concluded their negotiations  with the EU, whereas the Norwegian negotiations on fisheries  became deadlocked. When the session began, Norwegian Prime  Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was absent. She was in Brussels  with many members of her government in a final, all-out attempt  to try and catch up, and bring the Norwegian negotiations to a  successful conclusion before the end of the EU meeting, which  ends on Tuesday.  <H5>  Iceland Out in The Cold </H5>   It fell to Prime Minister David Oddsson of Iceland -- the  only Nordic country that is neither a member of the European  Union nor an applicant for membership -- to deliver the five  prime ministers' joint introductory address at the session's  ceremonial opening in the Riksdag building. The presidency of  the group of prime ministers rotates, depending on which Nordic  country will host the next session. In 1995 it will be Iceland'  s turn.    At a press conference the prime ministers developed their  ideas about continued Nordic cooperation in a new and unfamiliar  situation. Carl Bildt seized the opportunity to have a dig at  those members of parliament who are worried that the prime  ministers are assuming too much power: "We view the criticism  as recognition of the fact that the prime ministers have  accomplished something, and perhaps also as a relection of a  fear that we have succeeded far too well. I think the members  of parliament should regard it as a challenge for themselves."    Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, a long-standing member of  the Nordic Council, went on to say that over the last 10 years  the Council had failed to achieve anything new.    Bildt thought that time and time again Nordic studies had  reached the conclusion that the necessary preconditions for  making further progress in many areas do not exist.    Nonetheless, the prime ministers agreed that Nordic  cooperation is now heading toward a brighter future within the  framework of European integration. Bildt mentioned the fact  that recently cooperation has been more intensive than anything  he had experienced before. Aho thought he could see guarantees  for the Nordic dimension also being able to function within the  EU. And Denmark' s Poul Nyrup Rasmussen felt that Nordic  parliamentarians have a future at European level.    Nyrup Rasmussen also consoled the Norwegians by saying that  there is no such phrase as "the breakdown of negotiations," and  that he is among those who believe that Spain should give way in  the fisheries dispute. Esko Aho took the opportunity to point  out that this proves it is possible for any member state to  fight for its own national interests, despite its EU membership.    There will be referendums on EU membership in all three  Nordic candidate countries, and Finland has indicated already an  interest in 18 September, the same day as parliamentary  elections in Sweden.    Carl Bildt reported on the Swedish situation following the  chaotic meeting of party leaders on Friday: "There are two  conceivable times -- mid-June or the end of November. A  majority seem to be in favor of mid-June. However, that does  not mean to say that it will be held in mid-June. At least two  meetings of the party leaders still have to be held before the  issue can be decided."  <H5>  Domino Effect </H5>   The Norwegian Government is counting on a domino effect, for  Norwegian opinion polls show that the prospects for a "yes" will  increase significantly if Finland and Sweden hold their  referendums first. In response to a question as to when Norway  would hold its referendum, the Norwegian minister of labor and  municipal affairs, Gunnar Berge, answered cryptically: "Does  the sun not move from east to west?"    When the 87 elected members of parliament from the five  countries plus Aaland, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands took  their seats in the session chamber it was the second time that  they tested a new arrangement that was introduced last year --  that is, that it is the prime ministers, rather than the  ministers of Nordic cooperation, who outline their priorities  and plans for Nordic cooperation.    Foreign policy, which used to be such a taboo subject at the  sessions of the Nordic Council, now has its allotted place in  the introduction to the prime ministers' opening address. The  situation in the Baltic states, democratic developments and  uncertainty in Russia, and the anxiety concerning the  disintegration of Yugoslavia were central issues. The tone was  more cautious on the subject of internal Nordic cooperation.  <H5>  New TV Attempt </H5>   David Oddsson raised the topic of TV cooperation, where --  after decades of failure -- attempts are now being made to open  up the way for cross-border broadcasting, but where the problems  of copyright still remain unresolved. He mentioned the plans  for a Nordic environmental strategy for the years 1994-1996, and  the data network that will now be linked up to all schools in  the Nordic area with a view to improving language teaching.  Preparations are also underway for a Scandinavian year against  xenophobia.    "When one sees how comprehensive Nordic cooperation is, it  is  impossible not to wonder at how little the citizens of  Scandinavia know about it," David Oddsson complained, adding:    "For a long time we have been talking about a single Nordic  market. Thanks to the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement  this has finally become a reality."    At the press conference, Carl Bildt said that in four or  five  years it will be time for a reassessment of the Nordic Council.</p>

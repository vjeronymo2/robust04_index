			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the main  problem of the talks on Cyprus is the inclusion of the concrete  rights that will be recognized to the Turkish-Cypriot side in  the document, dated 21 March. President Denktas stressed that  the document, dated 21 March, or the draft ideas, can be  changed. He recalled that the UN General Secretariat has made a  promise to the Turkish Cypriot side on that matter.    Denktas received Gustav Feissel, the UN secretary general's  deputy special representative, at 1600 today. Minister of State  and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur; Minister of Foreign  Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit; Under Secretary of the  Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray; and Presidential advisers Necati  Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun also attended the meeting. In a  statement after the meeting, which continued for nearly 45  minutes, President Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] We are working on the matter. We  have been unable to conclude our work today. I could have asked  Mr. Feissel yesterday to come back on Thursday [16 June].  However, I hoped that we would be able to conclude our work  today. We have not been able to do so. Therefore, he will come  back at 1000 on Thursday.    The situation has not changed. They have put forward  requests on the access road [to Maras] and the area. Their  requests are common knowledge. They want us to withdraw one  mile or one kilometer from each side of that road. We have  agreed to withdraw up to 400 meters. Furthermore, we have  agreed that our military troops will not be seen in that area.  We are holding talks on the question of the transfer of the  police post, which is known as the police house, from the  eastern to the western part of that area. The military troops  must be able to perform their normal duties in the area. In  view of that, the Greek Cypriot demand for a document on how and  when crossings will take place is not practical. We are working  to try to determine whether or not alternate means can be found.    As far as we are concerned, the main problem is whether or  not concrete Turkish-Cypriot rights will be included in the  document dated 21 March. That is the main problem and we insist  that the reply is affirmative. Otherwise, we cannot be  satisfied because a comprehensive agreement has to be signed.  It should not be divided into two parts. A letter by the UN  secretary general confirming the rights to be recognized to the  Turkish-Cypriot side cannot be regarded as a part of the  comprehensive agreement. That would be meaningless. Such a  letter cannot be regarded as being of equal strength. It would  create many legal disputes in the future.    I believe that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis'  statement that the document, dated 21 March, cannot be changed  is not valid because it has been described as containing a set  of draft ideas. Work is carried out on a draft document in order  that it can be finalized and converted into an agreement. That  means that certain points can be changed. The UN Secretary  General has promised us that it can be changed. However, it has  suggested that the change should be realized through a letter.  We have responded by saying that what they have described as a  document on draft ideas should be changed and converted into an  agreement. [end recording]    For his part, Gustav Feissel said after his talks with  Denktas that they tried to clarify certain points.    Following his statement on the talks he held with Gustav  Feissel, President Denktas assessed the intervention of Serge  Abou, the European Union's observer on Cyprus, on the  implementation of the package of confidence-building measures.  Denktas stressed that Abou was wrong to take sides as an  observer. He said the following:    [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Abou is reported to have said  today that he believes that the document, dated 21 March, is  valid and must not be changed. We did not expect a coordinator  or an observer to involve himself in the problem in such a clear  and biased fashion. Some of our officials were undecided as to  whether or not we should hold talks with him. Considering his  statement, we thank God that we did not agree to meet him.  Obviously, he has been influenced by the Greek Cypriots as a  result of his contacts with them. He has taken sides on a  matter that does not concern him. Consequently, he has already  begun to do everything he can to influence the EU in favor of  the Greek Cypriots. That is a regrettable development. His  appointment was wrong. It was asked for by the UN secretary  general on behalf of Glavkos Kliridhis. It was unnecessary.  Obviously, something was required to reinforce the  Greek-Cypriot side's approach.    That state of affairs is regrettable. The adoption of a  position by observers to harm one side of the issue is  unthinkable. We hope that Mr. Abou will not make a similar  mistake in the future.

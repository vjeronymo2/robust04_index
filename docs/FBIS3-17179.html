We are  getting ready to meet him in Moscow next weekend. This was  reported today by Sergey Filatov, the leader of the  administration of the head of state, in an interview to an  ITAR-TASS correspondent.    In his words, he phoned Boris Yeltsin in Sochi today, but  the  president, together with his aide Lev Sukhanov were on the  tennis court at the time. In response to a question by an  ITAR-TASS correspondent asking why, during the vacation, Yeltsin  does not talk to the press -- as leaders of other states do, and  thus gives grounds for rumors about his ill health -- Filatov  answered: There are as many characters as there are people.  Boris Yeltsin is not Bill Clinton, and he has the right to his  own style of behavior.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia's Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin  reported to INTERFAX that the session of CIS Coordinating  Consultative Committee (CCC) underway on Tuesday in Moscow  approved the draft agreement on Ukraine's joining the Treaty on  Economic Union of CIS countries as an associate member.    Shokhin, who chaired the session, said the problems related  to Kiev's joining of the economic union are largely caused by  the political situation in this republic, in particular, by the  fact that a new parliament would apparently ratify a  corresponding agreement. To this effect the minister reminded  that based on CIS documents already ratified by Kiev, at the  Commonwealth's forums, Ukraine enjoys the right of a decisive  and in several cases of a consultative vote.    As Shokhin asserted, Kiev "has no reserved special positions  on articles of the treaty on economic union." "Ukraine's  peculiar feature is that it is closer to plenipotentiary than to  a classic associate membership in the economic union," stressed  the minister. He added that the CCC had proposed a general  variant of the draft agreement on associate membership with  respect to Ukraine.    Ivan Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, made it clear  during his conversation with our INTERFAX correspondent that a  common principal accord was voiced on the issue of Ukraine's  associate membership in the economic union at the CCC session.  However, experts have been charged with also developing a text  of an appropriate document. Korotchenya explained that due to  the fact that Kiev had not signed the CIS Charter and the Treaty  on Economic Union, because Ukraine had expressed its discontent  with several of the Treaty's provisions, there appear certain  difficulties and contradictions due to the preparation of an  agreement on associate membership of this republic in the  economic union.    Korotchenya added that "there is not a single completely  prepared document among those approved at the CCC session  Tuesday, all of them are to be revised by experts." Korotchenya  reported that majority of CCC members are in favor of a joint  conference on March 31 in Moscow instead of two separate  sessions, namely of the Council of heads of governments and  Council of heads of states.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: NMW stake changes hands ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, has spent Pounds 2.1m to take a 25.4 per cent stake in NMW Computers which specialises in services and software for the UK securities business. It paid 40p a share. Last year ACT bought Quotient, a software house specialising in financial software and which was a competitor of NMW's. ACT says that its holding in NMW is purely an investment. Last year, it made about Pounds 1m through buying and selling a stake in SD-Scicon, the computing services company which was eventually sold to EDS of the US. The Birmingham company has, however, a thriving financial services division, one of five industry sectors on which the company is focused and which contributed strongly to its pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 17m on sales of Pounds 120m. ACT acquired the stake from Specialist Computer Holdings, a privately-held dealership and distributor.</p>

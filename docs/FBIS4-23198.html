			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Nairobi, May 29 (AFP) -- Fighting raged in Kigali  on Sunday [29 May] on the eve of ceasefire talks between rebel  and government forces, and the United Nations said part of the  interim government had fled its base southwest of the capital.    The combat, sporadic but at times heavy, forced the United  Nations to suspend its evacuation of civilians from Kigali, a UN  spokesman said.    In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said  some 400,000 Rwandans had fled the fighting in the capital:  "They have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. It is a very  grave situation," said ICRC spokesman Tony Burgener.    UN spokesman Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone from  Nairobi, said: "Our information is that a substantial number of  government officials have left Gitarama for Kibuye (west) and  Butare (south), but some are still there."    It was not immediately clear whether the interim Prime  Minister Jean Kambanda was among the officials who reportedly  fled.    The self-declared interim government fled Kigali on April  12,  and established its base near Gitarama, 50 kilometres, (35  miles) southwest of the capital, after Rwanda Patriotic Front  rebels launched an offensive on the city.    The rebels have been tightening their grip on Kigali over  the  past couple of weeks and are reported to have advanced within  seven kilometres (five miles) of Gitarama.    There was also heavy fighting around the northern town of  Ruhengeri, Kabia said. [passage omitted]</p>

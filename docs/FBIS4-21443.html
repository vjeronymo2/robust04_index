			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katri Himma: ``Vietnam Is Conserving Its </F> Forests; New Village Model May Reduce Slash and Burn of Mountain  Forests'']    [Text] Hanoi -- Vietnam is rapidly opening its doors to a  market economy. But unlike Thailand and Indonesia, Vietnam does  not want that country's exceptionally fragile natural  environment to pay the price for it.    They want tight supervision of the rapidly dwindling  forests.  Logging permits are restricted and scientists have recently  found promising new ways of halting the rapid advance of erosion.    The size of Norway, mountainous Vietnam is losing over  160,000 hectares a year of virgin forest.    While the forests are being threatened more and more with  commercial logging, forest use by ordinary people is a basic  problem, according to Vo Quyn, professor of forestry at Hanoi  University.    Eighty percent of Vietnam's 70 million inhabitants still  live  in rural areas. Arable fields are in short supply. As the  population grows, the slash-and-burn agriculture employed  especially by the ethnic minorities that live in the mountain  regions is becoming a problem.    Whereas after farming it for a few years, a cleared and  burned field used to be left for at least 10 years to revert to  forestland, now new farmers come to clear the land again within  as little as 3-5 years because there is no other unoccupied land.    When forestland does not have time enough to properly  reforest itself, erosion sets in. According to Prof. Quyn, 13  million of Vietnam's total of 32 million hectares are already  devastated because of erosion.  <H5>  Pond in Center of Ecological Village </H5>   Vo Quyn, who heads the Faculty of Natural Resources and  Environmental Affairs at the University of Hanoi, is Vietnam's  ecology veteran. After the Vietnam War, the country's forests  were caught up in an ecological catastrophe. Seventy million  liters of environmental toxins had been scattered over the land.    In the 1970's Prof. Vo Quyn set out in earnest to look for a  village model that would get the aborigines, who were used to  moving on [after exhausting a piece of land], to remain in their  areas and work the forests and fields of the mountainous areas  in an enduring manner.    After years of experiments and errors, Vo found the ideal  village model. Fruit trees are planted near the house and  fast-growing trees from which people get their firewood on the  upper slopes.    Villagers can cultivate their own crops, tea, rice, and  vegetables, between the forest stands. In the center of the  village is the heart of the idea, a pond that produces water for  both people and plants and guarantees fish for the villagers'  tables.    ``The only way to get people to protect the environment they  live in is to make it useful to them. People need food and  money,'' Vo said.    Vo's model is now being applied in many provinces. Nearly as  much new forest is being planted in these areas as is being  logged.    In January the Vietnam National Assembly passed the  country's  first package of environmental laws. It contains strict rules  according to which business firms are obligated to assess the  impact of their operations on the environment and their use of  natural resources. Prof. Vo, who participated in the drafting of  these laws, is particularly pleased.    ``Now we have a foundation on which to base ourselves. While  the new laws are not yet very detailed, they afford government  officials the possibility of monitoring the use of natural  resources better than they could before.''    The laws are also of help in connection with Vietnam's  latest  environmental problem, the dumping of waste. At the start of the  year, a Vietnamese food company asked customs officials for  permission to import ``a 61-container lot of miscellaneous  assorted plastic products'' into the country.    However, the shipment vanished and after only a few weeks  the  cargo was found in a suburban development near Ho Chi Minh:  1,114 tons of dirty, used plastic bags. They had planned to burn  the plastic waste or bury it. The officials, however, ordered  the shipment to be sent back to its country of origin -- Germany.</p>

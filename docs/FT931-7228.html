			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Problem at offshoot sees CRP shares fall Shares in CRP Leisure yesterday fell 3 1/2 p to 4 1/2 p, after the USM-traded group warned of financial difficulties at its CR Pursehouse subsidiary, compounded by a sizeable bad debt on a building contract. The company warned that trading at Pursehouse, a building contractor acquired a year ago and mainly engaged in public house refurbishment, had 'deteriorated significantly' in recent months. CRP said it was examining various options to resolve the problems at Pursehouse, including possible refinancing and an arrangement with the subsidiary's creditors.</p>

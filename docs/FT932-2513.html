			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / People: IBM poaches Cooper IBM's European personal computer business has recruited Mr Paul Cooper, aged 33, Dell Computer's direct sales manager in the UK, to lead IBM's long-awaited move into direct PC sales. In his new role as IBM's North European director in charge of direct response marketing, Mr Cooper will be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of a North European direct sales strategy for IBM personal computers. The move marks something of a coup for IBM, which has watched as rival PC manufacturers such as Dell have grabbed market share by selling directly to customers off computer magazine pages and via the telephone line. Mr Cooper joined Dell in 1989 as direct sales manager and during his first three years with Dell was part of the team that expanded Dell's direct sales team from 10 to 50 people and increased its sales from Pounds 15m to over Pounds 50m. In 1991 he established Dell's main accounts operation and a year later set up Dell's direct sales operation in Ireland. Before joining Dell he worked for Rank Xerox, becoming district sales manager. He joined Rank Xerox from Bradford University where he studied management science and trained with ICL, the UK-based computer group.</p>

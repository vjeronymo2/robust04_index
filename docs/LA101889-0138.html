			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT HEARINGS POSTPONED AGAIN  </P> <P> Citing a mass of new information from the airline industry that must be  studied, John Wayne Airport officials have again postponed public hearings on  the proposed airline flight allocation plan.  </P> <P> The initial hearing before the County Airport Commission, previously scheduled  for tonight, now is set for Nov. 5, said Jan Mittermeier, assistant airport  manager. She said county supervisors probably won't hold their public hearing  and final vote on the plan until mid-November.  </P> <P> Originally, the airport access plan -- which includes jet flight allocations at  the tightly regulated airport -- was to have been approved in April.  </P> <P> An unexpectedly slow review of the plan by the Federal Aviation Administration  and opposition by two of the nation's major cargo carriers, Federal Express and  United Parcel Service, upset that timetable, however. County airport officials  met with the FAA on Monday and Tuesday to discuss the cargo carriers' concerns.  </P></p>

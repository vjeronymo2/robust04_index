			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Carlton bids Pounds 758m for Central rival: The first of the UK's big commercial television takeovers Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications launched the UK's ITV takeover game yesterday with an agreed bid for Central Independent Television which valued the second largest ITV company at Pounds 758m (Dollars 1.1bn). The cash and shares offer at the equivalent of Pounds 26 a share came just five days after Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, proposed changing the ITV ownership rules to allow, for the first time, a single company to own a total of two broadcasting licences. Mr Green, will become the most powerful figure in UK commercial television if the Central deal, conditional on parliamentary approval, goes through. The combined group will command around 30 per cent of total ITV advertising revenue. Central already owns 20 per cent of Meridian, the south of England broadcaster, while Carlton holds 20 per cent of Good Morning Television, the commercial broadcaster. Carlton, whose interests range from television facilities and professional equipment to video-cassette duplication, yesterday underlined its growing strength by announcing a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.1m. Central's share price rose more than Pounds 4 yesterday to Pounds 25.73 and Carlton finished 30p up at 797p. Two other forces in independent television are also expected to make takeover moves. Granada Group is thought to be eyeing London Weekend Television, a company in which it holds 20 per cent, and Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, is predicted to go for either Anglia Television or HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west. But neither Mr Gerry Robinson, the Granada chief executive, nor Lord Hollick like the current ITV share prices and it is far from clear when they will make a move. Mr Green said yesterday that the Central deal would create 'a serious critical mass' of programme production and promised that appropriate Carlton network programmes would be made in Central's Nottingham studios, which are underused. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbroker Goldman Sachs, said last night: 'In television terms it's a great move. It's a real power base.' The deal will lead to a reorganisation of administration and support services and there are fears of job losses. Ms Anne Rawcliffe-King, of the broadcasting union Bectu, warned that the concentration of power within ITV resulting from the takeover would 'seriously unbalance the system'.</p>

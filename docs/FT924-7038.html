			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Announcement of gilts auction wipes out early gains FUNDING worries continued to trouble the UK government bond market with medium-dated issues closing lower on the latest auction announcement. The Bank of England's announcement of a gilt auction next month helped to wipe out the morning's gains, dealers said. The Bank plans to auction a medium-dated conventional stock, maturing between 2001-2005, on December 2. Further details, including the amount and specific stock, will be announced on November 24. Dealers said the announcement pushed medium-dated issues lower. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 109 3/8 to 109 1/32 by late afternoon. Among short-dated stocks, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 inched up from 104 31/32 to 105 to yield 6.58 per cent. Dealers estimate the government only has about Pounds 4bn of funding left to do in the current financial year, to help meet its estimated Pounds 37bn public sector borrowing requirement. However, the market is expecting gilt issuance in the 1993/94 financial year to be much heavier, with about Pounds 1bn of gilt issuance a week. US Treasury prices were firmer across the board in relatively thin trading yesterday. Earlier in the day selling at the long end had led to a modest steepening of the yield curve, but bond prices enjoyed a late burst of demand. At the close the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 101 1/32 , yielding 7.533 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up 3/16 at 99 5/16 , to yield 4.605 per cent. After Monday's curve-flattening trades, which involved buying longer-dated securities and selling the short end, investors came in early to reverse partially that move, with the yield on the two-year note falling farther than on the long bond. The long end later recovered, although there was disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not add permanently to reserves during the afternoon by buying outright Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn of securities, as some dealers and investors had been expecting. The Fed's decision not to intervene led to a lightening of some positions, said dealers. Otherwise, trading was subdued in the absence of important economic news, and in the expectation that the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, which was meeting yesterday, would leave interest rates unchanged in light of the recent signs that the economic recovery was gathering pace, albeit only very slowly. GERMAN government bonds traded in a narrow range ahead of today's holiday. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 91.01, moved in a range of 90.93-91.09, ending the day at around 90.97. Dealers welcomed yesterday's announcement from the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) that it will include Treuhand bond issues for delivery into its German government bond futures contract. The news emerged too late in the day to have much impact on the market. ELSEWHERE in Europe, French government bonds ended mixed with long-dated issues closing down while shorter-dated bonds finished slightly firmer. The yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1994 opened at 8.17 per cent and ended at around 8.08 per cent. Dealers said the short end of the market held up well ahead of tomorrow's auction of two and five-year paper. Long-dated bonds ended lower with the yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 ending at 8.12 per cent, against an opening level of 8.09 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds reached new highs in the cash and futures markets, lifted by the combination of a weak stock market and an easing in money market interest rates. The Nikkei stock index dipped below 16,000 for the first time since August, losing 169.51 points to finish at 15,993.48. Its fall revived hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate. In the money market, dealers said the Bank of Japan appears to be tolerating lower interest rates, as the overnight rate slipped  1/32 to 3 29/32 per cent. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.63 per cent and closed at 4.59 per cent, corresponding to the day's high.</p>

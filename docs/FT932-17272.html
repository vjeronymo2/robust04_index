			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Adwest ahead 60% to Pounds 3.2m - Benefits from two-year restructuring programme come through ADWEST GROUP yesterday announced a 60 per cent jump in first-half profits, helped by a two-year restructuring programme which reduced the workforce at the automotive components, defence and property company by some 1,100. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2m to Pounds 3.2m on sales ahead by just 4 per cent to Pounds 63m for the six months to December 31. The sharp difference in sales against profits was the result of 'all the work we have put into streamlining our businesses', according to Mr Fred Grant, chairman. As part of the restructuring programme, the workforce has fallen from 3,350 in 1991 to 2,250. The group did not expect such a strong advance for the full year, however, and forecast a maintained total dividend of 7p. The interim was increased by 60 per cent to 2p, solely to balance out the interim and final dividends. Earnings per share rose by 1.4p to 3.7p. Mr Grant said momentum had begun to slacken toward the end of the first half, especially in France and Germany where recession was beginning to bite. Adwest was also unlikely to benefit significantly from the recent upturn in the US, where its defence businesses are based. 'Defence is not flavour of the month, and is not likely to be,' said Mr Graham Menzies, managing director. Taken together, these three countries accounted for some 35 per cent of sales. 'But that doesn't mean we still won't have a pretty satisfactory year at the end of the piece,' Mr Grant said. Analysts are forecasting a range of Pounds 8m to Pounds 9.5m, against last year's Pounds 7.5m. During the first half, the automotive division had shown increases in both sales - from Pounds 34m to Pounds 38.6m - and in profits. Mr Menzies said new Japanese business was expected partially to offset the softening of demand in France and Germany. The situation at at Leyland Daf, an Adwest customer, was not expected to have a material effect on this division's second half performance, Mr Menzies said. The power systems division - which includes Adwest's defence operation - increased both profits and margins, although sales were slightly down at Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 23m). Defence had proved to be a good cash generator, although it remained a difficult environment. Property suffered a decline in margins on the housebuilding side while the rent roll from commercial development was steady at about Pounds 2.5m. Mr Menzies said the group now intended to pursue bolt-on acquisitions, which would be funded through internally generated cash. Gearing for the full year was expected to be close to last years 29 per cent.</p>

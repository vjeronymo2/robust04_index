			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: Eaten up by emotions EATING CHILDREN: YOUNG DREAMS AND EARLY NIGHTMARES by Jill Tweedie Viking Pounds 15.99 314 pages EATING CHILDREN is the first, startling instalment of Jill Tweedie's autobiography, written years after she established a reputation as one of Britain's leading feminists. She suggests that the catalyst for writing it, though, is not the rise of 'post feminism' but the death of her father, which left her, to her astonishment, emotionally adrift at the age of 50. The events of the books are remarkable in themselves. Born in Cairo - and convinced for years the hospital had handed the wrong baby to her parents - she grew up determined to be different from them. Her father was an authoritarian Scot, and her wistful and reproving mother had exchanged an exotic Turkish upbringing for a respectable and loveless Home Counties marriage. Early escape meant choosing a Swiss finishing school instead of university, and then sudden marriage - the first of three - to a bullying Hungarian count. But the title points to the deeper theme of the book: the way parents and children feed off each other, and the way this early relationship distorts later ones. Terrified as a child that she will be 'sucked in, eaten up' by her parents 'and would emerge as somebody else entirely', she later finds herself in 'suffocating panic' at coping with her first baby's demands. When he dies - in an unexplained cot death - she felt that she was 'the witch who killed children and ate them'. In spite of - or perhaps because of - her sensitivity to those undercurrents, she was blind to the real risks of the relationships; she dreamt her husband was a vampire, but failed to foresee that he might run off with their two children. They were returned to her only after years of court cases. One of the book's surprises - given what you might expect from a 1970s feminist - is her guilt about hurting men. The book opens with her fear that she may have triggered her father's heart attack, and hints that the boy to whom she was briefly engaged committed suicide when she ignored his letters. The guilt leads to a paralysing confusion about who is the victim and who the aggressor. She stays with her violent husband, she says, for fear that he would kill himself, in spite of the growing fear that he would kill her. Her anxiety about attracting men is also unexpected, and they are by far the most prominent characters in the book. But where the women are described in enormous physical detail - sprigged blouses, fruity perfumes, long legs, olive skins - the men are more elusive. Her husband is a 'brooding presence' and she gives a fragmented picture of her father, alternately domineering and teasing. She clearly links her claustrophobia in these relationships to her later feminism, and shows more self-knowledge in doing so than Germaine Greer did in her book about her search for her father. But the book's strength and honesty is that it gives a personal not a social explanation of her route to independence. Clearly, the women's movement has changed some things that constrained her. Rubber girdles have gone, and women no longer need a male guarantor to rent a flat (her father refused to give his signature because she had left her husband). But the psychological insight she is pursuing has won less support in Britain than the 1970s gave grounds to expect. Nor, despite the flurry of interest around the recent failed royal marriages, are there many writers who acknowledge so clearly how parents shape their children. That perceptiveness makes the book much more than a historical record. There are irritations: she almost flaunts her past lack of control, and the tone is sometimes reminiscent of 'before and after' features on self-help. Her final casting-off of her parents legacy is also unconvincing: 'For far too long, I had raised and nourished a hybrid persona which had produced the odd fruit but at far too high a price. Now, with any luck, the real thing had been dug in and the roots would hold'. But those are small points, and simply raise the interest in her next instalments.</p>

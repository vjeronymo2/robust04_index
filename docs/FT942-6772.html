			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Removing the punch bowl It is the job, so the adage goes, of a central bank to take away the punch bowl just as the party becomes lively. That is precisely what Mr Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve has managed to do, even though many American politicians and economists have failed to recognise the achievement. But what about the Germans? They are apparently thinking of removing the bowl before the guests have taken off their coats. That the Federal Reserve has judged things rather well was confirmed by yesterday's release of the revisions to US gross domestic product for the first quarter. The annualised growth rate had been initially estimated at 2.6 per cent. This has now been raised to 3 per cent, contrary to market expectations, which were for the growth rate to be revised downwards, to 2.3 per cent. Last week's half a percentage point increase in the US discount rate looks even better judged now than it did then. The Federal Funds rate is a little under 4 1/4 per cent, 1 1/4 percentage points above where it was in early February. This increase must be judged the least that can be justified, given what has been happening to the US economy and bond markets. US and German short-term interest rates have been converging since the autumn of 1992, when the gap was 6.7 percentage points. But even now, after a tiny reduction this week, the Bundesbank's repurchase (or 'repo') rate, at 5.2 per cent, remains more than one percentage point above the Federal Funds rate. A visitor from Mars, looking at the two economies and the two rates, would surely be puzzled. The US economy has been growing since the beginning of 1991, while German recovery remains notional. Most measures, notably unemployment, suggest the US economy is running at close to full capacity, while German unemployment is at 9.3 per cent, even excluding the high levels in east Germany. US inflation is running only a little below German rates, which have been falling steadily, to below 3 per cent. US long rates of interest are more than half a percentage point higher than those in Germany, underlining the greater confidence in German price performance. German rates The visitor from Mars would be puzzled. The investor in European markets seems to be shocked, if not by the level of German interest rates, at least by the fear that they may not decline further. Both the German and UK stock markets registered marked falls over the week. By contrast, US and Japanese markets have been relatively robust. Similarly, Salomon's European bond index lost 1.59 per cent in local currency over the week to Thursday, making European bonds the biggest losers for the second consecutive week. It had been widely assumed that, by cutting the discount rate to 4.5 per cent on May 11, the Bundesbank had deliberately given itself room for substantial cuts in the repo rate, which was then (and is even now) well above the previous floor of 5 per cent. That confidence has since been punctured. The proximate reason for the change in perspective has been remarks by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, and a number of his colleagues. Mr Tietmeyer said that 'we are not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time being'. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's monetarist chief economist, Mr Otmar Issing, remarked that 'current money supply figures did not match a landscape of falling interest rates.' The data certainly underlined the warning, since the Bundesbank's target measure of broad money, M3, grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised rate of 15.8 per cent between the last quarter of 1993 and April 1994. Twin desires Two desires are warring in the heart of the Bundesbank. The first is not to throttle German and, indeed, European recovery. The second is to remain a credibly monetarist institution, one that takes its targets as seriously as it would like outsiders to take them. That side of the Bundesbank is worried by the weakness of the German bond market, looks askance at the German fiscal deficit and feels comforted by the emerging signs of recovery, not just in Germany, but also in France. It is good news, for example, that Insee, the French government's statistics agency, predicts a 0.9 per cent growth in the French economy in the first half of this year. The first impulse drove down the discount rate in early May, while the second is determined to use the room for manoeuvre as cautiously as possible. But German short term rates of interest still seem set to decline further (whatever the monetary numbers may say to the contrary). Similarly, US interest rates have further to rise. What is happening to monetary policy in US and Germany merely underlines the vastly divergent politics in the two countries. In the US people ask why rates are so unreasonably high. In Germany they ask why they are so riskily low. That is why the Bundesbank is, once again, a convincing party-pooper.</p>

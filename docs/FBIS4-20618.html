Especially in the fields of active safety design and  human-machine interface, remarkable progress has been made by  utilizing advanced electronics and other technologies. The  technologies expected for providing vehicles with further  intelligence in response to the social demands should cover a  very wide range including materials, semiconductors, control  methods, information communication and ergonomics. In other  words, we must develop vehicles that are kind to people, society  and the earth by making effective use of the fruits of the  research and development activities in these fields.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Development of automotive technologies in the history of  automobiles over 100 years can be referred to as steps toward  realization of intelligent vehicles. Driving vehicles may be  considered a combination of high-grade complicated physical and  mental (intellectual) activities. Technologies for supporting  and executing these activities can be called intelligent  technologies in a wide sense. Some examples of intelligent  technologies introduced in the past are checking the driver's  operation, unit operation, meter indications and driving  environment as well as information exchange with external  systems. Vehicles today are based on technologies in a very wide  range. In the process of providing vehicles with further  intelligence in the future, the results of scientific and  technological research and development activities in a wider  range calling for interdisciplinary and interindustrial  cooperation will be incorporated. In this paper, we will  introduce the technologies which will contribute to the  attainment and satisfaction of the existing and expected needs  and functions concerning vehicles.  <H5>  2. Assignments and Orientation for Developing Automotive </H5> Technologies    The most important assignment for automotive technologies is  to satisfy various requirements in the fields of environmental  protection, energy resources and safety. Major environmental  issues are exhaust emission control, improvement of fuel economy  leading to reduction of CO[.sub]2[/], substitution of CFC and  recycling of materials. Examples of exhaust emission control  technologies are the three-way catalytic converter that reduces  HC, CO and NO[.sub]x[/] at the same time, knock control  system (KCS) that optimizes the thermal efficiency of the engine  for better fuel economy and idle speed control (ISC) system that  controls the engine speed at idle. Since improvement of safety,  on the other hand, involves human factors such as drivers and  pedestrians, results of future research activities in the fields  of ergonomics, psychology and physiology are required to be  incorporated. Implementation of active safety technologies for  appropriate coverage of such human characteristics as fatigue,  forgetfulness and mistake are expected especially. Furthermore,  improvement of the human-machine interface and development of a  traffic system that organically links roads and vehicles are  desired in preparation for expected increases in traffic  density, vehicle speeds and aged population.  <H5>  3. Active Safety Technologies </H5>   As the concept of active safety is relatively abstract and  may be interpreted in many ways, we have tried classification in  terms of the method for avoiding danger, type of danger and  situation involving danger. First, the active safety technology  can be referred to as the technology for avoiding human errors  by substituting the operating functions of the driver.    The operating functions performed by the driver may roughly  be divided into the seven following steps:    (1) Perceiving the present traveling state of the vehicle  being driven and the surrounding situation.    (2) Predicting the state in the next moment on the basis of  past experience and knowledge.    (3) Estimating the difference between the target (expected)  state and predicted state to judge (determine) the necessary  operation.    (4) Performing appropriate operations according to the  result  of judgment.    (5) Checking if the change resulting from the operations has  brought about the optimum (target) state and performing  correcting operation as required.    (6) Memorizing (or physically mastering) the result for  future use in the same situation.    (7) Returning to step (5) or (1) again.    Though the time period for steps (1) to (7) is generally  extremely short, much dispersion or an error will arise  depending on the driving conditions (time zone, weather, road  environment, etc.) at the moment and driver's characteristics  (driving experience, age, degree of fatigue, etc.). In  substituting a part of driver's operating functions that can be  divided into steps (1) to (7) above, the active safety devices  should perform the following functions:    (1) Supporting the driver's perceiving activities    (a) Indication of objective physical values by  meters    (b) Environmental recognition systems (radar system,  external pattern recognition system for perceiving obstacles,  road signs and road shape, etc.)    (c) Systems for ensuring field of vision and  improving visibility (automatic wiper, anti-glare mirror,  monitor camera, etc.)    (d) Guidance for appropriate driving operation    (2) Alarm and warning by knowledge base    (a) Prediction and detection of inappropriate or  wrong driving operation    (b) Indication of limits for driving    (c) Detection of abnormal vehicle state    (3) Emergency intervention    When the driver operates incorrectly to generate an  emergency  state for which simple alarming may be too late to avoid a  danger, the manual input portion is isolated from the  man-machine system and changed over to be driven by the wire  system for forced braking or steering, for example. In this  case, forced intervention of the machine side requires matching  with the reaction and feeling of the driver.    (4) Partially automatic operation    This means autonomous driving by recognizing the external  situation and calculating the path by the image recognition  system and expert system during traveling in a fixed environment  with relatively little external variation (noise) as on an  expressway or traveling at low speeds as at the time of garaging.    The second type of active safety technology is for warning  and alarming the driver by predicting and detecting  physiological and mental states such as fatigue and drowsiness  of the driver. Technologies of this type have been studied in  the fields of labor science and ergonomics, but study in the  automotive field has just started.    Development of technologies for measuring driver's facial  expression, heart rate and brain waves, for analyzing the  correlation with fatigue and for warning is necessary.    The third type is the technology for realizing comfortable  driving environment gentle to the driver to cause little  fatigue. It means to quantitatively grasp the conditions likely  to cause fatigue of the driver and the environment comfortable  or disagreeable to the driver so as to determine the vehicle  dimensions and control the interior conditions accordingly. Some  examples are enhancing the ride comfort, controllability and  stability, upgrading the air conditioner, improving NVH (noise,  vibration and harshness), and improving the visibility of  display and meters. Especially in the field of display, long  focal-length instruments (virtual image meters) and HUD  (heads-up display) for reducing change in the line of sight and  focal adjustment have been developed. Further upgrading by  introduction of advanced holography, CG (computer graphics) and  VR (virtual reality) is expected in the future. Table 1 shows  the examples of active safety systems.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Human Interface </H5>   Human interface is closely related to the active safety  technologies explained in the previous chapter. The speech  recognition technology aims at reducing the operation load.  Applications to mobile telephone (hands-free telephone), audio  system and air conditioner operation, and destination input to  the navigation system have been reported. The specific speaker  recognition system was mostly used in the early stage, but  unspecific speaker recognition system will be introduced in the  future. These should be used selectively according to each  application system.    The speech synthesis technology began with Toyota Speak  Monitor in 1980, and has been inherited in the voice navigation  system. It will be necessary to eliminate unnaturalness in  speech generation timing, message repetition and tone felt by  the listener for accurate understanding of the meaning.    As regards the display technology, it will become important  to study the method for communicating an increasing amount of  information generated both inside and outside of the vehicle  accurately for easy understanding by the driver. It is therefore  important to develop the display method (software) matching the  characteristic of human sense of vision and the hardware for  realizing it with good coordination. The display system in the  cockpit of the airplane has optimized the priority of displayed  information and selective use of colors in good coordination  with the buzzer, synthesized speech and vibration. The  instrument panel in vehicles will develop into an intellectual  interface incorporating the knowledge in visual psychology and  sonics.  <H5>  5. Control Methods </H5>   The term ``nonlinear technology'' has made its appearance  only recently. It is a generic term for neural networks, fuzzy  systems, fluctuative control, chaos and fractal. Application of  this new technical thought to the field of engineering has been  proposed. The fuzzy control has already been applied to cruise  control, AT (automatic transmission) shift change control and  air conditioning control, and pattern recognition by neural  networks and nonlinear adaptive control system making use of  parallel distributed processing and learning function have been  reported.    The fluctuative control is based on the experimental result  showing that fluctuation frequency f and the intensity of  fluctuation (power spectrum) are distributed inversely  proportional to each other in phenomena (such as breeze,  vibration of vehicles and classical music) agreeable to human  beings. (This is called l/f fluctuation.) The heartbeat cycle  and alpha brain wave are also said to have the characteristic of  l/f fluctuation.    Chaos and fractal theorems are said to be able to find out a  certain kind of regularity in seemingly irregular events. It is  possible that these theorems may be applied to the analysis of  human body measurement data.  <H5>  6. Information Communication System </H5>   Adaptation of vehicles to the information age is an  extremely  important task. Mobile telephone and portable telephone have  already been put into service as members of mobile communication  systems and the demand is predicted to increase greatly in the  future. Information communication is confronting a turning point  as represented by implementation of the vehicle mounted portable  telephone system and digital mobile telephone system as well as  freeing of using radio equipment and antennas.    Communication networks surrounding vehicles with the public  telephone network application system including vehicle mounted  facsimile as the core are being enriched. In addition to the  conventional running turning and stopping functions, vehicles  can be said to have obtained the communicating and speaking  functions. Future development to cover the satellite  broadcasting, communication system, new cordless telephone (PHP:  personal handy phone) system and future public land mobile  telecommunication system (FPLMTS) is also expected. Figure 1  [not reproduced] shows the communication networks surrounding  vehicles.    The navigation system, on the other hand, will develop from  the initial dead reckoning system to the map matching and GPS  applied systems. In the near future, it will be integrated with  the traffic information system for communication with the  infrastructure as the VICS (vehicle information and  communication system) for example. It is also expected that an  intelligent vehicle/road traffic system with the road vehicle  communication technology as the core will be implemented in the  future. Table 2 shows the examples of future road traffic  systems.       Table 2.

Elementary Technologies </H5>   Electronics has contributed much toward realization of  intelligent vehicles. Especially, the development of  semiconductor technology has been keeping pace with the  development in the intelligence of vehicles.    Various intelligent sensors and actuators provided with  excellent precision and response as well as many special  microcomputers capable of processing high-grade control logics  with sufficient durability to severe operating environment on  vehicles have been introduced to combine electronic means to the  conventional mechanical structure effectively so as to create  characteristics and functions that are difficult to be realized  simply by improving mechanisms. Development of high level  programming language for automotive control system and  implementation of the development environment for testing and  debugging prototype programs are also important tasks for  adaptation to diversification and upgrading of microcomputer  systems in the future.    In the field of sensors, intelligent sensors with high  precision in small sizes by high-precision microstructure  fabrication called micromachining have been put into practical  use. Some examples are the manifold pressure sensor for lean  burn system, semiconductor G sensor for air bag and  semiconductor negative pressure sensor for EFI.    Heat resistant elements, pressure resistant elements, power  devices (contactless relays) and high density packaging  technology or surface mount device technology have been  developed in addition. Development of applications of the EEPROM  and flash memory as memory elements is also expected.  High-performance glass, functional film, electro-chromic (EC)  and electro-luminescence (EL) devices, LCF (light control  filter), high-output laser diode and radio-frequency oscillator  are expected to be developed as display devices and new sensors.  <H5>  8. Systematization Technology </H5>   The fault diagnosis systems have been put into practical use  in the forms of both on-board and off-board. It is considered to  be improved further, but standardization in the industry is  desired.    Effectiveness of the ECU network in suppressing the increase  in the wire harness size has been confirmed. Standardization of  the network protocol is being studied. Power circuit control  will add to its importance for counteracting increases in the  current consumption and engine load resulting from increase in  electronic devices.  <H5>  9. Conclusion </H5>   We have roughly explained the examples of technologies for  providing vehicles with further intelligence and the  technologies for supporting realization of such technologies. In  addition to the approach for providing intelligence by selecting  intelligent behaviors of personified vehicles, we have also  described the intelligence from the viewpoint of convenience of  vehicles for people who use the vehicles. In providing vehicles  with further intelligence, it is necessary to understand drivers  as men and to study ergonomic design and human-machine interface  further. In the future, we would like to form the desirable  image of intelligent vehicle convenient for the people after  fully understanding the difference between men and machines. The  environment surrounding vehicles is expected to continue quick  changes but the necessity of producing safer and comfortable  vehicles that are kind to people and the earth will remain  unchanged.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Knyazev: "Ajaria--An Island of </F> Stability?"]    [Text] It is midday. The city's streets are half empty. The  rarely encountered passers-by are not talkative. The shelves of  the state stores are pristinely bare. Bread was delivered and a  waiting line formed for it. But in the private commercial  stores, on the contrary, everything is available and there are  no waiting lines. For a Snickers chocolate bar for your child  you shell out 30,000-35,000 coupons and there goes a third of  your wages. One chicken costs 120,000 coupons. The salesmen  break out into a smile at the sight of Russian rubles.    The dolphinarium, once famous throughout the Union, is  empty.  The inhabitants of the dolphinarium were transferred to less  expensive premises "until times get better"--there is no money  to pay the workers and there is no one to marvel at the  dolphins--few people travel to Batumi, and the local residents  prefer bread to spectacles.    There are few Russians left in Batumi. People's faces are  stamped with gloom and doom. The government is praised for the  fact that there is no war, but otherwise living is hard. They  sell everything in order to eat. They staunchly tolerate  accusations from citizens of the indigenous nationality that  Russia is to blame for everything. The strong and healthy have  left. The weak and sick have remained.    The Ajarian militia frequently go around out of uniform;  they  are replaced by automatic weapons as a way of showing that a  person works for the power structures. Militiamen are paid a  great deal, with private merchants footing the bill. The  minister of internal affairs told them straightforwardly: If you  do not want the youth to get involved in rackets and robbery but  rather to preserve your peace, hand over the money. With these  funds they purchase rations, weapons, and uniforms.    The border with Turkey is guarded. Russian border guards  rule  out the possibility of the illegal passage of armed formations  across it. It is possible to bring a great deal from the other  side of the cordons, but almost nothing is taken out.    Only two of Batumi's industrial enterprises are  operating--the heating and electric power plant and the tea  packaging factory. The equipment in the shops is ancient.    The chief of the 400,000 Ajarians, Aslan Abashidze, wants to  reconcile Armenia with Azerbaijan and Abkhazia with the  authorities in Georgia. The peacemaker is forced to sleep with  his rations and stay alert--repeated attempts have been made on  his life. In a KGB solitary confinement cell sits a person who  was promised an immense sum for Abashidze's head in Tbilisi. But  he himself had to make a confession since he considered "Mr.  Aslan" to be a national hero.    Members of the Ajarian government travel throughout the  world  and they have a great deal about which the rank-and-file  resident can only dream. But at the same time they work 15 hours  a day. They say about themselves that their death sentence has  been signed in the event that Abashidze leaves--both opponents  in Batumi and ill-wishers in Tbilisi are thirsting for their  blood--and too many of them want to live a free and easy life  and have power in their hands. Simple people do not have time  for that. City dwellers are being fed by their soft-hearted  relatives from the villages. Ajarians dream about receiving  their wages in Russian rubles and they were glad when Georgia  entered the CIS. But certain of them still consider Russia to be  to blame for all their problems.    For peace and tranquility, even if it is under the roar of  automatic weapons, they thank Abashidze and Turkey, with which  they have good relations. Customs officials of the Ajarians and  their neighbors are living "in harmony."    There is almost no theft in Ajaria. Of the six motor  vehicles  driven away during the past year, four have been found. Is  everything tranquil in Batumi?</p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 3, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposal to adopt a new Rule 6.9 that would regulate the execution of ``solicited orders''; would set forth specific priority principles applicable to such orders; and would restrict trading by members and associated persons possessing knowledge of imminent undisclosed solicited transactions. On September 19, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to its proposal. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 13, 1994. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  One comment letter was received on the proposed rule change, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  to which the CBOE responded. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1 to the CBOE's proposal serves to make three minor revisions: (1) the first paragraph of Proposed Rule 6.9 is amended to make it clear that the rule includes solicitations by floor brokers who do not represent an original order but who become aware of the original order when it is announced in the trading crowd or otherwise; (2) Proposed Interpretation and Policy .04 is revised to reflect that only paragraph (a) of Rule 6.9 overrides the Exchange's crossing rule, Rule 6.74; and (3) Proposed Interpretation and Policy .05 is revised by deleting the introductory clause and adding an example to make it clear that the priority of an original order is in all cases governed by the priority principals of Rule 6.45.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letter from Michael L.

Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the CBOE's proposal is to regulate the execution of ``solicited'' transactions in options,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  options transactions having terms that are negotiated prior to the time the orders comprising the transaction are exposed to the trading crowd on the CBOE floor. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change also restricts trading in any class of an option, as well as trading in the underlying security or any ``related instrument,'' by CBOE members and their associated persons who have knowledge of an imminent solicited transaction in options of that class. This prohibition applies until all terms are disclosed to the trading crowd or until execution of the solicited transaction cannot reasonably be considered imminent given the passage of time since the transaction was agreed upon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rule 6.9 states: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A member or member organization representing an order respecting an option trading on the Exchange (an ``original order''), including a spread, combination, or straddle order as defined in Rule 6.53 and a stock-option order as defined in Rule 1.1(ii), may solicit a member or member organization or a non-member customer or broker-dealer (the ``solicited person'') to transact in-person or by order (a ``solicited order'') with the original order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the CBOE's rules are designed to promote order interaction in an open-outcry auction. For example, Rule 6.43 requires bids and offers to be made at the post by public outcry, and Rule 6.74 imposes specific order exposure requirements on floor brokers seeking to cross buy orders with sell orders. The CBOE believes that if the orders that comprise a solicited transaction are not suitably exposed to the order interaction process on the CBOE floor, the execution of such orders would be inconsistent with the open auction market principles governing the execution of orders on the CBOE's floor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rule 6.9 is intended to preserve the right that CBOE members currently enjoy the solicit orders in advance of submitting a proposed trade to the crowd, while at the same time assuring that original orders that are the subject of a solicitation are exposed to the auction market in a meaningful way. For instance, the proposed rule change would require a member representing an original order that is the subject of a solicitation to disclose the terms of the original order to the crowd before the original order can be executed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

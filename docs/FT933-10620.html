			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 3m offer for loss-making Etonbrook MR ALEX Perloff, the erstwhile rebel shareholder of Etonbrook Properties who staged a boardroom coup and took the chair himself, yesterday announced that companies in which he has interests had agreed a cash offer for Etonbrook. The two investment companies, Panther and Multitrust, already own 1.26m shares - some 32.9 per cent of the shares or 25.8 per cent of voting rights. They are offering 79p per share, a premium of 1.3 per cent over the 78p closing price on July 29, valuing the company at about Pounds 3.03m. Etonbrook yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.23m in the year to March 31 compared with profits of Pounds 181,214. It showed net current assets of about Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 5.99m). Losses per share were 34.3p compared with profits of 1.3p last time. There is no dividend. The new board has decided not to compensate the company's former directors and has made a provision towards costs that could arise from legal claims. Directors intend to investigate the original acquisition of properties from Palmerston Investment Trust, in particular a property bought for Pounds 3.5m in 1989 now valued at Pounds 250,000.</p>

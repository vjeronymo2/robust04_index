			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: 37% increase lifts Seacon to Pounds 2.3m Improved results in all its divisions enabled Seacon, the USM-traded transport and freight group, to lift turnover 6 per cent and pre-tax profit 37 per cent in the year ended September 30 1992. In view of the increase and to mark the group's confidence in the future  - Mr Chris Roth, chairman, thinks 'the recession has bottomed out'  - the dividend is raised from 4.2p to 5.1p with a final of 3.1p. Earnings per share improved from 12.05p to 15.92p. In percentage terms the largest profit increases were achieved by Seacon and Forestrans. At the end of the year sterling was devalued. However, for the bulk of the period the steady sterling/D-Mark relationship and declining fuel prices helped the fleet to be operated more efficiently. Mr Roth said profits for the first quarter of the current year were marginally down, after being affected by adverse weather conditions in October and again last month.</p>

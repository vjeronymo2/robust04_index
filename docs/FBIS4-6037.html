			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) started routine safety checks Monday at  nuclear power facilities in South Korea.    Two IAEA inspectors, A. Bodadilla Muchino of Mexico and I.  Acquah of Ghana, arrived in Seoul Sunday for a one-week  inspection of nuclear reactors in Kori, Uljin and Youngkwang, as  well as nuclear processing facilities.    They begin their official duties by examining documents and  records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing  them with on-the-spot field studies.    They will change the batteries and film of surveillance  equipment and seal some areas when necessary. Storage of used  nuclear fuel will also come under investigation.    Officials said the IAEA conducts routine inspections every  two months of the heavy-water reactor at Wolsung and every four  months of the other eight light-water reactors.    The inspectors will first visit the Seoul office of the  Korea  Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to study records on its  research reactor and management of nuclear fuel.    They will then tour the research center at Taeduk science  town and check KAERI's research facilities and manufacture of  heavy- water fuel as well as its processing of Australian  uranium.    They also plan to investigate KAERI's light-water fuel  manufacturing company to check its use and storage of uranium  imports.</p>

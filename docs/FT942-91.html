			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ideal Hardware poised for debut Ideal Hardware's crowded sales floor in its south London headquarters looks more like a foreign exchange trading room than a computer hardware distribution centre. In this hot-house atmosphere clusters of salesmen - paid on commission  - sit in front of computer screens and cut deals on the telephone with customers for data storage peripherals such as hard disks and optical storage devices. The company, founded in 1987 by Mr James Wickes, managing director and Mr Konrad Goess-Saurau, chairman, has grown into one of the UK's largest independent distributors of data storage products and is coming to market via a placing which is expected to value the group at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. The data storage market is one of the more secure areas of the fast growing computer market. According to Dataquest, the market research concern, the UK data storage market supplied by distributors will be worth more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 263m) this year, increasing to Dollars 700m in 1997. Ideal has between a 10 and 15 per cent share of the domestic market. Mr Wickes attributes the market growth to the increase in personal computer systems, the wider range and complexity of software products, processing performance gains and the growth of multimedia. By focusing on the data storage market and emphasising a high level of customer service - including providing its 2,500 customers with a CD-Rom-based interactive sales catalogue - Ideal has managed to build itself a strong market position. Its supplier list includes Toshiba, IBM, Digital, Compaq, Fujitsu and Conner while customers fall into three main groups - value-added resellers who build systems for large corporate clients, corporate resellers and systems integrators. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 1.58m) in the year to April 30 on turnover ahead 58 per cent to Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 45.5m). Operating profits increased almost threefold, bolstered by an improvement in net margins to almost 6 per cent. With Pounds 9.35m of cash in the balance sheet and no borrowings at the end of April, Ideal has no immediate need to raise substantial additional funds, although the new capital will strengthen a balance sheet which shows net assets of just Pounds 3m. However, the stock market debut will provide Mr Goess-Saurau, who owns a 26.2 per cent stake, with an exit. Ideal's three executive directors will retain more than half the expanded capital after flotation. The company plans to move to larger premises and expand its current 38-strong sales force substantially. The placing is sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney Securities. The issue will be priced on July 14.</p>

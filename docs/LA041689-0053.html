			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> ALL THE VACATION COMFORTS OF HOME  </P> <P> Designed for comfortable, casual indoor/outdoor living, this rustic vacation  home will complement any scenic setting, from mountains to shorelines. Two  decks and expansive areas of glass at the rear of the home take advantage of  the back-yard view. A stone fireplace, board-and-batten siding and cedar shakes  give the home rugged appeal.  </P> <P> Inside and out, this home has features rarely found in a recreational design.  The carport provides shade and shelter while loading and unloading the car, and  the garage offers secure storage space for boats and other equipment.  </P> <P> The interior is characterized by an open, multilevel floor plan that adds  interest and definition to the 1,158 square feet of living space. Including the  basement, the rooms are spread out over four levels. All the rooms, except the  kitchen, have vaulted ceilings, and cedar paneling lines the walls throughout.  </P> <P> The front entry deck leads to a short hallway, outlined by a railing, that  overlooks the dining/living room and kitchen. Two bedrooms and a bath make up  the first level, while the kitchen and combined living/dining room are four  steps below. An open staircase leads to the uppermost level containing a third  bedroom, a second bath and a private deck. A side entrance leads to the kitchen  and the stairway to the partial basement.  </P> <P> The open arrangement of the kitchen, dining and living rooms affords maximum  enjoyment of the view outside. An 8-foot breakfast bar between the kitchen and  living room provides seating for up to four people, with plenty of space left  over for a dining table. The cozy fireplace is flanked by windows and backed by  stone veneer extending to the peak of the ceiling. Sliding glass doors open to  the 10-by-36-foot deck.  </P> <P> This vacation home is designed with energy-efficient exterior walls.  </P> <P> Homestyles Plan Service offers a variety of specialized plan books, available  at newsstands nationwide as well as full-sized, complete construction  blueprints.

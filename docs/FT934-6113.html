			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / MPs urge tougher NHS controls Stronger systems of management control and accountability in the National Health Service were demanded by the Commons public accounts committee yesterday to avoid any recurrence of 'grave shortcomings' uncovered in the West Midlands region. The committee says in a report that at least Pounds 10m was wasted in the management of the West Midlands health authority's regionally-managed services organisation. The report says the essence of this mismanagement was that 'the responsible official, new to the NHS, was able to follow his own path, making a bonfire of the rules in the process, uncontrolled either by the regional health authority or regional senior management'. It says failings occurred at all levels of management. There was a serious failure by members of the health authority, and in particular by Sir James Ackers, then chairman, in their duty to secure the accountability of their regional management. The committee says the NHS management executive should have been aware of problems in the West Midlands region much earlier. Although the executive has taken subsequent action to tighten procedures, the committee says the present division of responsibilities between the executive and health authorities leaves 'too much scope for negotiation and argument'. It calls for clearer lines of control and accountability. The report says it is essential that non-executive authority members should be of sufficient calibre and experience to bring independent judgment to important decisions, while standards of 'honesty, openness and fair dealing' should play a large part in the selection, training and assessment of staff. West Midlands' regionally- managed services organisation was set up to handle a range of activities including supplies, computing, blood transfusion and ambulance services. The committee says the engagement of United Research Group, a consultancy, to advise on supplies activities 'fell well short of the standards expected from public officials' in several respects. It says it was 'astonished' that Mr Chris Watney, director of regionally-managed services, had been left to pursue an objective of privatising the supplies branch without the knowledge of the authority - which had no policy for such privatisation - or the NHS management executive. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, welcomed the report and said an enormous amount had already been done to address the issues it raised. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said it presented an 'astounding catalogue of corruption and incompetence'. Public Accounts Committee.

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CSUF GETS $301,000 BIOMEDICAL GRANT  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton has been awarded a $301,000 grant to start a program to  encourage more ethnic minorities to enter biomedical careers such as chemistry  and biology.  </P> <P> Beginning in January, eight students will work as research assistants to four  of the university's top research scientists involved in projects funded by the  National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.  </P> <P> Each student will be paid to work part time during the academic year and full  time for at least eight weeks during the summer. In addition, the program will  include tutorial assistance, a peer support group and a seminar program.  </P> <P> The National Institute of General Medical Services provided the grant to launch  the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program at Cal State Fullerton. The  director of the program will be Bruce Weber, professor of chemistry and a  former chairman of the chemistry department.  </P> <P> "Our hope is that one day there will be so many minorities working in medical  and research laboratories and teaching in universities that we will no longer  need this program," Weber said in a statement.  </P></p>

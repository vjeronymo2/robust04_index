			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of </F> Russian Unity and Accord and minister for nationalities affairs  and regional policy, by Vitaliy Yaroshevskiy; place and date not  given: "The USSR Will Not Be Restored by Pushing Buttons in  Parliament"]    [Text] [Yaroshevskiy] When visiting Moscow, Nursultan  Nazarbayev called into doubt the effectiveness of the CIS,  advancing the idea of the Eurasian Union. In purely  chronological terms, you made your proposal thereafter. At issue  is the "Eurasian confederative agreement." Did Nazarbayev's  pronouncements give it an impetus, or did this idea mature in  parallel?    [Shakhray] I take pleasure in yielding political priority to  Nursultan Abishevich; I respect him as a politician who knows  how to take a long-term view. As far as the legal,  organizational aspect of the issue is concerned, I prepared the  draft of a confederative agreement by April 1992. Everyone  understood that the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent  States in December 1991 amounted to preventing a spontaneous  breakup of the USSR, which was fraught with great trouble, the  beginning of integration on new principles, along new lines,  rather than an act in divorce proceedings.    The thrust of my draft is not to disband the CIS but rather  to create a confederative nucleus of three to four countries  within the Commonwealth of Independent States.    The topic of a confederation was a component of our election  platform. In April 1994 I revisited this idea, proposing this  time a specific draft confederative agreement which I released  and officially introduced in the State Duma.    To me this topic also has a moral dimension in conjunction  with the charges concerning my participation in the Belovezha  negotiations. Incidentally, on the issue of breaking up the USSR.    The USSR was a mighty state, was it not? Of course, it was a  nuclear power, a world power. However, another question is also  proper: Could a truly mighty state be broken up by three  persons--Yeltsin, Shushkevich, and Kravchuk--in the woods, under  KGB supervision? The answer is obvious--it could not!    Two points are fundamental to me: The Belovezha agreement  was  not the beginning of the collapse of the USSR, but the  completion of a quite protracted and tragic period of the  destruction of the state; the formation of the CIS was the first  stop on a long path toward economic and political integration.  It is impossible to restore the Soviet Union by pushing buttons  in the parliament. There is only one path toward the  future--from the CIS toward the Confederation as a voluntary  union on an equal footing with Eurasian states on the principles  of economic integration. There is no alternative.    The confederation would continue the political sovereignty  and independence of the states belonging to it and would be  created to achieve common goals. For the states of the former  Union, this is primarily economics, our Common Market if you  will, in which after a while the free movement of goods,  services, and capital will be guaranteed.    Collective security and the coordination of certain foreign  policy actions would be the second goal of the confederation.  The preservation of minimum sociocultural relations, insurance,  retirement benefits, and so on would be the third goal.    It appears to me that the idea of integration is even  somewhat overripe now. The elections in Ukraine and Moldavia  [Moldova] indicate this.    [Yaroshevskiy] At present, everybody is "fixated" on the  idea  of reunification--national-chauvinists, fascists, and democrats  alike.... Nonetheless, there are two approaches--frantic and  balanced. What is your vision of the position of the democrats,  of the democratic movement?    [Shakhray] The destruction of the Union is a grave  psychological trauma associated not only with the loss of  territory or the fact that 25 million Russians have ended up  beyond the borders of Russia. For many people this is also a  personal tragedy because the Russian people, Russians, always  perceived themselves within a specific state. This is, if you  will, the sense of great statehood. It is possible to exploit  the self-awareness of the Russians and restore the one and  indivisible Rus within the borders of 1975, 1913, or any other  year.    This is the forcible and bloody path of Vladimir Volfovich.    Voluntary integration on an equal footing is the second  path.  The confederation is precisely a legal form for such integration.    [Yaroshevskiy] Your idea of a confederative structure  appeals  to common sense. The ideas of, say, Zhirinovskiy and his ilk are  designed for emotions. Are you confident that common sense will  prevail this time? Are you not afraid of major interethnic  clashes? Many people have a preference for feelings; they could  not care less about what the confederation is.    [Shakhray] You are absolutely right; this is why I say that  we are even being late with the confederation proposal because  time and painstaking work are necessary for common sense to win  out whereas a fraction of a second suffices for an emotional  outburst. However, we should keep it in mind that an attempt at  forcible integration would be yet another attempt to turn the  Russian people inside out.    [Yaroshevskiy] Each historical period brings forth its own  political leaders. There was a parade of sovereignties, there  were people who exploited this very social condition. The  spontaneous craving for unification is strong at present. Are we  right to surmise that the forthcoming replacement of the current  political leaders is predetermined by the striving of the people  toward some kind of community?    [Shakhray] If upwards of 80 percent of the population are in  favor of integration but politicians are against it, such  politicians will not have a future. Their stubbornness is  fraught with conflicts, societal breakups, and clashes.    Let us conduct a referendum on unification in Ukraine,  Belorussia [Belarus], Russia, and Kazakhstan. I think that not  one sober-minded person has doubts about the outcome of such a  referendum. Perhaps we should not spend tens of billions to hold  it, but actually solve the problem of integration.    [Yaroshevskiy] Could you give us examples of those in favor  of and against your proposals?    [Shakhray] The response of political leaders is known in  part: Nazarbayev supported it; Akayev supported it; the largest  faction in the Belarussian parliament welcomes the idea of the  confederation. We have proposed to establish an international  group for refining our draft. The Party of Russian Unity and  Accord is appealing not only to the leaders of states but also  to the public, political parties, movements and deputies who  come out in favor of integration on the basis of common sense,  on the basis of voluntary participation and equal rights. That  is to say, we are trying to create a critical mass that will  prevent violence under the guise of unification from spreading  like a forest fire.    [Yaroshevskiy] How will the State Duma respond?    [Shakhray] The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia]  will  come out categorically against, and I will view this as proof  that we have taken a very serious and timely step.    I think that Russia's Choice and Apple will take a  moderately  favorable position. They will respond favorably because no  sober-minded politician will come out against integration or  civic peace. They will respond with moderation because there are  objective difficulties and obstacles on the path toward  integration. I think that support can be expected from a segment  of the Communist faction and some agrarians, the New Regional  Policy group. We hope to gain support from other associations,  too. Therefore, there should be more allies than adversaries. In  all of this, I am prepared to give up the authorship if the name  "Shakhray" irritates someone. This is why I propose to establish  a working group. Let the idea itself work.</p>

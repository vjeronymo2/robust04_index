			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong year end limits Dutch office group deficit An unexpectedly strong performance in the fourth quarter helped cushion a decline in full-year results at Oce-van der Grinten, the Dutch office equipment maker. Net profit, which had fallen by 42 per cent in the first three quarters, rose 25.6 per cent in the final quarter ended November 30. This limited the fall in full-year net profit to Fl 62.2m (Dollars 32.2m), a decline of 28.9 per cent compared with 1992/93. Oce, the first large Dutch company to report final figures for 1993, plans an unchanged dividend of Fl 2.25 in spite of the drop in profit. Sales rose slightly in the fourth quarter but fell by 4 per cent to Fl 2.63bn in 1993/94. Sales in North America rose particularly strongly, accounting for 19 per cent of total sales compared with 17 per cent the year before. The sharp improvement in the fourth quarter exceeded analysts' expectations, and Oce's shares gained more than 3 per cent to close up Fl 2.40 at Fl 76.00. Mr Harry Pennings, chairman, predicted a further improvement in 1994/95. Oce is a producer of copiers and printers as well as of plotters for engineering systems. The fourth-quarter recovery was due not so much to improved economic conditions as to the launch of new products, internal restructuring and the pruning of jobs, Mr Penning said. Another factor was currency stability in the fourth quarter.</p>

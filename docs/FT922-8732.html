			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Priorities and purpose at the heart of capitalism: The Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised companies' narrow focus on shareholders. Charles Handy calls for a shift in thinking What is a company for? The question sits uneasily at the heart of capitalism. Until recently, with communism and centrally planned economies as our common opponents, we were not pressed to provide an answer. To many reared in the traditions of Anglo-American business, the answer anyway was clear - 'to enhance shareholder value', with all that implied for efficiency, customer service, shrewd investment and personnel policies. The capitalist world, however, has lost its common enemy and must now look more closely at itself. The countries newly emerging from socialism are not entirely happy with all they see of capitalism. To them it is not self-evident that what is good for some shareholders is necessarily good for the rest of society. They also see there are different versions of capitalism: Japanese, American, German, British. As the world of business becomes more and more global, these different traditions of capitalism bump up against each other. We not only have to learn about them, we need to learn from them because they begin to close towards each other as companies compete and combine. Working on different assumptions will be untenable in the long term. Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, has taken the point. In an article in the January edition of Bungei Shinju, the political and economic journal, he suggests that Japan's competitiveness has been achieved by keeping margins and prices low over a long time in a constant search for volume to provide the cash-flow. This has, however, meant skimping the other stakeholders in favour of the customer. The average pay-out ratio, for instance, was 30 per cent in Japan in 1990 compared with 66 per cent for the average British company and 54 per cent for US ones. Japanese employees worked 2,159 hours on average in 1989 compared with 1,638 in France and only 1,546 in Germany. Mr Morita argues that neither the world nor Japanese society will tolerate these differences much longer. Japan, he says, must fashion a new corporate attitude, rebalancing stakeholder interests and going some way to meet the west. We, on our part, may have to do the same but in the other direction. If we don't, we may lose competitively. More of the earned surplus needs to go back to the customer by way of lower margins and lower return on projects. An open and tempting share market will also lure new owners for Anglo-Saxon assets from overseas without any corresponding opportunities in their more closed markets. A change to foreign ownership can often be beneficial in the short term, but if too much of Britain ends up as an offshore manufacturing subsidiary subject to the whims of outside owners, the risks are obvious. We may, therefore, start to look at our shareholders rather differently, and more as other countries do, as financiers rather than as owners. Satisfying these financiers then becomes a requirement not a purpose. To turn shareholder needs into a purpose runs the risk of confusing means with ends. But this is a risk we seek to avoid by saying that shareholders' needs are actually a yardstick for all other purposes. The danger in doing this is that we undersell the real purpose of the business, which is to provide quality goods and services to customers and quality lives and work to its people. One cannot continue to do that without keeping one's financiers happy at the same time. If they are not happy they will blow the whistle, warn and then, if necessary, move the management before the marketplace removes the business. Whistle-blowing is their function, not the indirect management of the business. Ownership is a misleading concept in other ways too. It suggests that a company is a commodity to be traded and that its people are commodities too. Too often that is exactly what happens, because in the Anglo-American stockmarkets financiers have that power. Should they have that power? They do not, after all, have the balancing responsibilities of ownership. Because of the different ownership patterns of Japanese and Continental companies the casual investor does not have the same power as his counterparts in New York or London. The financiers in Japan and on the Continent, therefore, are more like guardians, keeping a watchful eye, but not jumping ship just because there is a torn sail. Akio Morita called for a change in Japan's corporate attitude and suggested that the big companies should lead the way. There are encouraging signs that that is happening in Britain. More and more companies are formally listing their priorities, often putting customers and employees ahead of shareholders in the pecking order of stakeholders and taking pains to educate the stockmarket about their long-term strengths and plans. Now, too, that the investing institutions own two-thirds of the equity of British businesses, they are effectively locked in and must become guardians (though not owners) rather than traders. Some company chairmen are cautiously lowering their real term dividends without upsetting their share price in a more sophisticated market. Share option schemes are beginning to be designed to reward long-term performance by managers rather than acting as short-term cash bonuses. We need to go farther faster. We need ways to put numbers on people's skills, which are an increasingly important element in companies' wealth-creating capacity, and on other forms of intellectual property. Intangible assets already outweigh the tangible assets on the balance sheets of many advertising agencies, consultants, publishers and architects. They probably do so in most businesses, although this fact usually only shows up during contested takeovers. Accountants, in other words, need to turn their gaze on the future and measure it. If they will not do so, management should. We can no longer shelter behind shareholder value as a synonym for corporate purpose. In business, as in life, we all need 'a purpose beyond ourselves' to feel useful, worthwhile and good about ourselves. Companies today are not like they were in Victorian times - properties with tangible assets worked by hands whose time owners bought. Business today depends largely on intellectual property, which resides inalienably in the hearts and heads of individuals. Companies have to be re-conceptualised. They are communities with members, communities which need customers, suppliers, financiers and community support if they are to survive and prosper in the interests of all. We do not need to change company law to create this new idea of the company, but we do need to change the way we talk and the way we count. That way we will start to change the way we think, and then the way we act. The author is Visiting Professor at the London Business School and the author of The Age of Unreason.</p>

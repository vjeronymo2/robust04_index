			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- In the first five months  of this year, China's airlines have maintained steady increases  in the number of passengers and the amount of cargo transported.    Yan Zhixiang, deputy-director of the Civil Aviation  Administration of China, said today that from January to May  this year, domestic airlines carried 15.28 million passengers  and 314,000 tons of cargo, up 19.2 percent and 19.8 percent,  respectively, on the same period last year.    Yan said that so far this year the record of air safety has  been generally good, with no transport flight accidents. Flight  punctuality and service quality have been improved to some  extent, and flight delays have been markedly cut.    Yan reiterated that major attention should be paid to air  safety. All airlines should scientifically arrange their flights  according to their own capabilities; examinations will be  regularly arranged for air crews. Those who break the rules  will be severely punished.</p>

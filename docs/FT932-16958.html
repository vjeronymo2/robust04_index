			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome faces new pressure THE SHARE price of pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was hit in early trading by concern raised by an impending article in The Lancet, the UK premier medical journal. The article apparently relates to an extensive trial of Wellcome's key anti-Aids drug Retrovir, or AZT, and was expected by the market to have a negative effect. In particular, the article seems likely to undermine the long-held hope that Retrovir can be used for carriers of the disease as well as Aids sufferers. Analysts estimate that there are some 1.5m carriers in the developed world compared with 150,000 sufferers. Analysts said there was a further knock from a presentation in Philadelphia by SmithKline Beecham, which gave research details of a rival to Wellcome's main drug Zovirax, the anti-herpes product. The shares were off 28 at worst but, partly because they had already fallen from above 900p since the figures last week and partly because of the very tight security surrounding the article ahead of publication today, the price stabilised. The stock ended 19 lower at 743p on turnover of 4.9m.</p>

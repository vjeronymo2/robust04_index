			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan fund or loan consortium shall have in place a legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits it to recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP subsidy provided to the project in the event of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the AHP requirements, and the applicant shall have in place a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that permits it to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such amount recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor or owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(3)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule also provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the applicant shall have in place, if the Bank agrees and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such agreement is legally enforceable, a four-party agreement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes the Bank, the applicant, the loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium, and the sponsor or owner, that permits the Bank to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover from the sponsor or owner the full amount of the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy provided to the project in the event of the sponsor's or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the AHP requirements, upon written request by the Bank,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant, loan fund or loan consortium, sponsor or owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. Required Annual AHP Contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.18 of the proposed rule requires each Bank to fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its AHP annually in accordance with the formula set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 10(j)(5) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(5). Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.18 is consistent with &sect;960.10 of the Board's existing AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, except for minor wording changes and deletion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language regarding required funding in 1990 through 1993 which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer necessary. See 12 CFR 960.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, proposed &sect;960.18 provides that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall fund its AHP in accordance with the following formula:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) In 1994, the greater of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 6 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That Bank's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of an aggregate of $75 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In 1995 and each year thereafter, the greater of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 10 percent of the Bank's net earnings for the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) That Bank's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> share of an aggregate of $100 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be contributed in total by the Banks, such proration being made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of the net earnings of the Banks for the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``net earnings of a Bank'' is defined in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.1. The definition has been revised from the definition in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track its definition in section 10(j)(8) of the Act. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.1(j); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> N. Temporary Suspension of AHP Contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.19 of the proposed rule sets forth the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing temporary suspensions by Banks of their required annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP contributions. A number of revisions have been made to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section in the Board's existing AHP regulation in order to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately track the language in section 10(j)(6) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning this section and to provide greater clarity. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.11; 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Application for Temporary Suspension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

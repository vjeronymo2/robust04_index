			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--Spokesmen and presidents of parliamentary  blocs and committees today hold a "crucial meeting" to study  allegations by Minister of Health 'Abd-al-Rahim Malhas that a  good quantity of food and medicine sold in the country do not  meet standards and specifications.    Acting Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament 'Abd  al-Razzaq al-Tubayshat called the meeting after some deputies  demanded that the House hold an emergency session to discuss the  minister's statements that first appeared in a weekly tabloid  Thursday [20 January].    About 30 other deputies demanded that the House hold a  general discussion of the government's regulations on the entry  of food and medicine to the market.    Dr. al-Tubayshat told the JORDAN TIMES Sunday that the  meeting would agree on the steps that the House would take to  investigate the minister's allegations and whether an  extraordinary session will be held. He said the issue would be  on the agenda of the house when it meets Wednesday.    Parliamentary sources said the House was divided on whether  a  parliamentary investigation committee should be set up to look  into the minister's statements that appeared in a lengthy  interview in SHIHAN Arabic-language weekly.    The sources said that some deputies wanted to hear the  government's response to the minister's statements before a  course of action is decided, with some arguing that the issue  should be handled by the judiciary.    "The issues addressed by the minister, if proven true, means  that the health of people is in grave danger. They point to  real financial, administrative and political corruption that  require the government to take immediate, firm and fundamental  measures. They also require that the representatives of the  nation support the minister," said 30 deputies in a request to  hold a special session to discuss the minister's allegations.    Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that there was a  deficiency in laws governing the sale of food and medicine in  the market, pointing to the need of laws that would protect  consumers.    He charged that a "mafia" of food and drugs merchants were  violating the few existing laws that regulate the distribution  of food and medicine. He said these merchants were resisting  the new regulations the Ministry of Health has introduced to  ensure that food and drugs sold in the market meet certain  standards and specifications.    SHIHAN quoted Dr. Malhas as saying that a good quantity of  food and medicine that reach the market "is the garbage of the  industrialised world and is unfit (for human consumption)."    But Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that the weekly  "blew (his remarks) out of proporition." He said SHIHAN  "sensationalised" his statements.    President of Pharmacists Union Husam al-Din Mismar Sunday  denounced the Minister's allegations and urged the government  and the House to investigate remarks he made "against  pharmacists."    In a front-page newspaper advertisement, Mr. Mismar sought  to  assure people about the safety and efficiency of drugs sold in  the country.    Mr. Mismar, a former director at the pharmacy and medicine  control directorate at the Ministry of Health, said the  directorate examines and registers all drugs before they go into  the market.    Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the ministry  officials who are supposed to inspect drugs are pharmacists who  own private pharmacies, pointing to a conflict of interest.    Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy Muhammad 'Addub  al-Zabn said that all drugs that go to the market were examined  by specialised committees at the Ministry of Health.    "The Ministry of Health is a scientific institution and it  can never allow the importation of medicines unless they meet  certain specifications," said Dr. al-Zabn.    Dr. al-Zabn said Dr. Malhas should have asked Parliament or  the government to initiate laws if he saw a need for such laws.    The pharmacy and drug control directorate was established in  the early 1980s by the then minister of health, Dr. Zuhayr  Malhas.    Conflict between the ministry and the phamacists' union goes  back to 1987 when Zayd Hamzah, then minister of health, insisted  that pharmacies be attended by registered pharmacists.    Dr. Hamzah also banned the sale of medicine without  prescriptions, except for "over the counter" drugs.    Informed sources said the ban was introduced to limit the  sales of addictive drugs.    In his interview with SHIHAN, Dr. Malhas said that "pressure  was applied," to overrule a Higher Court of Justice verdict that  said pharmacies should be run by pharmacists in whose names they  are registered.    The council for the interpretation of laws has overruled the  court's verdict on the basis of a 1975 ruling that says  pharmacists should not be in charge of their own pharmacies.    Dr. al-Zabn said that food shipments were also examined by  specialised committees before being allowed into the country.    Other sources familiar with the situation, however, said  that  the inspection of food was the responsibility of various  government ministries and departments and that that allows for  confustion and inefficiency.    One source said that there were previous attempts to have  one  agency responsible for the examination of food "but  unfortunately there was a power struggle (among the various  bodies) and the effort never succeeded."    Sources pointed to the controversy over cooking fat  shipments  that did not meet specifications but were sold in the market in  1989 as evidence of the inefficiency of some of the departments  entrusted with inspecting food sold in the Kingdom.    "Only a thorough investigation can end the controversy  created by the minister's statement," said a source familiar  with the issue on the condition of anonymity.    "What the minister said is dangerous," he said. "it has to  be  investigated."    "Parliament is taking the matter very seriously. It will  take the proper action on it," said Dr al-Tubayshat.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Brussels hits back at fresh US threat of trade sanctions THE EC yesterday attacked the 'perverse and overtly discriminatory Buy American Act, and the host of other US discriminatory procurement rules', in an angry response to US threats of trade sanctions against EC government procurement legislation. On Friday, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, set a January 1 deadline for sanctions against the EC, unless it agrees to rule out discrimination against non-EC suppliers of equipment for telecommunications and electrical utilities. The European Commission said the decision was 'regrettable' and that the disputed clause of its legislation made 'absolutely no distinction between EC and US suppliers'. The directive, part of the move to a barrier-free internal market, was approved by EC ministers in September 1990 and is due to come into effect on January 1. This latest EC-US row is bound to raise the temperature in negotiations on government procurement under Gatt. The EC says it has formally offered to outlaw all discrimination in public procurement, and claims the US is holding up progress because it will not grant equal access to US markets for EC suppliers. 'Progress in this field will come from removal of obstacles by both sides, not from adding to the existing array of American discriminatory measures,' the Commission said yesterday. The relevant article of the EC directive applies only to third countries which have not ensured 'comparable and effective access' to their own markets. 'The US is being remarkably cheeky,' an official from one EC member state said yesterday. 'We only put this clause in because the US telecommunications market is closed.' The clause allows EC governments to reject any tenders for supply contracts where the non-EC content of the products supplied exceeds 50 per cent of total value. It says in border-line cases, preference should be given to tenders where over half the products are made in the EC, even if the price is up to 3 per cent higher than that of competing tenders.</p>

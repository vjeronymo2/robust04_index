			<p>BFN     [Text] The Muslim Brotherhood has issued a statement  reiterating its opposition to the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and  last week's signing ceremony in Cairo for the commencement of  its implementation. In its statement, the Muslim Brotherhood  said: "It has become evident that the PLO has given all the  required concessions. The PLO continued to concede right up to  the last moment before signing. The PLO has linked itself to  the Zionist entity by accepting self-rule. Hence, the PLO has  become a tool of the Zionist hegemony in Palestine and the Arab  and Islamic region."    Continuing, the Muslim Brotherhood said: "The Cairo  Agreement is not binding on the Muslim brothers, the issue of  Palestine is the responsibility of all Muslims, and the  liberation of the holy land in Palestine is the duty of every  male and female Muslim. Furthermore, the Cairo agreement does  not achieve the minimum of the just demands of the Palestinian  people, because the basic issues are still pending, including  the issues of the displaced, refugees, holy Jerusalem,  settlements, and the setting up of the Palestinian state on all  the Palestinian soil."    The Muslim Brotherhood called on the Arab and Islamic people  to support the Palestinian people's jihad by continuing the  complete boycott of the Zionist entity and reviving the jihad  spirit among the youth.</p>

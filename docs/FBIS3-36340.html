Kannik stressed the fact that the obligation taken by NATO  in  the initiative to hold consultations with new partners was  "especially important for Estonia because of a possible  political crisis in the near neighbourhood".    "Estonian Government considers Partnership for Peace a  positive programme and a great step ahead. We understand that  it is a part of a process of becoming a full member of NATO,"  Kannik said.    Head of the NATO mission, permanent representative of  Germany  in NATO Hermann F. von Richthofen told the press conference that  as NATO was not a closed system, no obstacles were laid to any  states in joining it, adding, however, that participation in the  Partnership for Peace programme did not mean a soon membership  of NATO, but was still a step towards wider and closer  cooperation.    Kannik said that in the report to be made to NATO as to the  Estonian standpoints on aims of the Partnership for Peace  programme and means necessary to participate in the programme,  Estonia will make a proposition to hold a part of the joint  exercises of the Partnership for Peace programme in Estonia to  reduce cost of participation in the programme. At the same time  NATO aid to founding the Baltic peacekeeping battalion was not  out of question, he added.</p>

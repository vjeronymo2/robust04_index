			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO REPORT A MALFUNCTIONING TRAFFIC SIGNAL  </P> <P> It is frustrating. There you are sitting at a traffic signal, waiting for it to  change. You watch what seems to be a thousand cars whiz by, and still no  change. You go into reverse and run over the electronic loop, hoping to  activate the signal in your favor, but still no change. You get so irritated  you get out of the car and go press the crosswalk button.  </P> <P> And still no change.  </P> <P> You finally give up and whip through a nearby gas station in disgust.  </P> <P> Don't let it end there, because you just might find yourself sitting at that  particular signal again.  </P> <P> In every city of the county, motorists can report malfunctioning and mistimed  traffic signals. The county has a traffic engineering division to do the same  for signals in the unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> Caltrans will respond to complaints about signals on state-maintained roads  such as Pacific Coast Highway, Coast Highway, Imperial Highway, Laguna Canyon  Road and most of Beach Boulevard.  </P> <P> The number of complaint calls about traffic signals varies considerably from  city to city, from 50 a week in Newport Beach to one or two a month in the  smaller cities, traffic officials say.  </P> <P> Complaints range from seemingly mistimed signals to non-working left-turn  arrows; from an out-of-whack rotationto a light that has gone out altogether  (this last is the most dangerous situation of all, traffic officials say.)  </P> <P> The fault does not always lie in the machinery, however. In some cases, the  motorist failed to prompt the light by not running over the electronic loop in  the road.  </P> <P> Buena Park traffic engineer Herb Vargas said that there was one case in which  the city resorted to painting the electronic loop so that motorists could see  where to run over it.  </P> <P> Then there are the complaints from drivers who think they were kept waiting far  too long at a particular signal only to have a field check show that the signal  is functioning normally.  </P> <P> "Let's just say we get a number of calls that don't check out to be what was  reported," said Ron Garrett, traffic engineering technician in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Although many cities have central computer systems to monitor signals, through  the electronic loop system, traffic officials must still rely on the public to  report many problems.  </P> <P> Here is a list of phone numbers to call to report mistimed and malfunctioning  signals. You must be able to provide the place, the approximate length of time  you waited there and the direction you were driving.  </P> <P> Number has a 714 area code unless otherwise noted.  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> Traffic engineering division, 999-5183.  </P> <P> Brea  </P> <P> Traffic engineering division, 990-7742.  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P> <P> Traffic engineer Herb Vargas, 521-9900.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P> <P> Traffic engineering department, 754-5185.  </P> <P> Cypress  </P> <P> Traffic engineer, 229-6750.  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P> <P> Public Works Department, 248-3560.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P> <P> Traffic engineering, 965-4400.  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> Engineering Department, 738-6845.  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P> <P> Traffic engineer, 741-5190.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Traffic engineering division, 536-5431.  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Traffic engineer Rob Hughes, 724-7648.  </P> <P> La Habra  </P> <P> Engineering Department,  </P> <P> (213) 905-9720.  </P> <P> La Palma  </P> <P> Public Works Department, 523-1140.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P> <P> Municipal services, 497-0706.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P> <P> Call 643-7000 and give the information to the receptionist.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P> <P> Call City Hall at 827-8670 and ask for the city engineer.

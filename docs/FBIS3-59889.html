			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Journalists also asked a question that stood apart  from the main point of discussion at the briefing held by  Ukrainian foreign affairs and foreign trade ministers.  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko was asked to comment on the  situation that has taken shape after the United States of  America refuted yesterday's statement by President Kravchuk.  Here is what the minister replied.    [Begin Zlenko recording] The only thing that I can tell you  is that following the decision about START I ratification by the  Supreme Council, the Ukrainian foreign minister has undertaken  extremely active efforts to resolve conditions and reservations  put forward in the resolution. I could tell you about the whole  range of measures that the ministry has taken over this short  stretch of time. They include negotiations with the Russian and  American delegations and trilateral consultations recently held  by Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. In other words, we  are currently looking for approaches to settle the issues  connected with the destruction of nuclear weapons, as stipulated  by the Supreme Council resolution. This is why I would like to  say that there is nothing here to refute. The fact is that the  negotiations were held and the search for solutions to this  problem is under way -- including the participation of such  great nuclear states as Russia and the United States of America.</p>

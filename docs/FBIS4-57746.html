			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] Arnulfist Party [PA] President Mireya Moscoso de  Gruber reported that the PA National Directorate has decided to  accept the resignation of Carlos Sousa Lennox, who accepted a  post in the Ernesto Perez Balladares administration, rather than  expell him from the party.    Sousa Lennox, current director of the National Association  of  Cattlemen (Anagan), will head the Agricultural Development  Ministry (Mida) as of 1 September when Perez Balladares'  presidential term begins.    Moscoso de Gruber added: "Sousa Lennox believes agricultural  interests are more important than the interests of the PA, so he  resigned."    Perez Balladares offered the PA two ministries, but the  Arnulfist leadership forbade its members from occupying posts in  the incoming government and threatened to expel them from the  party if they did.    According to Gruber, Sousa Lennox's resignation did not  puzzle or surprise her and she accepted it without demanding an  explanation. The PA leader said: "He was offered the ministry,  and we knew he would accept and resign from the party. That is  why I personally accepted his resignation without delay."    Sousa Lennox presented his resignation at the beginning of  the week, saying that the interests of the agricultural sector  and of the group of producers he represents are more important  than his party's zeal.</p>

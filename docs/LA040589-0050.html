			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'AGE OF AIDS' LOOKS BEYOND EPIDEMIC'S STEREOTYPES  </P> <P> As the opening shot in a weeklong salvo of programs on KCET Channel 28 about  the multiple dimensions of the AIDS crisis, "America in the Age of AIDS" (at 8  tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50) deliberately removes  the epidemic from its falsely perceived sociological ghetto. Once a disease  that hit almost solely gay men and intravenous drug users, AIDS has traveled to  middle America.  </P> <P> Though it is virtually impossible (and probably wrong) to characterize any town  or city as typically American, this KCTS-Seattle production, hosted by Linda  Ellerbee, adopts Ft. Wayne, Ind., as just that city. Though predominantly white  and family-oriented, it also has poor black neighborhoods and a small gay  community. Despite being deep in the heartland, Ft. Wayne would inevitably be  confronted by AIDS.  </P> <P> Even more crucially (and this is where the cliched AIDS cobwebs are swept  away), Ft. Wayne is shown as being full of sexually active teen-agers who may  or may not take the disease seriously. This is complicated by tradition-bound  parents who believe that frank education on sex and disease in the classroom is  out of line. Besides clearly showing that no sector of Ft. Wayne -- and, by  inference, the country -- is immune to AIDS' threat, "America in the Age of  AIDS" shows how this child-parent complication has its parallel in every other  community affected by the virus.  </P> <P> Besides being most affecting as a document of personal testimony -- that of  housewife Bea Harris, for instance, whose brother was one of the city's first  AIDS victims -- this report subtly depicts an unresolved, ongoing drama: Will  our innate fear triumph? Or will our innate humanity fulfill its  potential?ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

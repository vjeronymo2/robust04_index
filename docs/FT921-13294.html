			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Bank workers walk out across Germany GERMAN banking workers walked out of branches and financial institutions all over Germany yesterday in support of their claim for a 10.5 per cent pay increase this year, against an employer offer of 4.5 per cent. However, retail banking was not noticeably disrupted by yesterday's warning strikes. Negotiations are due to resume today. Steel unions and employers, meanwhile, struggled to close the one percentage point gap between claim and offer in what were described as 'last ditch' talks to avoid industrial action. Officials from the steel union said before yesterday's talks, called ahead of a strike ballot planned for Sunday, that further progress had been made since last week's failed negotiating round. At that stage management was offering a package worth 5.2 per cent, while the union had offered to reduce its official 10.5 per cent demand to just over 6 per cent. In other negotiations, a 10 per cent claim from shoe industry workers was sent to arbitration after talks were formally broken off. Journalists joined the pay round with a demand for 11 per cent, while coal miners, who are faced with mass redundancies in the next few years, resumed negotiations on an unspecific claim 'in line with inflation'. Despite some harsh words from the union side, and further warnings of the impact on inflation and the availability of jobs from Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, there was no tangible increase in tension. Unions representing 100,000 chemical industry workers in eastern Germany yesterday accepted a two-stage pay increase worth 20 per cent, which will bring wages up to 65 per cent of west German levels.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART OF UNDERSTATEMENT LEAVES HIM WONDERING  </P> <P> My ribs still ache from laughing at the Morning Briefing column (March 6)  discussing the $1.3-million prize of this summer's Tour de France. "Not bad for  pedaling a bike across a couple of hills" was the last line.  </P> <P> By that standard: Joe Montana and Jerry Rice played "catch" in the Super Bowl;  Kirk Gibson's game-winning shot in the World Series was "batting practice at  the local high school," and the L.A. Marathon was a "stroll to the local  tanning salon."  </P> <P> ROBERT MEEKER  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever In retrospect it is surprising that a solid and well spread business such as Unilever managed to outperform so sharply in the dizzy stock market conditions of the late 1980s. Amid a welter of provisions, chopped dividends and forecasts of unending recession, however, it seems natural that its class should shine through. Yesterday's 14 per cent rise in second-quarter profits not only left the shares 10p higher at 953p; these better-than-expected results put the price back within 2 per cent of its all-time high. Unilever, to be sure, can put much of the gain down to increased efficiency and a lower interest charge. Borrowings have come down by Pounds 900m over the past 12 months on the back of healthy disposal proceeds and a tight working capital squeeze. There were also special factors in the company's favour, such as the right weather for ice cream sales and a relatively indifferent comparative quarter in the US. On the other hand, the profit was struck after an estimated Pounds 20m of exceptional restructuring charges - a heavier burden than this time a year ago - while better volumes were achieved in most parts of the globe. Consumer products generally fared better in this respect than the company's industrial interests. On this showing, Unilever is still set to make around Pounds 1.95bn for the year, which puts the shares on a multiple roughly 10 per cent higher than the market average. Given that Cadbury Schweppes is on a premium of more than 20 per cent to the market - albeit reflecting slightly more exciting growth prospects - Unilever's rating does not seem excessive.</p>

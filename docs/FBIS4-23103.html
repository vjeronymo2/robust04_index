			<p>Chinese      Communist Party General Secretary and President Jiang  Zemin and Politburo member and PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen  have affirmed Beijing's opposition to the imposition of sanctions  against North Korea in China's most authoritative statements on  the sanctions issue to date.  Reflecting China's longstanding  position on the DPRK nuclear issue, Jiang, according to a 10 June  Xinhua account of his interview with Japan's NHK television the  same day, told NHK commentator Hatsuhisa Takashima that China  "does not approve of sanctions."  Sanctions, he warned, "do not  help" the situation and can only "escalate" it and lead to  "consequences which none of the parties is willing to see."  Calling for "all parties concerned" to take "active measures to  avoid intensifying the crisis," Jiang said that China believes  that "dialogue and consultations" are the only "effective way" to  resolve the problem.  On 8 June, Qian delivered the same message  to the visiting Maltese foreign minister (Xinhua, 8 June), a  message' he repeated on the 9th in talks with the South Korean  foreign minister (Xinhua, 9 June).

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (6): Enigmas in the east - In the ex-Soviet bloc, N-power retains a role SEVEN years after Chernobyl, it seems strange that nuclear power is growing in importance in Russia. In contrast to the US, where alternative technologies using gas and clean-coal combustion are driving power sector expansions, Russia remains wedded to its nuclear industry. According to a survey by Siemens, nuclear power will apparently account for 18.7 per cent of a greatly increased demand by 2010, compared with 10.9 per cent in 1990. In March, the Russian Ecology Ministry even gave approval for the finish of the 60 per cent complete unit No 5 at Kursk, 500 kms south of Moscow. Kursk No 5 is an RBMK reactor, similar in design to those of Chernobyl. It has, apparently, been thoroughly modernised and enhanced with new safety features. Chernobyl, of course, is in the Ukraine, whose people, along with those of Belarus, suffered most from the disaster. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, recently revealed that 11m people had been treated in some way for effects of the radiation. Yet the remaining plants on the site are still in operation. The Ukrainian local authorities cannot afford to shut them down, while the station managing director, Nykola Sorokin, believes that they have been sufficiently improved so as to be substantially safer than many other plants in the former Soviet Union. Worries continue about the cracking sarcophagus over the ruined reactor and about the impact of a rising water table underneath. Yet the site remains in production. The Ukraine may indeed lift its ban on building new reactors shortly. The government is under strong pressure to start the nearly complete reactor at Rovno. Even in Belarus, where there are no reactors at all and resistance to building them is extremely strong for obvious reasons, the government has plans to build two, but has yet to find a site. In Armenia, the French nuclear consultancy Framatome is helping assess two 408MW VVER reactors for refurbishment. These were closed after the 1988 earthquake on safety grounds. Now the Armenia government is desperate to reopen them - electricity supplies in the Republic are available for less than one hour a day. Russia's own intended increase in nuclear power does not flow from the same economic motives as those of Armenia or the Ukraine. Russian electricity demand fell in 1992 by 5 per cent. Equally, Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, substantial supplies of oil and more than 400 years of coal supplies at current rates of extraction. In contrast, both Armenia and the Ukraine have had to adjust to rapid increases in fossil fuel prices on which the bulk of their power supply depends. As things stand, 73.3 per cent of Russia's 213GW of power capacity is fossil fuel-fired, 20.3 per cent is hydropower and only 9.5 per cent is nuclear. At present, the nuclear sector has nine plants, with 28 reactors, amounting to 20 GW. Prior to the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet government had planned to more than double this capacity in order to provide the USSR with a20 per cent level of nuclear electricity by 2000 and increasing thereafter. After Chernobyl work was stopped on more than 74 new plants either under construction or planned throughout the USSR. The new plans are not as extensive as this. Ten new reactors are under construction in Russia itself, amounting to 8,600MW as well as 3,000MW in the rest of the C1S area. A further 7,600MW are at the planning stage. Of these, three, at Balakovo, Kursk and Kalinin, are due to be finished by the end of 1995, according to the Ministry of Atom Power (Minatom). A further eight are due to come on line before 2000. In a curious way, the fear about safety in Russian designed reactors has actually aided the role of nuclear power in Russia. As a Friends of the Earth Report, Dangerous Liaisons, pointed out last December, western nuclear companies were among the first industrial sectors to seek work in both eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The process of getting bilateral aid from the west was greatly aided by the fear that Chernobyl could happen again. As the state of former Soviet waste disposal plant was revealed, this too attracted western company interest. In 1991, nearly half of the EC's TACIS technical aid programme for energy in the CIS went on nuclear safety; a figure of Ecu54m. Most of this was spent on 'operational safety' rather than physical upgrading on the RBMKs and virtually all of it went to western companies. Money spent on energy saving measures amounted to Ecu21 million. In 1992, TACIS ceased to have an 'energy' sector at all. It was replaced entirely by nuclear safety with a grant of Ecu100m. Russian enthusiasm for nuclear energy may well be increased by a further Ecu3.3m TACIS grant to the new International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC) in Moscow. Funded with additional money from the US and Canada, Boris Yeltsin has decided to place this under the supervision of Minatom as a home for Russia's numerous unemployed nuclear scientists. In the view of nuclear sceptics, this is using western taxpayers' cash to promote a technology in Russia that is not being developed elsewhere. The anti-nuclear lobby has a dilemma in relation to eastern European and CIS nuclear power. Few can suggest that the safety issue should be ignored. Yet it is clear that expenditure of money on safety at various plant is seen as justification for their continued operation. The original perception was that many of the more dangerous plant would be handed over to western contractors for safety upgrading. Siemens put the price at between Dollars 150-Dollars 180m for a VVER 440MW reactor. Yet Minatom has now stated that it feels fully confident of its own technological skills and wants to limit western involvement to improved monitoring and training, for reasons of national pride as well as money. Yet if the plan is to go ahead with 12 more reactors before 2000 in a Russian nuclear revival, then safety remains a potent question mark over Russian technology. If the Russians have radically improved their record of 'human error', the number of incidents resulting from equipment failure is rising. The preferred solution of anti-nuclear groups, the industry's replacement by gas-fired capacity is perfectly possible and might even be cheaper than a full safety upgrade to western standards. Yet such a shift to gas would worry western gas and power utilities, counting on Russian supplies. Minatom remains at the centre of a power sector which has hardly suffered from the disintegration seen in the oil sector. The nuclear programme will keep it there.

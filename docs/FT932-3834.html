			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (9): Challenge of banking the unbanked - The way forward in the new South Africa for financial services AS BEFITS a society undergoing fundamental transition, South Africa is full of examples of poacher turned gamekeeper. A case in point concerns Moses Mayekiso, head of the SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco), one of the country's most prominent communist leaders. He has been a key figure in recent years in organising civil disobedience, such as rent boycotts, in black townships which has made the black home loan market a perilous place for banks to be. Mr Mayekiso is the man with whom the Association of Mortgage Lenders (AML) has worked in an attempt to restore stability to this difficult market. Two months ago the AML and Sanco reached an historic agreement on a set of principles to be followed in the handling of bond payments in arrears, payment defaults and repossessed properties. The agreement is, in effect, a peace treaty between the two parties. What is telling, however, are the principles underlying the treaty which make explicit the sort of issues which need to be tackled if banking is to be successfully transacted in the new South Africa. Home loans, of course, are a particularly politicised area. For decades apartheid decreed where blacks should live and denied to most the right to home ownership. This politicised the question of where people live, and by association, products in the housing market. The act of repossession, for example, when a loan was in arrears, was not seen so much as the normal functioning of the system, but as a perpetuation of the apartheid plan of depriving blacks of housing. Though politics has made home loans the most fraught area of lending, the root problem, which confronts banks across the full spectrum of their activities, is the enormous gap between the formal banking sector and the black community. The symptoms are typically South African. On the one hand, evidence of considerable sophistication - reputedly the highest number, per capita, of automatic teller machines in the world. On the other, evidence of the most basic developing country - very few black people, who constitute about 80 per cent of the population, have cheque accounts. How to bridge this gap - to bank the unbanked, bridge the gap between first and third world, call it what you will - is a huge strategic challenge facing South Africa's banks. Given that they make handsome profits serving the first world, it might well be asked why they should bother with the problematic third world market. There are two legs to the answer: Profit: it constitutes a huge potential growth market; and Self-preservation: in the words of Mr Jopie van Honschooten, head of the Community Banking Division at Standard Bank: 'If you don't have stability in the wider community, then you can forget about success in the formal banking sector. It will be like having first class tickets on the Titanic.' That is the easy part. The difficult question is that having decided it is a market you cannot ignore, how do you approach it, and how far do you become involved? These are still early days, but the broad outlines of the way forward are fairly clear. First, in Mr Van Honschooten's words, 'new mechanisms are needed for new markets'. Products developed in the developed market cannot simply be transferred into the developing market. There is ample evidence that this method has failed. New products and approaches are required. In terms of product, banks have realised that their offerings must be more closely tailored to the actual needs of the developing community. For example, research shows that in these communities access to credit is often more of a problem than the cost of that credit. Also, time horizons are often shorter. A hawker wants a loan not for three or six months, but for three weeks. Hence, greater attention needs to be paid to 'velocity loans' - where interest rates of 0.5-1 per centa day make sense in the short term, in spite of appearing usurious on an annualised basis. In terms of approach, banks have realised that they have a development role to play. Given that most of the developing market is outside the banking system, there is very little informal transmission of knowledge about banking practices - for example, how to get a home loan, what commitments are expected, what to do when in arrears, etc. If the banks want to create a sustainable environment in which to do business, they have to take on this educational task themselves. As Mr Van Honschooten makes clear: 'We're not in development per se, as some politicians would have us be. We're in development to the extent of making banking sustainable.' He reminds that 'the role of the bank is actually as intermediary to channel surplus savings to those who need to borrow. At our peril in South Africa do we endanger that process.' The way to secure it, of course, is to maintain sound principles of risk management. What this involves is clearly spelt out in the AML/Sanco accord which, inter alia, accepts the principles that financial institutions: Have a contractual commitment to depositors to pay them an agreed return on deposits; Would be unable to raise funds for lending if they didn't offer shareholders and providers of capital a fair return; As custodians of the nation's savings have to act with utmost prudence in assessing risks. These principles are balanced by others which recognise, for example, that 'community empowerment, education and participation are vital to the process of creating a normal property market'; repossession should be avoided wherever possible; and the need for alternative forms of housing tenure. In practice, what this means is that the formal banking sector is likely to limit itself to meeting the needs of the economically active - those who have stable employment and regular income. Those who are 'sub-optimally economically active' - in the informal sector, with irregular income, will have their needs met by community-based structures, supported by the formal sector. In this regard a Community Banking Project under leadership of Mr Bob Tucker, formerly head of The Perm building society, has done considerable work towards establishing the commercial and practical viability of community banking in South Africa. There seems to be a reasonable prospect that community banking will soon be established in South Africa to introduce, on a pilot basis, 'mass banking' into the black community.</p>

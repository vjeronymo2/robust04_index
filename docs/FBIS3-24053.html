			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Second installment of two-part article by Gennadiy Zyuganov </F> under the heading "Essay in Russian Geopolitics": "Exploit of  Rus"]    [Text]  <H5>  `Heavenly' Soul </H5>   Geopolitics suggests how to maintain in a healthy and viable  state the sovereign body of the country and how to harmonize and  bring into line with objective requirements the external sphere  of the vital activity of a great people. But there inevitably  remains outside of the framework of this approach the immense  and fundamentally important inner sphere of spiritual, cultural,  and religious-moral national existence.    For Russia, though, this sphere has traditionally  performed an outstanding, if not to say determining, role. The  thousand years of our history unambiguously confirm that we are  an idealist-people, a dreamer-people, an ascetic-people  frequently guided in our practical activity not by the arguments  or reason and considerations of advantage or sober calculation  but by sincere urges of incredible force. It is they that  at times elevate Russia to the pinnacles of almost unattainable  selflessness, sacrifice, heroism, and sanctity, it is they, on  the other hand, that cast it at times into the abyss of nihilism  and moral decline.    For many centuries the zealous custodian of national ideals  and shrines was the Russian Orthodox Church. It carefully made  sure that the boundless breadth of the Russian nature engender  holy ascetics and sovereign builders sooner and more often than  brilliant adventurers and insatiable power-seekers.    The very emergence of stable Russian statehood is connected  with a spiritual phenomenon--the baptism of Rus in 988. Having  already been in existence for roughly 150 years by this time,  the union of East Slav tribes, which had withstood the difficult  struggle against the khanate of Khazaria, represented  nonetheless a formation that was diffuse and infirm and  threatened by the minute to fall apart under the pressure of  intertribal contradictions and localistic tribal interests. And  only the adoption of Christianity, which united the  freedom-loving Polyane, Drevlyane, Krivichi, Vyatichi,  Radimichi, and others by a strong philosophical union of common  religious ideals, stabilized its state form, initiating also the  start of the formation of that unique ethnopolitical and  spiritual-ideological community that is known to the world as  the "Russian people."    Since this time each in the least bit significant period of  our history has inevitably coincided with stages of the  spiritual formation of Russia. The people's memory has carefully  preserved the visible symbols of this coincidence--the figures  of all-Russian spiritual mentors such as Sergiy Radonezhskiy or  Nil Sorskiy and sovereign Russian leaders like the  lord-and-master princes Aleksandr Nevskiy and Dmitriy Donskoy.  Saviors of the fatherland Minin and Pozharskiy, the legendary  Suvorov and the "White General" Skobelev, Marshal Zhukov, and  the present state-absolutist patriots, unreconciled to national  disgrace and the humiliation of the Russian State, to an equal  extent--whether they were aware of this or not--professed one  and the same geopolitical principles, whose ideological,  spiritual, and religious content were the ancient prophesies of  the Monk Filofey.    Russia came by this continuity, however, at a high,  immensely  high price. Beginning in the 18th century, which had been marked  by Peter's drastic, "shock" reforms, small cracks began to  appear in the state-philosophical monolith of Russia. The  point is that the "Russian idea" in its classical form does not  recognize state power as being of self-sufficing significance,  defining as its purpose merely the creation of the optimum  conditions for the achievement of justice and the moral ideals  of personal, family, and social justice. The entire  ideology of the "symphony of powers"--spiritual, moral-religious  and state, and secular--is based on this fundamental assertion.  But it was this "symphonic" principle that was disrupted by  Peter, who unambiguously made paramount the imperial, majestic  might of the country as the highest priority.    The two centuries that followed were a period of continuous  growth of the state might of Russia. But simultaneously with  this the internal contradictions in society, the spiritual state  of which ceased to be a paramount concern of the state, became  increasingly profound. A severe crisis of Russian national  self-awareness was the inevitable consequence. As a result, when  the discrepancy between the external sovereign greatness of the  enormous country and its internal ideological state passed the  critical level, Russia fell under the burden of its own  contradictions.  <H5>  End of Empire, Take Two </H5>   It seemed that the storm and calamities of revolution had  become an irreparable geopolitical catastrophe for the state  that had taken shape. Russia's continental nucleus became  disarticulated (the Far East Republic and the newly formed  states of Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus Republic, and the  Baltic countries, isolated from vitally important coastal  zones). The spiritual continuity of Russian life was brutally  and abruptly severed.    Nonetheless, the centuries-old sovereign-state inertia was  able to overcome the pathogenic energy of disintegration. In  spite of everything--the ideological Russophobia of the radical  party wing, the temptations of "world revolution," and the class  antagonisms that raged in the fire of the civil war--the country  restored its natural geopolitical shape incredibly quickly. The  people paid a fearful price for this, shouldering the horror of  punitive measures and starvation, devastation, the  all-hands-to-the-pump work at the industrial construction sites,  and the burdens of forced collectivization. But they believed in  the ideals of justice and human brotherhood. By their heroic  efforts the state rose again from the dead, in spite of  everything, before the eyes of an astonished world, rising up  like a phoenix from the ashes.    The main strategic problem for the long-term survival  of Russia arrayed in the new state body of the Soviet Union was  that of the discovery of a constructive world outlook and the  restoration of the spiritual life of the nation. It was in  this sphere that things were most difficult: The totalitarian  trends of state power had acquired an ugly, exaggerated form,  having become deadened in ideological tenets ruthlessly  suppressing the least spark of free, inquiring thought. This  situation, however, began to change rapidly in the years of the  Great Patriotic War, which became the pivotal moment of the  Soviet period of Russian history.    Without getting into assessments of the personality of  Stalin, it has to be acknowledged that he more than anyone else  understood the need for philosophical renewal within the  framework of the geopolitical form of the USSR. He also  understood the urgent need for the harmonization of the new  realities with age-old Russian tradition. The result of this  understanding was the abrupt change in the official ideology of  the Soviet Union in the period 1944-1953.    The basis of the new policy was the aspiration to  create an effective "ideology of patriotism" corresponding to  the demands of contemporaneity which could be a dependable  philosophical basis for the functioning of the state mechanisms  of the enormous Soviet state and its allies. Many pages of  authentic Russian history were restored and all persecution of  the church was emphatically terminated as the first order of  business to this end.    The USSR won the most dreadful and bloody war in the history  of mankind. Fully in accordance with its interests, it expanded  to the utmost the zones of influence in the sea and oceanic  directions, blocking henceforward any attempt at direct threats  to the borders of the state. The postwar devastation was  overcome and an autonomous, self-sufficient economic system  capable, given the competent domestic use of the country's  colossal natural wealth, of providing for the steady growth of  national well-being was created in record time. Were its pace to  have continued, the "ideological restructuring" left no doubt  that within 10-15 years the USSR would have fully overcome the  negative spiritual consequences of the revolutionary storms,  having developed their constructive results to the maximum here.  The creation of native nuclear weapons ruled out all  possibilities of power interference in our internal affairs.    Such prospects evoked in the West--the traditional citadel  of  "oceanic geopolitical strategy"--a state close to panic. There  were reasons for this. A most powerful alternative center  of world influence personifying justice and the power of the  people and the social, political, cultural, and economic  principles of the "continental" line of development of human  civilization was taking shape in the person of the USSR--the  continuer of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The  centuries-old efforts of the commercial and financial  cosmopolitan elite to create a "world system of the  international division of labor"--the economic basis for the  subsequent political standardization of mankind within the  framework of a "new world order"--were in jeopardy.    This dramatic global encounter of the two archetypes of  world  politics, economics, and culture was personified in the  opposition of the two superpowers--the United States and the  USSR--which acquired the forms of the cold war.    The anticommunist rhetoric of the "free world" and its  hypocritical concern for "human rights" here were the  ideological screen behind which the invariable age-old  geopolitical interests of the West demanding the weakening and,  if possible, the destruction of Russia were concealed from the  gaze of the uninitiated. This hypocrisy has become particularly  obvious now, when the unconcealed flouting of the rights of  millions of Russians and Russian speakers, who in the new  ethnocratic states of the CIS have found themselves in the  position of second-class citizens, not only is not evoking  condemnation but is being tacitly welcomed by the "civilized  world."    From the moment of the start of the cold war, when the  secret  mechanisms for the destruction of the Union were engaged,  through the final act of the drama in 1991, three stages--three  consecutive periods of the development of the geopolitical  sabotage against the USSR--may, conditionally, be distinguished.    The first began immediately following the death of Stalin  and  was conducted beneath the slogans of "de-Stalinization" and  "Khrushchev's 'thaw.'" History does not know the subjunctive  mood, alas: The some 57 years of life were not enough for Stalin  to have made his "ideological restructuring" irreversible and to  have ensured the restoration of the Russian spiritual-state  tradition, which had been unjustifiably interrupted. The  leader's body was not cold in the Mausoleum before his  successors were abruptly turning back the ideological course.  The "entire civilized world" clamorously welcomed this maneuver,  maintaining a modest silence about the labors it had cost its  politicians, diplomats, special services, and "agents of  influence."    The era of "stagnation" naturally continued this pernicious  process. Dogmatic teachings that were patently out of date were  preserved by the efforts of many of the present "outstanding"  democrats who were at that time implacable conformist types. The  absence of a healthy philosophical base was echoed in painful  confusion in the sphere of Soviet geopolitics also.    On the one hand geopolitically substantiated attempts to  expand the zone of Soviet influence in the strategic continental  directions--in Afghanistan, for example--assumed a categorically  impermissible radical-militarist nature. On the other, measures  like the attempt to "install" Nicaragua in the "world socialist  system," which were utterly pointless from the geopolitical  viewpoint, swallowed up giant forces and resources. Deprived of  an adjusted geopolitical concept, the USSR succumbed to the  temptation of a "symmetrical," "socialist" mondialist response  to the strategic challenge of capitalist mondialism on the part  of the United States.    Year after year this insupportable burden exhausted our  powers. Year after year we strained the resource and industrial  and military and demographic potential of the country in the  chase after mirages of global world leadership entirely alien to  the very spirit of the Russian geopolitical tradition. The  result was soon reflected: The economic situation within the  USSR began to deteriorate consistently, and the ideological,  religious, and cultural vacuum created unprecedentedly favorable  conditions for the infiltration in society of alien values,  destructive philosophies, and egotistically parasitical  stereotypes of social consciousness.    Such was the general situation when the "generational  change"  in the highest Kremlin echelons enabled Russia's enemies to  embark on the second stage of the dismantling of the USSR--the  creation of the ideological base for its collapse. Its  chronological framework encompasses 1985-1990--the bulk of  Gorbachev's "perestroyka."    I have in previous articles dwelt in sufficient detail on  the  specific mechanisms of the "slow-moving catastrophe" that  ensured the destruction of the USSR, so to avoid repeating  myself I would note merely that the main areas of the  ideological war against the Union were the avowed Russophobia of  the denationalized part of society, the incitement of  antipatriotic hysteria cleverly linked "in a package" with  furious anticommunism, and the deafening, importunate propaganda  of the "charms" of the liberal-democratic philosophy.    The third, culminating stage of the global geopolitical  sabotage took just two years (1990-1991) and was aimed at  political assurance of the disintegration of the single Union  state. In the domestic political sphere it was characterized as  a "struggle against reactionaries" in the directive machinery of  the party and government, an abrupt outburst of outlying-area  nationalism and regional separatism, the paralysis of the  central authorities, and use of the "democratic" Russian  leadership as a battering ram to destroy the general economic,  legal, political, and cultural space of the country.    Today, with the passage of two and a half years filled  with dramatic events that have been the natural consequences of  the collapse of the USSR, it may be maintained with confidence  that the backstage sponsors of this operation were, for all  that, unable to achieve all their strategic goals.    And the plan was this: By way of speeding economic and  political changes within the Soviet Union and the broad-based,  single-minded ideological indoctrination of the populace in a  "democratic" spirit, to cause in the disoriented society a loss  of natural immunity connected with intuitive healthy  conservatism and the self-preservation instinct. Having  suppressed the protective mechanisms of social self-awareness,  to ensure the collapse of the unified state against the  background of the buffoonish Emergency Committee "putsch." On  the wave of this powerful state-ideological cataclysm  accompanied by the most powerful shock to the mass consciousness  to occupy the key positions in all the leading spheres of social  life. To ensure the maximum possible degree of Russia's  economic, political, and military dependence on foreign  (Western) influence. And, most important, having availed  themselves of this, to trigger on a par with the ongoing chaos,  economic crisis, and shocked state of society the mechanisms of  internal Russian disintegration, taking as a basis the  separatism of the national outlying areas, regional  contradictions, and the fratricidal struggle of Moscow's  political clans.    The "architects of perestroyka" evidently had in mind a  broader timeframe for the realization of their far-reaching  operation. The studies of social psychologists and practical  experience show that the "period of shock" of the mass  consciousness which is caused by sudden social upheavals and  which "switches off" the mechanisms of social self-protection  cannot be long. In the case of Russia-USSR the engineers of the  collapse could have counted on four or five years, no more.    Taking as the initial reference point of the shock processes  on the territory of the USSR the year of 1989, when  "perestroyka" had entered its "revolutionary" phase, we see that  this timeframe is today at an end. Here are the true reasons for  the "surprise" results of the recent elections, this is the  cause of the growth of the "neoimperial" mood in society!    "The sleep of reason gives birth to monsters," the sharp and  shrewd Goya once said. Today the collective reason of our  people is beginning slowly and with difficulty to awake  following many years of an arduous and tormented half-conscious  state.  <H5>  Choice of Destiny </H5>   The charges against Russia of a "revival of Great-Russian  chauvinism" and the "pursuit of an imperial policy," which have  become fashionable as of late, reflect the increased agitation  of the world's backstage players aware that the entire global  decades-long anti-Russia and anti-Russian intrigues are now on  the verge of being thwarted. For it is obvious that, having  regained consciousness from the long semi-comatose state, having  recognized their true national-state interests, and reviving on  the basis of millennial historical traditional values, Russia  will not accept the humiliating role being imposed on it and  will restore its natural position of great world power.    So:    Today, as in past centuries, the vital interests of Russia  consist by no means of "subduing," "conquering," or  "subjugating" anyone. Not of endlessly expanding its territory,  which is the most vast in the world as it is. Not of straining  the people's efforts in vain attempts to impose on someone or  other its own view of the world as the "sole correct" and  uncontested view.    They consist primarily of gathering on its land, under  its own roof, under the protection of a single powerful state,  all Russian people, all who consider Russia their motherland,  all the peoples that agree to link their historical destiny with  it. And Moscow does not have the right to abandon this  traditional role of "gatherer of the lands"--and will not do so,  however much some people would like to "hound the Russian bear  in his den."    Further, our vital interests consist of ensuring in our own  home unconditional and lasting peace guaranteed against all  encroachments from outside and from within, the corresponding  foreign policy conditions having been created for this. Of  protecting our historical individuality and distinctive  spirituality against the aggression of alien, perverted  stereotypes of mass consciousness and against the noxious  influence of immorality elevated to a norm of life and  individualistic egotism extolled as a virtue. In order to create  for our fellow citizens all the necessary conditions for  education and health care, labor, and recreation, the  development of science and culture, and a happy childhood and  serene old age.    Russia is today experiencing a unique moment in his  existence. We have in the past century acquired invaluable  experience, by which we have come at an exorbitant,  irreplaceable, excruciating price. Are we unable to take  advantage of it; to consider the tragic lessons of the past,  multiply the heroic traditions of national history, and from the  height of the present dolorous days finally overcome the  internal disagreements, having restored the successive and  consistent current of our life?    Today, for the first time in three centuries, we have a real  opportunity to restore the symphonic unity of our spiritual and  state traditions. We are now all too well aware of how heavy the  yoke of aspiritual statehood can be, and sense all too well what  a fearful moral price would have to be paid for the loss of the  ideals that could impart to our conciliary, national, social  being sacred, eternal, and nontransient meaning....    But in order to realize all our actual potential we must  learn to take a sober view of things, without illusions or  embellishment. This means first and foremost that we must  recognize that far from everyone in the world around us will be  happy that Great Russia is reviving. Life's realities are  such that the age-old struggle of the two rival geopolitical  principles will not end merely because Russia's democrats have  suddenly become smitten with a tender love for the Western way  of life. And this being the case, let us recall, nonetheless,  that:    the state exponent and most complete spokesman for the  competing geopolitical model is the United States of America  superpower with its strategic allies constituting altogether the  geopolitical bloc that we are accustomed to designating by the  term the "West";    the economic exponent and industrial pillar of this model is  the commercial and financial cosmopolitan oligarchy straining  after world domination and constituting the main driving force  of the contemporary mondialist plan of the "new world order";    its philosophical exponent is liberal-democratic ideology,  whose basic features are extreme individualism, militant  aspirituality, religious indifference, a devotion to mass  culture, antitraditionalism, and the principle of the domination  of the quantitative over the qualitative principle....    There are, unfortunately, exponents of this geopolitical  principle within Russia also. A fifth column of politicians and  public figures and parties and organizations of a "pro-West"  persuasion united by a commitment to the "wild" market and the  unchecked "integration of Russia in a single world community"  and the unconditional priority of "values common to all mankind"  are appearing primarily in this unattractive role.    Let us say at once that the affirmation of these facts is  under no circumstances a call for confrontation and enmity. On  the contrary, a clear understanding of the situation only  increases the chances of a reasonable compromise and mutually  beneficial cooperation.    I would like in conclusion to emphasize once again the  thought that serves as the leitmotiv of the entire article: We  are today faced with a choice that will determine Russia's fate  for a long time to come. A choice that we should be helped to  make by our entire age-old history, our entire tragic and heroic  experience, and by all our incalculable and nameless compatriots  who from age to age created the great state and defended it  against encroachments and adversities.    We simply do not have the right to make a mistake in this  choice!</p>

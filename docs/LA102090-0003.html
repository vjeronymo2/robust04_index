			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSCASTER LUND'S RETURN  </P> <P> Re "Back From the Ranch," Steve Weinstein's Oct. 10 article on newscaster  Christine Lund:  </P> <P> Like many other Southern Californians, I'll be welcoming the return of Lund to  Channel 7. I remember her thorough and honest reporting . . . her ability to go  on the scene and ask tough questions . . . her concern for fairness.  </P> <P> I was eagerly reading Weinstein's interview until I saw, "Now in her 40s but  still possessed of the white-blond hair and crisp blue eyes that once made her  an anchor superstar. . . ." Is this what she worked so hard for? Would your  reporter have said this about a male journalist? And what rock has he been  living under that he thinks women in their 40s are suddenly unattractive?  </P> <P> An interesting story became yet another example of trivializing a woman's  accomplishments. Where's a good editor when you need one?  </P> <P> ANDREA DANIEL  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / People: Rada's hands-off experience for Digital 'What specific experience do you have that qualifies you for this job?' If that standard question had been put at an interview to the man just appointed as Digital Equipment's European director of strategy, he would have answered in one word: 'None.' Chilean-born Dr Juan Rada, who is to take up the post on May 1 at the age of 40, has never held a full-time industrial job. His previous career has been in management education, culminating in the director-generalship of the IMD international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was also professor of technology management. 'I've nevertheless worked with industry a lot, not least Digital itself,' he says. 'And being director-general of the school involved me very much in line-management work, including a merger.' IMD was formed in 1988-89 by amalgamating Geneva's IMI school with the IMEDE school in Lausanne. Oddly enough, Digital Europe's president and chief executive Pier Carlo Falotti is chairman of IMD's advisory council. 'We've been friends for years,' adds Rada who will work closely with Falotti as his director of strategy and new initiatives, based in Geneva. 'He's a man who practises management as I've learned it needs to be - a process of coaching your people to apply their own ideas and supporting them, as opposed to just bossing them around.' As for IMD, it is being run for the time being by Professor Xavier Gilbert while a committee looks for Rada's replacement. 'I hear they have some very good candidates,' he says.</p>

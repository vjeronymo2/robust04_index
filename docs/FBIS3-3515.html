Experts regard the area's economic take-off as a key to  achieving China's goal to rank among the world's moderately  developed countries by the mid-21st century.    The Chang Jiang flows 6,300 km from the Qinghai-Tibet  Plateau  to Shanghai, where it joins the sea. It runs through the seven  provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and  Sichuan, which account for 40 percent of the nation's production  capability and 30 percent of consumer purchasing power.    Inspired by the construction of the Pudong New Area in  Shanghai, the central government set forth an ambitious plan to  develop the Chang Jiang River Delta in June 1992.    Shanghai, the country's biggest city, which is located at  the  mouth of the Yangtze, has become the area's economic showcase,  in the process of regaining its status as the largest trade and  financial center in the Pacific-Asia region.    By 1993, the city's ten newly-established and biggest  exchanges registered over 1,000 billion yuan in total  transaction volume. Its indices and quotations have become  instructive for both domestic and world trade.    Shanghai's development seems to display the Chinese  leadership's firm determination to deepen the country's 15-year  reform drive and open the country wider to the outside world.    If this city, which had fully implemented the central  planning system since 1950, is successful in its shift to a  market economy, there is no reason for other cities not to  follow suit.    Another key national project, the ongoing Three Gorges  water-conservancy project, which started on the upper reaches of  the Chang Jiang in 1993, has attracted many investors from home  and abroad to tap its water resources, which equal the total in  the Commonwealth of Independent States and are 40 percent more  than the total in the U.S.    Now, an industrial modernization campaign is sweeping  through  the delta, which has a strong industrial foundation and advanced  scientific and technological level.    The steel corridor, embracing the Baoshan Steel Works Group  and iron and steel companies in Chongqing, Maanshan and Wuhan,  has expanded sharply.    Car production centers in Shanghai and Wuhan are now under  construction.    The provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui have set a target to  double their nonferrous metals output.    And the hi-tech industry, featuring bioengineering,  microelectronics and new materials, will facilitate the area's  development as a whole.    The major projects in the region, including those in  construction and on the drawing board, are expected to pool a  total of 1,000 billion yuan.    With China's policy-makers turning their focus to the area,  it has also seen a huge influx of foreign investment.    In 1993, the area approved over 10,000 foreign-funded  enterprises, with nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars in promised  foreign investment.    So far, more than 100 big-name conglomerates among the  world's top 500 have entered the region, especially streaming  into cities like Shanghai, Wuhan and Chongqing.    Large companies from Belgium and Germany, which took the  lead  in exploring this market, have recouped their investments,  prompting many others to follow suit.    Experts predicted a bright future for the area under the  fine  economic climate nationwide, especially for the forming market  economy, which is on the fast-track of development.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: Singing the new-issue blues - The Bottom Line Over the next few weeks, investors will be bombarded with share offers from companies floating on the stock market as the autumn season of new issues gets under way. Recent events may make them think harder before signing the cheque. On Wednesday, shares in Aerostructures Hamble almost halved when the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, which was floated in May, issued a profits warning. The next day, there was an even more dramatic slump at McDonnell Information Systems (MDIS), which came to market at 260p in March. Following its admission that profits would fall this year, the shares tumbled to 112p. 'Told you so,' said those who had warned that this year's bumper crop of flotations contained a number of over-priced, over-hyped issues that would soon go bad. There have been plenty of disappointments already, including the high-profile problems of MAID and the even more spectacular flops of DRS and Coda. But the evidence suggests that the successes still outweigh the duds. The table shows the best and worst performers among the 84 UK trading companies worth over Pounds 10m which have floated so far this year. The share price performance is measured against the FT All-Share index from the first day of dealing until the close of trading on Thursday. The average is a gain of 5.8 per cent. This is influenced heavily by some spectacular increases from very small companies such as Magnum Power and Waste Recycling. But the average, weighted by market value, would also be ahead thanks to good increases from 3i (up 24.7 per cent) and House of Fraser (up 19.6 per cent). Yet, the gain is hardly impressive given that new issues are priced to give a reasonable premium on first dealings. For private investors, the evidence is less encouraging still. Of the top 10 performers, all but two - Inspec and Alpha Airports - were placings with institutions, whereas half the worst performers were marketed to the public. The average for those flotations in the sample, where there was either an offer direct to the public or through intermediaries, was a decline of 1.3 per cent. This squares with most academic studies of initial public offerings which show that, despite the initial premium, they perform much in line with similar companies that are quoted already. One possible explanation is that companies tend to come to market when their profits are strong and their sector is in fashion. But fashions change - as those investors who bought some of the flood of electronics issues early in the 1980s found to their cost. One of the attractions of buying shares in a flotation is that, in theory, the company should have been scrutinised carefully by its advisers. But, as last week shows, the fact that names likes Baring or Rothschild appear on a prospectus does not make something a risk-less investment. When it comes to assessing those risks, it is tempting to look for patterns in the recent flops. Certainly, it is striking that both Aerostructures and MDIS were recent management buy-outs, and some observers argue that the relatively poor performance of this year's new issue crop reflects the many MBOs. Yet, studies in the US suggest that MBOs tend to out-pace other companies after flotation - and the fourth-best performer this year has been Inspec, the specialty chemicals company which was a managment buy-in/buy-out from BP. It would also be wrong to read too much into the poor performance of computer and technology companies. DRS, MAID, MDIS and Coda all made the bottom 10 and Chiroscience was the latest of the bio-technology flotations to disappoint. But Ideal Hardware, Radstone Technology, Unipalm and Cedardata all made good progress while Magnum Power, which developed a cheap power supply for personal computers, made the top spot. Magnum, a four-year-old company which lost Pounds 1.23m on turnover of just Pounds 59,000 last year, was probably the most risky of this crop of flotations. But it has been the most rewarding. In most respects, new issues are no different from other shares. Investors should judge them on the same basis.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Float or sink?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Best performers     %*    Worst performers     %*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Magnum Power      +97.8   DRS               -54.9 Waste Recycling   +53.5   MDIS              -52.9 Trafficmaster     +46.7   Coda              -50.0 Inspec            +41.5   Aerostructures    -38.7 My Kinda Town     +41.5   MAID              -35.0 Domnick Hunter    +39.5   Chiroscience      -32.5 GRT               +30.4   United Carriers   -26.5 Partco            +30.4   Wainhomes         -24.2 Alpha Airports    +27.3   Nottingham        -22.7 Ideal Hardware    +25.4   Beazer Homes      -20.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Average   +5.8**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Share price performance against the FT-A All-Share index. **Average of all UK trading companies valued at over Pounds 10m floated in 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

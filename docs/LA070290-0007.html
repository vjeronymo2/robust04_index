			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 'OPINION DEFENSE' IN LIBEL CASES  </P> <P> 1984 is here, six years late. Conrad's cartoon makes the point that the libel  ruling will stifle opinion, and thus I say, stifle dissent.  </P> <P> Now our government has apparently decided on "thought control" beyond its  attacks on free speech and a free press.  </P> <P> Can't we see where this Republican-appointed Supreme Court is taking us?  </P> <P> JIM MOORE  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Buenos Aires explosion kills 17 Argentina closed its borders and placed police outside synagogues yesterday after an explosion had ripped through the offices of a leading Jewish organisation in Buenos Aires, killing at least 17 and injuring at least 127, said a government official. The blast, which nearly levelled the building, in a mainly Jewish district, was a dramatic reminder of the attack two years ago on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, when a car bomb killed 30 people and injured some 250. The source of that attack remains undiscovered. President Carlos Menem initiated a high-level official inquiry yesterday and instructed border guards to ground all flights and seal all borders. Two foreigners were detained for questioning as they were about to board a flight out of the country, said Mr Raul Burzaco, the presidential press secretary. Telam, the domestic Argentine news agency, reported that they were a German woman and an Iranian man, at Buenos Aires international airport. An estimated 100 people had worked in the building, which housed the Delegation of Argentine-Israeli Associations, the country's principal Jewish community organisation, and the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, a charity group. There are some 250,000 Jews in Argentina, most of them in Buenos Aires. In Jerusalem, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said he was sure the explosion was a terrorist attack, while the World Jewish Congress in New York called on all Jewish organisations to take immediate security precautions. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, called the new attack 'a cowardly, criminal and evil act'.</p>

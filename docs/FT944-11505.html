			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Long View: When deflation rules Despite diving into crippling deficit only four or five years ago, Britain's corporate sector is now becoming awash with wealth. In the first six months of 1994, industrial and commercial companies were running a surplus at the rate of nearly Pounds 20bn a year. The future course of the economic cycle will now depend largely on how they decide to spend it. According to the latest CBI quarterly survey, business optimism is now back to cyclical peaks last seen during the mid-1980s. National output has at last moved above the 1990 pre-recession high point and is climbing at nearly 4 per cent year-on-year (including a bonus from higher North Sea oil output). The corporate sector has reaped unusually lush rewards for two main reasons: the 1992 devaluation has boosted export profitability and, in a depressed labour market, nearly all the rewards of a leap in productivity are accruing to employers. While personal incomes from employment are edging ahead at about 3 per cent a year, company trading profits are jumping by 23 per cent. That is why profits as a share of GDP rose from 12 to 14 per cent in 1993 and may top 15 per cent this year. Because spending on fixed investment and stocks has, if anything, fallen back, the result has been a rapid surge into financial surplus. What happens now? The conventional (and official) wisdom is that the corporate sector should plough back its wealth into growth by increasing its investment spending. One of the present economic scares is that the economy will soon run into the buffers of a capacity constraint, capping growth and triggering inflation. The scale of any remaining 'output gap' remains vague but - according to the Bank of England's Inflation Report this week - is certainly substantially smaller than a couple of years ago. Investment intentions are now positive, according to the CBI survey, but are not yet back to late 1980s' levels. Of course, there are big changes going on in the productivity of invested capital; quality is just as important as quantity. There are other uses for corporate wealth, however. Dividends have been unexpectedly strong, rising by 7 per cent over the past 12 months and heading for perhaps 9 per cent growth next year, according to City expectations. In some cases, such as where profits are piling up in monopoly utilities and capacity expansion would be inappropriate, capital is being returned to shareholders: East Midlands Electricity is giving back Pounds 186m before Christmas. Barclays bank, running short of lending opportunities, is said to be considering something similar. For the time being, certainly, the corporate sector surpluses are serving to reduce borrowings; companies have become debt-averse after the financial scares of the early 1990s. Now the tables are turned and these are anxious times for the banks, because companies are continuing to repay borrowings at roughly last year's Pounds 11bn annual rate. When British company bosses have money to burn, they resort traditionally to take-over activity. At the height of the last acquisition boom, in 1989, British companies spent Pounds 27bn on acquisitions and increased their bank borrowings by Pounds 34bn to help pay for these and other excesses. The wave of take-overs at home and abroad produced many disasters; an interesting research report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this week suggested that foreign companies (Britain's prominent among them) spent Dollars 316bn on US acquisitions in the past decade but are, in aggregate, running them at a loss. At home, the battle for control of VSEL suggests that the bad old habits of buying second-hand capacity rather than building new factories are still evident. But spending on acquisitions was only Pounds 7bn last year and has not accelerated greatly in 1994. There is one other way in which companies could spend their new-found riches. They could cut prices - some call it an investment in market share. True, it is not a British attitude; but when Rupert Murdoch found that his television businesses had turned round into surplus last year, his response was to recycle the money into newspaper price reductions. The British approach, judging by the ambitions of those replying to the CBI survey, is to exploit an unnecessary shortage of supply by being slow to increase capacity and then raising prices (as a balance of 20 per cent are hoping to do in the next four months). This is the attitude that led to such a rise in import penetration in the past. It became ingrained when British companies regularly faced spiralling labour costs and an over-valued currency. Surely, though, companies should be more aggressive when labour costs are quiescent and profitability is high. The outcome might vary from sector to sector and plainly will be different in retailing or food manufacturing, where capacity will remain excessive, than in capital goods, where it might soon become short. Meanwhile, of course, a revenue-hungry chancellor could have his own designs on the corporate sector's riches. The Treasury has changed the details of dividend taxes already: it did that 18 months ago, and the full impact is now coming through. It would be surprising if companies escaped unscathed in this month's Budget. From the investor's point of view, the challenge is to judge the durability of the profits boom. Has there been a permanent structural shift towards capital? Or will a cyclical rise in costs push the profit share back down towards its historical norm? Relative strength in sterling, certainly against the dollar, might prove to be an important factor here. The unusual feature of the 1990s is that it could be the deflationary forces acting on prices that take the icing off the cake, rather than the more familiar upwards pressure on costs.</p>

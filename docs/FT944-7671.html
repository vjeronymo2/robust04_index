			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (11): More glitz for shoppers - US/Mexican retailing alliances The North American Free Trade Agreement has spawned half a dozen cross-border alliances between Mexican and US retailers which are betting on the growing purchasing power of 90m Mexicans. Cifra, Mexico's leading retailer, has formed a jointly owned company with Wal-Mart of the US to establish supermarkets and discount stores. A second joint-venture has been signed between Cifra, Wal-Mart and Dillard Department Stores, which specialises in clothing and wearing-apparel. Comercial Mexicana, the second-largest retailer, has teamed up with Price Club of the US to rival the Cifra-Wal-Mart alliance. Grupo Gigante, Mexico's third-largest retailer, has joined up with Carrefour of France in one joint-venture and with Fleming Companies in another. El Puerto de Liverpool, the Mexican department stores, are developing a combination store chain with KMart Corporation. The alliances have not only added more glitz to the Mexican shopping experience - they are injecting more competition into the retailing sector and reducing margins, prompting companies to pare down costs and look beyond the Guadalajara-Mexico City-Monterrey axis for new business opportunities. Expansion of the new joint-ventures is taking place under less than perfect conditions, as the slow-down in economic growth and high interest rates have put a break on the consumer credit boom of the early 1990s. As a result, growth in consumer demand has been lower than expected. Cifra says its sales, (excluding Wal-mart's share), which totalled Dollars 4.58bn in 1993, have risen by only 4 per cent so far this year. Cifra executives say they began preparing for the tougher competitive environment five years ago - 'we knew the large US chains would come to Mexico once Nafta was signed, so we took a hard look at how they run their business. To survive, we had to become as competitive and efficient as the largest US retailers.' The first step was to cut operating and administrative costs. In his annual report, Mr Henry Davis, Cifra's president, outlines some of the cutbacks: 'We no longer supply our executives with cars . . . subscriptions to magazines have been restricted, and the executive dining rooms have been closed. All breakfast, luncheon and dinner meetings have been replaced with working sessions at our offices.' In addition, Cifra invested Dollars 25m in computer equipment and systems last year. The new, no-frills company ethos allowed Cifra to cut operating and administrative costs from 22 per cent to 15 per cent of sales, a figure which company executives say is comparable to the best-run US chains. US companies have sought Mexican partners because of the latter's greater knowledge of the local consumer market and suppliers. In return, the US chains are contributing their greater experience in computerised inventory control, wholesale distribution and their vast network of US suppliers. 'We are greatly benefiting from our joint venture with Wal-Mart, a company recognised worldwide as a leader in retail applications of information technology,' says Mr Davis of Cifra. 'The joint-venture has allowed us to install well-proven systems and programmes which Wal-Mart already has in operation. We are, therefore, reducing our costs and eliminating the risk of failure.' Cifra executives say they are also learning from Wal-Mart how to manage the growth of their operations. They have plans to almost double the number of stores in some 90 cities by 1997. This will require learning about the wholesale side of the business and the establishment of distribution centres equiped with computerised 'just-in-time' technology to reduce inventories and transport costs.</p>

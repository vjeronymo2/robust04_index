The meeting is chaired by Indonesian  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.    Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs  and head of Jordan's delegation, made a speech at the opening  session. [passage omitted]    Explaining Jordan's position on the Bosnian issue, the  minister of state for foreign affairs pointed out that the war  crimes committed by Serbian forces have continued despite  international condemnation. He said: The siege on the city of  Sarajevo and Muslim regions is getting worse. Ethnic cleansing  is increasing at a fast pace. Mass murder and the shelling of  civilian targets are getting uglier. More than 260 civilians  were either killed or injured. This is an indication of the  ugliness of this crime and the Serbs' unmatched barbarity.    The minister of state for foreign affairs added that after  the partition of former Yugoslavia, Jordan was among the first  countries to dispatch troops under the UN flag. Jordan now has  the second largest contingent of peacekeeping troops after  France.    Talal Sat'an al-Hasan added: Jordan strongly condemns  Serbian crimes and is amazed at the silence of the international  community toward Serbian disregard for international legitimacy  and resolutions. Jordan believes that dialogue is a way of  settling disputes. Therefore, it calls for an immediate  cease-fire, starting talks, and lifting the Bosnian arms embargo  to achieve a balance in military capabilities between the two  warring parties.    Al-Hasan said Jordan urges measures and supports an urgent  meeting for the Security Council, as proposed by the chairman,  to restore peace to war-torn Bosnia. According to the proposed  measures, there should be an end to the continued Serbian  encroachments on the international borders of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, in line with  Security Council Resolution 796 of 1992. Also, the former  Republic of Yugoslavia (the Serbs) should be forced to stop arms  supplies to Serbian militias operating within the borders of the  Republic of Bosnia in line with Security Council Resolution 819  of 1993, lift the siege on the city of Sarajevo and other  cities, and adopt measures to protect holy and residential  areas.

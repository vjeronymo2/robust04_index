			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS RECRUITS COVETED CHEMIST;  </P> <P> SCIENCE: AN MIT PROFESSOR ACCLAIMED FOR MEDICINE-RELATED RESEARCH WILL TAKE AN  ENDOWED CHAIR IN RESEARCH INSTITUTE'S NEW CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT.  </P> <P> Moving aggressively to buttress a chemistry department that is just a year old,  the Scripps Research Institute has hired a world-renowned chemist for an  endowed research chair.  </P> <P> K. Barry Sharpless, 49, will be trading an endowed professorship at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the position in La Jolla.  </P> <P> "This is a major achievement for us," said an exultant department chairman,  K.C. Nicolaou. "He is a genius at discovering new reagents and reaction  processes useful to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as well as to  other researchers in chemistry and biology."  </P> <P> Scripps received a $2.9-million grant in December to establish the chair that  Sharpless will hold, the W. M. Keck Foundation Chair in Chemistry. The Keck  foundation, funded with the bequest of the late oilman William Myron Keck, is  based in Los Angeles. One of its best-known recent gifts was a $70-million  donation for a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory in Hawaii.  </P> <P> Sharpless will not move to San Diego until next spring, when Scripps can locate  him in temporary quarters while a new chemistry building is being constructed.  </P> <P> The appointment brings to four the number of professors in the new department  and is being portrayed by Scripps as a crucial step toward gaining the new  department a reputation as a leading center for bio-organic chemistry, just a  year after being established, Nicolaou said.  </P> <P> The achievement is impressive, said Mark Wrighton, chairman of the MIT  chemistry department that Sharpless will be leaving.  </P> <P> "It's a remarkable achievement in a short period of time," Wrighton said. "I  think Dr. (Richard) Lerner, (president of the institute), is to be  congratulated upon assembling this group. It's really remarkable progress."  </P> <P> He added, though, that Scripps clearly is taking a very narrow field within  chemistry in which to specialize -- the field that is developing new techniques  to build the "designer drugs" that scientists are dreaming up on  supercomputers.  </P> <P> "The breadth of activities is still modest in comparison to the leading  departments. So I regard it as a collection of truly super people, but in only  one part of chemistry," Wrighton said.  </P> <P> More than two years ago, Scripps embarked on a program to add chemists to its  research staff. Although officials emphasize that Scripps still will do basic  research, the new chemists will also make the institute more likely to develop  new drugs or other products to which Scripps would have lucrative patent  rights.  </P> <P> One more professor remains to be hired before all five professorships in the  department will be filled, Nicolaou said.  </P> <P> Sharpless is widely regarded for his work in finding new ways to synthesize  organic molecules using metallic compounds, said department chairman K. C.  Nicolaou.  </P> <P> In 1980, Sharpless invented a process for using asymmetric metallic molecules  to force oxygen atoms to bind to organic molecules in a particular  three-dimensional orientation.  </P> <P> Normally, the oxygen atoms can bind to a pair of carbon atoms in two different  ways, known as "right-handed" or "left-handed" isomers.  </P> <P> (In the drug or nutritional store, consumers see examples of this in amino acid  supplements such as lysine, often seen labeled as L-lysine. The right-handed  form would be R-lysine.)  </P> <P> Sharpless's method assures that all the molecules in a chemical batch will be  purely of the same handedness. The handedness of organic molecules is  significant because the human body generally uses only one isomer of a  compound, so pharmaceuticals must be given only in that form.  </P> <P> Currently, pharmaceuticals are first synthesized and then purified, but  Sharpless's method eventually could eliminate the need for a purification step,  Nicolaou said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it is fundamental to much of the synthetic organic chemistry being  done in research laboratories today, he added.  </P> <P> Elected in 1985 to the National Academy of Sciences, Sharpless did his graduate  work at Stanford University, and postdoctoral work at Stanford and at Harvard  University. He has been at MIT since 1970, except for 1977-80 when he was a  chemistry professor at Stanford.  </P> <P> Two years ago, he spent three months at California Institute of Technology in  Pasadena, which offered him a permanent post that he turned down, said his  wife, Jan Sharpless.  </P></p>

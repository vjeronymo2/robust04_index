			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>   [Text] Israel has agreed to recognize Jordanian  sovereignty over territories in the 'Arava, especially in the  Dead Sea area, even before the signing of an official peace  treaty between the two states, political sources in Jerusalem  confirm. These lands take up tens of thousands of dunams, which  Israel annexed over the years in the wake of drilling for water  and due to the flow of the Jordan River.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said in recent interviews it  must be acknowledged that the Dead Sea is not a fixed lake, but  shifts several kilometers from time to time.    We recall that the Jordanians are demanding that territories  spread over some 360 sq km, chiefly in the 'Arava and mainly  uninhabited, be transferred to their sovereignty.</p>

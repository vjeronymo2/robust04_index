Rule 13h&hyph;1 was initially proposed by the Commission in Exchange Act Release No. 29593 (August 22, 1991), 56 FR 42550 (August 28, 1991). Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 would establish an activity-based identification, recordkeeping, and reporting system for large trader accounts and transactions. Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 also would establish a definition for large traders and require such large traders to file Form 13H with the Commission. Registered broker-dealers would be required to maintain transaction records for each large trader account and report transactions upon the request of the Commission or a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') designated by the Commission. Reproposed Rule 13h&hyph;1 would fulfill the goals of the Market Reform Act of 1990 (``Market Reform Act'') by providing the Commission with the information necessary to reconstruct trading activity in periods of market stress and for enforcement or other regulatory purposes, without imposing undue burdens or costs on market participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons wishing to submit written comments should file three copies with Jonathan G.

During this period of change, the securities markets have experienced an increase in activity and the potential for volatility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42550.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history accompanying the Market Reform Act noted the Commission's limited ability to analyze the causes of the significant market declines of October 1987 and 1989. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission's inability to analyze trading activity was attributed to its lack of specific statutory authority to gather broad-based samples of investor trading information.

Rep. No. 524, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (June 5, 1990) (reporting H.R. 3657) (``House Report'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Proposing Release, the Commission proposed rules that defined the term large trader, required the disclosure of a large trader's identity and accounts to the Commission or others, and provided for the assignment of unique identifying numbers to large traders. The proposed rule also required broker-dealers that carry large trader accounts to maintain records of identified large trader transactions as well as transactions of those persons who have not identified themselves, but whom the broker-dealer knew or had reason to know were large traders. In addition, the proposed rule required broker-dealers to report large trader transactions in machine-readable form through the industry's existing electronic bluesheet system to the Commission upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission solicited comments on various aspects of the proposed rule, including the definition of a large trader, the identifying and reporting activity thresholds, exemptions, Form 13H filing requirements, execution time recordkeeping and reporting, and the proposed rule's application to foreign entities. The Commission was particularly sensitive to the burdens imposed by the proposed system and sought alternatives that would reduce such burdens and still accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission received 77 written comments on the proposed rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, members of the Division of Market Regulation met on numerous occasions with the Securities Industry Association (``SIA''), the American Bankers Association, the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (``SIAC''), and two broker-dealers, to answer questions and discuss issues related to the operation of the proposed system and its impact on market participants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The comment letters and the Division of Market Regulation's summary thereof have been placed in the Commission's public files.

The commenters generally sought clarification of ``who'' would be a large trader, ``what'' information must be disclosed on Form 13H, and ``when'' Form 13H or trade report information must be submitted. These concerns were manifested in specific questions and comments regarding the rules for aggregation, the definitions of ownership and control, the scope of Form 13H information, and time frames for filing Form 13H. The commenters also addressed the identifying activity level, exemptions, and the duty to supervise compliance with the proposed rule. Finally, the broker-dealer community raised several concerns regarding the technical aspects of the reporting requirements for execution times, multiple large trader identification numbers (``LTID''), and the time frame for submitting trade reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were received from seven types of market participants and regulatory organizations, which may be grouped as follows: 12 broker-dealers; 24 investment advisers; 13 industry or professional associations; 8 banks or trust companies; 6 regulatory organizations; 4 law firms; and 9 other affected market participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

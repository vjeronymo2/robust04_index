			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Sellafield nears US military deal Nitric acid contaminated with uranium from a US atomic weapons plant may be reprocessed at Sellafield, Cumbria. Between 15 and 20 shipments a year are proposed, together worth about Dollars 500m (Pounds 325m) to British Nuclear Fuels. The material would come from a closed US military reprocessing plant that is being cleaned up under a programme to deal with sites contaminated by the military. UK government policy is that countries should handle their own waste and not send it overseas. But BNFL said last night the material was not waste. Uranium was regularly imported into the UK to make fuel for power stations. 'The import of uranium in the acid is no different as the acid will be re-used and the separated uranium can also be re-used.' The purified uranium would be owned by the US and would be stored at Capenhurst, Cheshire</p>

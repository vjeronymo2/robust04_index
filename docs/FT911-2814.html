			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Property: Mr Ridley's rectory - How an MP created a country idyll IN 1959 the newly adopted Conservative Party candidate for the Cirencester and Tewkesbury Division of Gloucestershire recalls being 'bear-led around the constituency and being introduced to everyone. We were visiting Naunton and I saw this house; it was empty and I asked who owned it and if it was for sale.' The Old Rectory in this Cotswolds village had been empty for four years and was in dire need of repair. 'The roof was falling in and the garden was untouched, but I did get to meet the owner and, in the end, he let me buy it.' Thirty years on and Right Honourable Nicholas Ridley PC MP, one-time Treasury Minister, Minister of Transport and former Secretary of State for the Environment, is planning to move back to the north of England. In the years taking him from hopeful parliamentary candidate to outspoken national figure, Ridley and his family have steadily restored The Old Rectory and transformed its acre of garden. 'The River Windrush runs along one side of the garden. The land is part of the flood plain of the river so you could dig a channel to let the river in  -and, hopefully, out - and create running water gardens.' Having never tackled a garden before the move, 30 years of channel-digging, planting and pruning have turned the bare acre into a lively, part-formally terraced, part-wild setting for the house complete with three distinct water gardens. No self-respecting Grade II Listed Queen Anne rectory could be without a croquet lawn. In this case - or so the Naunton villagers insist - The Old Rectory's copper beech and wisteria-framed grass can claim literary status as the template for the croquet lawn in Alice in Wonderland. 'Other places do lay claim to being the garden that Lewis Carroll had in mind,' says Ridley, 'but we do know that Carroll - Cannon Dodgeson - visited the rectory when the Reverend Litton was here . . . and it is the ideal croquet lawn.' The materials of the area dictated against any Churchillian brick laying. But Cotswold stone proved no bar to a resourceful homeowner with a dilapidated house with all the converted zeal of a born-again gardener. The stone walled grounds and stone terracing, up to full formal arch standard, bear witness to Ridley's claim to have acquired the masons' art. As for the six-bedroom house, that has been a progressive restoration job carried out as the family could afford the work. 'We did have to do an enormous amount of work and it cost a great deal more to restore the house than to buy it in the first place. I think that we finished the last of the outbuildings around six to ten years ago, and the house as a whole is in good condition now.' The rectory is too large for the Ridleys these days, and as he is not to stand for the seat at the next general election he plans to find a smaller house and a larger garden in the north, possibly in Cumbria. Patrick Ramsey of sale agents Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) will be aiming to agree a reserve asking price for The Old Rectory at a final planning meeting this weekend. The odds are on a guide price not that far short of Pounds 1m. 'We really don't know at the moment,' says Ridley, 'but we are under no pressure to sell. We'll see what happens.'</p>

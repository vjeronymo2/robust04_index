			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Sure way to demoralise trainees Sir, In all the comment on the activities of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, no mention seems to have been made of the effect of delays in implementing NVQs on those who are meant to have been benefiting - the trainees themselves. I have been helping a client planning to introduce NVQs across the complete spectrum of his employees. Encouraged by a grant obtained through the local Training and Enterprise Council, and committed to the principle of a better trained workforce, the company started young trainees on Level 1 last autumn in a pilot scheme. They are now reaching the stage when they should be assessed on at least part of their work. Considerable time and money has been invested to ensure that trainers have been trained, assessors accredited (a pre-condition of the grant), and the whole workforce involved in planning a wider programme to cover everyone. We were assured by the industry lead body, which has been helping in the training, that standards would be set and assessment processes validated by the end of March. Enthusiasm and commitment has been generated at all levels. We now learn that not only has the date slipped, but that we may not have approved procedures even by the year end. It is difficult to discover who is to blame. What is of equal concern is that no-one outside the company seems to be worried or surprised. In the meantime, we are faced with the consequences of much wasted effort and a potentially demoralised staff, whose enthusiasm will be that much more difficult to re-kindle. What price now the government's undertaking that 80 per cent of the national workforce would be covered by NVQs in 1992?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia says Indonesia's closure of three news  magazines is a sign of a society in a state of transition.  Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says Indonesia's  Government is having to deal with the consequences of greater  openness. Senator Evans said Australia must take a long-term  view and build a relationship with Indonesia which will survive  the current generation of leaders. Senator Evans said the prime  minister, Paul Keating, would make a judgment when he visited  Jakarta next week on the most productive way to convey the  strong Australian and international perception about the ban.    [Begin Evans recording] I think we are seeing here simply a  society in transition, which is more focussed on its internal  difficulties and transition processes, the move to openness --  the consequences of that is negative as perceived by the  government as well as positive -- rather than a society that is,  at the moment in this respect, paying very much attention to  anybody externally. [sentence as heard] It's to be hoped of  course that, particularly with an internal reaction which was  generated, and the extent to which political openness has  already become a mainstream part of Indonesian society rather  than [words indistinct] go on and it would be more of a matter,  I think, that internal reaction would produce on the ground than  any other overt external pressure. [sentence as heard] [end  recording]</p>

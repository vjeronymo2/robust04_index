			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN'S SPELLMAN STAYS FOR THE SHOW IN 11-INNING WIN  </P> <P> They held a magic show at Cal State Northridge on Saturday that even Doug  Henning would have admired.  </P> <P> As the stunned Cal State Sacramento players watched, the amazing Bill Kernen,  coach of the Matadors, pulled not one, but two rabbits out of his hat.  </P> <P> The first, freshman Eric Spellman, who had pitched 8 2/3 innings all season,  went the distance in Northridge's 2-1, 11-inning victory over Sacramento,  ranked third in NCAA Division II.  </P> <P> The second, junior Greg Hansen, in his fifth at-bat of the season, powered the  game-winning home run over the left-field wall in the 11th.  </P> <P> "Unbelievable," Kernen said after Northridge improved to 22-14-1 with the  nonconference win. "If anybody can ever figure this game out, he'll be the  first guy."  </P> <P> It was, indeed, a day of intangibles.  </P> <P> Sacramento (29-13), runner-up in the Division II College World Series last  season, sent its ace, junior right-hander Erik Bennett, against the Matadors.  Bennett had struck out 104 batters in 78 2/3 innings and had an earned-run  average of 1.49.  </P> <P> Northridge, short on healthy hurlers, countered with Spellman, a walk-on from  Royal High who had not pitched since Feb. 17 and who had an ERA of 4.15.  </P> <P> So what happens? Bennett pitches six innings of two-hit ball before tiring and  leaving with the score tied, 1-1.  </P> <P> Spellman (2-0), relying primarily on a hard slider and off-speed pitch,  shackled the usually hard-hitting Hornets, limiting them to seven singles and a  bloop double. He struck out two and walked two.  </P> <P> "I didn't know I was starting until I read the paper today (Saturday). I went  'Whoa,' " Spellman said. "So I came down here and put it on the line."  </P> <P> Said Sacramento Coach John Smith: "Whatever he was throwing was dancing around  the plate and we couldn't hit it. He showed a lot of courage staying out there  for 11 innings."  </P> <P> Northridge took a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Craig Clayton led off with a  single and Mike Solar followed with a walk. Chae-Ho Chong grounded to third  baseman Shawn Blankenship, who bobbled the potential double-play ball and  settled for a force at second.  </P> <P> Anton Siegl followed with a sacrifice fly to right-center.  </P> <P> Sacramento tied the score in the fifth. Ryan Kato led off with a single and  took second on a sacrifice bunt by Blankenship. Kato moved to third on a ground  out, then scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Both teams had a chance to win in the ninth. The Hornets had three hits in the  inning, but catcher Rusty McLain threw out pinch-runner Steve Furchner at  second, and Denny Vigo turned Quinn Gregory's hard smash into a double play to  turn Sacramento away.  </P> <P> Siegl led off the Matador ninth with a double but was unable to advance as  reliever Bob Blankenship (4-2) shut Northridge down.  </P> <P> But Hansen, who entered the game as a pinch-runner in the ninth, ended it in  the 11th by driving a Blankenship fastball over the wall in left.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eddie Mabo's legacy of fear for Australian miners - A judgment named after an obscure aborigine is threatening the industry IN MINING circles, the best known name in Australia is not Paul Keating, the prime minister, but Eddie Mabo, an obscure aboriginal activist who lived all his life on an isolated island off the tropical north coast. Mr Mabo, who died last year, gave his name to a historic judgment by Australia's High Court which many mining companies claim is a threat to the future of the resources industry. Both the Labor government and the conservative opposition have played down the implications of the Mabo case, partly in order to avoid a damaging row with aboriginal activists. However, Australia's approaching federal election has focussed attention on the multitude of questions raised by the case that will face whichever is in government after polling day, March 13. The uncertainty flows from a High Court ruling that Mr Mabo's Meriam aboriginal group owns Murray Island, which lies in the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea. The significance of this is the court's recognition that a form of 'native title' may exist where ownership of land has not been explicitly transferred to private hands - for example, by freehold sale. The judgment was greeted with jubilation by aboriginal activists because it extinguishes the constitutional doctrine that Australia was terra nullius, or unoccupied, when European settlement began in 1788. In the long-term, the judgment will help to legitimise aboriginal claims that Australia's indigenous inhabitants were disposessed by British settlers and may increase pressure on the government to negotiate a treaty. More immediately, however, it has prompted claims from aborigines and mining groups alike that other areas, many of which include mines or mining prospects, may be open to similar land claims. Already, aboriginal groups have indicated that ownership claims will be made on much of the Kimberleys region of Western Australia and the Nabalco bauxite mine at Gove in the Northern Territory. Other claims have been discussed, though not yet filed, on MIM Holdings' McArthur River lead/zinc/silver project in the territory and most of central Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland. More claims are likely according to Mr Mick Dodson, director of the Northern Land Council, an aboriginal advisory group, who says 'blanket land claims' across Australia are likely to prove a 'gold mine' for aborigines. The ruling was the last straw for many people in the mining industry, which was already concerned about the federal government's decision to block a gold project at Coronation Hill because of Aboriginal religious objections. Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman of Western Mining Corporation, says the ruling raises doubts about the legality of existing mines and warns that new projects may be delayed or cancelled. Ironically, the federal government has made determined efforts over the last year to overcome unease about the Coronation Hill decision by establishing a 'fast tracking' approval mechanism for major projects. The accelerated approval procedure is likely to be undermined, however, if projects are made the subject of land claims relying on the precedent of the Mabo decision. MIM, for example, received approval within nine months for the ADollars 250m (Pounds 120m) McArthur River project. It believes it holds legal title to the area and intends to press on with development. It is not clear, however, how the title granted under existing legislation would be affected if the Northern Land Council went ahead with its threat to file a land claim. This is because the High Court judgment says that native title exists only where aboriginal groups can prove continuous occupation or close association with the land being claimed. In addition, the extent of the native title would depend on the traditional rights of the aborigines concerned, which might vary from full ownership to hunting or fishing rights. A further complication is that native title is likely to have been extinguished by mining titles issued before 1975, most of which effectively transferred the land to private ownership. However, most mining titles issued since 1975 would not extinguish native title because of the provisions of the federal Racial Discrimination Act, which prevents the abolition of land claim rights without compensation. Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC's managing director, has called on the federal government to ease the problem by repealing the Race Discrimination Act. However, such a step is unlikely because it would breach Australia's international treaty obligations. An alternative approach would be for mining companies to reach specific agreements with local aboriginal groups under which they would trade compensation for a binding agreement that no land claim would be made. Zapopan, a small mining company, recently reached such an agreement with the Jawoyn aborigines which will allow the development of a gold mine at Mount Todd, about 300 km (180 miles) south of Darwin. Other mining groups say, however, that this strategy is fraught with danger because of the fragmented nature of aboriginal society. 'It is impossible to know whether the people signing have the authority to sign on behalf of all the groups which may have an association with the area,' says an executive involved in land claims negotiations. Faced with this uncertainty both the government and the Liberal/National Party coalition have promised consultations with aboriginal and mining groups to try to find an agreed solution. The coalition has said it would legislate 'if necessary', but has not explained how the legislation would work. Nor has it supported threats by the conservative Northern Territory government to block land claims by legislation. Mr Gregory McIntyre, the Perth lawyer who represented Mr Mabo, says it may be possible to resolve some of the claims by negotiation, or by legislation that clarifies aboriginal rights. But the complexity of the judgment means that many cases will have to be decided by the courts, prolonging the uncertainty for miners and aborigines alike. 'The only alternative would be for the High Court to rule in the next test case that mining rights extinguish native title (in all cases),' Mr McIntyre says. 'That would put an ened to all the uncertainty. But if the court rules favourably for the Aboriginal people then there would be a drawn out process of claims being made.'</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Engineering slide expected to last into 1992 BRITAIN'S engineering industry is unlikely to see any real recovery from the recession until at least mid 1992 and has not yet reached the bottom of the current downturn, according to a gloomy forecast by the Engineering Employers' Federation. Output, productivity, employment and exports are all still dropping, the EEF said yesterday in its spring 1991 trends report. Employment is forecast to fall a further 90,000 by this time next year to 1.9m, making a total reduction of 210,000 over three years. Mr Peter Brighton, director general, said the EEF's forecasts 'obviously differed' from those of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who this week forecast a slow recovery in output in the second half of this year. Mr Brighton said he disagreed with the view of some in industry that the upturn is already happening. 'The rate of decline is decreasing, but we haven't reached the bottom' in manufacturing industry, he said. He ger-term effects of a further decline in British manufacturing. 'The simple thing is that our manufacturing base is now down at a level where it will not be able to cope with the upturn,' he said. That was the main reason why the EEF was relatively pessimistic about the mid-term outlook for engineering exports. In the more immediate future, it sees the decline in engineering exports, which began in the second half of last year, continuing this year, before recovering slowly in the first half of 1992. The one relatively bright spot was in motor vehicle exports, which rose sharply at the end of last year and are expected to stay high. In contrast, domestic demand for vehicles is very weak. The EEF has 5,000 member companies in electronics, computers, electrical and mechanical engineering, motor vehicles, aerospace and shipbuilding. It said the recession was affecting virtually the entire industry. Engineering output is estimated to have fallen about 8 per cent between the first halves of 1990 and 1991 and a further decline of 2 per cent is forecast between the first six months of 1991 and 1992. Sales by the engineering sector this year are forecast at about Pounds 128bn  -of which Pounds 50bn are for export - compared with Pounds 136bn in 1990, and Pounds 117bn 10 years earlier . All figures are at 1991 prices. The EEF said productivity - output volume per person - had dropped in spite of falling employment, but further job cuts this year and next would prevent productivity from falling below early-1991 levels.

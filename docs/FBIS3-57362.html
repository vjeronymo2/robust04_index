He was a former  Russian ambassador to the United States. How can the State Duma  influence the formulation of Russian foreign policy? More from  our parliamentary correspondent, who interviewed Vladimir Lukin.    [Unidentified correspondent] Primarily, under the  Constitution, the State Duma shall or shall not ratify  international treaties concluded on behalf of the country. The  State Duma also approves of the foreign policy articles in the  budget. Besides, under the Constitution, the State Duma will  agree upon Russia's ambassadors to foreign countries'  appointments and withdrawals.    We shall see to it that these responsible posts are filled  with the persons who can respectfully present Russia's  interests, said Vladimir Lukin. When asked to respond if he had  shared the viewpoint that the Russian Foreign Ministry paid  insufficient attention to the Asia and Pacific region, he said  that this is exactly so. A foreign policy is first and foremost  the accomplishment of specific results, significant to the  country concerned. From this point of view, our Asiatic  policies do leave much to be desired.    He goes on to say that Russia's foreign minister, Andrey  Kozyrev, is to visit China shortly. I wish his visit could  produce good results. And in his final remarks, Vladimir Lukin  stressed that we would need specific accomplishments in the  foreign policy we pursued, and this would relate not only to  China, but to other Asian countries as well.</p>

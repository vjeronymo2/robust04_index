			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sharp recovery buoys Howden HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern that was brought low by a contract to supply tunnelling machines to Denmark, showed a sharp recovery to Pounds 5.81m in pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31. This compared with Pounds 214,000 last time, which was overshadowed by tribulations over the Pounds 41m contract to supply four machines to bore twin rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway. Howden said yesterday the dispute with MT Group, its customer, was being fought out in courts in Denmark and Scotland. It still had not been paid the Pounds 10m outstanding on the contract. MT's claim for damages exceeded the Pounds 12m contractual limit 'by a large margin'. No provisions had been made for either amount. The board had taken this decision based on legal advice, the insurance position and its substantial counter claim. In July Howden announced a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 30.6m to reduce borrowings of nearly Pounds 76m, compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 60.3m at the end of April. Howden said yesterday that net debt at the half-way stage was about Pounds 45m, gearing of less than 50 per cent. It was being reduced further in the second half. Turnover fell from Pounds 148m to Pounds 138.3m. Work on the Great Belt machines had pushed up the figure in the previous period and their completion more than accounted for the turnover decline. Operating profit jumped from Pounds 4m to Pounds 9.1m and interest costs were reduced to Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 3.78m). As the rights issue cash was only in for two months, a greater benefit would be felt in the second half. Howden said the air and gas division, which accounts for 50 per cent of the business, gave an encouraging performance. In construction and mining - just over 25 per cent of sales  - Wirth exceeded expectations. Defence and aerospace markets had been slowed down by the 'peace dividend', but the division continued to produce good profits. Processing and packaging had experienced some softness in demand from food companies. The interim dividend, which was maintained at 1.59p last time in spite of 0.7p losses per share, is cut to 0.7p. This resumes payments after a passed final. Interim earnings per share were 2.2p, adjusted for the rights issue.</p>

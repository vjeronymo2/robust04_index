			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / EC proposes airline 'open skies' next year EUROPEAN airlines could be free to set their own fares from the beginning of next year, according to proposals under consideration by European Community governments. Mr Karel van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, said yesterday in London there were growing signs that a majority of EC governments favoured accelerating the process of liberalisation of European air transport. This included giving airlines freedom to fix air fares and introducing cabotage, enabling an airline from one EC country to operate domestic flights in another member state. EC transport ministers will consider the third stage in the Community's air transport liberalisation programme at a meeting in Brussels next week. That meeting would not take a final decision on the third package of liberalisation measures but a final agreement is expected in June, Mr van Miert said. This would clear the way for 'open skies' in Europe from the start of next year. Mr van Miert said he had been pleasantly surprised by the progress and degree of consensus emerging among EC governments on the latest air transport package. 'Work has progressed well and goes beyond what we originally felt was possible,' he said. Agreement to allow airlines freedom to fix their fares would represent an important breakthrough. But the Commission would retain powers to ensure airlines did not abuse any dominant position or attempted to drive out weaker competitors through predatory pricing and dumping. Under the current system, scheduled air fares in Europe are governed by the 'double disapproval' system whereby an airline can be stopped introducing a new fare between two EC countries if the governments of both countries oppose it. Mr van Miert suggested a system of 'consecutive cabotage' as a first step towards full cabotage could start as early as next year. 'This would enable an airline like British Airways to fly from London to Paris and then on to Nice or some other place in France,' he explained. Agreement also appears to have been reached on the criteria of licencing airlines in Europe. An airline could be established anywhere in the Community as long as it was 51 per cent owned by EC citizens. But Mr van Miert acknowledged the larger EC carriers were unhappy with the Commission's proposals to set up a system of allocating 'slots' at busy European airports to new entrants and smaller airlines. There were also difficulties in reaching the necessary balance on a policy for airline mergers and partnerships to ensure European airlines could expand to compete against large foreign carriers by forging cross-border links at the same time as not undermining competition rules. Transport ministers from 28 European countries yesterday agreed to help east European states upgrade their air traffic control systems and improve air links with western Europe. This is part of the effort to harmonise and integrate Europe's fragmented and inefficient air traffic control network.</p>

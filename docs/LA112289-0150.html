			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FACTORY ORDERS FALL, TRIGGERING RECESSION FEARS  </P> <P> Orders to U.S. factories for "big ticket" durable goods fell 0.6% in October,  the second consecutive monthly decline, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- items expected to last  three or more years -- dipped to a seasonally adjusted $124.59 billion last  month after a 1.1% drop in September.  </P> <P> Although the October decline had been expected, the real surprise was a sharp  revision to the orders number for September, which a month ago had been  reported as a small increase of 0.2%.  </P> <P> The back-to-back declines in orders provided fresh evidence that the U.S.  manufacturing sector is facing a severe slowdown. Many economists are  forecasting that the country will dip close to a recession in the coming six  months as a slump in manufacturing spills over into the rest of the economy.  </P> <P> Much of the weakness has been in the auto industry, where weak sales have  prompted layoffs and production cutbacks.  </P> <P> For October, transportation orders rose by 3% to $33.54 billion, recouping some  of a giant 10.8% drop in September.  </P> <P> However, the October strength came from increased demand for military ships and  civilian aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles were down again.  </P> <P> The total demand for defense equipment fell by 12.4% to $9.33 billion. However,  this followed a huge 33.9% increase in military orders in September.  </P> <P> The September advance had originally been reported as an even larger 60%  increase, but the Commerce Department said changes in the original company  reports triggered a big downward revision that transformed the overall  September figure from a small positive to the big decline.  </P></p>

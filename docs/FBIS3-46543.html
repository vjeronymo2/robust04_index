"The North Korean nuclear problem, which is of ultimate  importance to the survival of the 70 million Korean people,  should be solved early this year at the latest," Kim said in a  New Year's ceremony at Chongwadae [presidential offices]  attended by presidential secretaries and guards.    "We had many difficulties trying to solve the nuclear  problem  because we needed inter-Korean negotiations and because we had a  counterpart to negotiate with."    He also mentioned rice market opening.    "It is important for us to save our agricultural  communities.  Rice will be imported beginning next year, but the government  will buy and process it all for reexport," he said.    On industrial relations, he emphasized stability and said  that the businesses need stable relations between labor and  management to develop advanced technology and make excellent  goods, which is necessary to win the competition on the  international market.</p>

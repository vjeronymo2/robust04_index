			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Filatov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The land code will give a  fresh impetus to the land reform in Russia," Nikolay Komov,  chairman of the Russian Committee for Land Resources and Land  Management, told ITAR-TASS after the draft's discussion by the  Presidium of the Russian Government.    Asked why this code was necessary, Komov mentioned four  principal reasons: Firstly, the number of parties to land  relations has lately increased sharply, reaching 60 million  families. This process is continuing due to the extensive  development of entrepreneurship, private housing construction,  increasing number of private farms, development of horticulture,  vegetable-growing, and subsidiary farming. Secondly, new rights  to own land have appeared, as well as new legal grounds on which  citizens and legal persons can obtain land and effect  transactions with it. Thirdly, one now has to pay for the right  to acquire land and to use it. And, fourthly, the  redistribution of land (land circulation) has become much  faster. A land market has appeared.    Komov said that the draft land code includes 21 chapters.  They reflect the main directions of Russia's land policy, the  right to own land and other rights, the competence of state  bodies and local self-government organs in land matters, the  legal and economic mechanism for dealing with them, the status  of agricultural, forest, urban, specially protected and other  lands. Important attention is given to the protection of the  priceless land wealth, land management, state land evaluation  and registration of the right to own land plots, and to  transactions with them.    Komov particularly noted that the document includes for the  first time a chapter on "land transactions", laying down clearly  the procedures for concluding deals with land plots and land  shares, obtained during the reorganisation of collective and  state farms. The proclaimed rights of citizens and legal persons  are still not legislatively regulated even now that Russia is  switching over to a market economy. There is no mechanism or  procedure for obtaining land (for money or free of charge), or  for renting it on a termless basis. An owner cannot mortgage  his land, cannot use is as a contribution to some fixed capital,  cannot present it as a gift or to exchange it. It is  practically impossible to dispose of a land share at one's own  discretion, because it is granted only for farming purposes.  There is also no procedure for buying out land needed by the  state or the municipal authorities. Today, it is even  impossible to replenish the land redistribution fund for  carrying out many state programmes or to confiscate land from  lazy owners and to transfer or sell it to efficient farmers.    In addition to legally guaranteeing the rights of citizens  and juridical persons to freely own, use and dispose of their  land in their own interests, the draft code also contains some  restrictions on land deals, preventing latifundism in Russia.    Komov also noted that legal norms for the land around large  apartment houses have been fixed for the first time. These land  plots, within the established limits, may be owned jointly by  the dwellers (in the form of condominiums).    The proposed draft land code, Komov believes, allows to  eliminate the blank spots in the existing legislation and to  place land relationships on a solid economic basis. It reflects  the novelty and complexity of the land situation in Russia. At  the same time, the document is understandable and convenient not  only for specialists, but for all the citizens of the country.    After discussing the draft, the Presidium of the Russian  Government instructed corresponding bodies to make the necessary  amendments in it and to submit the document to the State Duma  for approval.</p>

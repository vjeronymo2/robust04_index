			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Euro Disney: The Story So Far - A question of the mouse's attraction THE EURO DISNEY fantasy has so far enticed 1.5m holidaymakers. However, this buoyant beginning conceals worries about its longer-term prospects. European capitals report interest and substantial initial bookings but selling this US culture experience to Europeans will become more difficult as economic uncertainty continues and winter approaches. In the UK, P&amp;O Euro-Ferries said the first three months' packages have 'sold so well that we had to go back to Euro Disney to ask for greater hotel room allocation'. P&amp;O added that it has sold more than 70 per cent of its packages for the first three months, and that bookings for the peak summer months are at that level. The UK operator Airtours declined to give monthly figures for sales but said that it had sold 70 per cent of its allocations up to December. The UK coach operator Wallace Arnold has an allocation of 25,000 packages up to March 1993. It said that so far 14,000 have been sold. It would not give a monthly breakdown. Other UK operators also declined to give details of monthly bookings but stated they were achieving 70 per cent of their target. British Airways Holidays (a subsidiary of British Airways) said that 'bookings are exceeding our budget for June and will probably be the same in July and August'. However, BA Holidays added that, so far, September is 'considerably quieter', with less than 20 per cent of its projected bookings being taken up. BA Holidays' figures for the last two months of 1992 are even lower: November, 12 per cent and December, 10 per cent. Bookings for the start of 1993 are lower still. BA Holidays said: 'We don't think it's going to be easy trying to market Euro Disney in the winter but we have to persuade people of the attraction of not having any queues then.' It added: 'So long as people dress up warmly and make sure they are waterproofed' then a wintery Eurodisney might not be unattractive. It is perhaps no coincidence that tour operators claim to be achieving a 70 per cent sales target, yet are reluctant to give monthly breakdowns. Euro Disney yesterday confirmed that part of its agreement with designated tour operators is that the operators guarantee fulfilling their allocated hotel room quotas by 70 per cent; if they fail to achieve that, then they, not Euro Disney, are liable for the cost of the vacant hotel rooms. In France, the consensus among operators and travel agents is that interest was high immediately after the park's opening, but has since declined. Mr Jean Luc Durovraz, director of development at VPS Voyages, one of France's largest coach operators, said: 'After very strong interest in the first few weeks' sales and advance bookings had fallen by 'about 20 or 30 per cent' since the middle of May. RATP, operating the railway link between Paris and the theme park, supports that. Its daily ticket sales to Euro Disney (to both French and foreign travellers) peaked in late April and early May - reaching a record of 26,000 on Saturday May 2 - but has since fallen. Mr Durovraz said it was too early to say whether the recent reduction in demand reflected a long-term disenchantment with Euro Disneyland, or if it was due to seasonal factors like the recent profusion of national holidays in France. Mr Jean Pierre Bouteillier, marketing director of Visit France, the tour operator owned by Air France, said the present level of interest in Euro Disneyland was 'satisfactory', but added that his company had 'absolutely no idea what to expect' from it. Mr Durovraz suspects that Euro Disney may have a longer term problem, in that it is trying to sell a US leisure concept incompatible with French leisure trends. French consumers 'are uncomfortable with the US idea of spending a lot of money on a one-day trip to a single site.' Spanish travel agents have only recently begun a concerted campaign to sell Euro Disney. The two largest hotel and travel operations say interest has exceeded their expectations. 'It could not be better,' said Ms Rosa Paramio, chief of planning at the Corte Ingles agency. She was, nevertheless, unable to give precise figures. At Eurodisney Utell, a Spanish hotel agency specialising in Euro Disney reservations, Ms Avelina Iglesias said she had been 'very surprised' at the rate of bookings for Euro Disney hotels. But Euro Disney will in the next few years face competition from a Dollars 500m theme park being built near Barcelona by Anheuser Busch and a Catalan financier, Mr Javier de la Rosa.

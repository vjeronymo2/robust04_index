			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> APPOINTED OFFICIALS SILENT  </P> <P> The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. has been actively involved in trying to  mitigate the scope of a three-story monolithic shopping center, encompassing  one full city block, which is proposed for construction on Ventura Boulevard  between Ventura Canyon Avenue and Woodman Avenue.  </P> <P> We have had consistent acknowledgment and support from all of our elected  officials throughout our campaign to fight this inappropriate intrusion into  our neighborhood.  </P> <P> Namely, Councilmen Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, and City Atty. James Hahn.  </P> <P> However, what is the score card for appointed officials? Zero. On April 18 our  subcommittee for this project sent a four-page letter, along with almost 2,000  signatures on a petition, to Mr. Kenneth Topping, director of planning in the  Department of City Planning. This letter and the petition specifically  addressed the issue of this Ventura-Woodman project and the vital environmental  factors which we felt qualified the project for an Environmental Impact Report.  This parcel was sent by certified mail.  </P> <P> It has been more than two months and we have had absolutely no response  whatsoever.  </P> <P> Does this suggest an arrogance and irresponsibility on the part of appointed  officials?  </P> <P> RICHARD R. McCURDY  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

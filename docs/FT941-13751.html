			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Domino Printing Sciences - Other Companies A tough and erratic year for continuous ink jet printer makers is expected to be reflected in Domino Printing Sciences' results tomorrow. One of the leaders in a market dominated by UK-owned companies, Domino's share price started sliding from 620p to a current 435p earlier in the year when it warned that interim profits would be a fifth down on expectations. Despite continuing sluggishness in the US and Germany, there has been some recovery and the company is expected to show some advance on last year's revenues of Pounds 71.6m with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 11.9m.</p>

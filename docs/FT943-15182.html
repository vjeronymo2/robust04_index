			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Brazil's monetary move connected with presidential campaign Sir, As mentioned in your article, 'Brazil expected to limit issue of new currency' (June 28), the central bank's strict control of the 'real', that country's new money which came into existence on July 1, 'is one of the key mechanisms the government hopes will prevent inflation creeping into the new currency'. But, perhaps more importantly, Brazil's new, tight monetary policy must be seen, at least in part, as a political move intended to spark the lifeless campaign of presidential candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This is not the first time Brazil's leaders have politicised economic policy. In February 1986, President Jose Sarney introduced the Cruzado Plan with a peremptory price freeze. Although inflation dropped from 22.4 per cent to -0.9 per cent, after Sarney's party won 22 of 23 governorships in November elections, the freeze was smartly lifted. Not surprisingly, inflation sky-rocketed to 7.6 per cent in December. In 1990, Brazil's newly-elected president, Fernando Collor de Mello, waited until the day after his inauguration to present a Draconian anti-inflationary plan that sent his country into a brutal recession. Now, with leftist Workers Party's presidential candidate, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, threatening to dislodge the ruling Brazilian Social Democratic Party, the current president, Itamar Franco, discovered compelling reasons to declare the real would be pegged to the dollar at 1:1. By fixing the exchange rate, inflation should fall because the government is essentially making a commitment not to print additional reals to pay its bills. But Franco already has rescinded his pledge to allow for the free convertability of the real. If he had decided otherwise, Brazilians might have rushed to buy dollars in fear of a potentially victorious Lula halting payments on domestic debt. The result would be an exchange crisis far worse than that at the end of the Cruzado plan, with Cardoso's defeat being a foregone conclusion. The problem with Franco's new currency strategy is not so much its contents as its timing. By introducing the plan three months prior to the ballot, Franco is betting that lower inflation will help defeat Lula at the polls in October. If Franco is wrong, however, and he has to increase public spending to pay off the special interests which traditionally have dominated Brazilian electoral politics, inevitably inflation will re-emerge. Renewed inflation would not only kill Cardoso's presidential aspirations, but also demonstrate once again to the world financial community that Brazil's economy is more often than not merely a political tool for its rulers to manipulate.

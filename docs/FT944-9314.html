			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Little evidence of poor performers being prime takeover targets Sir, In a recently published book, Hostile Takeovers: Defence, Attack and Corporate Governance (McGraw Hill), we report that there is little evidence that targets of takeovers are poorly performing firms experiencing either earnings or dividend reductions or below average stock market performance. Reviewing the book (FT Review of Business Books: 'Handle with care', November 2), David Wighton suggests that, during periods of rising earnings, companies with below average growth rather than declining earnings and dividends may also be legitimate targets of bids. Even if this were true, it simply does not apply: more than 80 per cent of the targets where we report no evidence of poor performance actually experienced earnings increases above the market average. In regard to stock market returns, Wighton suggests that anticipation of bids may have inflated targets' share prices, causing poor performance to be disguised. We specifically avoid this problem by allowing poor performance to be revealed up to two years before the bid: 70 per cent of the targets with above average stock market performance outperformed two as well as one year before the bid. Contrary to the impression created by the review, the book is not primarily about performance; others have provided more detailed evidence in support of the above. Instead, the book examines the strategies employed by raider and target company. The detailed case studies reveal that hostile bids are frequently motivated by strategic objectives of the raider rather than poor performance of targets. It is a pity that the review of the book makes no mention of one of its main observations, and that is the few defences which targets can employ once, in particular, cash bids have been launched. The book argues that shareholders should be able voluntarily to implement takeover defences, as they commonly do in virtually every country outside the UK, on the grounds that a large group of dispersed shareholders may be unable to commit to particular corporate policies in the absence of such self-denying ordinances. On the basis of evidence from several recent studies, the burden of proof that the UK should have the most liberal hostile takeover market of any country in the world, including the US, now rests firmly in the hands of those who wish to establish that no consequential damage is imposed on target companies.

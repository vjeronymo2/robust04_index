			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: BDA still in profit BDA Holdings, architects, consultants and property developers, has stayed in profit, making Pounds 6,000 pre-tax for the half year ended July 31 1992. Mr Brian Duker, chairman, said the profit - Pounds 1,000 down on last time - was achieved despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 733,000 and the ongoing effects of the recession in London and the south-east. No provisions have been made for any reduction in values of property and sites, as it was considered the current values reflected their value to the group. Earnings per share were 0.03p (0.04p). The marketing of the two remaining areas of office accommodation at Chingford and Ilford continued, the chairman said.</p>

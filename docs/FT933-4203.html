			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Trickle turns into a torrent - China THE Chinese motor vehicle market and industry is currently one of the world's most dynamic automotive sectors. During the 1980s, several Chinese companies concluded licensing agreements with foreign vehicle manufacturers for the local assembly of selected models. Joint ventures with foreign companies also began to make their appearance in a trickle of deals which has recently turned into a torrent. There has been what has, at times, looked almost like a rush by western vehicle manufacturers to put down a marker in the rapidly-growing (and potentially very rich) Chinese market for all types of vehicles. The Chinese government has welcomed this process, with Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, citing vehicle manufacture as one of the four central pillars of Chinese industry. Technology transfer is actively sought; China is eager to learn from the expertise of the world's vehicle multinationals. The sector is very highly fragmented, with a large number of relatively small-scale operations likely to characterise the industry for the 1990s. This situation will surely start to change early in the next century, however, given the strength of the vehicle market where growth prospects seem virtually limitless. An equally important influence is the rapid growth of the Chinese economy and the liberalisation of economic and certain political attitudes, for example towards the creation of wealth and the personal ownership of the means of production. Not only will larger-scale vehicle manufacturing plants probably start to make their appearance in strength, but it is probable China will seek - either through the state or private-sector interests - to develop a truly indigenous motor vehicle design and manufacturing industry. Throughout the 1990s, the sector will concentrate on boosting output, improving efficiency and profitability, raising economies of scale and upgrading managerial and blue collar expertise and skills. Comprehensive figures for the levels of vehicle production and sales for any year in China are extremely difficult to come by, with assessments based on individual company releases and on the information put out by the China National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC). Two things are clear, however. One is the rapid growth in passenger car and commercial vehicle production and sales in recent years. According to CNAIC, output last year reached 120,000 cars - excluding the Daihatsu Charade which is also assembled in China, and Beijing Jeep's aged 2020 four-wheel-drive vehicle - and 960,000 commercial vehicles. The other is that the sector will expand throughout the 1990s. The recently published Financial Times management report, The Emerging Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry: Growth and Opportunities from South Korea to Turkey, which examines the industry in depth, is forecasting that Chinese output of passenger cars could rise to 1.9m units by 2002, and that of commercial vehicles to 1.6m units. The potential size of the market explains the scramble since the start of the 1990s by western and Japanese vehicle manufacturers to establish or expand production, assembly or licensing business in China. Germany's Volkswagen group is in the process of increasing its level of investment. It has entered into two important joint ventures. The first is the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company, which in early 1992 announced that it was to increase annual output substantially at its Shanghai facility by 1995. The second is the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, which is constructing a plant in Jilin province, scheduled to come on stream by 1995. The second-largest carmaker in China is France's PSA group, which has two joint ventures. The first is Guangzhou Peugeot which assembles the 505 in the south of China, and the second, SAW Citroen Auto, which in the autumn of 1992 began to assemble the Citroen ZX hatchback. Among other European vehicle manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz has interests in the commercial vehicle sector in China, while Italy's Iveco has a tie-up with Nanjing Motor for the production of light trucks. Two of America's Big Three are building a strong presence. Chrysler has a shareholding in the Beijing Jeep Company, which manufactures the Cherokee four-wheel-drive vehicle. At the start of 1992 General Motors formed a joint venture with the Chinese van and light truck producer, Jinbei Automotive. Most Japanese carmakers have already concluded joint ventures or technical assistance agreements in China. These ventures include Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile, the Hainan Mazda Motor and Stamping Company, the Jiangling-Isuzu Motors Company, the Changan Suzuki Automobile Company and the Shenyang Jinbei Passenger Vehicle Manufacturing Company, in which Toyota is in partnership with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. In addition, Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy Industries have technical assistance agreements with Chinese vehicle manufacturers. Other Asian vehicle producers are also eyeing opportunities in China. These include South Korea's Kia Motors, which has announced a joint venture for the assembly of passenger cars and components in Yanji City.</p>

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho issued a statement  deploring the killing, saying the Seoul government "believes  that such an unforgivable act of violence is in no way of help  to the on-going Middle East peace process."    The Korean Government calls upon all parties to prevent the  recurrence of such a tragic and terrible incident, the statement  said.    Seoul hopes that "they overcome this tragedy and continue to  exert their efforts for early realization of the Palestinian  self-rule and for settlement of permanent peace in the region  through dialogue and reconciliation."</p>

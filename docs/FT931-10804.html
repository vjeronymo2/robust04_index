			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Russia space offer The head of Russia's space agency said yesterday he was willing to agree with the US and Europe a Russian quota of three commercial satellite launches a year, out of a world market of 15 to 16 launches a year, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Mr Yuri Koptiev said this would generate badly-needed income of Dollars 200m a year. This indicates he would raise prices to western levels, to assuage fears of low-price launches by Russia's Proton rocket.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Malaysia lifts UK trade ban: British groups prepare to bid for Pounds 2bn of work as decision brings an end to strained relations Malaysia lifted its seven month-old ban on government contracts for UK companies yesterday, in a move hailed by the British government as marking the restoration of normal trade relations. Malaysia gave no reason for ending the ban, imposed in February after the Sunday Times alleged that a UK company had sought indirectly to offer bribes to senior Malaysian politicians in an effort to win a construction contract. Announcing the end of the ban, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, said: 'British companies are now eligible to participate fully in contracts and tenders. We will consider their bids on merit and competitiveness.' Mr Anwar gave no indication of what prompted yesterday's move. 'The Malaysian cabinet made the decision . . . there were no conditions attached. We just felt the time was opportune.' The decision appears to reflect concern in Kuala Lumpur that the ban was adversely affecting its economy. It follows recent informal UK government initiatives which emphasised the harm being caused to both countries. Mr John Major said: 'I am delighted that the hiccup is now behind us and that we are back to our traditional relationship.' The Confederation of British Industry called the decision 'very good news'. The CBI added that the ban had cost some British companies business but its immediate impact had not been profound, and British exports to Malaysia had risen strongly in the first half of the year. Mr Richard Needham, the British trade minister, who has visited Malaysia several times to seek to end the ban, said: 'It is a surprise but I'm delighted at the news. There is at least Pounds 2bn of business going at the moment in Malaysia which British companies can win. But you never get an order by abusing your customer.' Mr Needham has strongly criticised some British media reporting on Dr Mahathir's government. The precise cost of the ban to British exporters is not known. But one of its main results has been to exclude British companies, including GEC, Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House, from bidding for potentially highly lucrative contracts for a new international airport south of Kuala Lumpur - presently South-East Asia's largest infrastructure project. British bidders have also been excluded from tendering for some contracts in Malaysia's power sector and for some construction projects. However, the ban has not prevented British companies from continuing to bid for private sector business in Malaysia. That, along with sizeable shipments of UK defence equipment, appears to have contributed to an increase in UK exports to Malaysia to Pounds 667m in the first half of this year, up from Pounds 364m in the same period of last year. Malaysian exports to Britain fell to Pounds 582m from Pounds 774m in the same period. Malaysia relies heavily on foreign capital to finance an ambitious economic development programme. Some British and other foreign investors have expressed nervousness about doing business in a country which is perceived to be highly sensitive to outside criticism. In 1981 Dr Mahathir, angered at what he felt was British high-handedness, imposed a 'Buy British Last' policy that ended in 1988. In the following years, Malaysia became one of Britain's most successful overseas markets. Contractors relieved at lifting of ban, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] La Paz, 17 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- According to the  conclusions reached by the Military Justice Court, the arms  trafficking "affair" carried out in the name of Bolivia from  1991 to 1992 in Europe and Asia involved an estimated $59  million and a considerable number of companies and countries  linked to illegal global arms trafficking.    Defense Minister Raul Tovar Pierola disclosed this  information on 17 May at the conclusion of the ceremony honoring  the 180th anniversary of the creation of the Argentine Navy,  which was held at the Bolivian Military Naval School.    Minister Tovar also announced that the conclusions of the  summary proceedings delivered by the Military Justice Court,  which are to be submitted to authorities this week, will lead to  the "opening of criminal proceedings against approximately 70  people, among them civilians and military personnel, who are  involved in this case" for trial in the regular courts.    Tovar said: "They will all go to the regular courts because  those involved in the crimes can only be labeled common  criminals, as they have seriously harmed the nation." He did  not, however, reveal the names of the people to be accused of  criminal acts before the regular courts.    He said the number of people involved in the "affair" is  large, but refused to give their names. He admitted, however,  that there are more foreigners than nationals involved in this  case.    He added: "Many Bolivians took advantage of the  circumstances, and there is evidence that some institutions were  negligent in the fulfillment of their functions and duties."  [passage omitted]</p>

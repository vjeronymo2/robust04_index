			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Guilt and attribution - AC Grayling challenges Kate Millet's interpretation of torture THE POLITICS OF CRUELTY by Kate Millett Viking Penguin Pounds 18, 335 pages According to Amnesty International, torture is practised by more thanhalf the world's governments. The United Nations definition of torture is any act by which mental or physical suffering is intentionally inflicted by public officials, or their agents, for the purpose of securing confession or information, or for punishing or intimidating the recipient. By the end of the 19th century torture as a judicial instrument against crime had ceased almost everywhere - it was banned in Russia in 1801, in Japan in 1847, in Britain during the 18th century. But even as it vanished as an acknowledged resource, openly applied as a result of due legal process, it reappeared elsewhere as an unacknowledged and hidden weapon of the state against 'political crimes' of dissent and opposition. If it was a 'shame and reproach on mankind,' as the Tsar's ukase described it in September 1801, it has since become even more so in the hands of secret policemen everywhere. Kate Millett made her name with her best-selling Sexual Politics and has been a vigorous protester ever since. Here she turns her attention to torture and its widespread occurrence in the recent and contemporary world. She ranges widely, across the Soviet Gulag, Northern Ireland, South American dictatorships, Africa and Asia. And the range is not merely geographical; one chapter addresses the Holocaust, the next reports the case of an Algerian journalist in the hands of French soldiers. Much suffering and cruelty is recorded, prompting much sorrow and anger in response. We read in newspapers of the 'disappeared' in South America, of torture, rape, and murder in Guatemala, Argentina, Brazil. Distance makes it easy to shake one's head and pass on to the next item. Then we read of 'ethnic cleansing' and rape in Bosnia. We stir uneasily: this ugliness is in Europe, nearer home - and so soon after 1945. But, rightly, Millett will not allow us just to pass on again. If we are French, there is the scandal of Algeria to live down. If we are British, there is the fact of prisoners in Northern Ireland standing hooded for long hours, deprived of food and sleep and subjected to continuous monotonous noise. It is and should be an unpleasant shock to face such facts. British treatment of terrorist prisoners might be relatively much less severe than torture usually is - although comparisons are of little comfort to victims - but the meaning is starkly clear. It happens here too; guilt is everywhere. Because torture is a vileness it is, in one way, easy to evoke shock and concern by recounting the brute facts of it. This Millett does in the passages where she is simply reporting. Her method is to summarise a book by a torture victim, or a film, or to describe photographs of victims; in this respect her book is an anthology of paraphrases, a sort of agonising Reader's Digest of Solzhenitsyn, Primo Levi, and other sufferers. Among these summaries she intersperses her own meditations and views. Whereas the paraphrases retain something of the power of the originals - suggesting that one should read and think about them and not Millett's summaries of them - her interpolations are nowhere near as telling. The chief reason is that Millett is indiscriminate. She has her betes-noires  -one especially: 'patriarchy', that is, male-dominated culture - and her thinking is restricted to the polarities thus generated, so that she sees everything in (so to say) betes-noires and blanches. This makes her analyses crude and her advocacy on behalf of victims weaker than it should be. Her model for explaining what torture is and why it happens is Western male sexuality ('Western' because she was once married to a Japanese, she tells us; she makes no mention of Japanese wartime torture, once a by-word for the practice). She describes 'Western eroticism' as a system in which men turn women into vulnerable sexual victims, at the same time hating them for being such. This doubtful picture is then used to analogise torture. Torture is 'based on traditional ideas of domination: patriarchal order and masculinity'. Its victims are female, either actually or symbolically. Torture is hierarchy, a master-slave relationship. It exists to give pleasure to the perpetrator and to humiliate the victim. No doubt this is sometimes true, but as analysis, it merely scratches the surface. For example, Millett does not consider that a person might torture to punish a terrorist outrage, or out of belief that something dangerous to society impends. Neither motive excuses torture, but nor does it fit her model. Revenge, patriotism, political conviction, racism, insensibility, war-induced madness, and much besides, might create a torturer. For Millett the only motive is getting a kick out of dominance. Such is the result of analysing the world according to a tendentious view of sexual politics.</p>

This is so because President  Clinton is determined that his country should resume the role of  the driving force of the world economy. To achieve this,  Clinton must defend U.S. companies and create new jobs in  industry and agriculture. Much of the president's effort has  been geared to the approval of NAFTA; to the holding of the  Asia-Pacific Conference in Seattle; to the successful conclusion  of the Uruguay Round of the GATT -- which will enable the United  States to sell its agricultural surpluses for several years  while restructuring the sector and being instrumental in  improving competitiveness all over the world; to pressuring  Japan, the PRC, the ROK, and other countries to improve the U.S.  balance of trade position; and so on and so forth. The lifting  on the embargo on trade with Vietnam is another chapter in this  long string of events.    The initiative is neither surprising nor does it stem from  Clinton's past convictions about the Vietnam War, even though  public opinion believes his action is undoubtedly tinged by  memories and emotions of that cruel war -- without mentioning  the "missing" U.S. soldiers whose whereabouts have never been  disclosed by the Hanoi authorities. They have not repatriated  the mortal remains of all the fallen to their homeland either.    And yet, bilateral relations have eased off considerably.  Back in April 1991, General John Vessey, an envoy of the then  President George Bush, met with the Vietnamese foreign minister  to notify him of the opening of an official U.S. office to  investigate the fate of the U.S. soldiers reported as missing.  They also discussed the possible resumption of diplomatic  relations on condition Vietnam withdrew its troops from  Cambodia, and that the South Vietnamese officers being held in  "rehabilitation camps" be released and authorized to travel to  the United States. It goes without saying that the United  States also made it a condition that Vietnam should actively  cooperate in the search of the missing. In exchange for that,  rapprochement would continue (telecommunications, tourism) and  restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats before the United  Nation in New York would be lifted.    Following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia  in mid December 1992 and Vietnamese cooperation over the  missing, Washington authorized U.S. companies to "prepare  themselves" in Vietnam because the raising of the embargo was  considered imminent. Washington also gave the "green light" for  international credits for Vietnam for the reconstruction of the  country.    Following a line of diplomatic continuity at the beginning  of  July 1993, President Clinton announced that the United States  would no longer oppose the granting of loans for Hanoi by  international organizations (the IMF and the World Bank). By  that time, the economic reform in Vietnam had attracted  significant foreign investments, mainly from Taiwan, Hong Kong,  Japan, and Europe.    Finally, Washington sent three consular affairs experts to  Hanoi in July 1993 to look after fellow citizens who travelled  to Vietnam in ever-increasing numbers. By this time the  Vietnamese had "found" the blue book where the names of all the  U.S. prisoners of war were recorded and submitted the list to  Gen. Vessey. This report agreed more with the documents  obtained from Soviet archives than with the original list  drafted by Hanoi.    Parallel to the progress on the missing was the  consideration  that, from a very modest start, Vietnam's economy was growing  in leaps and bounds. It grew by 7.5 percent in 1992, and in  1993 things looked even better (industrial production increased  by 12.3 percent in nine months in 1993). Exports were expanding  at an average 20 percent a year. Foreign investments for the  period 1988 to August 1993 totalled $6.300 billion. This  contrasts sharply with the constraints on U.S. companies that  could only participate in business transactions with Vietnam  through contracts with international organizations.    Thus U.S. businessmen as well as the Senate enthusiastically  hailed the lifting of the trade embargo. U.S. companies, ready  and eager like racehorses at the starting gate, began activities  without wasting a minute, as has been eloquently recorded by  newspapers over the last few days. The logic of business  prevailed over [former President Richard] Nixon-like ideologies  which were furthered by those who want to continue struggling  against the last pockets of "the empire of the evil" until it is  totally routed, or at least until it is smothered. The  reestablishment of full diplomatic relations will have to wait  until the issue of the missing is totally cleared up.    The United States created 62,000 new jobs in January, 26,000  of which are in the industrial sector. It thus keeps reducing  its unemployment rate, which runs at approximately 6.4 percent.  This is much lower than the average in the European Union (10.9  percent), but higher than that of Germany, which is currently 6  percent. This is the reason why Clinton continues his trade  offensive -- to expand exports and reduce imports -- as the  basis for the country's productive renewal. He is aware that in  our modern world, nobody can indulge in the luxury of giving up  one's domestic market or a highly remunerative job lest one  should plunge into the maelstrom of decadence.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applications for continued participation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This section of the regulations generated many comments. Some commenters were concerned about the circumstances under which their institutions might be required to file an application in order to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program. The majority of the comments concerned the need for institutions to be notified enough in advance of the expiration of their program participation agreements so they could file an application for reapproval and the corresponding need for the Secretary to act on an institution's renewal application prior to the expiration of the institution's program participation agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters were concerned that the provision requiring institutions to apply for recertification upon the request of the Secretary allowed the Secretary too much discretionary authority and would mean that the Secretary would act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Many of these commenters believed that the regulations should identify the specific circumstances or significant events that would trigger a request from the Secretary and should require the Secretary to explain the reasons for the request. Two commenters recommended further that the regulations make clear that the Secretary will initiate action only if there is reliable evidence affecting an institution's financial responsibility or administrative capability. This commenter also said that it should be made clear that such an application would not be considered an initial application and that if the Secretary were to determine, on the basis of the application, that the institution should no longer participate in a Title IV, HEA program, the institution would have recourse to the appeal procedures specified in subpart G of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over seventy commenters were very concerned about the recertification process. Their understanding of the process was that even were an institution to file an application for reapproval in a timely manner, if the Secretary did not approve the institution prior to the expiration date of its program participation agreement, the institution either would lose approval altogether or would be provisionally certified. Because provisional certification connotes lesser status to these commenters and confers fewer appeal rights than full certification, the commenters viewed provisional certification under these circumstances to be unfair and unacceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters provided concrete, constructive recommendations for addressing their concerns. The majority of these commenters asked that the Secretary notify institutions in advance of the scheduled expiration dates of the program participation agreements and supply the necessary application forms. One group of commenters suggested that the Secretary establish time frames for the submission and the processing of applications. The time frames proposed by the commenters varied greatly, with one commenter urging that the Secretary be required to send applications to institutions 18 months in advance of the expiration dates of the program participation agreements and another stating that six months would be sufficient. Other commenters would have the regulations require that the Secretary act on an application within 45 or 60 days of receipt. The approach taken by another group of commenters was to recommend that if an institution submitted an application for renewal within a specific time frame, such as a certain number of days prior to the expiration date of the program participation agreement, the Secretary should extend the certification of the institution, as necessary, until the Secretary's review is complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary finds it necessary to reserve the right to require a participating institution to submit an application for certification if the Secretary has reason to believe the financial responsibility or administrative capability of the institution is in question. The Secretary refers those concerned to a discussion of the Secretary's position on page 9533 of the preamble to the NPRM published on February 28, 1994. The Secretary reiterates that the Secretary expects to exercise this authority rarely and to advise the affected institution of the reason for the request. An application submitted under these provisions is not considered an initial application, because the institution is a participating institution. The institution continues to be governed by the program participation agreement in effect at the time the institution submits its application until that program participation expires, the institution signs a new program participation agreement, or the Secretary limits or terminates the institution's program participation agreement under the procedures in subpart G of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary understands the concerns expressed regarding the processing of renewal applications and agrees that an institution should not be penalized if it files an application in a timely manner but the Secretary is unable to complete a review of the institution prior to the expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement. For a full discussion of this issue, see the section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that addresses certification procedures (&sect;668.13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification and application requirements for additional locations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were a number of comments on this section, and they conveyed a wide range of concerns. Many of the commenters were concerned that institutions would be required to notify the Secretary of each new location, regardless of the percentage of the educational program offered at the location. Many of these commenters asserted that the provision would prohibit community colleges from responding to community needs, because community colleges are constantly offering training and education at new locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters could discern no reason why the addition of a branch campus or other location at which 100 percent of an eligible program is offered should trigger a certification review of an entire institution. These commenters suggested that because accrediting agencies and State licensing bodies review additional locations, there is no need for the Secretary also to conduct a review. One commenter went so far as to recommend that &sect;668.12(b)(2) be removed, to guarantee that if the Secretary were to decide to certify a branch campus or other location, the decision could not trigger a recertification review of the entire institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters were concerned about the effect of these regulations on the ability of institutions to continue to offer internships on sites apart from their main campuses. Commenters complained about the effect of these provisions on an institution that contracts with a company to provide training for the company's employees on the site of the company's facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters supported the Secretary's need to monitor the financial responsibility and administrative capability of institutions that establish locations that offer at least 50 percent of an educational program. Two commenters recommended that the regulations be expanded to require that a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational program be reported to the Secretary if the volume of activity at the location exceeded a certain threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The comments reflect a good deal of confusion about the current requirements for reporting the addition of locations, current application procedures, and the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current Institutional Eligibility regulations, published on April 5, 1988, specify in &sect;600.30(a)(3) that institutions are to notify the Secretary of any changes in the name or number of locations since the institution's last eligibility application. As a practical matter, the Secretary has required institutions to report only changes to those locations at which the institution offered a complete educational program. This policy has been reflected for several years in the application and instructions. Thus, the notification requirement in these regulations, and the corresponding requirement in the new Institutional Eligibility regulations at &sect;600.30, are actually less onerous than the requirements in earlier regulations. Under these final regulations, community colleges and other institutions that frequently establish outreach locations at which they offer one or two courses need not report these locations. And, unless the internship portion of a student's program constitutes at least 50 percent of that program, there would be no need to report the location at which an internship is performed. Similarly, there is no need to report locations that offer only continuing education classes and do not have students who are eligible to receive Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEAT-SPONSORED PROGRAMS RESULT IN INCREASED AWARENESS OF SOCCER  </P> <P> Thomas Militello's suggestions on how to promote soccer (Times, July 26) have a  lot of strength behind them, but I would like to point out some of the programs  that the Los Angeles Heat have been involved in to increase awareness of the  sport in the past year:  </P> <P> * The team donated time to an anti-drug program. It did over 100 school  assemblies promoting "Soccer is a Kick, Drugs are a Drag."  </P> <P> * It offered free clinics to club and American Youth Soccer Organization teams  in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> * Press releases about the team are distributed to over 120 reporters, which  has resulted in increased media coverage.  </P> <P> * Ticket packages have been put together in an attempt to increase attendance  at home games.  </P> <P> This past year the team went through management changes and it wasn't until  March when a new management team was in place. It led to a great loss of time  in promoting the 1990 season. But our attendance has increased over 60% from  last year.  </P> <P> As for a public-address announcer, if you know of someone who loves and  understands the game of soccer and can show enthusiasm over the microphone  while still sounding professional, please send some references to us.  </P> <P> JILL FRACISCO  </P> <P> General manager, L.A. Heat  </P></p>

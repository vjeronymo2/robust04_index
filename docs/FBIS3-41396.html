			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mairtin MacCormaic: "5,000 in Capital on Hard </F> Drugs"]    [Text] Some 5,000 people in the Dublin area are now  addicted to hard drugs such as heroin, Health Minister Brendan  Howlin disclosed in the Dail yesterday.    And he admitted in reply to questions from Independent TD  Tony Gregory that the figure could be as high as 7,000.    "However, it's estimated that--excluding persons attending  the community services established by the Eastern Health  Board--approximately 1,850 persons are receiving treatment for  drug abuse in various treatment centres."    A total 352 people are on the methadone and maintenance  programmes in the satellite clinics and a number of others are  receiving treatment from general practitioners.    The services now in place and those being developed have  been  introduced as a result of the strategies prepared by the  National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse and the National  AIDS Strategy Committee, explained the Minister.    And he told the TD: "The deputy can be assured I regard this  area as a priority and have made provision in the 1994 estimates  to develop these services further."    Mr Gregory said that in spite of very dedicated staff the  satellite clinics provided "little more than a Band Aid service."    In some instances two counsellors were looking after in  excess of 100 addicts, and a waiting list of nearly 200 others.</p>

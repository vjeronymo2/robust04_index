			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GROUPS RENEW DEMAND THAT ELY RESIGN;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A TEACHERS UNION AND A CITIZENS GROUP CITE JAMES (TOM) ELY'S ARREST  AND VOW TO PRESS A RECALL CAMPAIGN IF HE DOES NOT STEP DOWN AS COLLEGE TRUSTEE.  </P> <P> A teachers union and a Simi Valley citizens group renewed their demand  Wednesday that Ventura County Community College District Trustee James (Tom)  Ely give up his post, citing criminal charges filed Tuesday against him and his  wife, Ingrid.  </P> <P> "We would like him to resign," said Larry Miller, chief negotiator for the  Ventura County Federation of Teachers, which represents 1,000 faculty members  at Moorpark, Ventura and Oxnard colleges. "If a board member is not  contributing anything positive to the district, then he's got to go. We have  too many good things to do in education to be bogged down with this local  Peyton Place drama."  </P> <P> Tom Ely was charged Tuesday with eight counts of embezzlement and 19 counts of  making fraudulent claims to the district. Prosecutors say he billed the  district for thousands of dollars in improper travel expenses incurred in 1988  and 1989. In addition, the Elys were charged with two counts each of conspiracy  to commit grand theft.  </P> <P> Among the charges is an allegation that the couple double-billed the district  for some expenses, with Tom Ely submitting expense vouchers to the district and  his wife submitting the expenses to the Moorpark College Alumni Assn. for  reimbursement.  </P> <P> Miller said the union will continue to support the citizens group's recall  campaign if Ely does not resign. He said the union has already contributed  $1,250 to the recall effort.  </P> <P> Caroline Paras, who is coordinating the Ely recall campaign, also called for  Ely to step down.  </P> <P> "I hope he will resign and take care of his own problems," Paras said. "It  would be the best thing he could do. But knowing Tom and his ego, he probably  won't."  </P> <P> Paras said Ely's arrest will give the recall campaign an added boost. She said  her group has gathered 3,436 of the 9,901 signatures needed to force a special  recall election. The group has until Oct. 25 to gather the necessary  signatures. Ely has more than a year remaining on his third four-year term.  </P> <P> The Elys could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Trustee Timothy Hirschberg, an outspoken critic of Ely, agreed that he should  give up his part-time $400-a-month post. As a trustee, Ely is one of five  people who set policy for the district, which has a $62-million budget and  nearly 30,000 students.  </P> <P> "He should resign for his own sake and the district's sake," said Hirschberg,  who has given $100 to the recall effort. "His personal problems and financial  problems, and now the criminal problems, have caused enough disruption to the  board and the district."  </P> <P> Board of Trustees President Greg Kampf said he is considering asking Ely to  resign, but first he wants to review the district attorney's report and talk  with other board members. He said that if Ely does not resign, he might lend  his support to the recall drive.  </P> <P> Kampf said Ely might no longer be an effective trustee.  </P> <P> "Because of his conduct on travel . . . whether he can lead or participate  fully in the district is seriously under question," Kampf said.  </P> <P> Kampf said the board will discuss whether to take any action against Ely at its  next meeting on Sept. 4. He said the options include censure, which is a formal  condemnation by the board for misconduct. Another option would be a lawsuit to  try to recoup some of the money that Ely allegedly misappropriated.  </P> <P> Before making any decisions, Kampf said he wants to talk with the other  trustees and attorney Stuart W. Rudnick, who was hired by the district to  conduct its own investigation of Ely.  </P> <P> Hirschberg, however, said the board has enough information to act.  </P> <P> "There is nothing new in the charges," Hirschberg said. "The board has had the  evidence under its noses for months.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that the board has not taken a clear stand and shown that  we're outraged," Hirschberg said. "We're responsible for a $60-million budget.  The public must have confidence that we're not pocketing any of it."  </P> <P> Trustee Greg Cole could not be reached for comment. Cole has previously stated  that Ely should resign.  </P> <P> Trustee Pete Tafoya said he did not wish to comment on any actions the board  might take. "It is a very traumatic event for Mr. Ely," Tafoya said. "It  doesn't look good for the district, and I'm obviously concerned about that."  </P> <P> District Chancellor Barbara Derryberry and Vice Chancellor Tom Kimberling  declined to comment on the matter.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, board members said they believe that the district has done all it  can to tighten its travel policy and to ensure that similar problems do not  occur in the future.  </P> <P> Under a new policy adopted in June, the board must approve all trips for  individual members in advance. Previously, board members were only required to  get approval from the chancellor.  </P> <P> In addition, the board recently voted to establish a special committee of  trustees Hirschberg and Tafoya to work with the community to draft an ethics  code for the board. Among other things, the committee will reassess the need  for providing trustees with credit cards, facsimile machines and telephones.  </P></p>

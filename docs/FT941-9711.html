			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Babes in the Warehouse - Strange happenings in deepest Docklands Shiny Nylon is Urban Panic, says the publicity material for a bizarre event that opens next week in S-Shed, London's newest and most uncomfortable venue. For 12 days a filthy, unheated former tobacco warehouse in deepest Docklands will host a curious mixture of installation art, dance and rock opera. The show has been commissioned by Jules Wright of the Womens Playhouse Trust who last October brought us Dirt - a dance around washing up bowls performed by ordinary people in the disused Wapping Pumping Station. Shiny Nylon was inspired by Wright's - questionable - observation that cities are changing. One of the elements of these altered cities, she argues, is panic. She defines the state as 'confusion that arises when you can no longer make sense of your circumstances'. In that case, Shiny Nylon hits it right on the head. Those who do have an inkling of what the project is about seem to disagree with each other. The confusion is the result of Wright having commissioned three single-minded creative artists, each with their own ideas. Wright says it is about journeys, 'literal journeys, desire to travel, travelling in your mind.' Deborah Levy, writer and director of Shiny Nylon sees it in terms of Babe, the central character. 'When Babe got run over on the motorway, she said she had seen her death on the big screen 50 times over . . . Read her beautiful lips: Babe wants to be a love diva but no one taught her how to kiss.' Babe, it seems is a bundle of impressions; during the show nothing happens to her at all. When Deborah Levy first saw the echoing emptiness of the S-Shed she was horrified. But Anya Gallaccio, the artist who recently smeared 300 bars of melted chocolate on the walls of a London gallery, was ecstatic. To her, the soulless space was crying out for two voluminous red and gold velvet curtains, to sweep up and down the full length of the warehouse, and for a bank of 100 19th century theatre seats (there will be standing room for 50). There will also be mirrors of every shape and size. The one thing that will be lacking is Nylon, shiny or otherwise. Gallaccio evidently does not feel bound to take Levy's title literally. The choreographer, Kristina Page, whose dancing has been described as 'visceral', sees the sloping concrete walls and pillars as ideal material to throw herself against and wrap herself around. If Shiny Nylon works, it does not matter whether it is about anything at all. Watching a rehearsal in which the singer, 'Babe' Jenny Potter, and dancers haul the curtains up and down, and stretch their bodies against the mossy walls to a sound track suggesting Velvet Underground, you begin to feel that this could, in the end, be something special. Even so, you might wonder what the London Docklands Development Corporation is doing putting about Pounds 25,000 into this sort of thing (Pounds 5,000 into the show and Pounds 20,000 into refurbishing the warehouse). If it wants to encourage businesses to move to Docklands, getting them to its bleakest spot for an evening standing up watching something without plot is a strange way to go about it. And those who thread their way through the neighbouring building site afterwards to Custom House station may experience some Urban Panic first hand. Yet to argue that would be to miss the point. The LDDC has set itself the ambitious target of building up an arts centre as good as any in London, with its newly-appointed arts manager Katherine Orrell drawing on regional, national and international talent. The S-Shed is only one of many old, and sometimes beautiful, warehouses that are empty on the Royal Victoria Dock. Orrell is attempting to find better use for them. 'I have an unashamed wish to bring in people with oomph and power to make things happen', she says. Wright agrees that Shiny Nylon is risky, but says that it is good to 'create the freedom to fail'. She has had some failures herself recently - her controversial attempt last year to take over the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith was shortlived - but she seems unmoved by predictions of disaster for this latest project. 'Everyone says: 'no one will come to that, Jules' - but they will. They always do'. Shiny Nylon runs from February 15 to 27. Tickets 071 379 9700</p>

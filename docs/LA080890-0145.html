			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TUSTIN MARKETPLACE  </P> <P> There are power lunches, power suits and power neckties. But wait, there's a  new concept on the horizon . . . a power center.  </P> <P> For the uninitiated not up on the latest newspeak, a power center is not a  shelter where recalcitrant consumers are hooked up to electrodes and zapped  until all their plastic is melted into an unusable heap. A power center is the  new buzzword for a strip center on steroids -- a major open-air retail center  that combines the off-price advantages of a community shopping center with the  far-reaching drawing power of a regional mall, such as a South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> Like Orange County needs another mall, right?  </P> <P> "The Tustin Marketplace really isn't in competition with South Coast Plaza or  any of the other regional malls," said John Allen, a leasing representative for  Donahue Schriber, the Newport Beach-based developer responsible for filling the  new 80-acre shopping center.  </P> <P> "At regional malls you expect to pay full retail. The Marketplace has more  community-type stores that sell merchandise off price. A tenant at a community  mall won't go into a regional mall and vice versa," he continued.  </P> <P> And it's true. While there is no Robinson's, Nordstrom, I. Magnin, Saks Fifth  Avenue or designer boutiques to make deep dents in the plastic, there are more  moderately priced stores -- Clothestime, T.J. Maxx, Ross Dress for Less, and  the $5 Clothing Store -- that feel right at home at the new  750,000-square-foot, palm-tree-lined center quickly nearing completion.  </P> <P> The mall, which is painted terra cotta and brick red with purple and fuchsia  accents, is smartly divided into three distinct sections. One side is dedicated  mostly to hard goods and includes such nationally known stores as Home Depot,  Stor and the Waterbed Gallery; the opposite corner is predominantly soft goods  and is host to Kids 'R' Us, Chick's Sporting Goods, C&amp;R Clothiers, Payless  ShoeSource and the soon-to-open Good Guys, a San Francisco-based audio/video  outlet that will open its first Orange County store in the Marketplace this  month.  </P> <P> In the middle will be the Village, an entertainment center described by Allen  as "fun and festive." Eventually, the Village will boast a bookstore, Tower  Records, a variety of food shops and a six-screen Edwards Cinema.  </P> <P> "We have a tenant mix second to none. We pride ourselves on a good mix so that  everyone will do well," Allen explained.  </P> <P> Store managers seem to agree. Kids 'R' Us manager Jayne Monge said business is  going well and he likes the location of the Tustin Marketplace. And why not?  With frontage along the Santa Ana Freeway, an estimated 200,000 cars daily pass  the center with the violet-and-white sign boldly proclaiming "Tustin  Marketplace."  </P> <P> But it's the plans for expansion in the immediate area that have Ross Dress for  Less manager Diane Ershig so enthusiastic. "We love being in the Marketplace.  We like the proximity to Irvine, the new homes being built around us and being  in a brand-new, exciting center," she said. "Also, our store is a prototype.  It's a newer look of the Ross stores. The store has more 'shopability' -- it's  more departmentalized. We are consistently busy," she added.  </P> <P> Home Depot, which will be celebrating its one-year anniversary at the Tustin  Marketplace next month, has also profited by location. "This is a great  shopping center -- definitely a state-of-the-art place. We're doing great  business here," manager Steve Noren said.  </P> <P> "We're not a typical shopping center," Allen said. "This one is unique and has  its own character. It's definitely a landmark location."  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday,  noon to 5 p.m. Sunday  </P> <P> Address: 2777 El Camino Real, Tustin  </P> <P> Miscellaneous information: When completed, the Tustin Marketplace will have 70  stores and about 4,000 parking spaces.

Senior government sources  point to over 40 settlements that the government will probably  have no choice but to evacuate. In the meantime, it seems that  the tendency to leave voluntarily is growing among the settlers.  Over 1,000 settlers have so far appealed to the Construction  and Housing Ministry to leave and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer  admits that contrary to the law, he approved rental aid for the  center of the country. Roni Daniyel and 'Imanu'el Rosen report:    [Begin recording] [Daniyel] This is the picture that says  it all. In the heart of Hebron's casbah the white roofed houses  belong to the Jewish settlement in the town. There are about  400 Jews in Tall al-Rumaythah, Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and the  Avraham Avinu market among 120,000 Arabs. That is what  threatens to ignite a big fire.    [Ben-Eli'ezer] That obliges us and the entire public to say  to them: Despite all the pain and sorrow we feel, you are being  evacuated from Qiryat Arba. Period. [passage omitted]    The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs  discussed the fate of those houses this week. Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer and Shulamit Aloni demanded the immediate  evacuation of the Jews from Hebron. The prime minister listened  but did not respond. Many ministers believe that he will order  their evacuation, but not now, not before the Declaration of  Principles is implemented. 'Uzi Bar'am promises to raise the  issue at tomorrow's cabinet meeting.    [Bar'am] I think that only a few ministers have declared  their opposition therefore there is still a silent group,  including the foreign minister, and it is very important to hear  their opinions on the matter.    [Rosen] What is the prime minister's stand on the Hebron  issue, as far as you know.    [Bar'am] I think that the prime minister does not want to  touch the Hebron issue because he wants to continue with the  position that we do not evacuate settlements at this stage. I  do not think he agrees with the settlement inside Hebron, he  simply thinks it does not pay to concentrate all the forces on  that issue now.    [Daniyel] But Hebron is only a small example of a much  larger problem. This is Karmel which does not have Arab  neighbors or in fact any neighbors. It is a Jewish settlement,  30 families, on the slopes of the Hebron Hills, with a narrow  road and almost no traffic, a clear example of an isolated  settlement. [passage omitted]    Karmel is also only one example. The government ministries  and the defense establishment have already prepared the lists.  Over 40 settlements are defined as isolated settlements in the  heart of Arab areas. Put another way, it is Netzarim repeated  40 times. When autonomy is implemented, approaches to each of  these settlements, for example Psagot, will become a military  operation. [passage omitted]    [Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur] I believe we will  want to set up coherent blocs of as many settlements as  possible. We will have to find solutions for isolated  settlements. I already know this will not be easy. Travel to  them is very unpleasant, they pass through or nearby Arab  villages. Topographically, it is very easy to set up ambushes  there.    [Rosen] Not for attribution, we were told that the General  Staff, the government, and the prime minister believe that the  future of these settlements, or at least these, will be decided  on in the near future, long before the permanent arrangement is  discussed.

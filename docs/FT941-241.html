			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Wall Street stocks slide amid fears of interest rates rise US share prices plunged again yesterday as investors sold stocks amid growing fears about rising long-term interest rates and the outlook for a rapidly-weakening US equity market. It was the fourth big decline on Wall Street in the last five days. In Tokyo, stocks opened lower amid concern about the sharp retreat in US share prices. The Nikkei 225 index fell about 50 points to 19,510 in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 72.27 at 3,626.75, its lowest level since November 4, 1993. The Dow has fallen almost 250 points, or 6 per cent, since last Thursday. Traders said the selling was not triggered by any particular news, but blamed the declines on growing fears among investors that long-term interest rates, which have climbed sharply since February, will rise steadily throughout the rest of the year. Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond - the chief measure of long-term interest rates - rose to 7.1 per cent, its highest level in 13 months. Analysts say interest rates have been rising because bond market investors are worried that recent rapid growth in the US economy will push up inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income assets like bonds. Bearish comments about the outlook for share prices from Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the influential equities analyst at Lehman Brothers, served to further darken the stock market's mood. Ms Garzarelli, whose pronouncements have been closely followed since she predicted the stock market crash in 1987, said the indicators she uses to forecast the market had fallen sharply in recent months. The Lehman analyst said: 'We feel the odds are about 50-50 that we may already be in the 10 per cent to 15 per cent correctional phase.' She had originally forecast a decline of no more than 10 per cent. London share prices were hit by Wall Street yesterday. The Dow's overnight fall knocked 36 points off the FT-SE 100 at the opening. The index later recovered all but 5.7 points, but then slid to 3,092.4, a net loss of 31. Floating-rate gilts auction a success, Page 35 World stocks, Page 43 London stocks, Page 46</p>

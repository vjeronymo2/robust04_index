			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Peruvian press reports  today that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  has finally decided to run for president. The press reports add  that Perez de Cuellar hopes to officially announce his decision  in August.    According to the newspaper EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar's  decision was announced by a group of Peruvian politicians,  businessmen, and personalities who met him a few days ago in  Paris, where Perez de Cuellar currently lives.    The Peruvian presidential and legislative elections will be  held in April 1995 but the deadline for the registration of  presidential candidates is October 1994.    EXPRESO reports that the former UN secretary general hopes  Police Inspector General Antonio Ketin, responsible for  capturing Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman in 1992, and Diego  Garcia Sayon, former Andean Lawyers Commission chairman and an  old leftist militant, will be his running mates.    According to EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar has "declined" any  eventual alliances with traditional political parties that  support his candidacy. He believes their support will do him  more harm than good because they will take away votes from him.    He has proposed, however, giving more participation in his  eventual administration to the main party supporting him, the  Popular Christian Party (PPC), if the main PPC leaders decide to  withdraw their candidacies to the legislature.    Perez de Cuellar approved a list of candidates to the  legislature encompassing independent politicians identified with  the opposition, such as Maximo San Roman, who was President  Alberto Fujimori's vice president until the 1992 coup d'etat.    The list also includes personalities such as former Senators  Enrique Bernales (Socialist) and Raul Ferrero (conservative);  Daniel Estrade, the leftist mayor of Cusco; and Bar Association  President Jorge Avendano, among others.    Moreover, political circles have reported high-ranking  Peruvian media representatives also were present in the Paris  meeting at Perez de Cuellar's request.    The same sources reported that Alfredo Barnechea, a  journalist and former candidate for Lima City Hall for the  American Popular Revolutionary Alliance -- headed by former  President Alan Garcia -- will be the 75-year-old veteran  diplomat's campaign manager. Barnechea is married to Perez de  Cuellar's stepdaughter.    Perez de Cuellar's campaign will be launched next week with  several new members and the collection of signatures to support  the former UN secretary general's candidacy.</p>

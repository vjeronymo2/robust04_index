			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Sport: England are licked into shape by Lara - Cricket / A look back at Caribbean Tests England may have left the West Indies yesterday vanquished 3-1 in the Test matches, but it was a series of chasms and summits. Already two-nil down by mid-March, England sank to their lowest ebb in Trinidad when their batting was blitzed by a sensational spell from Curtly Ambrose, probably the best fast bowler that has ever lived, certainly the tallest. England responded by sending 7,000 reinforcements to yell encouragement in Barbados, and this spurred Alec Stewart to his two centuries in the match and England to their first win in Bridgetown for 59 years. And then came the small matter of Brian Charles Lara. Compact and chunky, like many old batting kings - Donald Bradman, Len Hutton, Sunil Gavaskar - Lara is the man with the most voracious appetite for batting in world cricket. He toyed with the England attack for close on 27 hours over the five Tests, and could not be contained. The wagon-wheel scorechart for his record-breaking 375 in Antigua - each stroke represented by a thin black line - looks like a huge plate of spaghetti. Very occasionally during this astonishing and chanceless innings, his inside edge was beaten, but the ball missed the wicket almost as if it was not there. Obviously this particular feat was meant to happen. This was underlined by the presence on the players' balcony of Sir Garfield Sobers, the man whose record score Lara passed, ready to come on the field to embrace his heir at the appropriate moment. England were as powerless to arrest his progress as were the local police to restrain 1,000 invading West Indian supporters. That is the point about West Indian cricket. It is irresistible. Ever since they proclaimed to the 1947 England team that they were unsure of their ability and then took the field with the three Ws (Worrell, Walcott and Weekes) the West Indies have turned up the heat on visiting teams. A conveyor belt ferries new fast bowlers to replace the old ones, there is no respite in between. Meanwhile virtuoso, free-spirited batsmen have ghosted into the team almost unnoticed. Ninenteen-year-old Shivnarine Chanderpaul was given a fanfare Test debut on his home patch in Guyana and has since made a 50 in each Test. The number five, Jimmy Adams, has played eight matches and averages 61. And Lara has attained greatness by the age of 25. Warwickshire county cricket club have gained a useful asset this summer. Where do they keep getting these players from? Several years ago there were rumours that cricket was beginning to decline in the West Indies. These were unfounded. Undoubtedly in Barbados - the traditional cricket stronghold - basketball is taking a grip through American television. Much less cricket is played on the beach there, and the current Test side has a conspicuous lack of Bajans. Elsewhere, cricket rivals Christianity as the main religion among men. On small islands such as Grenada or Tobago, car drivers have to swerve round street games as well as potholes and in Guyana any patch of flat land beside a creek or river will do. Using the base of a palm tree as the wicket, two 'pelt' bowlers alternate from one end, chucking rather than bowling. There may be 20 fielders, so you learn to stay in - if you are out you might not have another bat for a while. Wherever there is an empty beach, there will be a match. If interest was flickering in other places, Lara's genius has ignited it again. A high court case in St Vincent was postponed last Monday so that the lawyers could watch him break the record on television. Afterwards, an impromptu carnival materialised in Antigua with an evening of calypso and a parade by an iron band, creating rhythms from pans and hubcaps, and radios blared out songs idolising 'Curtly' or 'Brian'. England have returned with the spoils from a series in the Caribbean only once, in 1969. The one thing that exceeds the breadth of West Indies' achievement is the expectation. 'We may have beaten you last time,' people say, 'but now we're gonna give you a damn good lickin'.' Confronted by the wealth of talent and the depth of passion, a young England team has fared quite well. 'They've matured down here,' said one onlooker, and he was right. Atherton and Stewart have become the world's best opening partnership, Robin Smith has rediscovered his self-belief, you will not find a more accurate bowler than Angus Fraser, and Graham Gooch will be available for the Tests against New Zealand and South Africa this summer. All England need is a quick bowler. In the Caribbean, they are still wallowing in the deeds of Sobers, and his prime was 30 years ago. Presumably Lara will now be similarly deified. Once a hero, always a hero. Star cricketers do not pay taxes in the majority of islands of the West Indies, most do not need jobs once they retire. Cricket is the route to prosperity. In England few players receive the status they deserve. As soon as they reach the highest echelons they become targets for ridicule. More than once this winter a picture of the captain, Mike Atherton, has appeared in British tabloid newspapers with a turnip superimposed on his head, but Atherton is no vegetable and he has a willing bunch of players. Do not be surprised if England give this summer's first visitors, New Zealand, a damn good lickin'.</p>

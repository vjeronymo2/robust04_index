			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Treuhand offers jobs to striking miners THE Treuhand, the east German privatisation agency, is to offer jobs to hundreds of striking miners. The miners have been on strike since April in protest at the Treuhand's decision to close loss-making potash mines in the state of Thuringia. Mr Werner Bayreuthner, a senior Treuhand official, said the agency was close to reaching agreement with the government of Thuringia in which 380 jobs would be created. The move represents a climbdown by the Treuhand and the state of Thuringia, and could set a precedent for industries earmarked for closure or substantial job cuts. The miners have not yet responded to the proposal. The compromise follows a decision by the Treuhand to merge east Germany's Mitteldeutsche Kali and west Germany's Kali und Salz to reduce overcapacity in the potash industry. The merger entailed closing down the Bischoferode mine. However, the Treuhand had agreed to preserve the 700 jobs for the two years. But miners from the region opposed the merger and insisted that Bischoferode be kept open. Mr Bayreuthner said 200 jobs would be kept to maintain the closed mine, retraining schemes would be offered to 80, and 100 jobs would be guaranteed through companies investing in the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Between Two Massacres"] </F>   [Text] At first glance, one cannot but link the Zuq  Mikha'il church massacre in Lebanon to the al-Ibrahimi mosque  massacre in Hebron committed by a Jewish "fundamentalist" with  the clear participation of others who believe that there is no  possibility of coexistence between the peoples of the region and  that there is only room for extremism, extremists, and  continuation of violence.    Of course, the timing of the church explosion appeared to be  the best service to Israel because the crime committed in  Lebanon provided the best evidence that there are "extremists"  everywhere and that the ugly act committed against the  worshippers in Hebron was part of the wider framework of  imbalance in the region, a condition which made the peace  process possible just as it made those opposed to the process  resort to exceptional ways of fighting it. And so in the end it  would appear that violence and terrorism are features of a  general condition prevailing in the region, that what happened  at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was an integral part of that  condition, and that Israel itself will have to face the problem  of its "fundamentalism" just as in the case of a good number of  states in the region such as Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt.    Such an argument appears to be solid and logical, but what  is  required is an understanding of the Lebanese situation, which  must be viewed from a special angle because that small country  is in the process of rebuilding itself after its government  moved it out of the intensive care unit to pave the way for  laying the foundations of a state and institutions that would  take it healthily to the year 2000 and beyond. Lebanon is  currently in labor. The Zuq Mikha'il church explosion cannot be  isolated from the attempt to assassinate Christian clergy on  their way to the al-Balamand monastery, the explosion at the  Phalangist headquarters in al-Sayfi in the heart of Beirut on  new year's eve last year, or the sectarian leaflets distributed  at the time and the explosions which accompanied that in stores  in various areas. All that was in the context of undermining  the process of redrafting an integral national plan for Lebanon  taking into consideration the fact that there is a need to  rectify matters, particularly the injustice inflicted on the  Christians in general after they were dragged into a "suicidal"  plan and then into boycotting the latest parliamentary  elections. That does not mean that other parties, such as  Syria, do not bear any responsibility in the context of settling  scores with certain leaderships to the point of deliberately  humiliating them even if that means making a large number of  Lebanese people feel that they are the "oppressed" group indeed.    It is easy to accuse Israel of being the party behind the  church explosion to divert attention from the al-Ibrahimi mosque  massacre, but it is difficult to admit that certain groups in  Lebanon, while pretending to be fighting Israel, actually in  practice serve the policy of the Jewish state. They do so by  seeking to sabotage the national basic program being implemented  by the Lebanese Government at all levels beginning with the  reconstruction of Beirut and reviving it as a civilized city in  which people enjoy living together, not just a place of  coexistence between the Lebanese themselves and Arab brothers  and foreigners, and by pursuing a policy of terrorizing the  Christians to block any attempt to restore political balance in  the country.    The main question remains: What is the position of the  Syrian leadership on everything happening in Lebanon? Can  Damascus continue to play the game of maintaining certain  balances in the country through its ability to use "the  extremists" and their practices in the framework of its regional  policy? Finally, the church explosion must be seen as a blow to  Syrian security in Lebanon. What will Damascus do? Will it  continue to play the waiting game knowing that any weakening of  Lebanon is ultimately a weakening of Syria and its ability to  face Israel with a minimum degree of Arab coordination.</p>

That way,  everyone will consume according to his means...this will put an  end to smuggling across the border and to waste," said Mr.  Mustapha Makraoui, acting commerce minister, in a press  conference held yesterday at Government House.    The acting commerce minister met yesterday with journalists  to say, first of all, that if there are food shortages, it is  not because the state has failed to import enough.    The minister also challenged government officials to improve  the output of a "totally foundering" national distribution  system that engenders only penury and speculation.    Typically, Mr. Makraoui first bombarded journalists with  statistics. Imports for last year were valued at $9 billion,  including $2.5 billion for food products. Some $700 million went  for importing hard and soft wheat, corn, rice, and barley, $520  million for semolina flour, and $54 million for dehydrated  vegetables. Authorizations for imports by ENAPEL [expansion not  given] (milk, coffee, sugar, tea, etc.) came to nearly $1  billion.    The commerce minister admitted, however, that these programs  were not all fully implemented, for several reasons. For  example, foreign banks were cautious, preferring to wait until  they knew whether Algeria would negotiate with the IMF in late  1993. Algeria is also having difficulties acquiring hard wheat  and semolina on world markets, difficulties that Mr. Makraoui  ascribes to the decline in world production of hard wheat. Not  until January did the European countries agree to make available  300,000 tons of hard wheat and an equal amount of semolina.</p>

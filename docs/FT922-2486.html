			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Computer fraud loophole blocked A LOOPHOLE in the law on computer fraud was closed by the Court of Appeal yesterday. Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, sitting with Mr Justice Macpherson and Mr Justice Turner, overturned a judge's ruling last year that interfering with a computer by operating the keyboard directly could not count as computer fraud, because the Computer Misuse Act was directed at 'hacking' - breaking into a computer network using another computer. The act provides for jail terms of up to five years, unlimited fines or both. Lord Taylor said that if a person who gained direct access to computer data could not be convicted it would lead to a 'surprising and unlikely' gap in the act. The case arose out of the acquittal of a man accused of computer fraud at Snaresbrook Crown Court last year. Purchasing key cutting equipment from a former employer, he awarded himself a 70 per cent discount by keying in the necessary instructions on a sales assistant's computer while the assistant was in the stockroom. Although the appeal judges overturned the trial judge's ruling, the man's acquittal stands. The court had been asked by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney general, to give an opinion on the Crown Court's ruling because he believed it had implications that could emasculate the act.</p>

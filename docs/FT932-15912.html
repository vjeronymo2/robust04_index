			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Hopes rise over Leyland DAF HOPES for the future of nearly 1,000 jobs at the Leyland DAF van plant in Birmingham were boosted last night by an agreement in principle for a management buy-out. The optimism was bolstered by a possible breakthrough in a components dispute which has threatened to halt production at the van plant and the truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, which employs 1,100 people. The two developments raised hopes of continued employment at the truck plant, where a buy-out is also planned, and for the company's 1,400 other workers. Funding for the Birmingham buy-out is being led by 3i, the UK's largest venture capital group. Last night, however, both its other backers and the total amount involved remained unknown. Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the joint administrative receivers, said he was satisfied the required funding was in place for a buy-out by the plant's managers, led by managing director Mr Allan Amey. The announcement coincided with talks over the halting of key brake and clutch component supplies by Automotive Products, a BBA group subsidiary. A solution to the dispute is important for both the buy-outs. AP requested a meeting with the receivers last night, in what it hinted was an attempt to find a way of resuming supplies to both Leyland DAF plants, while pursuing its claim for Pounds 750,000 in respect of components delivered before the receivership. The talks, which ended apparently inconclusively, with a joint statement that both sides were 'considering their positions', took place just 24 hours after the Court of Appeal had upheld a High Court ruling last week that AP was under no obligation to resume parts supplies. The receivers had argued unsuccessfully that AP's refusal to continue supplies breached EC law by abusing the company's dominant market position. However, the circumstances of last night's meeting suggest that AP is actively seeking a solution which would allow both plants to stay in business. It has already begun separate talks with the Birmingham MBO principals concerning possible supplies when the managers take over. Mr McKillop said last night there were 'good grounds' for hoping the Birmingham MBO would be completed by April 19. So far AP is believed not to have begun talks with the management team seeking to buy out the Leyland trucks operations. This MBO is understood to be at a considerably less advanced stage than the Birmingham venture. Meanwhile, the receivers indicated yesterday that, if no agreement with AP could be reached, alternative suppliers might be found far more quickly than had been considered possible.</p>

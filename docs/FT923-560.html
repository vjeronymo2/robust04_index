			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / The European Market: Brussels puts squeeze on the Dutch cartels - Changes in a business culture THE WORD 'cartel' usually conjures up images of furtive meetings in smoky back rooms, where deals and agreements are struck far from the authorities' prying eyes. In the Netherlands, however, the focal point of cartel-fixers is not some secret rendezvous but the conference rooms, offices and corridors of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in The Hague. It is here that companies, business federations, agricultural product boards and retail associations have traditionally sent details of their cartels for inclusion in a register maintained by the ministry. At last count the Netherlands had officially sanctioned more than 400 cartels. The exact details of the Dutch register are kept secret, but one ministry official says the sectors involved form a broad cross-section of the Dutch business community. The cartels run the gamut from well-known agreements in the asphalt and construction industries to accords governing the production and sale of the lowly pearl onion. The agreements cover price levels, supply restrictions and product ranges. Another favourite is the arrangement adopted by many retailers around the country: the by-laws of many shopping centres stipulate, for example, that the tenants may include only one shoe shop - to protect the livelihood of the sole purveyor of shoes in the complex. However, the days of the Dutch cartel are clearly numbered. Under pressure from the increasingly active competition policy being pursued by the European Community, the Netherlands is preparing to start banning three types of cartel practices from 1993 - horizontal price-fixing, market share-out arrangements, and tender arrangements which allow prior consultation among businesses vying for the same order. 'Traditional, defensive cartels will run into a red light,' according to Ms Yvonne van Rooy, state secretary for economic affairs. 'But the green light will continue to be given to positive and offensive cartels.' Beneficial cartels, she said last week in a speech to a Rotterdam conference on the future of cartel policy, were ones designed to offer early, temporary protection to companies seeking to launch new technologies. Surprisingly, perhaps, for a country which is a keen exponent of European integration and harmonisation, Dutch cartel practice has always been fundamentally at odds with that of the EC and most of its EC partners. The Netherlands, with its traditional emphasis on achieving consensus and avoiding conflict, has fostered a business culture in which companies, trade unions, government bodies and industry associations engage in constant and close consultations. The country has no anti-trust authority, preferring instead to emphasise self-regulation whenever possible. Under a Dutch law of 1957 - issued at the height of post-war reconstruction, when co-operation among business was seen as the fastest route to economic strength - cartels are permitted unless they are deemed to be counter-productive. Under the EC Treaty of Rome of 1958 cartels are banned in principle, although rare exceptions may be permitted. This dichotomy surfaced early this year when the EC fined 7,000 Dutch builders for operating a 12-year-old cartel at the tender stage of building contracts. The cartel was conducted openly and appeared on the government's register of officially-condoned agreements, but the EC ordered it to be ended. An appeal by the Dutch construction industry is working its way through the European courts. The cartel enabled builders to compare bids and then decide among themselves which company should be the 'designated bidder' for a particular building project. The chosen candidate was required to ensure that the ultimate price of the building project included sufficient funds to reimburse the unsuccessful builders for the cost of drawing up their bids and producing supporting documentation, such as blueprints. Builders, retailers and industrialists in the Netherlands bristle at the suggestion that the country is a cartel paradise. They believe cartels are just as prevalent in other countries but take place outside government control, making them more damaging. The construction industry, for example, regards its now-outlawed cartel as a 'transaction structure' which provided for fair and efficient bidding without inflating building prices. Mr Frans van Waarden, a Dutch sociologist at the University of Konstanz in southern Germany and a defender of cartels, believes 'cartels are nothing other than a form of decentralised regulation compared with the centralised regulation provided by governments'. Be that as it may, the Dutch government has served notice it will start prohibiting entire categories of cartels next year, to bring the Netherlands into line with the EC. By the mid-1990s the ministry's closely guarded cartel register is expected to have shrunk to just several dozen entries, from well over 500 at its peak.</p>

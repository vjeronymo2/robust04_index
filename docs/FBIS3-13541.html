The discussions focused on the security  situation in the country and the results of the security  measures that have been taken in all Lebanese areas in the wake  of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in Zuq Mikha'il, the  attempt to bomb the French cultural center in Ghadir, and the  wave of rumors that accompanied these developments. Attending  the meeting were Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul; Interior  Minister Bisharah Mirhij; Major General Rafiq al-Hasan, Internal  Security Forces director general; Public Security Director  General Raymond Rufayil; Maj. Gen. Nabih Farhat, state security  director general; Public Prosecutor Munif 'Uwaydat; Jabal Lubnan  Governor Amin Hammud; and a number of Army and security forces  officers. We now hear the resolutions passed at the meeting  read by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Fadl Dahir, secretary of the  Internal Security Council:    [Begin Dahir recording] His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri chaired a security meeting at his palace at noon  today. Attending the meeting were the defense minister, interior  minister, the public prosecutor, the legal investigator into the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing, the commanders of the security  agencies, and the envoy of the Syrian security and intelligence  department operating in Lebanon. During the meeting, the  conferees reviewed the security situation in the country, the  results of security investigations, and the accompanying sweeps  and detentions. The meeting addressed the following topics:    1. The meeting reviewed the results of the investigations by  the security agencies of the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and the ensuing sweeps and detentions that targeted  suspects and other defendants in bombings, according to legal  arrest warrants. These sweeps covered most Lebanese areas and  camps without discrimination from Sidon to 'Akkar. The sweeps,  which were carried out by all Lebanese security agencies and  occasionally backed by units of the Syrian Arab forces, resulted  in the arrest of 127 people.    2. The conferees stressed the Lebanese people's right to  resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and western  al-Biqa', noting the importance of the resistance's heroic acts  that undermined the Israeli enemy army and its agents in the  border strip. The conferees then discussed the ramifications of  the appearance of gunmen in Ba'labakk on Friday [11 March],  which is considered to be a flagrant violation of the law. They  also reviewed the measures taken by the military public  prosecution office against those who broke the law, particularly  since the negative effects of these violations overshadowed the  measures of the security agencies tasked with investigating the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    3. His Excellency the prime minister stressed the need for  the security agencies to continue their interrogations and  security measures until the networks of terrorism and sabotage,  which threaten the country's security, are uncovered,  particularly since the Lebanese judiciary supervises all these  measures. Al-Hariri pointed out that the general amnesty law  pardons former criminals but does not prevent the security  agencies from investigating previous or subsequent crimes to  preserve the country's security. The public attorney said that  the general amnesty law was based on the principle that amnesty  can be rescinded if a person commits new crimes similar to  previous ones. Accordingly, all these criminals remain under  watch and can be hunted down for all crimes, including the  pardoned ones. At the end of the meeting, al-Hariri expressed  his satisfaction with the work of the security agencies and  urged them to continue their work and be strict in their  interrogations and measures against all violators and criminals,  no matter to which party they belong.

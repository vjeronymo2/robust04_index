			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / PM signals readiness to opt out of EU integration Mr John Major last night signalled that his government would be ready to opt out of the next stage of European integration as he sketched out a 'multi-track, multi-speed' future for the European Union. In a speech designed to unite the Conservative party by stressing his determination not to cede further national sovereignty, the prime minister flatly rejected the 'old centralised prescription'. Instead he insisted that 'a new vision of Europe' was emerging in which 'the functions of the Community should be carried out in different ways, often involving different groups of states'. Speaking at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port, he added: 'I have never believed that Europe must invariably act as one on every issue. Trying to make every country conform to every plan is a socialist way of thinking: it not for us.' The prime minister's comments marked out the growing difference of approach between Britain and some of its EU partners over the evolution of EU decision-making. Earlier this week, Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for Europe, hit out at governments seeking to slow the pace of European integration and called for more centralised decision making. But Mr Major said yesterday: 'I don't happen to think that it threatens Europe if member states are free to do some things in their own way and at their own speed.' Senior Conservative party officials insisted he was not suggesting Britain would join the 'slow lane' of a two-speed Europe. Mr Major also made it clear that he was not raising the possibility that Britain - or any other EU state - could 'duck out' of commitments made in the past. But the speech was immediately seized on by opposition parties as an admission by the government of its failure in Europe. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said that in order to hold together the Conservative party, the prime minister 'is apparently willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in Europe'. The idea of a multi-speed Europe has been floated several times in recent weeks by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as a possible outcome of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of European integration. But last night marked the first time that Mr Major had taken up the theme of so-called 'variable geometry'. He also used his second rally of the campaign to warn that the opposition parties would allow Brussels to dictate Britain's taxation and foreign policies. Surrender of the national veto would threaten Britain's Pounds 3bn rebate from Brussels and could also lead to higher taxes set by the EU and to a loss of control over Britain's own foreign policy interests, Mr Major said.

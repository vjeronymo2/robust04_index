			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Swedish money rate hits 75% SWEDEN RAISED its lending rate to banks to 75 per cent yesterday and announced heavy foreign borrowing to protect the krona as Nordic financial markets suffered a second successive day of unrest. The unprecedented rise in the Bank of Sweden's marginal lending rate, which governs bank deposits and borrowings with the central bank, stabilised the exchange rate but sent shock waves across the Swedish stock market. The rate was increased from 16 per cent to 24 per cent on Tuesday. Share values fell by 2.2 per cent on the Stockholm bourse to 888.3 on the Veckans Affarer index. The insurance and banking sector were particularly hard hit. Trading in the shares of Trygg Hansa and Skandia, Sweden's two biggest insurance companies, were suspended after Svenska Kredit, a credit insurance group controlled by the two companies, announced it had halted payments for lack of liquid funds. The Swedish government, however, pledged to support Gota Bank, the country's fourth largest commercial bank, after it forecast a sharp deterioration in its financial position and warned that credit losses would amount to SKr8bn (Pounds 784m) in 1992. Mr Bengt Dennis, governor of the Bank of Sweden (Riksbank), said the interest rate increase was designed to 'send such a strong signal that no one can doubt our commitment to defend a fixed exchange rate'. The action was accompanied by news of a plan for the Riksbank and the National Debt Office to raise up to Ecu31bn (Pounds 22.5bn) in foreign borrowing to support the Swedish currency. The total volume is three times the borrowing to support sterling announced by the British Treasury last week. Other market interest rates rose yesterday. Nordbanken announced that its rate on home loans was going up by 5 percentage points to 22.5 per cent. Short-term property loans rose by 3.5 percentage points to 21 per cent. Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said the centre-right government was prepared to see the Riksbank's interest rates rise still further if necessary. 'The sky's the limit,' she said. 'The fixed exchange rate of the krona is the most important cornerstone of our entire economic policy . . . We will do what it takes to convince the outside world that we are not going to devalue.' Mrs Wibble said the Social Democratic opposition party, business organisations and trade unions all rejected devaluation. 'There is a national consensus and that ought to convince the international markets.' Detailing the borrowing plans, the Riksbank said it would add currency worth up to Ecu16bn to its foreign exchange reserves using borrowings both on its own behalf and by the National Debt Office. The sums would be used for intervention in foreign exchange markets. A 'substantial part' of the Ecu16bn had already been raised, Mr Dennis said. The Riksbank has formal swap agreements with the other Nordic central banks, and has called on 'certain other central banks' for assistance in supporting the currency. The National Debt Office is using separate standby credit facilities amounting to Dollars 3.4bn. In addition, Sweden is drawing on its US and Euro commercial paper programmes to raise a further Dollars 2bn. The government has told the National Debt Office to look at means of borrowing another Ecu15bn on behalf of the Riksbank if necessary.

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COVERT BIAS;  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION REMAINS A PROBLEM AT SOME JOB AGENCIES, BUT IT'S HIDDEN AND HARD  TO FIGHT.  </P> <P> Audrey Quintero, a Berkeley woman just starting a week of training for her new  job as a counselor at a temporary help agency, couldn't believe what she was  hearing.  </P> <P> The point of this business is to make money, Quintero recalled the trainer  explaining, no matter what the laws say about discrimination.  </P> <P> So if a company calls and says it wants to hire only men, just fill out the  "male" section of the job order form under the heading "Appropriate Dress," the  trainer told Quintero. If the company wants only women, fill out the "female"  section. Don't worry; the authorities won't be able to figure out the code.  </P> <P> When an employer says he will hire only "the highest-qualified candidate," the  trainer told Quintero, that means that she should send only whites. And if they  tell her that they don't want gays or Latinos or blacks? "We simply comply."  </P> <P> Quintero -- who recounts the story in a lawsuit she filed against the  employment agency, Temporaries Inc. -- may have stumbled upon the dirtiest  little secret of the personnel industry.  </P> <P> Government experts, lawyers and employment agency workers say a small but  persistent share of the nation's 20,000-odd permanent and temporary placement  services continue to engage in systematic, surreptitious discrimination against  women, minorities and older workers.  </P> <P> Although lawyers for Temporaries Inc. have dismissed Quintero's charges as "a  figment of this woman's imagination," hers is only one of several recent cases  to contend that plantation-era attitudes endure in the fast-growing personnel  placement business:  </P> <P> * A division of Kelly Services, the temporary industry's second-biggest  company, entered into a consent decree in March with the federal Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission to settle charges that for at least five  years its Phoenix office had made job assignments on the basis of its workers'  race.  </P> <P> When customers asked Kelly Assisted Living Services -- which supplies nurses  and health aides to shut-ins -- not to send blacks, Latinos or American  Indians, the firm met their demands, former company supervisors told the EEOC.  Managers reminded the staff every couple of months not to place blacks on jobs  in Sun City, a 99%-white retirement community. The rationale, Kelly officials  told the commission, was to save minorities the embarrassment of being rejected  by clients.  </P> <P> Kelly did not admit any wrongdoing in agreeing to pay up to $5,000 in back  earnings to employees who lost assignments, to train workers in its anti-bias  policies and to allow the EEOC broad access to its records for a three-year  monitoring period.  </P> <P> * Early in June, the commission filed a lawsuit charging that another Kelly  division in Phoenix had discriminated against a Latino woman by withdrawing her  from a job assignment because her temporary employer at an apartment complex  didn't like her accent.  </P> <P> Together, state and federal authorities received 348 complaints of  discrimination by employment agencies of all kinds last year. Kelly, with  564,000 employees, was the subject of 45 bias charges -- about 13% of the  total, close to its share of the temporary help market.  </P> <P> * Interplace/Transworld Recruit, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Japan's  scandal-plagued Recruit Co., is under investigation by the EEOC, which charged  late in May that the firm used a secret code in its internal records to keep  track both of job applicants' ages, race and sex and of employers' hiring  preferences.  </P> <P> If an employer wanted to hire whites between ages 20 and 35 only, for instance,  an Interplace memo instructed agency workers to write, "Talk to Mary; Suite  20-35," on the job order. "Do Not Talk to Maryanne" meant that the employer  refused to hire blacks, according to the memo, one of several company documents  that the commission made public in court filings.  </P> <P> * Employees of another Recruit subsidiary in Los Angeles, Recruit U.S.A., made  plans for a hiring campaign for IBM Japan in which non-Asians would be denied  consideration, according to another memo filed in court by the commission.  </P> <P> Recruit lawyers say there is no evidence that the companies discriminated  against job seekers, and they have charged in court that the EEOC violated  criminal law by publicizing its investigation. Officials of IBM Japan have said  Recruit misunderstood their wishes and that they have no indication that the  commission suspects IBM of misconduct.  </P> <P> Industry leaders acknowledge that, 20 or 30 years ago, discrimination was as  widespread in the personnel placement business as it was everywhere else in the  hiring world. But they are insistent that such acts today are the isolated,  outlaw practices of a handful of placement workers willing to violate clear  company policies to boost their earnings or satisfy customer demands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pander to Requests  </P> <P> "To do this on a regular or one-time basis is suicidal," said Samuel R. Sacco,  executive vice president of the National Assn. of Temporary Services,  headquartered in Alexandria, Va. "Even if we wanted to do it, we can't afford  to discriminate, because we don't have enough people in this country to fill  the job orders we've got."  </P> <P> But civil rights authorities say it is clear that some placement firms --  whatever their official policies -- are perpetuating job bias by pandering to  their clients' discriminatory requests.  </P> <P> "It's great to have a policy, but the bottom line is they're out there to make  money, and unfortunately it's the clients' wishes that reign supreme," said  Sandra J. Padegimas, a trial attorney in Phoenix for the EEOC.  </P> <P> Lynn Eaton, a regional manager in Downey for United Temporary Services, had her  ethics put to the test early this year.  </P> <P> A client needed a receptionist. The qualifications? "Blond, blue-eyed, thin and  unmarried," the personnel clerk told Eaton, president of the Los Angeles County  chapter of the California Assn. of Temporary Services. "I said, 'Do you realize  you just violated every labor code there is?' "  </P> <P> Abiding by the policy favored by her trade association, Eaton said she refused  to fill the discriminatory job order. Instead, she offered to send the best  qualified candidates to the job, whatever their color, looks or background --  and thereby lost a customer.  </P> <P> "It's difficult as business people to walk away from business," Eaton said.  "However, we have to make decisions about what kind of business we want to have  and how we conduct that business."  </P> <P> The biggest employment firms -- Kelly and Manpower -- train their employees to  walk away from clients who list illegal racial, sexual or age-related  characteristics when they place an order for permanent or temporary workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Strict Policy  </P> <P> "If you were to ask me to swear on a stack of Bibles I know for sure no field  office is doing that, I couldn't do it," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chief  executive of Milwaukee-based Manpower and its British parent, Blue Arrow PLC,  the world's largest employment services company. "But I would be shocked and  disappointed if I learned anybody was."  </P> <P> Kelly's policy, likewise, leaves little room for doubt: "We will not accept any  order or be involved in any situation that requires or implies discrimination."  </P> <P> Yet Donna J. Rheaves says that when she tried to follow that policy, she was  fired.  </P> <P> Rheaves had enjoyed working for Kelly in the Washington suburbs, so when she  moved to Phoenix, she took a job in 1984 at Kelly Assisted Living (known at the  time as Kelly Health Care), with responsibility for hiring and firing home and  institutional health workers.  </P> <P> This was not the Kelly that Rheaves had known before. When county agencies  called for temporary workers, the Phoenix office sent blacks, reasoning that  most of the county's clients were black, Rheaves said. If retirees in Sun City  said they would not accept minorities as home aides, Kelly wrote the racial  preference on the job order and sent only whites.  </P> <P> Rheaves, who is black, refused to go along. "I'm of the thinking that I didn't  want to be sued," she explained. "If a company or a private individual said, 'I  don't want a black person, will you send me a white person?' I said, 'We are an  equal opportunity employer.' "  </P> <P> Although Reaves helped boost the office's revenue and had been promoted just a  month before, Kelly fired her without warning in January, 1985, for what EEOC  investigators later concluded were trumped-up reasons. Kelly paid Rheaves  $28,000 to settle her discrimination charge and later signed the consent decree  ending the broader investigation that she had inspired.  </P> <P> But Rheaves has yet to rebound from the experience. With her 8-year-old son,  she has been on and off welfare, sometimes sleeping in a car, while she has  struggled to get a permanent job. When companies learn that she once filed a  discrimination case against an employer, Rheaves explained, they grow wary.  </P> <P> "People look at you as a troublemaker," said Rheaves, who now lives near  Atlanta. "I sometimes do regret what I did. It's hurt my son. We've had to live  a whole different life style. And it seems like I can't get back to where we  were."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Catch  </P> <P> Civil rights agencies laid down the law against discrimination by employment  services in the early 1970s. A series of EEOC decisions struck down such hoary  industry practices as reserving higher-paid jobs for whites and assigning  blacks only to domestic work, or policies against referring women for  management jobs.  </P> <P> Catching agencies in the act of discrimination has grown harder since then. Job  seekers often are unaware that they have been the victims of bias -- they may  get a placement, just not the best one -- so government officials are dependent  on workers within employment firms.  </P> <P> "And when they leave, they don't want to say anything, because they'll be  blackballed," said Carol Schiller, regional administrator in Los Angeles for  the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission. Hamstrung by a lack of  funds, Schiller has dropped plans to conduct a hearing on employment agencies'  conduct. But she has been invited to lecture the local temporary help  association in the fall.  </P> <P> Lately, Japanese companies -- unaccustomed to operating in a multicultural land  -- have become a focus in the United States of complaints about employment  discrimination. The personnel placement industry is no exception to the trend.  </P> <P> In addition to the ongoing investigation of Recruit, former employees contend  that Persona, another large Japanese employment services firm with U.S.  headquarters in Los Angeles, has systematically discriminated against  minorities and women in job placements. Several of the ex-employees have  themselves filed bias charges against the company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used Coded References  </P> <P> When Persona established U.S. operations four years ago, ex-employees say,  separate files were kept for job applications from older women and blacks to  avoid placing such workers in Japanese-owned companies that preferred not to  hire them. Or a black dot would be used to signify a black's application.  </P> <P> The former employees say a gummed note describing the job seeker's appearance  was attached to most applications, designed for easy disposal if some  government investigator came snooping. Later, they said, coded references to  applicants' race, age and sex were placed in personnel records.  </P> <P> Persona President Muneaki Ueda -- seated in his downtown Los Angeles office  beneath a photo showing him arm in arm with Florence Griffith Joyner, the black  track star who is Persona's celebrity spokesperson in Japan -- denied that the  company has ever set out to discriminate.  </P> <P> Some employees may have made furtive notes about job seekers' characteristics,  he conceded, but if so, they were violating company policies. Yet Ueda  acknowledged that until recently, workers received little training in those  policies.  </P> <P> "The corporate policy was clear in my mind, and I thought that all the managers  were clear," said Ueda, who also had difficulty, during an interview, recalling  one of his chief critics, a man who was his top assistant from 1985 to 1987.  "But I cannot be 100%."  </P> <P> Ueda said he wants Persona to be a leader among Japanese companies in  understanding American business norms.  </P> <P> How? He's conducting seminars for other Japanese businesses on how to abide by  anti-discrimination laws.  </P></p>

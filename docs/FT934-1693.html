			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Arts: Lully's 'Roland' - Opera in Paris Nothing in France's operatic life has given greater cause for cheer in recent years than the rediscovery of its baroque heritage. The principal beneficiary has been Lully: first came the ground-breaking Atys at the Opera-Comique in 1987, then a project by the Theatre des Champs-Elysees to stage his three tales of medieval chivalry - Amadis, Roland and Armide. That trilogy has just been completed with the first performances for more than two centuries of Roland, in a production which Paris is sharing with Lisbon, Montpellier and Lyon. The title role is sung by Jose van Dam, an acknowledged master of French style. The conductor is Rene Jacobs, one of several rising stars in period instrument performance on the continent. And the producer - a Belgian like the other two - is Gilbert Deflo, fresh from a string of successes in Monteverdi. Why, then, was Roland such a flop? It is hard to blame the work itself. Premiered at Versailles in 1685 in the presence of Louis XIV, who had chosen the subject, Roland is based on Ariosto's epic poem Orlando furioso, which was to inspire numerous other composers after Lully (including Handel, whose opera comes to the Theatre des Champs-Elysees in February). This was the tenth tragedie lyrique on which Lully and his librettist Philippe Quinault collaborated, and their experience shows. The libretto is a masterpiece of compression. Roland woos Angelique, who prefers Medor; his love unrequited, Roland vents his anger, is put to sleep by a fairy and wakes up calmer, wiser and determined to seek glory in defence of his country. The theme - tailored to suit the mood of the French court - is the eternal conflict between love and reason, dressed in the clothes of crusading knights and oriental queens. The only obvious weakness is structural: Roland does not appear in the first act, is overshadowed by Angelique and Medor in the next two and dominates acts four and five. Whether the music matches the quality of Lully's other mature stage works was hard to tell from this performance. It sounded less good, but judgment was heavily influenced by the nondescript staging. William Orlandi confined his decor to a series of anonymous pictorial drop-cloths, overhung by wave upon wave of puffy cloud. No attempt was made to recreate the effects of baroque machinery or provide a sense of spectacle. The principals gestured vacuously. The chorus, dressed in wishy-washy apricot robes, adopted static, doll-like poses. The dances were anodyne. In the pit, Concerto Koln played with precision and textural refinement  - but this was more than offset by Jacobs' strict tempos and unyielding rhythms, robbing the recitatives of their supple expressiveness. Only in the gentle airs and symphonies of the final act  - which must rank among Lully's most noble music - did Jacobs begin to relax. The other major problem was the undercasting of three major roles. Ann Panagulias, who made her name as Lulu in San Francisco, lacked the histrionic and vocal opulence for Angelique. Harry Nicoll, in the haute-contre part of Medor, sounded puny and looked effeminate. Claire Brua turned the benevolent fairy Logistille into a dull figurine. Not all was gloom. The words were audible. Themire, Angelique's confidante, was sung by the statuesque Veronique Gens, whose handsome low soprano deserves wider hearing. Rufus Muller's Tersandre livened up the pastoral divertissement of the act four wedding party. And despite an unflattering red wig and costume, Jose van Dam sang with all the conviction he could muster. Here at last was evidence of Lully's seamless fusion of verse and music; here was evidence of psychological development, as Roland's hope gave way to despair. But Van Dam could not carry the show alone. Perhaps the merits of Roland will be more obvious when the promised recording is issued next spring.</p>

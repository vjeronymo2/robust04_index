			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Christopher Lockwood report: "Tory Euro-MPs Fight Threats </F> to Sovereignty"]    [Text] Strasbourg -- The EC Centre-Right group to which  Britain's Conservative Euro-MPs [MEP's] are affiliated yesterday  tabled a draft constitution that is likely to be embarrassing in  the run-up to the June elections for the European Parliament.    It will also embarrass the Labour Party which, a spokesman  said, favoured adopting the constitution as a basis for  discussion but did not endorse all its provisions.    The document, if adopted, would commit Britain to abandoning  border controls; accepting majority voting on foreign policy;  ending the system of rotating EC presidencies, and accepting  vast increases in the power of the European Parliament -- where  Britain holds only 15 percent of the seats.    The constitution was proposed by Mr Fernand Herman, a member  of Belgium's Centre-Right Social Christian Party, and draws  support from much of the European People's Party (EPP), the  loose grouping to which Tory Euro-MPs belong.    Mr Leo Tindemans, the Belgian leader of the EPP, said  yesterday that he favoured adopting the constitution as a basis  for discussion.    But all 32 Conservative Euro-MPs are committed to voting  against it, in the latest rift between the pro-federalist  parties of Europe and the British contingent, whose future in  the EPP group is far from secure.    A vote on a resolution which "approves this constitution as  a  basis for wider discussions" and commits Parliament to circulate  it among EC officials and member governments is expected to take  place later today. It is likely to go through. But the chances  of the constitution ever being adopted are remote.    The details are, however, a good guide to thinking among the  Christian Democrat partners of the Conservative Party.    Many of the ideas are likely to surface in the run-up to  1996, when government heads are due to decide the next stages in  the integration of Europe.    Enthusiasts for federalism pointed out yesterday that the  Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty both had their  genesis in a similar kite-flying exercise by the Euro-Parliament  10 years ago.    British Conservative Euro-MPs and officials have reacted in  horror to some of the constitution's provisions. The proposals  that most offend Britain's notions of sovereignty are:    The EC's unelected and barely accountable bureaucracy would  have the sole right to suggest foreign and security policy  initiatives to the European Commission. These would then go to  an EC vote and need only be adopted by a majority. At the  moment, votes must be unanimous, giving Britain an effective  veto, which would disappear.    The European Parliament would have the sole right to elect  the Commission president, a job which M Jacques Delors, the  incumbent, has shown to be perhaps the most powerful in Europe.  That decision currently rests with member states.    The Euro-Parliament would have the right to initiate  constitutional reforms.    It would compel Britain to elect its Euro-MPs by a "common"  European system -- inevitably a form of proportional  representation.    It would replace the rotating EC presidency with a system of  renewable one-year appointments, which would go to a vote by  member states. This could lead to indefinite exclusion for some  countries.    It would give the Parliament the right to veto any treaty  concluded by the EC.    Meanwhile, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the EC's information  commissioner, revealed details of the Commission's new freedom  of information policy, whose produres, he claimed, will allow  the release of 99 percent of documents placed before the  Commission.    The procedures will be in place by the end of the month.  However, sceptics doubt that they will work well in practice,  noting that last year the Commission adopted a code of practice  which allows it almost unlimited discretion to refuse disclosure  of internal documents.</p>

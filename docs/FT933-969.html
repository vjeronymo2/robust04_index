			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Stern Richard, angry Hamlet - Shakespeare in the provinces FOR THOSE in government who thought Shakespeare had crept out of topicality, The Tragedy of King Richard II (1597) offers this apposite observation: 'The wavering commons; their love lies in their purses, and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.' More broadly, the play asks what a political community should do with a leader who presides over divided followers and exiles dissent in this fine Richard II at the Royal Exchange Manchester. The director James Macdonald has focused on clear verse and sumptuous costumes rather than the grand display, recognising that this theatre in the round is no place for elaborate tableaux. The result is a stern interpretation of Shakespeare's sprawling, brawling pageant. Shakespeare's hindsight looks like the exact science it was when the Elizabethan picture is imposed on the medieval world. Macdonald's production keeps the tang of both, not only in the costumes (Kandis Cook) but in the weight given to the prophecies and predictions the characters make. The open sets rely on stark lighting and plain furniture, allowing the action to speak. The inward naggings of Richard's last scenes have to be earned by the outward political manoeuvrings in the early part of the play. The production achieves both: Richard's loss of control in the Mowbray-Bolingbroke debate, his inequitable sentencing of both, and his fits of kingliness in public contrast with the steadiness of John of Gaunt and the Duke of York, the country's two wise men. Linus Roache as Richard is all measured pauses and level quietness, although he finds a 'kind of ease' at Pomfret Castle with the edgy lines 'I wasted time and now doth time waste me.' Roache makes Richard a slight figure opposite the tousled Bolingbroke (Neil Dudgeon), a model of purpose and intent. An intelligent production, as this is, often reworks overlooked or traditionally seen characters. Ewan Hooper's strong Duke of York and James Maxwell's febrile John of Gaunt are the voices of conscience. Their firmness makes Richard and England into archetypes of political confusion, the country sold off, 'leased out like to a tenement or pelting farm.' Plus ca change. The English Touring Theatre Hamlet, now at Oxford on its national tour, is a surprising, breathless and unpredictable production built on simple and clean lines. It avoids the theatrical cliches of Hamlet with skull, Hamlet holding mirror up to nature not by passing them up, but by passing through them rapidly en route to the conclusion. The director Stephen Unwin has a lightly-cut text, a white set, a raked floor and minimal clutter, so minimal that Polonius has to carry his own curtains - a form of 'arrasment. The production's energies are focussed in Hamlet (Alan Cumming), Claudius (Pip Donaghy), and Polonius (Trevor Baxter) who carry the action forward with danger and suspense but keep each scene plausible. Cumming makes Hamlet angry with himself and disappointed in the world. He stalks the stage, his mind fizzing like phosphorus on water, sparking and smoking. His language is new-minted and his insights fresh. He makes 'To be or not to be' come across as a man thinking things through rather than an actor embarrassed to have reached that point in the play. Baxter and Donaghy play quickfire politicians. They make Eleanor Bron's Gertrude look flat-footed and unconvincing. She is a fine revue artist and actor of Chekhov, most at home with intimacy. But Gertrude's character is established in public, with other actors. She has yet to find the range. She lacks the necessary rapport both with Claudius and with the audience; without this rapport, Hamlet's appeals to her sound hollow. The lighting by Ben Ormerod (who lit Three Hotels at the Tricycle Theatre so well) lacks contrast, the kinds of shadowy effects in Olivier's murky film version. The production should be pithier and even pacier by the time it reaches London in November. Richard II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester (061-833 9833) until October 9 Hamlet at the Oxford Playhouse (0865 798600) until September 25. Then touring to Worthing, Whitley Bay, Buxton, Winchester, Dartford, and London (Donmar Warehouse)</p>

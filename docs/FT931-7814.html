			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / French politician Lecanuet dies at 72 FRENCH politician Jean Lecanuet, who forced General Charles de Gaulle into an embarrassing run-off in France's 1965 presidential elections, died yesterday after a long illness, Reuter reports from Paris. He was 72. Mr Lecanuet stood against De Gaulle as a centre-right candidate, opposing the president's moves to take France out of the military structure of Nato, and bringing US-style advertising campaign methods to French politics for the first time. He received 15.6 per cent of the vote, forcing De Gaulle into a run-off with Mr Francois Mitterrand. Mr Lecanuet later allied himself to Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who rewarded him with the justice portfolio when he was elected president in 1974. Mr Lecanuet remained a pro-European voice in the French senate in which he served for more than 30 years and was regarded as a particularly successful mayor of his home city of Rouen.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Technology: Detectives of the database - Police in central Scotland are no longer dominated by form-filling since project Trace, an IT system that allows access to a wealth of intelligence / Software at Work It's a bad week for criminals in central Scotland. Coming online in Alloa is a computer system that can take information in any form available - paper, voices, video frames, mugshots - and search for coincidences and common factors across a series of crimes. By linking with existing databases and making free-text searches across all sorts of data, the police can make the most of even fragments of information, such as the colour of a van and just one letter of its number plate. The Criminal Intelligence Application is the second phase of a project called Trace, which has already cut paperwork in half since the first phase went live at the end of March. Now it is enabling the police to make connections between events, crimes, locations, even rumour, hearsay and the background knowledge that comes from years of experience. Walk into any police station to report a lost dog, and the paperwork takes at least 20 minutes. Form-filling is the tedious but essential part of policing and it steals time from activities the public sees as more important: patrolling and solving crimes. Once a charge is made, the paperwork escalates and accuracy is vital: poor paperwork provides legal loopholes. Central Scotland Police confirmed their worst suspicions when investigating procedures two years ago - the same information was often filled in up to 27 times on various forms. The research team interviewed nearly 300 officers of all ranks, with experience ranging from six months to nearly 30 years. The examination included the end-purpose of the paperwork: what elements were vital for the Criminal Justice System, the Crown Office and other ultimate users outside the police. 'I was looking for a system that would make the front line policeman's job easier and cut down on the paperwork they are inevitably required to do,' explains William Wilson, the chief constable of central Scotland. He was not alone in feeling these needs would not be met by 'off the shelf' solutions available from the main suppliers of police systems, including McDonnell Douglas and Bull. Wilson sits on the Police National Computer board and represents Scotland on the police Technical and Research Committee. In his previous job as deputy chief constable in Fife, his interest in technology led to a joint development with Memex, whose software he had discovered on the police grapevine. The software, called the Memex Information Engine, enables users to make fast, free-text data retrieval (Textract) across a number of different databases. Several systems already help the police in various areas: PNC2, the Police National Computer and Holmes, used to co-ordinate significant investigations. Central Scotland wanted a system that would give them access to all these existing resources and their own databases, cutting out repetitive paperwork. They got that and more - a system that could provide real 'intelligence' and the ability to make connections. For police use, the system has been tailored into a product known as CCIMS - Crime and Criminal Information Management. The central Scotland implementation, Trace, goes one step further according to Wilson. 'It gives us the edge in terms of technology. I like to think it's a new era for policing.' The project required special funding and an investment in manpower, involving two senior inspectors for two years. The development principles were that everyone on the force should be able to use the system, (unlike the PNC2 computer), and that it should adhere to all existing standards, both technical - such as Gosip, the communication standard - and those used internally in the police and justiciary. It also had to provide 24-hour access to existing databases and be user-friendly for first-time users. Text retrieval often relies on the text being pre-indexed for keywords. Free-text retrieval allows any word or part of a word, even an approximation of it - known as a 'fuzzy match' - to be sought and matched. The Memex Textract software gets round the problem of slow retrieval due to storing enormous amounts of information by compressing data, using special codes and algorithms. Its speed enables it to capture new data generated by everyday incidents and police work and connect it with other available sources. 'People are restricted by budget, but the beauty of this solution is that it doesn't force you to abandon investment or change direction, because it can work with almost any existing database,' says Wilson. Inspector Peter Watson has led the Trace project since the initial research. 'One of the overriding considerations was that it had to allow expansion with ease. The system isn't just representative of the force workload, it is the workload. It's been designed to facilitate everything the officer does,' says Watson. The next step, coming into force this week, is a multimedia extension, the Criminal Intelligence Application, which brings video clips, paper records, photographs and voice data onto one screen. One demonstration of the extensions uses a real example - a search based on a recorded telephone conversation, reported by a radio amateur. The name of a local wood, a villain's nickname and the mention of a manhole cover, became search elements that put the police onto a leading drug ring. 'Without the Textract facility, that tape might have gone into someone's drawer as interesting but useless data and never been exploited for what it could tell us,' says Detective Constable Tom Newlands, a member of the Trace team. 'It's very flexible: it can take its data from any media, any source, from old black and white prints, to electronic-input,' says Newlands. 'It can also compress a PNC2 dump to one fifth of its size.' A screen menu details every form-filling task possible: results of breathalyser tests, statistics reports, property crimes, lost and found register. A high proportion of information is available through default, so that certain items appear on the screen automatically, saving keystrokes and increasing accuracy. Every address and post code in the area is on file. When in doubt, a user can 'point and pick' from a look-up table of options, such as crime codes. Wilson does not plan an assessment until the system has been in place a year, but benefits are already visible, such as the few seconds it takes to check an address. According to Inspector Tom Sneddon, an everyday end-user of Trace at Alloa, a lot of information that was not immediately relevant used to be lost. 'The problem is that you never know exactly what might be useful. Now it just sits there - it's there when we need it.' Benefits in local information-sharing with Fife are also apparent, and Wilson is keen to see the system adopted elsewhere: 'I never envisaged it being as comprehensive as it now is. We started with log entries and basic crime reports. Now we've gained a distinct head in terms of technology and the individual officers are the main beneficiaries.' ***** BUZZWORDS FREE-TEXT RETRIEVAL describes the storage, search and retrieval of large quantities of word-based data, now also known as 'full information management'. A SOUNDEX SEARCH retrieves all words of the same sound but varied spelling. A fuzzy match allows a search to be made on an approximation of a word. A WILD CARD SEARCH looks for any number of characters which might explain an indistinct word: Torloisk, recorded in the drugs raid, was found to be the name of a wood by searching an intelligence database of previous drug cache locations. ***** NATURE OF BUSINESS Central Scotland Police is the second smallest of Scotland's eight forces. With its headquarters in Stirling, it covers an area of approximately 1,000sq miles between the Forth and Clyde estuaries. It is divided into two territorial divisions and runs six local command units. EMPLOYEES: Around 800, including an establishment strength of 649 officers and 150 civilians. CRIME STATISTICS: Reported crime within central region has shown a decrease to April 1993 of 1,974 crimes, 7.9 per cent down on the previous year, with a detection rate of 55.9 per cent. KEY PERSONNEL: Chief Constable William Wilson, Inspector Peter Watson, Trace project leader, Detective Constable Tom Newlands, Trace development and specification, based in Alloa. TECHNOLOGY FILE SOFTWARE: The Trace system, Total Retrieval Administration Crimes and Events  -is based on Memex software for text information retrieval called the Memex Information Engine. With development and implementation from Central Scotland Police, Memex has made this into a police product, Crime/Criminal Information Management System CCIMS, already used by Fife Constabulary, under the name Focis, Fife Occurrence and Crime Information System. (Trace works on PCs and Unix workstations and 'bolts on' as a front end to existing databases.) Currently all connections to other databases such as PNC2 are ad hoc, but a permanent live link with the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal is planned in November. SUPPLIER: Memex, now based in East Kilbride, was founded by Edinburgh academics, Fred Heath and Graham Woyka, in 1979, and was bought by microfiche supplier Microfilm Reprographics Data Management in 1991. Memex had a turnover of pounds 1.4m in 1992-93. HARWARE: A central Sun Sparcserver 670, in a distributed X25 network with 4 Sparcstations, 2 computers, all running under the Unix operating system. It supports 320 dumb terminals, 25 intelligent terminal Sun X-stations and two PCs for imaging. VALUE OF SYSTEM: Cost was about pounds 900,000 with about half, pounds 550,000 accounting for hardware and communications.</p>

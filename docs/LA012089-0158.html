			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PBS 13-PART DOCUMENTARY SERIES LETS PARTICIPANTS TELL STORY OF NUCLEAR AGE  </P> <P> The first atomic explosion, in July, 1945, in the desert of New Mexico, changed  the world forever. Since then, nations with nuclear weapons and those without  have been obliged to do their political maneuvering in a world that could  destroy itself.  </P> <P> PBS' 13-part documentary series, "War and Peace in the Nuclear Age," premiering  Monday, sets out to examine a subject of major importance both now and in the  future, as well as to offer a retrospective on how we arrived at the atomic  edge.  </P> <P> Executive producer Zvi Dor-Ner, who began the project in 1984, noted: "All the  nations who have nuclear weapons say they need them to preserve peace. . . .  Yet they have risked nuclear war to preserve other values they believe in. This  tension is the story of 'War and Peace in the Nuclear Age.'  </P> <P> "We tell the story through its participants -- neither heroes nor villains,  simply ordinary people thrust into situations of extraordinary magnitude and  complexity."  </P> <P> Although the film makers had hoped to arrive at solutions, they eventually  concluded that they had no answers. Instead, they settled for trying to  increase understanding. Each installment has been planned to cover a theme and  historic period.  </P> <P> Monday's opener, called "Dawn," goes back to the scientific experiments of 1932  that led to the development of the atomic bomb, and to the desperate days in  the spring and summer of 1945 that preceded the first nuclear explosion at  Alamogordo.  </P> <P> The man responsible for developing the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer,  recalls: "A few people laughed. A few people cried. Most people were silent. I  remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita: 'Now I am  become Death, destroyer of worlds.' "  </P> <P> The following installment is "The Weapon of Choice," tracing how two former  allies, the United States and the Soviet Union, became adversaries, each able  to wield a nuclear arsenal.  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CAP-Gatt compatibility 'totally illusory' THE European Commission's claims that the Community-US agreement on the farm chapter of the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations is compatible with last May's reform of the common agricultural policy are 'totally illusory', France claimed yesterday. The new French attack on the accord, reached last November in Washington, came as EC farm ministers examined the report prepared by senior officials of the 12, aimed at measuring its 'compatibility' with the new CAP - which all member states have agreed needs to be established before it can go ahead. It also comes as France's socialist government faces overwhelming defeat in Sunday's parliamentary elections. Mr Jean Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said the commission's claims that the reformed CAP fits into the undertakings Brussels has negotiated with the US under the Uruguay Round was based on 'chancy techniques, optimistic interpretations, and arguable assertions'. 'I don't believe in miracles,' Mr Soisson said. The current French government has threatened to veto the Washington agreement, even though it is not clear whether it can do so under EC law - unless it gets sufficient support from other member states. Leading members of the centre-right opposition, who look poised for a landslide in the elections, have spoken while on the stump of renegotiating both the Washington agreement and CAP reform, and even of boycotting the EC if the accord goes through. Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, said last night that the 'compatibility' discussion was none the less 'very muted'. He said: 'It was left in a very general haze. . . as is suitable for the next two weeks.' By then the French elections will be over, and on April 5 EC foreign ministers are expected to endorse the oilseeds part of the Washington agreement. This is separate from the Uruguay Round proper. But Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, believes a US on the trade offensive against the EC might seek further concessions from the European agriculture unless it is quickly 'banked'. Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner who negotiated the Washington accord, secured a deal allowing the EC to plant the same area of oilseeds as envisaged under CAP reform, an outcome better than the 'bottom line' France drew at the time. France's main disagreement is on the commission's projections for cereals, and in particular permitted levels of subsidised grains exports under the Uruguay Round arrangements. It claims increases in productivity will push EC output over the allowed limits by 1999. But, as one senior UK official put it, 'the instruments are there under the reformed CAP to allow for further adjustments. It's a little bit bogus to sit down now and discuss cereals yields in 1999.' Mr Gummer summed up the situation: 'everybody accepted that if you accepted the (commission's) assumptions, then it was compatible; if you didn't, it wasn't'.</p>

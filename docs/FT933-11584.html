			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Tory party workers braced for by-election defeat CONSERVATIVE party workers in Christchurch were bracing themselves for defeat in today's by-election, as last-minute campaigning drew to an end in the Dorset seaside constituency. But with all parties reporting that a significant proportion of voters canvassed were still wavering, the size of the expected anti-Tory swing remained uncertain. A victory for the Liberal Democrats in the former Conservative stronghold would cut the government's overall majority in the House of Commons to 17. A disaster for the Tories in the constituency they held by more than 23,000 in the general election has been so widely predicted that the political damage has to some extent been discounted. Even so, a large majority for Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, would be a fresh humiliation for Mr John Major's beleaguered administration. The government's efforts to put the difficulties of the past year behind it were dealt a further setback by a national opinion poll which showed support for the Tories at 27 per cent - their lowest rating since December 1981. Only 19 per cent of those questioned were satisfied with the prime minister's performance, while almost three-quarters were dissatisfied. The Mori survey, in today's Times also showed rising support for the Liberal Democrats at 25 per cent, while Labour was on 44 per cent. The polling was taken between 22-26 July with a sample of 1,689 people. In Christchurch, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, sought to capitalise on the recent signs of economic recovery. But party workers brought in to support Mr Rob Hayward, the Tory candidate, appeared to be pinning some hope on discontented Conservatives abstaining. One or two activists even conceded that their task was to contain the Liberal Democrat majority rather than win the seat. Although the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel have been a significant reason for the loss of support in the constituency, Sir Norman ruled out any changes in VAT policy after the by-election. Labour, widely predicted to come a poor third in the vote, said it hoped that the growing anti-Tory sentiment in the area would help Labour to secure greater support in the south in the next election. A total of 14 candidates are standing in the by-election, which was caused by the death of Conservative MP, Mr Robert Adley. Labour U-turn, Page 5 Lib Dems call, Page 7</p>

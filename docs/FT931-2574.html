			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DISAPPOINTMENT that the UK government was unlikely to follow the Bundesbank in reducing interest rates led to a decline in the Footsie futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The last full trading session for the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index saw it open at 2,889 and it was quickly sold down, setting a day's low of 2,876 at 9.30am. But speculation and hopes that the German monetary authorities were about to lower rates led to buying of the contract and by midday it was trading at 2,912, the high for the session. A subsequent period of sideways trading was followed around lunchtime by the announcement from the Bundesbank that it was making a  1/2 percentage point rate cut. This, however, failed to lead to follow-through buying and, coupled with the lack of a similar move from the UK authorities, saw the contract relinquish the earlier gain. March traded in a tight 10-point range for the two hours until the market's close. It finished at 2,877, once again at a small discount to the underlying cash market, with turnover a reasonable 11,071 lots. Today's expiry of the March index options provided the main feature in traded options, leading to strong volume in the index options. Total turnover was 32,164 contracts, of which 12,242 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,314 in the Euro FT-SE. Asda was the busiest stock option, with 2,865 lots traded.</p>

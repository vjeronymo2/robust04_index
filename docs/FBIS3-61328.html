			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Chirkov: "And the Bank Just Nods and </F> Keeps Doing Its Own Thing"]    [Text] There was a certain period of time when the main  cause of delays in clearing were "bottlenecks" in integrated  clearing centers of the Central Bank of Russia. Then they  dissipated. Delays in payments still occur, however. But now for  a different reason. Some banks shamelessly keep their clients'  money in the turnover for their own profit. At the same time,  they try to blame those same clearing centers or technical  errors, or sometimes computer breakdowns.    We have already reported to our readers (RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA,  17 December) how unceremoniously the commercial Narodnyy Bank  treated its client, Moscow's Main Health Care Administration, in  December, leaving thousands of health care workers in the  capital city without salaries.    In January the situation repeated itself. And with the same  deplorable outcome for hospital and outpatient clinic employees.  On 4 January, on the eve of payday for doctors, medical  attendants, and other health care employees, the Government of  Moscow's Department of Finance instructed Narodnyy Bank to  transfer from its account to the account of the city's Main  Health Care Administration 17.62 billion rubles [R]. However,  the money had not left Narodnyy Bank on the 4th, or even on the  10th. Thus, over seven days this money, which the bank kept in  circulation instead of carrying out the client's instruction,  brought it--even at an interest rate of 210 percent (within  Central Bank's official clearing rate)--R700 million tax-free  profit.    Actually, of the payment order of its client--Moscow's  Department of Finance--Narodnyy Bank did deign it appropriate to  transfer....R1.7 billion. When the client complained  indignantly, the bank simply dismissed it: "The machine probably  failed to print an extra zero," they said. Meanwhile, though,  the clever bank did collect almost R700 million in interest.    This is a good time to bring up another subject as well.  Narodnyy is one of the few commercial banks which, with the  snobbishness of the former State Bank's branch, loans out money  from its clients' accounts. At the same time, however, it does  not find it necessary to share the interest earned on these  loans with the owners of this money. To this day, Narodnyy Bank  has not entered a single kopek in interest on the so-called  residual money into its clients' accounts.    In violation of all norms established by the Central Bank,  Narodnyy Bank uses an impermissible great share of its clients'  money for loans in the high-risk zone--to various limited  liability partnerships and joint-stock companies. Which are  unable to pay off these loans. And the bank, as we have seen,  cannot make good on its liability to the clients.    The only thing that is hard to comprehend is why they get  away with all these mercenary transgressions.</p>

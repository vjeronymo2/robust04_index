			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Observer: Mickey-take 'Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E,' runs the jingle. Just don't hum it too loudly on Japan Airlines. Plagued by poor earnings, JAL this summer launched a Disney campaign, daubing three of its aircraft in Disney characters and showing Disney films to befuddled passengers. Its air hostesses - average age 31.2 years - were required to dress up as Minnie Mouse, including those distinctive outsize black ears. They didn't much like that. Some even had the nerve to say they felt like Bunny girls. Wrong rodent, surely? Anyway, their union has now wrung a concession from management. In an effort to stem the squeaking, the hostesses are now being given Minnie Mouse aprons, 'to make wearing the head gear easier.' Terrific.</p>

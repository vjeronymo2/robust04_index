			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bae retreats Shares in British Aerospace retreated sharply, falling 47 to 502p, after analysts downgraded earnings per share expectations for the current year, following a second more detailed results meeting with the company. The changes of recommendation followed the revelation of a higher than anticipated tax charge. Mr Paul Ruddle at NatWest Securities reduced his current year EPS forecast from 31.5p to 19.3p and made a cut for the following year from 55.4p to 37.6p. Mr Chris Avery at Paribas reduced his current year forecast by a penny to 34p, and the 1995 figure by 8p to 50p. A retreat in Thorn EMI, which reported good results on Tuesday, saw the shares slide 40 to 1100p on profit-taking and continuing concern over the company's caution towards analysts wanting to upgrade their profit forecasts. The stock was also the subject of a multimedia warrant from SG Warburg, with a 30 per cent weighting along with Pearson at 28 per cent. Four European media stocks make up the rest of the basket. Pearson shares fell 17 to 685p. Drinks stocks held up well in the weak market, although dealers attributed this to their recent underperformance rather than a more fundamental reason. Bass jumped 8 on news of a marketing agreement with Grolsch, before closing 5 down at 520p. Grand Metropolitan moved in the reverse direction, being hit badly in the morning as Swiss food giant Nestle tumbled in Zurich on talk of a profits warning. This later turned out to be merely a number of analysts downgrades and GrandMet recovered to close 4 off at 457p. Drugs and DIY group Boots was the best performing stores stock, the shares staying firm at 534p with 3.7m traded. Dealers said Kleinwort Benson was recommending the stock, with a target price of 600p. UBS was also positive. Good two-way business in Burton saw the shares edge up a half-penny to 51 3/4 p with 12m traded. There was takeover talk around Bernard Matthews, lifting the shares initially. They ended 3 down at 110p. Hazlewood Foods held up to close just 2 down at 153p ahead of an analysts visit today. Tumbling Hong Kong stocks hit several related shares in London. HSBC fell 54 to 941p, Cable &amp; Wireless 11 to 469p and Standard Chartered 36 to 1224p. UK airports operator BAA was the only stock in the FT-SE 100 to hold out against the poor market trend, boosted by an upbeat Department of Transport forecast on air travel and general bargain hunting. The shares, which have underperformed the market by 3 per cent over the last month, closed 4 ahead at 977p with 2.5m traded. The DoT suggests that traffic at the group's airport will show an average growth rate of 3.1 to 5.5 per cent between 1992 and 2010. Royal Insurance rose in pre-market trading after posting figures within the mid-range of forecasts and a higher than expected dividend but fell back later with the sector, which is heavily geared to the performance of the stock market. Royals closed 12 off at 278p, Commercial Union 13 off at 603p and Sun Alliance 14 off at 339p. The Telegraph improved 7 to 587p following news of a 15.5 per cent jump profits to Pounds 53.7m before exceptionals. Buying pressure and takeover speculation again surrounded Carrs Milling, the shares gaining 8 to 217p. Other statistics, Page 35 and 39</p>

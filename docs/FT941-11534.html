			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rising bonds spark late equity rally Wall Street US stocks staged a late rally yesterday as a round of profit-taking petered out amid rising bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 11.53 ahead at 3,975.54, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 2.38 to 482.00, an all-time high. The American SE composite added 1.90 at 487.89, its third straight record. The Nasdaq composite gained 2.30 at 799.57. NYSE volume was 329m shares. The day's economic reports elicited little reaction. The December index of leading indicators and sales of existing homes were both strong, but the market shrugged the reports off as old news. With the US Treasury market unmoved by the release of the December data, stocks were left with little direction. As a result, the Dow barometer slipped into negative territory. But with bond prices showing steady improvement in the afternoon, the blue chip index climbed back. Oil shares were among the best performers. Texaco rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 67 3/4 , Exxon Dollars 1 to Dollars 67 1/4 and Mobil Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 81 1/8 . Cyclical issues were mixed, with Caterpillar down Dollars 1 to Dollars 104 5/8 and Cummins Engine off Dollars 1 at Dollars 53 3/4 , but Union Carbide Dollars 1 3/8 ahead at Dollars 26 and General Electric up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 109. The blue chip Dow index was held back from a run into record territory by Sears Roebuck. The retailer fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 when Prudential Securities cut its rating on the stock. The struggle to take over Paramount Communications provided a focal point for the morning's activity, after Viacom and QVC both sweetened their bids for the company moments before Tuesday's deadline. With the winner still uncertain, Viacom's 'B' shares slipped Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 33 1/2 . QVC gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 46 3/4 as investors bet that the cable network would lose the battle. The target company fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 78 after warning that it expected to post a net loss of 29 to 33 cents a share in the three months to end-January. Sprint, the long-distance telephone concern, advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 on its announcement of record revenues and income in the fourth quarter. On the Nasdaq, Amgen retreated Dollars 3 to Dollars 44 on a downgrading by SG Warburg. Concern over the sales of its Neupogen treatment has depressed the stock of late. Canada Toronto ended a five-day winning streak, slipping back in extremely heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended 17.8 off at 4,573.4, while falls led rises by 439 to 393 after volume of 96m shares valued at CDollars 1.279bn. Golds and banking shed 1.83 and 1.30 per cent respectively. The communications and media sub-group rose 2.06 per cent. The increase followed Maclean Hunter's announcement of a proposed takeover bid for it by Rogers Communications. Maclean jumped CDollars 1 5/8 to CDollars 15 3/8 and Rogers 'B' dipped CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 21 3/8.</p>

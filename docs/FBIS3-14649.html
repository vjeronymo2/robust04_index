This was stated by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to newsmen in  New Delhi today. He said Indonesia is willing to extend its NAM  chairmanship only if the NAM members find it difficult to  appoint a new chairman.    President Suharto stated that Indonesia was of the opinion  that several members have the capability to lead the movement  and the appointment of the new chairman should be carried out in  an orderly manner. Indonesia became the chairman of the NAM in  1992 after the holding of the high-level summit conference in  Jakarta. Indonesia's current term of chairmanship will  terminate in 1995.    During his meeting with the Indian prime minister, the head  of state, as the leader of the NAM, expressed his hope that a  decision would be made in connection with the leadership issue  during the upcoming foreign ministers meeting in Cairo from 1-4  June. A senior officials meeting will precede the high-level  foreign ministers meeting from 30-31 May in Cairo.</p>

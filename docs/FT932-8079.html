			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: German Trust income down Net asset value of the German Investment Trust rose by 7.7 per cent, from 87.5p to 94.2p, over the year ended March 31 1993. The managers said that costs of unification had overridden the longer term potential for growth, and had tarnished the performance of the equity market in Germany. However, interest rates there were falling allowing others in Europe to follow suit. Revenue in the year totalled Pounds 757,000 (Pounds 792,000) and the net outcome was Pounds 165,000 (Pounds 235,000) because of a fall in other income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Earnings per share were down to 0.42p (0.6p) and the dividend follows that trend at 0.4p (0.6p).</p>

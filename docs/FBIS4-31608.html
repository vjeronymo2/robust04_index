			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, June 12 (TANJUG) -- President of the  parliament of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) Momcilo  Krajisnik, with reference to the latest one-month ceasefire  signed in Geneva, has stated that the Muslims will not agree to  any peace irrespective of its limited length. Krajisnik said  this in an interview to be published in Monday's DNEVNIK daily  of Novi Sad. He added that perhaps it was better that a  short-range truce was signed in Geneva.    "Had they accepted the Serb proposal on a year-long  cessation  of hostilities," said he, "they would have presented themselves  to the world as the fighters for peace, but, essentially, they  do not give up their offensive actions against Serb territories."    Geneva talks on the overall cessation of hostilities in  Bosnia ended on June 7 in signinig a statement on a one-month  cessation of combat activities, based on the Muslim-Croat  proposal. In commenting on a territorial division map drawn by  the "contact group" in Geneva, Krajisnik said that this had  concerned the fulfilment of the megalomaniac demands by Croats  and Muslims to be given nearly the entire western Bosnia and  good parts of northern and eastern Bosnia.    "Of course, it is out of the question that we shall agree to  give the places where genocide of Serb people was committed in  the past two wars," said Krajisnik.</p>

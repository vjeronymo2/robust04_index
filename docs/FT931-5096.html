			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: Proud to be Paris - Architecture Any Londoner must envy Paris. It is a capital city with a strong sense of its own identity. It is a city with a government. It is a city devoted to culture and the finer arts of civilisation. It is a city with a working and up-to-date infrastructure. During the last 20 years it has become a city of importance in the history of contemporary architecture. Londoners can gain some sense of this creative excitement at Paris: A City in the Making, an exhibition at the French Institute in Queensberry Place. The exhibition is an offshoot of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal in Paris, a centre founded in 1989 to inform Parisians about changes in the planning and development of their city. Pavillon de l'Arsenal, housed in a 19th century glass and steel building on the Boulevard Morland in the IVe district of Paris, was the brain child of M. Jaques Chirac, as mayor of Paris. At its heart is a great model of Paris connected to a tactile screen computer. Visitors ask the computer questions, and it answers through a video disc while a laser ray spotlights the relevant sector of the model. Apart from all this high level technology the Pavillon de l'Arsenal publishes books, runs a library on Paris, and organises regular temporary exhibitions. The one in London follows many of the themes of the permanent display in Paris. Alas, the great model does not travel and so the exhibition is relatively hard work: you must enjoy reading panels and unravelling plans. Unlike the recent Vision for London model and exhibition at the Royal Exchange in the City, the Paris displays are not afraid of history. History and the study of civilisation unlock an understanding and enjoyment of architecture. The creators of the Paris exhibition understand this; they begin their themed explanation of the city's growth and change by explaining how the city acquired the shape it has today. From Philippe-Auguste's walls and crypts to the rampant demolition and rebuildings of Baron Haussmann, Paris has undergone sweeping changes. However, there is always evidence of the grand vision, which is so rare in Britain. The display in London helps to relate a number of significant architectural developments in Paris to the overall plans and strategies for the city. Visitors cannot but sense that the developers of Paris - both private and public - are aware of the restraints and advantages of centralised planning. The interminable peripherique, for instance, encircles Paris like a corset. And it is interesting to observe that Paris's encounter with the Modern movement was really a failure - the city remains visually of the 19th century. The immense scale of much of what the Modern movement intended for Paris destroyed the quartier and all the happy mixtures of activity that make Paris work so well. The Centre Georges Pompidou, for all its avant-garde attraction, also showed Parisians the crude insensitivity of much modern design. The more sensitive Parisians have always valued the density of their city and its hidden courts and muddle of uses. The city needs both the grand statement and the gradual renewal of the quartiers. There is a chance in this exhibition to compare, for example, the Parc de Bercy (1990) with Buttes Chaumont (1860); or the formality of La Grande Arche with the relaxed abstractions of the Parc de la Villette. The most intriguing period in Paris is, without a doubt, the 1980s and the triumph of socialism, marked by the grand presidential projects and the new urban policies of the city of Paris. In the 1970s, things were not quite so clear; the redevelopment of Les Halles caused much controversy and the rise of the post-modernism of Ricardo Bofill sparked off intense architectural debate. But President Mitterrand evidently knew exactly what he wanted. His projects are the result of international competition and represent the new wave of modernism. The unknown Dane, Johan Otto van Spreckelsen, designed the great white marble arch at La Defense. The equally unknown Bernard Tschumi, from New York, won the commission for 'the park of the 21st century' at La Villette. The president's wish to turn the entire palace of the Louvre into a modernised museum was granted by the American architect I. M. Pei, who provided the most potent new symbol in the city with his pyramid in the Louvre courtyard. The ministry of finance now occupies the huge slab overhanging the Seine designed by Chemetov and Huidobro, and the striking new City of Music opened at La Villette last year, designed by Christian de Portzamparc. With the French elections almost upon us, what will become of the unfinished projects if the socialist government falls? Will Dominique Perrault's strange French National Library in the Tolbiac district ever house books in its towers? Francis Soler's International Conference Centre on the Quai de Branly, near the Eiffel Tower, proposes three great glass boxes of an intensely minimalist design. Both these projects could well be casualties of a change of government. Whatever the political outcome of the next few weeks, Paris remains a city where architecture really matters as a part of the national culture. That just cannot be said of London, where the boom of the 1980s produced so little of architectural merit and our national leaders seem intent upon the removal of all sense of civic pride from the nation's capital.

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Albanians boycott census Ethnic Albanians yesterday refused to participate in the census in Macedonia, a move which threatens to heighten tensions in the fragile Balkan republic. For the second day running, ethnic Albanians ignored the population survey, which they hope will confirm that their numbers warrant greater participation in the Macedonian state. They have objected to the number of documents needed to prove citizenship, which they say most Albanians do not have. Albanians claim that they account for nearly twice as much as the official figure of 22 per cent, established in the 1991 census - which they boycotted. If ethnic Albanians decide to launch a mass boycott, the Party of Democratic Prosperity, their main political group, is likely pull out of the coalition government. With elections planned for this year, an Albanian withdrawal would upset the fragile coexistence with the majority Slavic Macedonians and undermine stability in the republic itself.</p>

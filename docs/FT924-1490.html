			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Switzerland (2):  A flat year ahead - The persistence of the recession has prompted debate over economic management which transcends immediate reaction to this month's vote on membership of the EEA / The economy SWITZERLAND's economic performance this year is one of hopes unfulfilled. While there might have been some expectation that 1992 would see a recovery from recession that had produced a fall in GNP of 0.1 per cent last year, the economy has contracted by slightly more. Worse still, growth looks like being flat next year, too. A combination of weak property prices and, for a time in the spring, short-term interest rates of around 9 per cent, has left both consumer and business confidence weak. According to to Credit Suisse, private consumption is likely to fall by some 0.1 per cent this year, but capital investment by industry and construction spending have been hit much harder. They are due to fall by 6.3 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Exports, and to a lesser extent public spending, provide the only bright spots. Unemployment has risen to what, for modern-day Switzerland, is an unprecedented rate of some 3.9 per cent; and, thanks to the slowdown elsewhere in Europe, the chance of exports sustaining the economy into next year seem to be diminishing. The persistence of the recession has prompted debate over economic management which transcends immediate reaction to this month's vote on membership of the European Economic Area (EEA). Has Switzerland lost its privileged position as an oasis of wealth and stability in Europe? Has the National Bank been conducting an appropriate monetary policy? And is lack of competition in the domestic economy to blame for consumer price levels some 40 per cent above the EC average? Certainly, part of the increase in unemployment appears to be structural. Improved benefits have made lay-offs more acceptable. Workers of foreign origin are less mobile. Many of them are second-generation immigrants, who cannot simply be sent home as they were in the deep recession of the 1970s. As Switzerland becomes less sheltered from the economic forces affecting other modern economies, some of its antiquated structures are being thrown into greater relief. In particular, the OECD has criticised the country for the wide range of restrictive practices which permeates its economy. Its report has fuelled a growing sense that Switzerland has done too little to restrict cartels, which have sustained prices in the non-traded sector of the economy at levels far above the international norm. Switzerland also has a heavily subsidised farm economy, and suffers from restrictive procurement practices by individual cantons. Such are the current pressures on the economy that reform of these structures was almost certainly inevitable, whatever the outcome of the vote on joining the EEA. A yes vote would, however, have accelerated the process, adding to growth and putting downward pressure on prices. According to a study by Bank Vontobel, membership of the European Economic Area would have reduced inflation by 1 to 1.5 percentage points and increased economic growth by 0.5 points over the medium term. Even so, the kind of restrictive practices about which the OECD complains will take time to unwind. Since the main preoccupation of the public sector is to reduce its deficit, the monetary policy of the Swiss National Bank remains probably the most important factor determining the economic outlook in the short run. Here, too, controversy rages. Monetarists regard the present policy as excessively tight and likely to stall any recovery and push up unemployment even further. According to the OECD, the focus of monetary policy on the monetary base - cash in circulation plus sight deposits of the banking system at the central bank - no longer makes sense. The development of an electronic clearing system has brought about structural changes, which have marginalised the importance of the banking system's deposits. Among the most frequently cited alternatives are the adoption of a target for M1 or the establishment of a direct relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate. Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, has, however, dismissed the idea of an exchange rate peg, on the grounds that it would force Swiss interest rates to rise to German levels. M1, he argues, is a statistically unreliable indicator. Other National Bank officials say the debate has less relevance at a time like the present, when all the various monetary aggregates point to weakness. Some economists, such as Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, of the BZ Bank, argue that weak monetary growth means there is no risk of inflation from exchange rate depreciation. Central banks, they say, have been far too obsessed with maintaining exchange rate targets. The danger is that this can ultimately play havoc with the domestic economy, as the sad example of Sweden shows. The National Bank is clearly not so sure that it can ignore the exchange rate. Bankers say that it is now increasingly pessimistic about the domestic economic outlook, and would probably like to see interest rates somewhat lower. But it is more likely to oblige if the franc is strong against the Deutsche Mark.</p>

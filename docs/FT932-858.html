			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Manx timeshare rules to be tightened THE Isle of Man authorities yesterday announced plans to regulate timeshare activities, Sue Stuart writes. Although hardly any timeshare businesses operate on the island they frequently use Manx companies or trustees. A working party recommended that the island's rules go further than the UK Timeshare Act in terms of consumer protection. The Manx government hopes the proposed legislation will eliminate the bad publicity the island receives from media coverage of alleged malpractice in timeshare operations involving Manx companies. The proposed EC directive for the conduct of timeshare business will not necessarily by implemented by the island, which is a self-governing Crown dependency and is outside the EC. The Manx government expects to place draft legislation before parliament by the end of the year.</p>

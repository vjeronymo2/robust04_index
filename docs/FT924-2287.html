			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / US Marines seize vital Somali airstrip: But confusion grows about the tactics and objectives of the United Nations relief mission US MARINES in 12 helicopter gun ships yesterday seized a vital airstrip in the starvation-ridden interior of Somalia, as the foreign intervention in the country continued to build up. However, with at least 36,000 troops due in Somalia by Christmas, confusion has begun to set in about the tactics and objectives of the operation, which has a United Nations mandate to provide security for relief efforts. Yesterday morning, a rifle company of 220 Marines, flying from Mogadishu in their first foray into the interior, landed and secured the former air force base at Bali Dogle, 160km west of the capital. The Marines will pave the way for the imminent arrival of the 10,000-strong US Army 10th Mountain division. In the capital, military officials said at least 3,500 US troops and 300 French paratroopers and 120 Belgian soldiers had already landed by last night to form the advance forces of the biggest military-humanitarian intervention ever undertaken in black Africa. At the port, the Marines have offloaded 320 vehicles, including 7 M1-A1 Abrams tanks and several armoured personnel carriers, from a huge supply ship, as part of the fleet which will penetrate further into the interior. However, there is some confusion among the foreign troops who have secured Mogadishu's port and airport and provided increased security in the anarchic city, over whether they should be disarming the city's residents. At first, US commanders gave orders for all weapons to be confiscated. Later, only heavy weaponry and machine-guns used in an aggressive or threatening way near checkpoints were ordered to be taken. Guns, which had disappeared from vehicles and pedestrians after the US marines arrived last week, are gradually re-appearing as bandit attacks continue unabated. Tension was also mounting between French and US officers yesterday. The paratroopers from the French Foreign Legion have long experience of patrolling Africa's most violent streets and are anxious to be moved rapidly into the interior. But they have put themselves under a US military command which appears to be taking no chances and is refusing to heed the pleas of aid workers that they move rapidly into the towns of Kismayo and Baidoa, which have been plagued by looting. US troops are expected to move to Baidoa in an armoured convoy by the weekend. Baidoa is the critical staging point for the relief effort to the cut-off interior. However, aid workers continued to criticise the slow US penetration of the interior, where there are at least 300 deaths a day and up to 2m Somalis are in desperate need of food, medicine, seeds and tools. 'The operation is too military and too little humanitarian so far,' said an official with Medicins Sans Frontieres. Foreign troops in Mogadishu have met little opposition from the freelance gunmen and bandits who have terrorised civilians for two years. On Saturday, however, Cobra combat helicopters fired anti-tank weapons at three Somali battle wagons they said fired upon their aircraft, killing up to eight people and injuring several. The wreckage of one burnt-out vehicle lay abandoned yesterday and residents living near the scene of the incident said the three destroyed vehicles, including a US-made M1-13 APC, had been fighting a rival clan for control of a former military camp when the US helicopters flew overhead on a routine patrol. US officials said they hoped the incident would set an example. A UN World Food Programme ship carrying 3,000 tonnes of bagged wheat docked at Mogadishu port yesterday, the first aid ship into the city since October 24. US Marines also escorted a food convoy of 20 tonnes of rice, beans and vegetable oil through south Mogadishu in the second day of US military-NGO co-operation.</p>

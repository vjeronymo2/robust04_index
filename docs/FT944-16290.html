			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Plan to crack down on tax 'treaty shopping' The US Treasury has proposed new regulations that could crack down on business arrangements designed to avoid withholding tax by channelling income through countries with favourable tax treaties with the US. US officials have been concerned that some multinational companies have been reducing the amount of withholding tax they pay in the US by funnelling income from the US through an intermediate company located in a country whose bilateral tax treaty with the US offers a more favourable withholding tax treatment. Under the proposals, the Internal Revenue would be able to disregard intermediate entities in its assessment of withholding tax, if it believed the taxpayer had changed the identity of the nominal recipient of income without changing the substance. The regulations, which if finalised would implement legislation passed last year, have been awaited with trepidation by tax lawyers, who feared the Treasury might embark on a sweeping new approach to 'conduit' issues, where transactions pass through an intermediate entity. They could have far-reaching effects on existing business arrangements. Mr Dennis Ross, a tax partner with the law firm of Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell in New York, points out that the regulations would apply not only to future deals, but to all payments, starting 30 days after the regulations are finalised. They would therefore apply to existing financial arrangements, even ones which predated last year's legislation. A typical conduit case might involve a company in the Far East - where the US has few bilateral tax treaties - avoiding withholding tax by financing its subsidiary in the US through an offshoot in the Netherlands, with which the US has a comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Netherlands tax treaty has recently been renegotiated to include a clause aimed at preventing such 'treaty shopping', where taxpayers look around for the country with the most favourable tax treaty. Anti-treaty shopping provisions are a central element in the US Treasury's recent efforts to renegotiate many of its bilateral treaties. But the Treasury failed to win Senate ratification of a package of treaties  -including an important protocol with Canada - submitted to Congress last month. This was partly because the Senate ran out of time before it broke for next month's elections, but also because of opposition from Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota.</p>

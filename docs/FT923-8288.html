			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: Back to work Spare a thought for Japan's prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Less than a fortnight ago he was trying to set his workaholic countrymen an example by announcing that he was taking 20 days off this summer. According to the latest Labour Ministry figures, the average worker in Japan took just 8.2 days holiday in 1990. When Miyazawa took office last November he vowed to change this and help dent foreign complaints that Japanese work too hard. He set in train a five-year plan to cut Japan's current 2,016-hour average working year to 1,800, the present European average. A typical German put in slightly fewer than 1,500 hours last year. It all sounded jolly sensible. However, some of the barons in Miyazawa's ruling Liberal Democratic Party are not so sure. LDP policy chairman Yoshiro Mori, concerned by the slowdown in the economy, is reported as saying that the prime minister should cancel his holiday and get back to work.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Link-up and deals to solve a pressing problem - Andrew Bolger looks at the latest moves at Verson which has seen its share price collapse to 4 1/2 p VERSON International Group, the loss-making Midlands-based machinery maker, has announced a large acquisition and disposal - both in the US  - and the strengthening of its links with C Itoh, the Japanese trading house. Mr Tim Kelleher, Verson's chairman and chief executive, said this complicated series of deals was aimed at significantly strengthening the finances of the group, which has seen its share price collapse from 47p since the outbreak of the Gulf war in August 1990. The shares yesterday closed 1p lower at 4 1/2 p . Verson also reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12.3m for the year to January 31, compared with a deficit of Pounds 390,000 last time. Turnover rose from Pounds 82.6m to Pounds 90.1m. Losses per share increased to 8.66p against 0.04p. It has passed its dividend, having paid a total of 1p last time. The group has agreed to buy Niagara, a US manufacturer of metal-forming equipment, for Dollars 23.5m (Pounds 12.1m), of which Dollars 14m is payable in cash on completion. Niagara, which employs more than 340 people in Buffalo, New York, last year incurred a pre-tax loss of Dollars 1.3m on turnover of Dollars 29.7m. Verson is also selling Taylor-Winfield - an Ohio-based metal-working equipment manufacturer it bought in 1990 - back to its original vendors, Mr John Anderson and some of his family, for Dollars 7.8m. Finally, the UK group is creating a joint venture with Enprotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of C Itoh, to distribute and sell spare parts for Verson and Niagara metal presses in North and Central America. By changing an existing licence agreement with Enprotech, Verson will receive a further lump-sum royalty payment of Dollars 7.5m. In addition, Enprotech has been issued with a warrant to subscribe for up to Pounds 7.17m new shares in Verson at 10p each, which would represent 5 per cent of the UK group's current share capital. Mr Kelleher, a Texan entrepreneur with an interest in West Midlands engineers, brought Verson to the market at the start of 1988. His strategy was to buy up depressed businesses, reorganise them into profitable units, and then use the group's international marketing arm to sell their products overseas. The group enjoyed a number of years of uninterrupted growth in turnover, with increasing export sales. This came to an abrupt halt with the onset of the world recession, exacerbated by the Gulf crisis. Mr Kelleher said: 'For six months, there really was panic. Order intake just went off the cliff - even in China, one of our best markets, which is normally insulated from everything.' Order intake dropped by 55 per cent after the Gulf crisis broke, with UK business being particularly affected. This led to significant under-use of UK manufacturing capacity. The group's operating losses of Pounds 3.64m last year were increased by interest charges of Pounds 4.6m and an exceptional Pounds 4m to cover write-offs, redundancies and restructuring costs. Mr Kelleher said he had reduced internal costs by Pounds 8m since November 1990. This had included 450 redundancies in the UK, plant closures and increased use of sub-contractors. In December, Verson announced it had agreed in principle to sell British Federal, one of its metal joining subsidiaries, to its management, backed by a venture fund. Mr Kelleher said the financial backers subsequently tried to negotiate a lower price, so discussions were terminated. However, the UK group has agreed to sell back Taylor-Winfield to Mr Anderson and certain members of his family. Mr Kelleher said the hoped-for benefits of the acquisition had never been realised and Mr Anderson had expressed a strong desire to leave Verson and re-acquire the business. But why is Verson making another big acquisition in the US, given that it has had to unravel its last deal there so speedily? Mr Kelleher said Niagara is a very different company from Taylor-Winfield: 'The family owners are elderly and will leave the business, so we can bring in our own management. The business is crying out for change and middle management wants to see it effected. It is also a business we know and understand completely.' There is also an important link between the acquisition of Niagara and the joint venture with Enprotech, which is a leading refurbisher of metal press equipment in North America. Spare parts supplied by the joint venture will be made at Niagara's plant, which Mr Kelleher estimates is currently only utilising about 30 per cent of its capacity. After these deals are completed Verson will still be geared at over 300 per cent. However, Mr Kelleher said he was confident he would continue to get full support from Lloyds Bank. On the basis of Niagara's asset base, Verson will also gain access to facilities from Marine Midland, the US subsidiary of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Mr Kelleher said all the reshaped group's businesses would be cash-generative, assuming that orders continued to improve. He was confident that as a result of these proposals, Verson would be better placed to exploit an upturn in its markets. However, he acknowledges that, despite the strengthening of the balance sheet resulting from these deals, Verson's borrowing is still too high in relation to its banking facilities - particularly in view of the intermittent nature of cashflow from some of the group's big contracts. The planned sale of surplus properties and changes in its US pensions operations should reduce the group's gearing and support its working capital requirements. But should the group's performance deviate materially from that anticipated, the board warns that it would be necessary to seek additional working capital.</p>

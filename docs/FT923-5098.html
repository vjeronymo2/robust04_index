			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: EC and US push for Gatt breakthrough - Negotiators may be softening their stand on farm subsidies EC and US trade negotiators are engaged in a 'final push' to achieve a breakthrough by mid-October in the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation talks, according to a senior European Commission official. He said 'the political will is now there' on both sides to chart a way through the farm subsidies maze, which has held up conclusion of the Round since the collapse of the Brussels summit under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in December 1990. Both sides appear to be softening their position on farm subsidies, in the interest of getting the leading industrial economies moving again. Although the new negotiations are being conducted in secret - it is not even clear where they are taking place - the official said agriculture and trade officials from Washington and Brussels began work yesterday on detailed formulae to resolve the two biggest differences. These are: The extent to which payments to EC farmers in compensation for the big price cuts agreed in May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be exempt from the subsidy reduction called for in the Uruguay Round 'final act'; The extent to which the EC must cut the volume of its subsidised exports, as well as the amount of subsidy. Negotiations are in a higher than expected gear following talks on Monday and Tuesday in Brussels between Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner. The main public outcome of those talks was to put on ice until the end of this month a separate bilateral dispute over oilseeds subsidies. The US has held off from slapping punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) worth of EC food exports in the knowledge that, as the Brussels official confirmed yesterday, 'we would have to consider retaliation'. If this happened it would put paid to hopes of a Uruguay Round conclusion. The official said a 'headline agreement' on the Round had to be reached by about the middle of next month, both to incorporate an agreement on oilseeds and to have any hope of meeting the March 1993 deadline for expiry of the US administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority. On the EC's compensation payments, Mr MacSharry had insisted that since they are linked to output restraint - farmers must take land out of production ('set-aside') to get them - they should be indefinitely exempt from the Gatt's prescribed subsidy cut of 20 per cent over six years. The US was only prepared to grant an exemption for six years if the target of 15 per cent 'set-aside' was fixed in concrete, and if compensation was cut back thereafter. But Mr MacSharry is now understood to be willing to settle for a form of words which ensures that the 'philosophy' that payments linked to production restraint should be exempt 'is carried through into the next round' of subsidy negotiations six years hence. 'We want recognition of their contribution to international trade peace,' the official said, 'just as there is recognition for subsidy payments for environmental reasons.' On export volume, where Gatt requires a 24 per cent cut in addition to a 36 per cent reduction in export subsidies, the EC still insists on flexibility within sectors. Under this formula the EC could export more wheat if it exported less barley, for example, provided overall cuts in grain sales reached the target. The US wants pro-rata reductions, especially since, under the EC's new farm regime, European wheat will become more competitive. The official said, however, that this flexibility could be limited and detailed, and pointed out the EC would still be cutting output. 'It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we can get agreement on these lines,' he concluded, 'but this has to be the final push.'</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM READY TO ROLL OUT;  </P> <P> GARBAGE: ON MONDAY, MANY RESIDENTS WILL BEGIN SEPARATING REUSABLE MATERIALS  FROM THEIR TRASH. EFFORT WILL BE CITYWIDE BY FALL, 1992.  </P> <P> Two years and more than $100 million in the making, Los Angeles' curbside  garbage recycling program begins Monday, slightly smaller than planned, but on  schedule and keeping its lofty goal of finding uses for 30% of the city's  household trash.  </P> <P> The kickoff for what officials say will become the nation's largest municipal  recycling program was to be marked modestly enough -- with just one sanitation  truck picking up glass and plastic bottles, aluminum and tin cans, and  newspapers from about 800 homes in El Sereno.  </P> <P> The program will be expanded slowly -- by just one truck route per day, five  days a week, on alternating weeks through the end of the year, said Drew Sones,  director of recycling for the city.  </P> <P> "It's a shakedown cruise," he said.  </P> <P> The number of homes to be brought into the program daily had to be cut by  almost half, Sones said, because of delays in contracting for high-tech garbage  trucks and automated collection bins. A $19-million contract was approved by  the City Council only last week, and the trucks and bins will not be delivered  until early next year.  </P> <P> But determined to stick to the schedule, sanitation workers will use existing  equipment to begin limited recycling in selected Highland Park neighborhoods on  Tuesday, Elysian Park on Wednesday, Los Feliz/Griffith Park on Thursday and  Hollywood on Friday.  </P> <P> Recycling will then roll out to other North-Central Los Angeles communities  such as Echo Park, Mt. Washington, Eagle Rock and Glassell Park through  year-end.  </P> <P> Bureau of Sanitation officials plan to have 24,000 homes formally in the  recycling program by Jan. 1, joining the 95,000 Los Angeles households already  in an experimental program.  </P> <P> The program will be introduced in turn to West Los Angeles in June, the Harbor  District in July, the East Valley in September, 1991, and the South-Central and  West Valley areas in April, 1992.  </P> <P> By September, 1992, city officials plan to have more than 720,000 residences  separating glass, plastic and metal containers, newspapers and lawn waste from  their household trash for collection and recycling.  </P> <P> Homeowners will be issued at least one yellow plastic bin for collecting  bottles and cans and two 60-gallon containers -- one each for household trash  and lawn waste. Initially, lawn waste will be collected only in selected  neighborhoods on a pilot basis.  </P> <P> Newspapers are to be tied or stacked in paper bags and placed at the curb.  </P> <P> By 1995, when the program is fully implemented, the city will have invested  about $360 million in its effort to fully automate trash collection and pare by  30% the more than 5,000 tons of household trash that are sent daily to  landfills.  </P> <P> Hundreds more California communities will inaugurate similar programs under  state legislation requiring every city to reduce its trash stream by at least  25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. Curbside recycling programs are already  under way in hundreds of communities, including Santa Monica, Burbank and  Glendale.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles pilot program, Sones said, about 50% of residents  voluntarily recycled.  </P> <P> "The public is anxious for it," he said. "People seem to understand the program  well and want to participate."  </P> <P> To meet the goal of recycling 30% of all trash by 1995, Sones said 80% of all  residents would have to be participating. The program is intended to be  mandatory, but Sones said that as long as goals are being met it will be  operated on a voluntary basis.  </P> <P> "If we can't make the 30% goal by 1995, then we'll trigger an enforcement  effort," he said.  </P> <P> For those about to begin recycling, Sones had a few tips.  </P> <P> Rinse out bottles and cans whenever possible, he said, explaining that "it  helps us with the quality of the materials" and keeps ants out of the kitchen.  And of the various plastic bottles used in the home, Sones said, only the PET  type -- used for soda, milk and water -- are to be recycled.  </P> <P> Otherwise, Sones said, "Just start (recycling) and it becomes a natural habit.  And you know what? You feel better after you do it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECYCLING SCHEDULE  </P> <P>  Recycling will begin Monday in the North-Central part of Los Angeles and fan  out community by community through November, 1992.  </P> <P>  Here is the Bureau of Sanitation's schedule for implementing the program:  </P> <P>  North-Central, from September, 1990, to July, 1991.

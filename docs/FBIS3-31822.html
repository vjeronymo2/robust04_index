According to Peterle, the Slovene Ministry of Foreign  Affairs "is actively observing the state of everything that has  recently changed in relations between Ljubljana and Belgrade."  The diplomatic service in Slovenia is preparing information on  what needs to be done to promote contacts between Ljubljana and  Belgrade. Peterle pointed out that Slovenia's official position,  favoring the normalizing of relations, is in Slovenia's  interest, particularly because of the increasingly successful  contacts between Zagreb and Belgrade.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Defence ministry probes ICL deal ICL, the Japanese-owned UK computer company, is under investigation by the Ministry of Defence for suspected irregularities involving two contracts totalling Pounds 1m. MoD police on Thursday morning visited ICL's sales office at Slough and engineering offices at Stevenage and Basingstoke, all in south-east England, and took away documents relating to the contracts. ICL said last night the contracts had been for 'run-of-the-mill' work installing computers and cabling for the MoD. An MoD spokesman said last night: 'An investigation is taking place, but I cannot discuss it further until the outcome is known.' Mr Richard Livesey-Hawarth, an ICL executive director, said: 'We take the matter very seriously, and will do what we can to co-operate.' He was constrained from commenting further by official undertakings, but added: 'I would not be surprised if the MoD had been contacted by a disgruntled former employee, who might want to bring us into disrepute.' ICL has been the preferred supplier of mainframe computers to the MoD since the 1960s. It is the prime contractor on a Pounds 250m office automation project for the MoD. The contract was awarded two years ago.</p>

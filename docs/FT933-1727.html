			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson chief in surprise resignation MR Nigel Rich has resigned as managing director of Jardine Matheson. He will be replaced by Mr Alasdair Morrison, currently managing director of HongKong Land Group, Jardine's property investment arm. Mr Rich had been 'taipan' of Jardine since 1989, taking the helm during a period predominated by politics, as the Jardine group made its attempt to side-step Hong Kong stock market regulations and gain a primary listing in London. He also led the group's expansion overseas, with HongKong Land taking a 25 per cent stake in Trafalgar House, the UK construction and property group. Other notable group deals included Jardine Strategic Holdings' purchase of a substantial investment in Singapore-listed Cycle and Carriage and a sizeable investment in retail operations in New Zealand, Spain and Singapore by the group's Dairy Farm arm. The announcement of his departure, which will take place in March 1994, came as a surprise. However, Mr Rich said he had only wanted to take on the job for five years. 'I had always had it in mind that my successor should have a good run in before 1997,' he said. He will return to London in 1994, where there is speculation that he may be offered a role in Trafalgar House. Mr Morrison has been with the group for 22 years, and had long been seen as the eventual successor to Mr Rich, who had also risen through the ranks of Hongkong Land. The reshuffle is not expected to lead to any changes in Jardine's management strategy, which is strongly influenced by its largest single shareholder, the Keswick family.</p>

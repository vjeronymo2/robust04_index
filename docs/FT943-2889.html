			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole expected to confirm US contract Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based manufacturer of high-powered notebook computers, has confirmed that it expected shortly to announce a US defence-related contract worth millions of dollars over the next few years. It also said that although its second half results would show significant increases in revenues compared with both the first half and the same period last year, the operating loss of Pounds 1.35m in the first half would not be reversed. Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the announcement was being made because of press and other speculation. Tadpole develops and manufactures portable workstations, personal computers with the power of mainframe computers in a notebook-sized package. Tadpole is already manufacturing a notebook based on a microprocessor developed by Sun Microsystems and it has recently started making a machine for International Business Machines. Earlier this year, the company announced a deal with Digital Equipment of the US for notebooks based on the Alpha microprocessor. Mr Grey said there would be continued heavy investment in development as the company prepared for broader markets. In the six months to March 31 revenue was Pounds 10.6m.</p>

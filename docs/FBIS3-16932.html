For four years, he has been working against the odds for the  transfer to private ownership of the Russian production  apparatus. His tactic, which is not very "capitalist" (150  million coupons have been distributed to citizens who invest  them as they wish in auction sales) has managed to create  millions of small shareholders. It absolutely must end on 30  June 1994. On that date, the transfer of property will  theoretically have been achieved, but the enterprises' problems  will still exist.    [Gherardi] Does the new political configuration in Russia  endanger the privatization process?    [Vasilyev] I do not think so. The people all have  privatization coupons, and now they feel they own something. No  political party dares to call that into question. Of course,  there is no lack of critics: the Communists and Centrists, for  instance, say that the military-industrial complex and land  should not be privatized. But President Yeltsin has never  stopped expressing support for privatization. The proof of this  is that the Committee for the Management of State Property  chaired by Anatoliy Chubays has remained in place.    [Gherardi] And what is the public's attitude?    [Vasilyev] I would say that there is "quiet support" for the  privatizations. The people find that things are not moving  quickly enough, those in remote provinces are insisting that  they should not be left out. We have tried to move closer to  them with our 90 regional committees. It is true that there is  frustration, especially among those who squandered their coupon  at the start.    [Gherardi] How did they lose them?    [Vasilyev] We distributed one coupon per person (in other  words around 150 million coupons), with a face value of 10,000  rubles [R] (Footnote 1) ($1 equals R1,600. The sum of R10,000  is more a convention than a price), but sold for the symbolic  sum of R25. Some preferred to immediately exchange their coupon  for cash -- or vodka. Others made a bad investment and are  regretting it. But a coupon market was very quickly established:  The rate stagnated at around R5,000 until mid-1993 and then  rose to almost R30,000 after the October events (Footnote 2)  (The attack on the rebel Parliament) and returned to between  R20,000 and R25,000 in recent weeks.    [Gherardi] What means do the Russians have for judging the  enterprises in which they invest?    [Vasilyev] There are information campaigns in the newspapers  and on television. But it is primarily by word of mouth. The  enterprises in the energy, oil, and food processing sectors are  very successful, as are hotel chains or stores. On the other  hand, the public does not really like the firms in the  military-industrial complex.    [Gherardi] What is the status of privatization operations?    [Vasilyev] They are progressing very rapidly. Around half  of the industrial apparatus has already been privatized. Eighty  million coupons (in other words 55 percent of the total) have  been turned into shares. The people who waited, hoping that  better enterprises would be put onto the market later, have not  necessarily miscalculated, but they are then likely to run out  of time: The coupons lose their value as of 1 July 1994 (the  date has already been postponed by six months and there will be  no new postponement). On that date, 70 percent of industrial  property will have been transferred to the private sector. We  will have become a bourgeois country!    [Gherardi] Do the Russians prefer to buy the enterprise  which employs them?    [Vasilyev] Not necessarily. Just 15 to 20 percent of the  coupons have been used in that way. By the way, that gives an  idea of how much confidence the employees have in their  enterprise! The biggest share (27 percent) has been invested in  joint investment funds: 640 of these funds were created in a  few months, and the largest one received 3 million coupons. And  10 percent of people decided to invest in enterprises other than  their own.    [Gherardi] Has privatization changed some aspect of  corporate management?    [Vasilyev] Privatization has not radically changed the  situation on the ground. The positive point is that there are  now identified owners. Of course, the structure of the capital  is not very efficient: In three-fourths of cases (out of 8,300  enterprises sold by the end of December 1993), it is the  enterprise's employees who have bought 51 percent of the  capital. But in this privatization formula, 29 percent of the  remaining capital must be auctioned (in exchange for coupons).  It is true that the power has largely remained with the  existing shareholders, but the freedom to sell shares will lead  to reorganizations. There are already quarrels between the  directors and outside investors to buy their shares back from  the workers. They are approached even on the shop floor!    [Gherardi] They will not have been "bourgeois" for very  long...    [Vasilyev] Not all are prepared to sell! There will be many  small investors in Russia for a long time. That is not  necessarily a bad thing. That creates a class of small owners  who form the strongest basis for democracy. I will go even  further: Hitherto there had been no social support for a policy  of combating inflation; this new class will very quickly see the  importance of financial stabilization and will give its support.  In this sense, stabilization and privatization go together.    [Gherardi] But what future can enterprises "privatized" in  this way have without fresh capital or new men?    [Vasilyev] The problem of recapitalization will very soon be  raised. Nothing prevents enterprises from issuing new shares.  Half of those which have been privatized have done so or are  preparing to do so. Of course, that creates great competition  to secure capital: The enterprises will be forced to open up  their capital structure and often to give up control. But this  will be a natural process, without any intervention by  bureaucracy. They have assets they can sell. They will also  try to establish alliances with foreign or Russian partners.    [Gherardi] Is there a difference in productivity between the  privatized firms and the others?    [Vasilyev] We cannot see it very clearly yet. All the  enterprises must be reorganized in a radical way: Know the  market better, organize their distribution, and improve  production. That will take at least one or two half-year  periods. But there are dozens of examples of very efficient  enterprises, even on an international level. We can mention  firms like Lubertsy, which manufactures carpets in the Moscow  area; or Kurgan in the Urals, which produces parts for oil  extraction equipment; or even clothing factories in St.  Petersburg. The quality they produce is comparable with that in  other parts of the world, but at much lower prices.    [Gherardi] Which enterprises still have to be privatized?    [Vasilyev] We have already sold very big companies, such as  ZIL (automobiles) for instance, which now have thousands of  foreign shareholders. Others were of a more modest size. The  average number of employees in the privatized enterprises was  around 1,000. At present, we are preparing for the privatization  of Gazprom (Footnote 3) (Gas monopoly which was chaired by  current Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin) for April. This is  an enormous operation: 89 million shares representing 29  percent of the capital will be offered to the public. I think  the demand will be very high.    [Gherardi] What share will continue to be owned by the  state? Will Russia be a mixed economy?    [Vasilyev] The mixed economy exists everywhere, it is a  question of degree. There are natural monopolies which will  remain in state hands, like RAOES, the Russian equivalent of EDF  [French Electricity Company] or some enterprises in the  military-industrial complex. But the state should be involved  as little as possible in corporate management, it is incapable  of running enterprises.</p>

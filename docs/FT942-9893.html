			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Troubled shipyard breaks even Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which went into receivership a year ago today, has broken even on turnover of Pounds 46m in the past 12 months, receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said draft contracts for the sale of Swans to French-based shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie had been discussed at meetings this week. He hoped a deal, conditional on the award to Swans by the Ministry of Defence of the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere, would be signed by the end of this month.</p>

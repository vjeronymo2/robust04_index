I am glad to be here today among you. During my previous  visits to the Europarliament, when in the West hardly anyone  talked about the collapse of the last totalitarian empire of the  20th century, it was this high assembly that realized what  changes occurred in my country and with its resolutions gave the  support that Armenia's democracy expected from Europe--the  defender of human rights and liberties.    The movement of the Republic of Armenia toward independence  and democracy can be characterized by the enumeration of a  number of key moments.    In May 1990, still under the communist order, the strong  democratic movement succeeded in forming a parliament, which as  early as August published a manifesto of tasks predetermining  the establishment of an independent democratic state and freedom  of political and economic systems.  <H5>  Political Sphere </H5>   The Republic of Armenia became a party to international  pacts  concerning human rights and adopted the law on the freedom of  parties.    The parliament carried out political reform aimed at  transforming the system of former soviets based on the principle  of division of power, which made it possible to retain stability  in the course of political and economic reforms under foreign  conditions most difficult for the republic and under the  blockade.    The Republic of Armenia did not accept Gorbachev's  referendum  on the preservation of the Union of 17 March 1991 and on 21  September 1991 through a democratic referendum (with the  fulfillment of all the requirements of USSR laws) the Republic  of Armenia became an independent state.    Complete freedom of speech and the press, in fact, exists in  the republic. Numerous independent publications, newspapers, and  journals and those belonging to various parties appear. In the  Republic of Armenia today there are more than 30 parties, which  are represented in the parliament.  <H5>  Economic Sphere </H5>   As is well known, for several years Armenia has been under  an  economic and energy blockade, which dramatically affects our  people's life and suffocates the economy. Despite all these  difficulties reforms are being carried out in our country.    Land privatization was carried out everywhere at the  beginning of 1991, as a result of which as of now the  agriculture of the Republic of Armenia is almost completely  private. Housing was privatized, legislative acts were prepared  for a large-scale program for privatization in production and  service spheres, and 1994 was planned as the year of  privatization and reform of the financial and banking system.  The implemented transformations created the basis, on which the  draft of the new Constitution of the Republic of Armenia was  prepared. It has already undergone large-scale discussions. The  adoption of the Constitution is also envisaged in 1994.  <H5>  On Nagorno-Karabakh </H5>   The leadership of the Republic of Azerbaijan continues to  reject the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem by  political methods, as a result of which hostilities between the  Republic of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh become even more  violent.    Not having accepted the CSCE [Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe] timetable, the Republic of Azerbaijan not  only reduced to naught the efforts of the Minsk CSCE group on  Nagorno-Karabakh, but also officially announced its  nonacceptance of UN Security Council resolutions, in which the  UN Security Council called upon the parties participating in the  Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to accept the CSCE timetable and to  put an end to the bloodshed. As is well known, the Republic of  Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh officially accepted the timetable  of the Minsk CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh and expressed their  readiness to carry out UN Security Council resolutions.    On the question of the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict the Republic of Azerbaijan to this day rejects both the  peace-making mediation of the Russian Federation and all the  initiatives directed toward a peaceful settlement of the  conflict. The facts of the participation against this background  of Afghan mujahidin, Turkish military specialists, and Russian  soldiers in military operations as part of the Azerbaijani Army  demonstrate that Azerbaijan relies only on the solution of the  problem by force and the policy of its leadership is aimed at  expanding the conflict.    Having rejected all peace-making efforts, on 18 December  1993  Azerbaijan began and to this day continues an  offensive--unprecedented throughout the history of the Karabakh  conflict--along the entire front.    A full blockade against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh on the  part of Azerbaijan has continued for more than 4 years. At the  same time, provocative attempts to draw the Republic of Armenia  into a major military conflict do not cease.    Under such conditions organized self-defense was and remains  the only guarantee for the life and security of the people of  Nagorno-Karabakh, because the people of Nagorno-Karabakh do not  have guarantees on the part of the world community.    The world community should give its assessment of the  aggressive policy of Azerbaijan's leadership, which stubbornly  strives for an exclusive military resolution of the  Nagorno-Karabakh confrontation, while in the meantime some  states continue to give military assistance to Azerbaijan.    My visit to Strasbourg takes places within the framework of  the political dialogue established between the European Union  and Armenia.    I am glad to note that we have succeeded in establishing  this  constant communication, which enables us to be better  understood. I realize that we will have to traverse a long path  in order to establish closer relations between our two  institutions.    With regard to changes in the European Union and Armenia,  you  know that after the establishment of diplomatic relations  between the European Union and Armenia in June 1992 Armenia  participated in technical assistance programs envisaged for CIS  countries. Armenia also received humanitarian assistance in the  European Commission (in 1993 about 18 million ECU). In  particular, the latest deliveries of mazut must be noted.    Armenia also received credits twice (38 and 20 million ECU),  most of which went for the purchase of grain.    There is another sphere, in which the European Union can  help  Armenia--this is the sphere of nuclear power.    The serious energy crisis led to the fact that the  government  of Armenia adopted a decision on the restart of one unit of the  Metsamor Nuclear Station. In connection with this Armenia asked  the Union for technical assistance, as well as for the financing  necessary for the implementation of this program.    It goes without saying that the implementation of this  program, the goal of which is to meet most of the energy needs,  is of vital importance for the economy of my country.    Such is the considerable assistance granted us by the  European Union.    Despite all this the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has a certain  effect on mutual relations between the European Union and  Armenia. Thus, despite the mandate issued to the European  Commission by the European Union on the beginning of  negotiations for the purpose of signing partnership agreements  among all former USSR countries and the European Union, such  negotiations did not begin with Armenia. The conduct of such  negotiations with the Transcaucasian republics is connected with  the establishment of stability in the region, in particular with  the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. At the same  time, Armenia--the only state in the Transcaucasus that has  internal stability, has carried out serious economic reforms,  has laid down the foundations for a democratic society, and  respects human rights and liberties--is the object of a parity  attitude on the part of the European Union: the principle of a  differentiated approach to Transcaucasian countries is reduced  to naught.    It is difficult to understand such an attitude on Europe's  part if we take into account that Armenia's attitude toward  peaceful negotiations held within the framework of the Minsk  CSCE group was constructive, whereas Azerbaijan's nonacceptance  of the program of nine members of the Minsk group, which sets  the task of implementation of UN resolutions, places on it the  responsibility for the intensification of the violence in the  region.    In this context the European Union's breaking away from  conducting any negotiations with Armenia for the purpose of  concluding partnership agreements can prove to be predetermining  for the process of transformations begun in Armenia.    We also believe that the European Union has the opportunity  to hold a more serious position in the cause of the search for  the solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict through  negotiations--by means of three participant countries, which are  members of the Minsk CSCE group, and the appointment of  observers of the European Union there.    I hope that the Europarliament will raise before the  European  Union and the commission matters important from its point of  view and will take advantage of its opportunities to inform the  Union's legal institutions of all these factors and to submit  proposals to them for rendering technical, financial, and  humanitarian assistance to Armenia.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Light composites take the strain Composite materials are renowned for being stronger and lighter than steel, but have traditionally been more expensive. Cambridge Consultants has now found a way of mass-producing composite structures with all the strength, but at a lower cost. The result could be tough but lightweight car bumpers, train seats, manhole inspection covers and even sports racquets. Composites, which derive their strength from the lengths of glass or carbon fibre embedded in the resin, are widely used in the defence and aerospace industries. But they could only be mass-produced if the fibres were cut, reducing their strength. Cambridge Consultants has developed machinery which adapts conventional spinning procedures to weave the fibres continuously in three dimensions. Special resins have also been developed.

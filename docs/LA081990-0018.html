			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORDS, ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> DONIZETTI: "MARIA STUARDA." Edita Gruberova, Agnes Baltsa, Francisco Araiza,  Simone Alaimo; Chorus of the Bavarian Radio; Munchner Rundfunkorchester  conducted by Giuseppe Patane.  </P> <P> Philips 426 233 (two compact discs). Although "Maria Stuarda" has received  three earlier commercial recordings, none has sustained the lyrical elements of  the 1834 work so completely as this latest effort. Baltsa's Elizabeth I and  Gruberova's Mary Stuart are evenly matched rivals in the epithet-slinging  encounter in Fotheringay Park, the opera's juiciest dramatic episode. Gruberova  lends pathos to Mary's famous prayer, and although Baltsa's voice has acquired  a steely edge, she bestows a measure of finesse on the conventional villain  Donizetti has made of the queen. Araiza does what he can with the third side of  the triangle. Credit is due Patane, who died shortly after making the  recording; his seasoned leadership lends the whole project considerable pulse  and idiomatic flair. ALLAN ULRICH  </P></p>

(``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposal to amend Section 9&hyph;1, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund_How Appointed'' of Article IX, ``Trustees of Stock Exchange Fund'' of the Exchange's By-Laws to allow two members of the Exchange's Board of Governors (``Board''), rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Stock Exchange Fund (``Fund'') and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees. In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10&hyph;13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's Executive Committee. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Article XXII, ``Amending the By-Laws,'' of the Exchange's By-Laws the Board voted on the proposed amendments to the Exchange's By-Laws and submitted them to the Exchange's members for comment. Receiving no comments, the Board voted to approve the proposed amendments and filed its proposal with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of the proposal appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34567 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44211 (August 26, 1994). No comment letters were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, Section 9&hyph;1 of the Exchange's By-Laws requires that the trustees of the Fund include the Chairman of the Exchange's Board, two Vice Chairmen of the Board and up to five other Exchange members; all of the trustees, except the Chairman, are appointed by the Exchange's Board and serve for three years or until a successor is appointed. The PHLX proposes to amend Section 9&hyph;1 to allow two members of the Exchange's Board, rather than two Vice Chairmen, to serve as trustees of the Fund and to allow qualified non-members to serve as trustees. Under Section 9&hyph;1, as amended, the trustees of the Fund will include the Chairman of the Board and two members of the Board. The remaining five trustees, pursuant to the proposal, can be either members, non-members, or a combination from these two categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the PHLX proposes to amend Section 10&hyph;13, ``Executive Committee,'' of By-Law Article X, ``Standing Committees,'' to delete the requirement that the Executive Vice President of the Exchange serve on the Exchange's Executive Committee. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Executive Committee executes and implements corporate policy established previously by the Exchange's Board of Governors and makes recommendations concerning corporate policy to the Board of Governors.

Under the proposal, the Board will be able to choose qualified persons with investment management expertise regardless of their status as Exchange members or affiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment will also eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees, to ease the administrative burdens currently imposed upon the Vice Chairmen. The proposal retains the Board's oversight of the trustees by continuing to require the Chairman of the Board to be a trustee and by imposing a new requirement that two other members of the Board be trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment to By-Law Article X, Section 10&hyph;13 deletes the Executive Vice President of the PHLX from membership on the Exchange's Executive Committee while increasing the minimum number of Board members on the Executive Committee from three to four. The PHLX states that the Exchange's management will continue to be represented on the Executive Committee by the Exchange's President and Chief Executive Officer. Under Section 10&hyph;13, as amended, the other members of the Executive Committee shall include the Chairman of the Board, two Vice Chairmen of the Board, the immediate past Chairman of the Board, and four or more additional members of the Board appointed by the Chairman of the Board with the Board's approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section 6(b)(3), in that it is designed to assure a fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of its affairs and to provide that one or more Fund trustees may be representatives not associated with a member of the Exchange. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Murray L. Ross, Secretary, PHLX, and Yvonne Fraticelli, Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on July 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b)(3) in that it is designed to assure the fair representation of the Exchange's members in the administration of its affairs. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed amendments to Section 9&hyph;1 are designed to provide the PHLX's Board with greater flexibility in the selection of Fund trustees by allowing the Board to appoint qualified non-members to serve as trustees of the Fund, thereby allowing non-members with investment expertise to serve as Fund trustees. In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to eliminate the requirement that the Exchange's Vice Chairmen serve as Fund trustees in order to ease the administrative duties of the Vice Chairmen. At the same time, the Commission notes that the proposal requires two members of the Board, as well as the Chairman of the Board, to serve as Fund trustees, thus helping to ensure that the Board will retain its oversight of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(3) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

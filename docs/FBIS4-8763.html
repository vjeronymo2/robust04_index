			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cajnice, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- The command of the  Herzegovina Corps [of the Srpska army] announced this morning  that, following yesterday's cease-fire on the Gorazde  battlefield, Serb forces stopped advancing toward Gorazde.    However, following a brief lull overnight, the Muslims in  Gorazde started opening sniper and antiaircraft fire on the Serb  lines, and the fire is being stepped up.    The command of the Serb forces issued sharp warnings that if  the fire does not stop immediately it will respond with all  available weapons. [passage omitted]    After they captured Biserna hill above Gorazde yesterday,  the  Herzegovina Corps' fighters liberated the whole of the right  bank of the River Drina. The last Muslim soldiers fled  yesterday afternoon across bridges in Gorazde to the left bank.    The Serb forces' frontline is currently in the town itself,  on the right bank of the River Drina. Serb units yesterday  advanced considerably from the direction of Kopaci, north of  Gorazde, and reached the town's suburbs.    A considerable chunk of territory on the left bank of the  Drina was also liberated yesterday. The areas of Jelah,  Konjbaba, and Sjedokosa are now under Serb control.    In addition to the central town area, the Muslims control  the  area on the left bank of the River Drina, 7 or 8 kms toward Foca.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Economic Viewpoint: It's the yen more than the dollar Intervention in the foreign exchange market by governments and central banks may or may not be justified. But to have a chance of success at least three criteria must be fulfilled: It must, if necessary, be massive. Nothing is worse than half-hearted intervention which merely gives the speculators a taste of blood. It must be multilateral. At the very least, the authorities of both the strong and the weak currencies should take part. It needs to be backed by domestic policies. Either the country with the weak currency should tighten its monetary policy - that is, increase interest rates - or the country with the strong currency should loosen monetary policy; or, best of all, both should move. There was no chance of these conditions being fulfilled at the time of the Group of Seven summit at Naples in the case of the dollar. The German authorities were determined not to intervene to support the US currency. But the problem is more a dollar-yen one; and joint action by the American and Japanese authorities was not on the cards either. The situation may always change if exchange rates move towards panic points  -what these are have probably not been determined in advance. Central bankers are now under a lot of pressure to intervene to prevent 'disorderly markets'; but they will simply be making capital losses for their countrymen unless they are to implement the three conditions. Anything less will be worse than useless. Meanwhile, it would help to clarify thought if we could establish whether the main trend has been a weak dollar or a strong yen. In the aftermath of the recent inconclusive summit, market operators merely noticed the dollar falling against all-comers and the yen rising. But a longer, cooler look makes it clear that the main development has been a rising yen. Indeed, the dollar has not been all that weak if examined over a reasonable period. There are many ways of demonstrating this fact. One of the most illuminating is to look at the track record of the dollar against the D-Mark. In the early and middle 1980s, it was violently unstable. But since the much-maligned Louvre Agreement of early 1987, the exchange rate between the two currencies has rarely strayed more than 10 per cent on either side of DM1.6 to the dollar. Indeed, the dollar's rate against the D-Mark was more favourable the day after last weekend's Naples summit than it was at its 1990, 1991 and 1992 low points. The relative stability of the dollar against the D-Mark thus suggests that the problems have come from the yen side. This is confirmed by looking at the yen's movement against the dollar, which is marked both by medium-term instability and a strong trend in favour of the yen and against the dollar. An alternative way of showing the yen's strength, not involving the dollar at all, is to look at the yen/D-Mark exchange rate. This important, but neglected, cross-rate shows the D-Mark falling from a high of more than Y90 at the beginning of 1991 to a low of less than Y60 this year. The move can be seen as a 50 per cent appreciation of the yen, or a 33 per cent depreciation of the D-Mark. It has undoubtedly helped Germany to compete in world markets despite a post-unification upsurge in domestic costs. These conclusions are confirmed by the trade-weighted indices. Contrary to popular impression, there has been little trend either way in either the D-Mark or dollar index in the last three and a half years. The yen, on the other hand, has shot upwards, although it previously reached something near to its present level in the summer of 1993. Japan has had lower inflation than the other G7 countries, but the discrepancy has not been nearly enough to offset the rising yen. Profit margins have been squeezed and export prices have fallen severely in yen terms in 1993 and 1994. Yet whatever yardstick is chosen, the yen has had a large real, as well as nominal, appreciation in the last few years. This appreciation has undoubtedly contributed to the severity of the Japanese recession. The retardation of gross domestic product has to be judged not just in relation to other countries, but in relation to the much higher trend previously seen in Japan. If one looks at industrial production, such analytical contortions are unnecessary. The absolute fall here has been much greater in Japan than in both the US and Germany. There are some indications of a slight recovery; but it will have to go a very long way before the trend rate of growth is recaptured. Indeed, the OECD projections show Japanese growth as among the most sluggish of the G7 in the next couple of years. The strength of the yen should put into perspective the facile belief that a currency's position is always closely linked with politics. For Japan has the most unstable government of all the G7 countries and the most uncertain political future, yet the strongest currency. The continuing Japanese external surplus is not on its own a sufficient explanation either. There is nothing new in the high Japanese propensity to save. The novel factor, which is helping to pull the yen upwards, is the growing disinclination to invest the surplus abroad. Irrespective of the precise diagnosis, the policy implications are pretty clear. Although it remains debatable when or how far US monetary policy ought to be tightened, it is clear that Japanese monetary policy should be loosened further. It will obviously help if Japan's finance ministry shelves indefinitely its plans for indirect tax increases to offset the recent direct tax reductions. But it is not enough to continue to rely on fiscal packages, which are seen as temporary. It may be asked how Japan can loosen monetary policy further when the official discount rate since last September has been at 1 3/4 per cent - a post-1945 low - and three-month market rates have averaged about 2 per cent. The discount rate can indeed be cut further and there are rumours that this is likely to happen. But if this is not enough, the short answer is to increase the supply of yen. If Japanese investors are not in a borrowing mood, the Bank of Japan can increase the supply of yen by issuing them to buy up dollars and other currencies in the foreign exchange markets (a process known as 'unsterilised intervention'). The country with a strong currency that is gaining reserves has an open-ended ability to intervene, which it is well advised to use so long as it is more afraid of deflation than inflation. The onus is on Japan to depreciate the yen more than on the US to support the dollar. The benefits of so doing would clearly make themselves felt to Japanese business. If the Japanese authorities can reverse the movement of the yen, the prices of internationally traded products in Japanese markets will start to rise. Thus, real interest rates would fall and could perhaps become negative, so helping economic recovery. The needed US contribution is mainly political and psychological. If Washington does nothing, markets may fear that it will go back to its old policy of talking down the dollar against the yen for the sake of US exporters. Markets will also worry that American trade negotiators may make direct threats which will unsettle sentiment further. The statements from US commerce secretary Ron Brown are hardly reassuring here. So any gestures which show the US in support of Japanese actions will help. Nor is there any reason to withhold this help. A monetary relaxation in Japan will give just the boost to the world economy and to American exports that Washington is supposed to be seeking.</p>

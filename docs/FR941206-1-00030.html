			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated November 8, 1994, Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (Wildlife Monitoring, administrative record No. WY&hyph;28&hyph;01). Wyoming submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendments at 30 CFR 950.16(aa). The provisions of Land Quality Rules that Wyoming proposed to reside were: Appendix B, Wildlife Monitoring Requirements For Surface Coal Mining Operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, Wyoming proposes to revise section E, by removing the language ``except migrating and wintering bald eagles or migrating peregrine falcons.'' After numerous meetings with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, representatives of the mining industry, and Land Quality Division biologist, the introductory sentence of section E is now acceptable to all participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section C: Raptor Production,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nest Status and Production Success <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of Appendix B was modified to satisfy concerns expressed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. These agencies recommended that the required dates for conducting raptor surveys be changed to: ``on or before mid February.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Wyoming program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Written Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or at locations other than the Casper Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been scheduled.

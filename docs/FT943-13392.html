			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Siemens-led group clinches Kazakh power contract A Turkish-German consortium led by KWU, Siemens' power-generating equipment business, has won a breakthrough turnkey contract to build a gas-fired power station in the Aktyubinsk region of Kazakhstan. The order is worth nearly DM1bn (Pounds 400m). The 954MW station will be Kazakhstan's first combined-cycle power plant, which uses the waste heat from gas turbines to power additional steam turbines. In line with a decree passed in December, the plant will be financed through revenue from three oilfields in the region. The contract was awarded by Kazakhstanenergo, the state-owned utility. Due to go on line in stages by 1998 and fired with Kazakh natural gas, the plant is expected to make a big contribution to the independence of the country's power supply. Kazakhstan is a big exporter of primary energy sources, notably coal and crude oil, but has to import about 20 per cent of its electricity. Siemens' German consortium partners are Babcock Lentjes Kraftwerkstechnik and Balcke-Durr, both parts of Deutsche Babcock. Siemens will supply four gas turbines, two steam turbines, six generators, the instrumentation and control equipment and the switchgear. The Babcock companies will provide the heat recovery steam generators and mechanical systems. Other components will be sourced from eastern Germany. The Turkish consortium member is the Turkish-US company United BMB Group, based in Ankara and New Jersey, which will handle construction and civil works. Siemens has been active in Russia through Interturbo, its St Petersburg-based venture with turbine manufacturer LMZ. Interturbo will manufacture four units for the Aktyubinsk IPP combined-cycle plant in Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The process aimed at suppressing money hoarders is  not a campaign, but a legal proceeding that will continue after  the first phase, begun on 16 May, is completed. Government  spokesmen have reiterated the commitment not to stop halfway  through this struggle against ill-gotten wealth, in an effort to  eliminate the causes behind money hoarding. The authorities are  working expeditiously within Decree Law 149 to achieve this.    To date, and as a direct result of the process, 222 citizens  have been registered as money hoarders. These now have to prove,  through documents, the ownership of 180 cars, 83 motorbikes, 48  trucks, 24 tractors, 108 houses, and over 3.5 million pesos. The  provinces with the most cases and largest amounts of goods are  Havana City, Havana, Pinar del Rio, and Camaguey. There are also  cases in other provinces.    The way in which these people became wealthy is significant,  in general, as is the fact that they foster criminal activities  and various crimes. There are, for example, people dealing in  meat, spare car parts, and tires. There are also those who  repair old cars. This allows many of them to build houses like  the eight-room home a citizen from Ciego de Avila is erecting on  a salary of less than 300 pesos. He also owns a truck, a car,  and a floor-tile machine.    The main goal of the process against the money hoarders is  not to prove the legitimacy of the goods, but to demonstrate  whether they correlate with the means of the citizen in  question. In other words, they must prove their source of  income. Of the 222 cases registered to date, 42 percent are  unemployed, 8 percent are small farmers, another 8 percent are  managers of grocery stores, meat shops, workshops, and other  such facilities. Precautionary measures have been implemented  against all of them.    Bank accounts had not been the indicator that began the  process against the money hoarders. The privacy of these  accounts is being preserved. Only when the case calls for it  does the bank come into play -- to provide details.    Currently, according to reports by sources from the attorney  general's office, they are working to conclude the first cases.  This involves four careful steps, from the prosecutor's office  to the Ministry of Finance, in order to ultimately determine  confiscation of the money hoarders' ill-gotten goods.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NORTH CITY WEST PLANS PETITION DRIVE TO DETOUR ROUTE 56 TO THE SOUTH  </P> <P> North City West homeowners are making down payments of $100 and more on a plan  to keep a major east-west freeway from bisecting their community.  </P> <P> At a meeting earlier this week, Jerry Mailhot, leader of the Carmel Valley  Coalition, unveiled plans for a referendum petition drive designed to force the  San Diego City Council to rescind its approval of the western State Route 56  alignment through Carmel Valley or to put the issue to a citywide vote.  </P> <P> Route 56, which has been in state Department of Transportation construction  plans for more than two decades, is proposed to link with coastal Interstate 5  at Carmel Valley Road east of Del Mar. The City Council adopted the westerly  end of the freeway alignment May 8 after heated opposition from residents of  surrounding upscale communities in North City West, Carmel Valley and Del Mar  Heights.  </P> <P> The City Council was scheduled Monday to give final approval to the ordinance  setting the Route 56 alignment through Carmel Valley but Mailhot protested that  the two conditions of approval ordered by the council had not been included in  the action. So the ordinance passage was postponed for two weeks.  </P> <P> "That buys us time," Mailhot told a group of concerned North City West  homeowners Monday night. The referendum petition drive cannot begin until the  ordinance is adopted by the council, probably on June 4, he said. After that,  the coalition has 30 days in which to gather at least 35,000 signatures.  </P> <P> The coastal suburbs near Del Mar have been fighting the freeway alignment for  several years, arguing that the alignment should be moved to the south along  the Carmel Mountain Road alignment. Such a route would be shorter, less  expensive and would not disrupt residential neighborhoods along Carmel Valley,  the coalition leaders claim.  </P> <P> Mailhot, who is also a member of the North City West Planning Board, told  residents that they must ante up donations to the Carmel Valley Coalition to  finance the hiring of a professional signature-gathering firm which would  supplement volunteer petition circulators to reach the petition goal.  </P> <P> "We are bringing in donations at the rate of $1,000 a day," Mailhot said. He  estimated that the group needed $35,000 to $45,000 to mount the referendum  challenge.  </P> <P> If the coalition succeeds in gaining the required number of signatures on its  referendum petitions, the San Diego City Council will be forced to rescind the  ordinance setting the Route 56 alignment or order the issue placed on the  ballot for a citywide vote.  </P> <P> The biggest problem with the referendum, coalition leader Jan Fuchs said, "is  that it will be perceived as a NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) issue."  </P> <P> The new freeway, which will link inland I-15 with coastal I-5 and I-805 to San  Diego, "will have ripple effects all up and down the coast" on traffic volumes,  Fuchs said. Additional traffic on the already crowded coastal freeways would  result from construction of the cross-county freeway, Fuchs said.  </P> <P> Mailhot said that a route over Del Mar Mesa to the south of Carmel Valley would  avoid the sensitive wetlands in the valley and the lagoon and would avoid the  noise and pollution that a major roadway would bring to developed sections of  North City West.  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Fishy method Hearing the dreadful stories of how revolting French fishermen are interfering with British fish exports, Observer wonders whether exporters can beat the French at their own game by using poisson distribution to calculate the exact probability of further interruptions. If the average destruction rate is 10 crates of cod an hour, applying the poisson gives an 11 per cent probability of 8 crates being destroyed in any one hour and a 7.5 per cent chance of a 15 to 30 minute delay between onslaughts.</p>

But according to the leaders of the two  organizations, today's meeting was in line with ongoing talks  between the two groups.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Nan Roux] The ongoing violence  and the rejection of a one-ballot system for the coming  elections. These were the issues discussed at a meeting between  IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and PAC President Clarence  Makwetu. The two leaders said such a system was undemocratic  and would rob voters of their freedom to choose parties at both  the provincial and national level.    [Makwetu] If we talk of democracy, if I vote on a provincial  level, and I want to vote differently on a national level I  should have liberty to do so. It should not be decided by the  bureaucrat where my vote should lie.    [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said the PAC and the IFP had already  contacted the Democratic Party, the Dikwankwetla Party, and  others who favor the two-ballot system, in order to work out a  joint strategy. On the issues of violence, both leaders  committed themselves to addressing the situation as soon as  possible for fear that it might jeopardize the entire election  process.    [Makwetu] I support a move by the people directly involved  in  the violence sitting together, trying to resolve their  differences.    [Roux] Mr. Makwetu said joint activity between the PAC, the  IFP, and the ANC, was the only solution. [end recording]</p>

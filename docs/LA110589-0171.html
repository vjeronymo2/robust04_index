			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1989 BOOK PRIZE WINNER: SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> PEACE: A BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE FOR PRIMATES?  </P> <P> In "Peacemaking Among Primates," Frans de Waal calls attention to an important  but recently overlooked perspective in ethology, the study of the evolution of  behavior. A relatively new science, ethology incorporates theories of behavior  that go back at least 200 years, when scientists first looked to the natural  world for a blueprint of the social contract, the basis for human behavior.  Since then, they have moved from the picture of man as a "noble savage," born  into an Eden and then corrupted, to the post-Darwinian vision of man as another  animal subject to fierce competition for limited resources in order to survive.  </P> <P> On a January day in 1880, a different view came to the attention of Peter  Kropotkin, known historically as the ideologue of anarchism, when he heard  about a lecture presented at the Russian Congress of Naturalists by a  well-known zoologist, who suggested that besides the law of mutual struggle --  species locked in a gladiatorial battle for existence -- there was a  corresponding and even more important law of mutual aid. Three years later,  Kropotkin read the same suggestion in Darwin's "The Descent of Man" and set to  work collecting data, which he published, in 1902, as "Mutual Aid," a chronicle  of cooperative behavior in the progressive evolution of the species.  </P> <P> Kropotkin reissued "Mutual Aid" in 1915 in order to set the record straight. He  insisted that the war then destroying civilization as he knew it was not  inevitable. People cooperate even under siege, he argued: Witness the peasant  women who thrust bread and apples into the hands of German and Austrian  prisoners as they trudged through the streets of Kiev. Mutual aid, he asserted,  is a necessary correlative of competition among social animals, including human  beings.  </P> <P> But this optimistic view of nature did not win much favor as the 20th Century  continued with wars and genocide expanded to levels previously unimagined.  Biologists and ethologists, along with psychologists and sociologists, sought  the roots of this violence in the evolutionary past.  </P> <P> The roots were not hard to find. Violence is dramatic and easy to document.  Tracking hostile behaviors in other species fulfilled the expectations of those  who read these acts as a genetic necessity, a selection of evolution. However,  while aggression is a successful adaptation among other species, it becomes a  fatal flaw in humans who still react instinctively, hair standing on end,  adrenaline flowing, to hostile movements, responding with nuclear weapons  instead of sharpened canines.  </P> <P> The late Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian ethologist of enormous stature, observed  that an animal must be aggressive to compete successfully, and he reasoned that  aggression has biological roots. This concept, which he explored in "On  Aggression," published in English in 1966, inspired a generation of scientists.  Perhaps as an effort to universalize the atrocities of the war he had lived  through in Germany, Lorenz defined aggression as the starting point of all  social relationships. Aggression inspires hierarchy, community, and among  non-human species controls the dispersion of resources. But among humans, he  asserted, it is out of control. As a species we have run amok because we do not  have the inhibition to control our aggressive instinct.  </P> <P> Lorenz's work was followed by a spate of books and articles testifying to the  biological, hormonal and psychological basis of aggression in human beings. The  consensus seemed to be that we come equipped with a runaway instinct, one that  suited our ancestors on the savannah, but in the world of advanced weaponry  seems to doom us to extinction.  </P> <P> Awash in this news about the aggressive nature of animals in general and  primates in particular, ethologists such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey began  to document intra-species killings, even cannibalism, among those apes we had  all learned to love because of their gentle nature.  </P> <P> De Waal rejects this pessimistic and one-sided picture of the human  predicament. "Peacemaking Among Primates" can be seen as a delayed, and  infinitely more sophisticated, sequel to Kropotkin's attempt to describe with  scientific accuracy the centripetal forces that keep societies together as well  as the centrifugal ones that drive them apart. It also is an elucidation and  expansion of Lorenz's views, accepting the reality of aggression but positing  it as only one side of the coin.  </P> <P> De Waal is both a revisionist and an optimist. Indeed, he concedes that  primates fight. But at least as often they avoid clashes that could lead to  fights; and when they do fight, they make peace with their adversaries so that  the community continues as before. He documents this assertion with detailed  studies of five primate groups including chimpanzees, macaques and human  beings, using data he has meticulously collected over more than a decade. He  confirms in the idiom of a modern ethologist what Kropotkin could only surmise:  that mutual aid has enabled primates to evolve complex and viable social  groups.  </P> <P> De Waal demonstrates that science can be like poetry: Once a truth is stated,  our vision shifts and we cannot imagine how we did not see it before. We join  De Waal in the public observation post at Arnhem Zoo in The Netherlands, above  the largest colony of chimpanzees in captivity. De Waal knows each individual  by name and personality (and has already written about them in an earlier book,  "Chimpanzee Politics"). Familiar with their frequent fights, he realized in a  moment of inspiration that their conflicts always ended in reconciliations that  left most relationships repaired and normalized. Along with his colleagues, he  had been blind for years to what had been happening before their eyes. Thus he  began to study the nature of reconciliation, of peacemaking among these  chimpanzees.  </P> <P> From the chimps at Arnhem, he went on to study peacemaking among rhesus and  stump-tailed macaques at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center where  he is now a research scientist; among bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), in the  unique group at the San Diego Zoo; and among human beings. He discovered  similar patterns of peacemaking among the five groups of primates. He also  discovered a blindness among other scientists to the study of peacemaking. He  describes a world- renowned psychologist, a specialist in human aggression, who  grew irritated at the suggestion that evolution has anything to do with  explaining behavior, and had not even considered the possibility that conflicts  are inevitable among people because aggression has a long evolutionary history,  and that reconciliation is worth studying because it is logical to expect the  co-evolution of powerful coping mechanisms.  </P> <P> Perhaps that psychologist will read his book. The evidence is overwhelming that  we share with other primates the mechanisms for fighting, but also the need for  friendship, support, body contact and even sexual activity as a social  function, and to get these we, too, have evolved mechanisms for face-saving,  for compromise, for consolation and for reconciliation.  </P> <P> Until now -- and this is the heart of his message -- most scientists have  believed that violence is more integral to human nature than peace. In reality,  he demonstrates, we have highly developed strategies for consolation and  reconciliation.  </P> <P> De Waal brings a new perspective to a discipline that has been dominated in the  English-speaking world by self-consciously detached observers as well as by  those who see animals as a gene's device to reproduce itself. De Waal also  rejects the approach that science starts with a battery of hypotheses which are  dispassionately tested. He points out that Darwin didn't set sail to test a  theory. Rather, he returned with the ingredients to make one.  </P> <P> Theory never takes precedence over his personal observations, one of which led  him to reject the extrapolation of the famous crowded-rat experiment to the  human condition. In this experiment, caged rats that were pushed closer and  closer together eventually went mad and turned cannibal. But De Waal notes that  vervet monkeys crowded together simply avoid eye contact and look at the sky  and ground a lot. The same could be said for his countrymen who, while living  in one of the most densely packed nations on earth, enjoy low crime rates and a  high degree of personal tolerance. Primates are one thing, rats another.  </P> <P> As a Dutchman, de Waal also is especially careful about English, the way a  person must be whose native language is not the lingua franca of any major  discipline. He distinguishes carefully between the words "aggression" and  "violence," the latter being the most extreme but not the most common form of  the former. He also distinguishes between "consolation," the act of support by  a bystander to the victim of a hostile encounter, and "reconciliation,"  peacemaking between the actors in the encounter.  </P> <P> De Waal's observations are wide-ranging, surprising and invariably provocative.  With increased knowledge of primate behavior, he worries about the ways some  zoos isolate these highly social creatures. From observations that male  primates participate in acts of reconciliation more frequently than do females,  he wonders if males are generally more conciliatory than females, and  speculates on the differences between the sexes in our own species.  </P> <P> This gracefully written book is unabashedly political, referring frequently to  contemporary issues to make a point. Concerned about survival, De Waal in 1986  signed the Seville Statement which asserted that "Biology does not condemn  humanity to war." But unlike the other signatories, who felt that we could rise  above our biological destiny (through intelligence, one supposes, and  restraint), De Waal believes it is that very biological heritage that provides  us with the mechanisms of reconciliation which he urges us to develop. We are  creatures of evolution, and have arrived where we are because we are able to  control and channel our aggressions. Peacemaking is not only desirable, it is,  in a sense, evolutionarily prescribed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Science And Technology Nominees  </P> <P> Is Science Necessary?

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian defense minister, Pavel Grachev, will go  to Brussels on the 23d of this month on a three-day visit. He  will submit at the NATO headquarters Russia's proposals for the  NATO program Partnership for Peace. Here is what our observer  Anatoliy Potapov writes about Russia's relations with NATO:    It is hard to guess what proposals the Russian defense  minister will take to NATO. Most likely it is not going to be  one of those documents currently under preparation by Russian  experts. Apparently General Grachev intends to talk about the  terms in which Russia will participate in the NATO program.    Given some statements made recently by President Boris  Yeltsin and other Russian leaders, there are no objections to  Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program.  The single document, obligatory for signing by all the member  states, does not perceive any concrete actions or joint  decisions. As many European politicians describe it, it is only  a declaration of intentions. The signing of the document will  not commit Russia to anything. The document does not outline  any prospects for cooperation. Then what is this partnership  all about?    The point is that Russia is seeking serious, large-scale,  equal cooperation with NATO. Russia has the right to expect  NATO will not disregard its special geopolitical situation, its  role on the world scene and, finally, its military might no  other European state can boast of. Thus it is necessary to find  a reasonable combination of the equity of all participants in  the NATO program and Russia's special role in it. This is the  essence of the problem of Russia's partnership with NATO. As  for Russia, it is preparing a bilateral document with clear-cut,  concrete parameters of partnership.    So far, the concept of the future document is a matter of  guesswork. Hopefully it will reflect the principles of  preserving the organizational structure and the unique character  of the Russian army, now numbering some 3 million, and the  standards of its often unique armaments. Russia is a European  but also an Asian state. It would be reasonable to word the  future document so as to rule out all possible fears and  speculations on the part of its Asian neighbors.    It's worthy to note that some East European countries regard  the NATO program only as the first stage of their full-fledged  membership in this bloc. Some statements by prominent Western  politicians support such aspirations. While Russia's idea of  the Partnership for Peace is different, Russia wants all  European states to join efforts to promote stability on the  continent. It does not see this document as a way to extend  NATO in the eastern direction, a way to a new splitting of  Europe. Russia is open and straightforward about this, seeking  to provide a firm basis for its wide-range [as heard]  cooperation with the North Atlantic bloc.</p>

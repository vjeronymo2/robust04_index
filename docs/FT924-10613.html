			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Scots Tories in Rosyth yard row THE Scottish Conservative party was embroiled in controversy yesterday after a report that a senior party official had warned local Tories to be braced for the announcement of the closure of the Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife. Mr Mark Tennant, treasurer of the Scottish Conservatives, was quoted in the Daily Record by Mr Mark Graveling, chairman of the Dunfermline West constituency party, as saying that Tories had to be braced for a major statement on the dockyard. A closure of yard, which employs 4,000 people, would make the final closure earlier this year of British Steel's plant at Ravenscraig 'look like a picnic'. Nevertheless, Mr Tennant denied telling the party to be braced for a closure announcement - although he confirmed making the comparison with Ravenscraig. He said Mr Graveling had misinterpreted what he had said. He said he did not think Rosyth would be closed. The government should decide shortly whether work on servicing the new Trident submarines should go to Rosyth, as was originally intended, or to the larger naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Whichever yard loses the Trident work would probably have to close. Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, denied that the government was planning the closure of Rosyth, but he said he understood that the Navy Board was recommending in favour of Devonport. The decision was a matter for the government and for Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary. Mr Graveling, whose constituency covers an area including Rosyth, had complained that instead of fighting against the possibility of closure the local Tories were being told to 'batten down the hatches and ride out the storm'.</p>

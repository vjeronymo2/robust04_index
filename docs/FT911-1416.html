			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Index reflects rise in confidence The FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, launched six months ago, has illustrated the sharp rise in confidence throughout European equity markets since the outbreak of the Gulf war. It also appears to have bolstered London's position in international dealing. It has proved particularly popular with investors wishing to hedge their bets against trends in portfolios of European equities - the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London Traded Options Market both plan to launch traded derivatives of the index next month.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PRAISES SALVADOR ACTION IN JESUIT CASE  </P> <P> The Bush Administration praised El Salvador on Monday for admitting military  involvement in the recent slayings of six Jesuit priests, but members of  Congress suggested that continued U.S. military support for the tiny Central  American nation might be in jeopardy unless the killers are punished.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Salvadoran President  Alfredo Cristiani had shown "great courage" in announcing Sunday night that the  preliminary investigation into the killings had implicated his own military.  </P> <P> "We asked that the investigation be thorough and the prosecution move ahead,  and it looks like that is the course he (Cristiani) is on. He deserves a lot of  credit," Fitzwater told reporters traveling with President Bush to Orlando,  Fla.  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the findings an  "important breakthrough" that "puts to rest" widespread speculation, especially  among congressional skeptics, that the Salvadoran government would never blame  its own powerful military establishment.  </P> <P> The slain priests, all members of the faculty of the Jesuit-run Central  American University in El Salvador's capital city, were taken from their beds  at the university residence before dawn Nov. 16 and shot to death with  automatic weapons. Also slain was the priests' housekeeper and her 15-year-old  daughter.  </P> <P> Progress in solving the brutal killings appeared crucial to whether Congress  would continue sending military aid to the Cristiani government, which  currently receives more than $300 million a year in U.S. assistance.  Cristiani's announcement marked the first time that a Salvadoran president has  blamed the military for a so-called "death squad" murder.  </P> <P> Although Congress is in recess until Jan. 23, several lawmakers likely to play  key roles in the debate over aid to El Salvador offered only qualified praise  for Cristiani's announcement. They said they will withhold judgment until the  perpetrators of the crime are identified, arrested and punished.  </P> <P> "I have told President Cristiani that there will be a major crisis in  U.S.-Salvadoran relations unless this investigation is carried out completely,  regardless of where it leads," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of  the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.  </P> <P> Leahy added that he will continue to press in the Senate for a strong link  between U.S. aid and respect for human rights in El Salvador.  </P> <P> "The overall human rights situation there is appalling," he said, "and the  United States has an obligation to use its enormous influence through its aid  program to insist on concrete improvements in human rights by the Salvadoran  government, the armed forces and the police."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), one of the most vocal critics of El Salvador  in the Senate, called Cristiani's admission "a long-overdue but welcome step  toward justice in this brutal killing."  </P> <P> However, Kennedy said the "key issue" remains Cristiani's progress in  "identifying the responsible individuals . . . and bringing them to justice,  regardless of their rank. There must be no further cover-up."  </P> <P> Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) insisted that Cristiani has "to pursue the case  all the way to the top, to those who pulled the trigger and those who ordered  it." U.S. aid to El Salvador, he added, "hangs in the balance."  </P> <P> Congress' skepticism reflects the fact that, although thousands of people have  been killed over the past decade by suspected right-wing death squads connected  directly or indirectly to the military, no Salvadoran military officer has ever  been convicted of murder in such a case.  </P> <P> The greatest number of right-wing death-squad killings occurred during the  early years of the Salvadoran civil war, which began in early 1980. When  Cristiani's right-wing administration was elected to office last year, it was  feared there could be a major resurgence of death squad activity, with leftist  civilians as the targets.  </P> <P> And while Cristiani's government managed initially to keep that from happening,  renewed terrorism by left-wing guerrillas touched off a fresh spiral of  politically motivated slayings, including the killing of the six priests.  </P> <P> Widely assumed to have been the work of military men stationed near the  university campus at that time, the killings provoked outrage in Congress and  led to new demands for a suspension of U.S. aid.  </P> <P> Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the admission of military  involvement in the slayings should not affect U.S. support for Cristiani's  elected government in its war against the Marxist-led guerrillas. But mindful  of the strong sentiment on Capitol Hill, she stressed that it is crucial that  Cristiani "now take actions to prosecute the alleged individuals."  </P> <P> Staff writers Norman Kempster and James Gerstenzang contributed to this story.  </P></p>

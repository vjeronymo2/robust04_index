			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUBBLE TELESCOPE FLAW BLAMED ON FAULTY MANUFACTURING TOOL  </P> <P> The defect that blurred the Hubble space telescope's view of the heavens may  have been caused by a flaw in an instrument used to measure the observatory's  mirror when it was built, officials said today.  </P> <P> Preliminary results of tests conducted on a device called a "null corrector"  found spacings in the instrument were about 1 millimeter off from design  specifications, according to a statement from the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration.  </P> <P> "The reflective null corrector is an optical reference device, which was used  to measure very precisely the surface figure of the (telescope's) primary  mirror during its manufacture" in 1981, the statement said.  </P> <P> The device was found in the factory in Danbury, Conn., where the mirror was  built, by a NASA investigative panel led by Lew Allen of the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena, which ordered the tests.  </P> <P> "Over the past two weeks tests have been run, systematically checking various  aspects of this device," the statement said.  </P> <P> "Preliminary results of a test conducted . . . (Wednesday) to look at the  spacings of the elements in the corrector have revealed a clear discrepancy of  approximately 1 millimeter between the design of the null corrector and the  device as it now exists," the statement said.  </P> <P> One millimeter is about 1/25 of an inch, or about the diameter of the point of  a ball-point pen.  </P> <P> "Preliminary analysis indicates that a discrepancy of this magnitude could  cause spherical aberration similar to that observed in the (telescope's)  primary mirror," it said.  </P></p>

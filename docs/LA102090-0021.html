			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYONE IS COMING TO THE RAMS' DEFENSE, OR, RATHER, LACK OF IT  </P> <P> I have many questions, but Ram coaches and management don't seem to have the  answers.  </P> <P> Why don't the Rams trade a running back or a draft choice to the Redskins for  the rights to Dexter Manley and hope the commissioner will lift his lifetime  ban?  </P> <P> I believe that the best thing that could happen is for Georgia to sell the team  to Jerry Buss. Then the players would get paid what they are worth and be there  at the beginning of training camp and take some of the load off the guys that  are there and prevent injuries.  </P> <P> There is another scenario. The Rams end up with the worst record in the NFL.  They fire the coach and get the first pick in the draft. They pick the best  defensive player. Problem is, they probably wouldn't sign him until they lose  four out of five next year.  </P> <P> ART GERSJES  </P> <P> South Gate  </P></p>

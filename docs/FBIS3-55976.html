A spokesman for the Army of the self-proclaimed  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has told Interfax that yet another 270  Azerbaijani servicemen have been put out of action on other  fronts.    Meanwhile, Karabakh has regained control over a number of  strategic heights, earlier captured by Azerbaijan.    The Karabakh Army's casualties on Tuesday were estimated at  6  killed and 15 wounded.    By latest reports from Stepanakert, Azerbaijani troops  mounted an offensive virtually on all fronts on Wednesday.  Bitter fighting is under way.    Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry has refuted as  false  Armenia's reports about Azerbaijan's heavy casualties in the  fighting.    It contended that last week's Azerbaijani losses in both man  power and material were much smaller than Armenia's damage.    A ministry spokesman estimated Armenia's losses in the  Mardakert region where Azerbaijani troops ringed two Karabakh  battalions on Tuesday at 30 men and three tanks.    Yet another 35 Armenian soldiers reportedly lost their lives  in fighting on the Askeran and Agdam fronts and in the Fizuli  region, Azerbaijan. Several tanks and artillery guns were  smashed.</p>

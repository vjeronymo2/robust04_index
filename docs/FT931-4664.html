			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: La Damnation de Faust - Opera The Berlioz work with the highest tally of opera-house performances is not one of his three operas but La Damnation de Faust, the Goethe-inspired 'dramatic legend' written for the concert hall. Berlioz's libretto is decked with stage directions ('Distant sounds, rustic and war-like, begin to disturb the calm of the pastoral scene') which nevertheless are intended to be executed in the listener's imagination. 'La Damnation', David Cairns has written, 'has the character of a dream' - lightning-swift in the modulation of mood and passage of incident, shaped with a dramatic logic unarguable but impalpable, carried on a current of brilliantly coloured and beautiful musical invention, an opera not of the stage but (Cairns's words) 'the mind's eye'. So is any attempt to realise it theatrically an act of artistic hubris? Is it sheer producer's pride, designer's delirium, management mania that brought La Damnation de Faust to the Coliseum in 1969 (revived 1980), and that now brings it to Covent Garden for the first time since 1933? Answers to those questions will surely be as numerous and as diverse as the audience-members themselves; the minority who at Monday evening's curtain calls made plain their dissatisfaction with Harry Kupfer's new Covent Garden staging, in the designs of Hans Schavernoch (sets) and Reinhard Heinrich (costumes), deserve tolerance and even sympathy. Myself, I sat utterly dazzled and enchanted, drinking in the kaleidoscope of visual images counterpointed with the music, convinced (at least temporarily) that this must be the most completely ravishing score of the entire 19th century, and longing at the close for an instant repeat performance. For me, indeed, this was two-and-a-half hours (unbroken by interval) of music-theatre magic. The engagement for the occasion of the world's leading Berlioz conductor is of inestimable benefit: a Damnation of Faust production considerably less mercurial than Kupfer's, less deeply imbued with Berliozian intelligence, irony and Romantic passion, would no doubt still take wing as a result of Colin Davis's lifelong involvement in the music. Michael Geliot's 1969 Coliseum staging employed a combination of projected images and processional devices to attempt a theatrical encapsulation of Berlioz's dream-dramaturgy. (Film has often been claimed as the work's ideal medium, although so far no-one has managed to put that belief to the test.) Kupfer works with simpler materials - gauzes, flying and trollied props, light-flashes, giant dolls - which he compounds with speed and legerdemain, in ways that evoke the manifold pleasures of 'naive' theatrical experience while simultaneously throwing out complex reflections about the work itself. The basic set is a 19th-century theatre auditorium, with boxes and a central glass door: old Faust enters it in silence at the start, a refugee from a snow-bound world. (La Damnation de Faust was given its concert-performance premiere in a Paris opera house - the Paris Opera-Comique - on a day in November 1846 when ferocious fierce snow-flurries contributed to the work's poor attendance and reception.) Into whatever form and guise it develops in the course of the evening, the relationship between this Faust - or Faust-Berlioz, one soon comes to think of him - and this theatre-within-a-theatre is held at a remove: he wanders through the staging as through a landscape filled with fleshly delights to which he is alien, a world coarse in bourgeois manners and crudely militarised, an environment he can only dominate by submitting to the dictates of an embodied negative conscience. Poetic irony is the key to Kupfer's Berlioz vision, an irony achieved in a succession of fluidly forming and dissolving theatrical images which the spectator is invited to absorb into his experience of the score, his awareness of its composer, its literary sources, its period of creation, its position in the history of Romantic artistic expression. Almost everything in the staging manifests profound sympathy with the precise quality and character of the musical invention: the sardonic whipcrack of Mephisto's exchanges, the hollow exhilarations of the martial sequences, the exquisitely elusive lyricism of Marguerite's doomed passion. Even in the ending - Kupfer devises here an effect of Brechtian alienation which wholly undermines the heavenly-salvation finale, and which will prove the production's most controversial feature - faith is kept with Berlioz's tracing of (as Cairns puts it) 'the defeat of the Romantic dream'. Davis's Damnation de Faust reading has matured. Energy, intensity of colour and line, command of rhythm are still its notable characteristics, enriched now by an 'inner' awareness of musical sense and direction that fills every note with an extraordinary iridescent glow. On a keyed-up first night, with so sophisticated a staging to attend to, pit and stage were not always exactly co-ordinated (a substitute Brander who lost his way caused problems in the Tavern scene). But already there were marvels of idiomatic playing and choral singing to relish - and no doubt these will be infinitely increased during the run. The star of the show is Samuel Ramey, in magnificent form as Mephistopheles, singing with the fastidious control of tone, line and word that marks the natural Berliozian, and playing with a masterly balance of wit, seriousness and menace. Jerry Hadley's tenor, excellently well suited to the French repertory, sounded on Monday a little dry in its lower reaches, a little too ready to fall into rasping parlando; his Faust is an alert, personable, quick-spirited figure. Olga Borodina's beautifully full, soft-textured, wide-ranging mezzo-soprano lacks the admirable distinctness of verbal delivery of both her colleagues: altogether, this opening-night Marguerite was a sketch which will surely be filled out during the run. I wish I could witness that filling-out process; I wish I could attend all remaining five performances] Sponsored by The Friends of Covent Garden; in repertory until March 25</p>

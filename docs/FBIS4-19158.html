			<p>BFN     [Text] Ambassador Adhamandios Vasilakis, the permanent  Greek charge d'affaires at the United Nations, conveyed a letter  from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to the UN Security  Council president. In the letter, the Greek Government rejects  Albania's unfounded and suspicious claims surrounding the  incident in Episkopi. The letter stresses that the great haste  with which Tirana moved to blame the Greek Government is  unacceptable and that [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's  government remains negative although Greece has repeatedly asked  for cooperation to resolve the issue.    Papoulias' letter refers to Albania's suspicious intentions  and motives in taking an unresolved issue and turning it into a  bilateral dispute. It also accuses the Albanian Government of  linking the incident with Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia--FYROM] and Kosovo.    UN diplomatic circles consider Tirana's behavior as a  desperate effort to disorientate the common view away from the  serious domestic, economic, political, minority, and human  rights issues the country is facing. It is believed that the  Security Council will take no further step but will only suggest  that the two sides cooperate to resolve the issue.</p>

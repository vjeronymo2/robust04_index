			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The New York Yankees, 45 days after letting Ron Guidry go as part of a youth  movement, made an abrupt turnaround and signed the left-hander to a 1-year  contract for $500,000.  </P> <P> Dallas Green, the Yankees' new manager, had previously decided not to keep the  38-year-old Guidry and the 46-year-old Tommy John.  </P> <P> Owner George Steinbrenner apparently decided to go against Green's wishes,  saying, "It was my decision."  </P> <P> Guidry missed the first half of the 1988 season while recovering from shoulder  surgery. He went 2-3 with a 4.18 earned-run average in 56 innings and made  $825,000 in the second season of a 2-year contract. He is guaranteed $250,000  in the new contract, even if he fails to make the opening-day roster.  </P></p>

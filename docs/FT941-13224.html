			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended in modest selling pressure - Market Report Unease over the economic outlook in the UK was fuelled yesterday by reports that independent pay review bodies covering about 1.5m workers are about to challenge the government's call for pay rises to be financed entirely from productivity increases. UK stocks, having been unable to follow other European markets higher in the morning, fell away sharply in the second half of the session as Continental bond markets weakened. By the close the FT-SE 100 Index was 37.4 down at 3,444. Some traders believed they had seen some switching out of UK stocks and into German equities, with futures markets paving the way for such moves. It was noticeable that the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has recently outperformed the FT-SE 100, came to heel yesterday and closed 9.8 off at 4,091.1. Several trading programmes were identified, and at least one was weighted to the sell side. But trading volume was not heavy, and many analysts remained confident that the stock market was suffering little more than a technical correction after its very successful post-Christmas run. Weakness in oil shares, after a downgrading of crude oil price forecasts by an influential London broking house, was an adverse factor. London was also discouraged at the close by a fall of 17 Dow points in early dealings on Wal1 Street as it reacted to IBM's trading statement. Seaq volume increased in the final two hours of trading to return a total for the day of 984.9m shares. On Monday 800.2m shares were worth Pounds 1.42bn in retail worth, the lowest daily figure for a week, although still satisfactory even by bull market standards. Most market specialists remained confident on equity prospects, even though it was agreed that a further correction was likely. 'The market could pull back by another 40 to 50 points to the Footsie 3,400 area without suffering too much strain,' said a leading dealer at one of the big US houses. Technical specialists believe that the UK market had become mildly overbought in the weeks after Christmas, and have been searching out possible areas of weakness. Share losses, although spread across the range of the market, were mostly of modest proportions. In many sectors, there were signs that institutional investors were shuffling their portfolios rather than taking cash out of the market. Stocks with Far Eastern involvement showed mixed movements, as Tokyo rallied cautiously while Hong Kong remained easier. Traders expressed continued doubts over the outlook for Hong Kong, and some UK based houses have turned cautious again on the Tokyo market, reversing their recent change of stance. The retail sector, awaiting further reports this week on the Christmas trading, was also mixed, with some leading names beginning to attract buyers at the end of the day. The retail area is still seen as a crucial indicator of progress in the recovery of the domestic economy, and traders await this week's statements from Burton and Next, two of the leading UK clothing groups, with keen interest. UK markets looked nervous at the close last night as they waited for the batch of important global news due before the end of the week. In addition to President Clinton's State of the Union Message, the markets face statistics on US employment trends, money supply and gross domestic product.</p>

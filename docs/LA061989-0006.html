			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South Korean patrol boats rescued 78 Vietnamese refugees who set their boat on  fire and jumped into the sea after they were refused permission to land, the  South Korean news agency Yonhap said. The patrol boats were escorting the  refugee vessel out to international waters when the 30-ton boat suddenly burst  into flames and sank off the southern island of Cheju, Yonhap quoted naval  police as saying. It was not immediately clear whether the Seoul government  would allow the "boat people" to settle in South Korea.  </P></p>

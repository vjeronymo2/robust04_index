			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariya Barutchieva] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- Bulgaria and Slovenia  have established traditionally friendly relations and the  purpose of my visit is to deepen economic cooperation between  the two countries, Mr. Davorin Kracun, deputy prime minister and  minister of economic relations and development of the Republic  of Slovenia, said upon his arrival here tonight. Mr. Kracun and  his party, including Secretary of State for Foreign Economic  Relations at the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development  Ms. Ravbar Vojka and Mr. Rok Tomsic, adviser at the ministry,  will pay a two-day visit to Bulgaria and are scheduled to meet  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev as well as the ministers  of industry, finance and trade. According to Mr. Kracun,  bilateral economic cooperation could be upgraded in the interest  of both countries and possibilities for its deepening will be  discussed during his meetings here. The two sides are expected  to sign an agreement on trade and economic cooperation, an  agreement on reciprocal investment protection and promotion and  a declaration of intent for setting up a free trade zone between  Bulgaria and Slovenia. [passage omitted]    According to Bulgarian government officials, the two  countries share identical views on a number of international  issues, including the crisis in former Yugoslavia and the  European integration efforts. Ljubljana's position is strategic  for Bulgaria's interests: It lies on a major transport artery  to Western Europe providing a passage for Bulgarian goods,  vehicles and passengers, these officials also said.    Estimates set the 1992 Bulgarian-Slovenian commercial  exchange at U.S.$5,744,722 and Bulgaria's surplus at $1,596,890.  The 1993 commercial exchange between the two countries totalled  $16,811,319, with Bulgaria's surplus amounting to $408,241,  representatives of the Trade Ministry said. Upon his arrival  Mr. Kracun said that in last year's commercial exchange between  the two countries, Slovenia had a U.S.$20 million surplus.  Cooperative deals prevailed in trade relations, Mr. Kracun  added. Bulgaria exports to Slovenia mainly agricultural  products (vegetables, tobacco and tobacco products, chemical  fertilizers) and imports manufactured and semi-manufactured  articles, including medicines, medical equipment, household  appliances and transport equipment, according to data of the  Bulgarian Trade Industry. Slovenia accounted for 43.8 percent  of the 1993 imports to Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Soap wars Since the late 1980s, multinational managers have been repeatedly urged to 'think global, but act local'. When first coined, the axiom was intended to correct the then common misconception that the opening of international markets meant that consumer demand was identical everywhere. Today, there is a wealth of business school case studies demonstrating the error of that assumption. However, the recent war of words between Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, two of the world's biggest consumer goods manufacturers, suggests a rather different conclusion. The hostilities centre on P&amp;G's allegations that a new Unilever detergent, which contains a patented cleansing technology, rots clothes. The origin of Unilever's embarrassment lies not in the difficulty - but in the relative ease - of marketing across borders. That, indeed, has become essential in the detergents industry, where steadily fiercer competition has eroded producers' traditional positions in national markets. Increasingly, success depends on being the first to develop new products and launch them simultaneously on many world markets. Though P&amp;G's allegations may prove baseless, and Unilever's faith in its new product vindicated by consumers, the incident points to a wider lesson. As pressure grows on manufacturers to innovate faster and expand their sales efforts across borders, they are also obliged to confront much bigger risks. In the days when they began by selling products just on their home markets, any hiccups could be attended to before they were launched abroad. Today, they can become a global headache from day one. Furthermore, the advantages procured by global product launches can be short-lived because they can often be quickly copied by competitors. Unilever has sought to combat that problem by using patented technology in its new detergent. But that is difficult in most other consumer products. From ice cream to nail varnish, makers of good new products invite ever earlier a horde of global imitators. For them, the challenge of the 1990s is no longer learning how to cross borders, but how to survive thereafter.</p>

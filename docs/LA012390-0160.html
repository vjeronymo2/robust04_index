			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NEW CONGRESSMAN FACES JAIL  </P> <P> Facing a possible jail sentence, Houston lawyer Craig Washington was sworn in  as Texas's 18th District congressman today, only one day after being found in  contempt of court for the second time in two weeks.  </P> <P> Found in contempt of court in Harris County, Tex., Monday by a judge who  accused him of abandoning his clients, Washington was flanked by members of the  Texas congressional delegation as he was sworn in during a brief floor ceremony  at the start of the 1990 congressional session.  </P> <P> Washington, a Democrat, won a special election in his district in December to  replace the late Rep. Mickey Leland, also a Democrat, who died in a plane crash  with 15 others during a hunger mission to Ethiopia last August.  </P> <P> "I could never replace Mickey Leland," Washington told his new colleagues after  his swearing in. "I'm merely his successor. I'm not here to serve as king of  the hill. I'm on the bottom of the hill, and I need your help."  </P></p>

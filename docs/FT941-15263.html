			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: FT/Transmedia restaurant promotion The FT/Transmedia restaurant promotion is off to a flying start with thousands of cards already sent out. Some 5,000 readers had applied for the card by the end of this week, writes Nicholas Lander. To answer several readers' queries: the 25 per cent saving on food and drink, which ownership of the Transmedia card confers, is a constant benefit that can be used in the UK and the US. The added benefit to FT readers is the six-month free membership. Nearly 200 British restaurants now accept the card.

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Telekom Malaysia climbs 23% Telekom Malaysia increased net profits 23.7 per cent to MDollars 605.8m (USDollars 233.6m) for the six months to June 30 compared with the previous six months. Earnings per share were 30.5 cents. The market greeted the results, which were within expectations, with enthusiasm. Mr James Hay, of Arab-Malaysian Securities, said: 'It's such a relief that they have come in well.' Most forecasts for the full year range from 71 cents to 75 cents. Turnover rose 15.3 per cent to MDollars 2.13bn, while pre-tax profits were up 12.1 per cent to MDollars 788.8m. Net profits were helped by a fall in tax rates from 30.3 per cent in the first half of 1993 to 23.3 per cent in the first half of 1994. Over the past year, Telekom's installed line capacity has grown from 12 customers per 100 population to 14 per 100. Analysts expect penetration to reach 15 per hundred by the year-end. Analysts see Telekom as a stronger utility in the market than Tenaga, the national power company.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONROE, VAN NUYS AGREE TO CHANGE KICKOFF TIME FOR MID-VALLEY GAME  </P> <P> The starting time for the Monroe-Van Nuys football game Thursday at Van Nuys  High has been moved to 2:15 p.m. in an effort to avoid recent gang activity  between students of the schools, according to Monroe assistant principal Angelo  Porco.  </P> <P> Drive-by shootings have taken place between a gang from Van Nuys and the  "Blythe Street group" from Monroe, Porco said. Administrators from the  Mid-Valley League schools agreed to move the time from 8 p.m. to the afternoon  start.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is make it safe," Porco said. "It's not giving in.  It's protecting people through the guise of daylight. We're letting (the gangs)  know that we're not going to tolerate them doing anything.  </P> <P> "The schools are here for our kids and the hoods are not going to ruin this."  </P> <P> Van Nuys Athletic Director Rick Rossini was reluctant to attribute the time  change to gang activity.  </P> <P> "I would hesitate to put any definitive label on this," Rossini said. "There's  a lot of investigating to do before we can make statements like that. (Monroe)  called us and we responded to the call like any school would."  </P> <P> Monroe is 1-5-1 entering the game, 1-3-1 in league play. Van Nuys is 3-4, 3-2  and could clinch a playoff berth with a win. BRIAN MURPHY  </P></p>

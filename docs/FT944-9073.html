			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Employee wins claim on workload stress A former senior social worker at Northumberland County Council yesterday became the first person in the UK to win an action against his employers for negligence after his workload damaged his health. The High Court ruled that the council had breached its duty of care to Mr John Walker, 57, whose workload drove him to a nervous breakdown. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the public services union Unison, which brought the case, said: 'This is a warning to employers that they can no longer expect their staff to pay with their health while struggling to provide under-funded, under-resourced services.' The union said Mr Walker would seek more than Pounds 200,000 in damages. Mr Walker of Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, had been area manager responsible for a team of social workers in the Blyth Valley area since 1974. He suffered a breakdown in November 1986 after his workload grew because of the rising number of child-abuse cases in the area. A psychiatrist said Mr Walker's anxieties were sharply focused on work pressures. He had no history of mental disorder. When he returned to work the following March he found that paperwork had built up in his absence and help promised from the head office was withdrawn. He suffered a second breakdown and was dismissed on the grounds of ill-health. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors, said: 'Most of us who employ people had better shut up and go home. It will make people think very carefully about employing anyone at all.' The number of cases facing employers in areas such as maternity rights, repetitive strain injury and now stress was becoming an increasing problem, she said. Northumberland County Council said it would look carefully at the judgment before deciding whether to appeal.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "A Yo-Yo in the Land of </F> Monkeys' Uncles"]    [Excerpts] State Comptroller Miryam Ben-Porat's reply to  Rabin's question, "Who is she to squawk about the PALMAH  [prestate underground]?" -- "I am the state comptroller" -- is  totally irrelevant. Who is she to tell Rabin who she is and  what her job is? Who is she to speak of good manners and tell  him that a man is as good as his style? Had the Wild West used  tongues instead of guns, Rabin could have been our own Gary  Cooper or Clint Eastwood. [passage omitted]    Despite the impression of army camaraderie projected by  expressions such as "if pigs could fly," "I don't give a damn,"  or "If that is a settlement, then I am a monkey's uncle," so  frequently used by Rabin, there is method to his madness, to  paraphrase Shakespeare. Proof: We have never heard Rabin use  offensive names for Arye Der'i, for instance. Der'i is the man  who encouraged Peres to break up the unity government, and yet  the term "foul maneuver" was attached to Peres. Not a bad word  about Der'i -- either then or today -- although he has been  giving Rabin a hard time, sending him like a "yo-yo" -- Rabin's  term for other circumstances -- back and forth to 'Ovadya Yosef.    You will not hear Rabin thrash out at former generals, even  when they are his sworn political enemies. Yet wherever Peres  is involved, Rabin shoots off his mouth indiscriminately. He  invented the term "suits" for Peres' aides. "Peres is selling  historic processes for the price of a newspaper headline," Rabin  says about the man "who has never served in the Army." Beilin  the poodle [term used by Rabin in a radio interview] is  sometimes referred to as one who acts "brainlessly" and at other  times as one suffering from "a loss of brains." Rabin must find  it infuriating to realize that he is treading the path beaten by  that group and even speaking their lingo (and referring to the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] as the "occupying army" -- God in  heaven!). Who are they to tell him what to do and how to speak?    Rabin is a blend of suspiciousness -- everyone is after his  head -- and a sense of arrogance of a man who knows everything  better than everyone else. That is the reason he is sometimes  the commentator and at other times, the state comptroller. He  speaks of "chatterboxes" in the context of discussions on stock  exchange taxation, and complains that "the finance minister is  mushily pondering new national priorities." Being certain that  everyone is after his head, everything is personal with him: He  disqualifies the contender, rather than the bone of contention.  Everything is "baloney," everything is "bull."    Not only is he unable to take criticism, he is mainly unable  to take alternative opinions. He has trained his ministers and  aides to acquiesce to a degree unheard of even in the days of  autocratic Ben-Gurion and Begin. People are afraid of his  tongue. And we get goose pimples at the thought of how  decisions are made in our country.    As time went on, all the independent bodies and authorities  got on his nerves. For Rabin, the justice minister has long  since become anathema because he routinely sides with the law.  Rabin coined various phrases to denigrate the legal  establishment's independent status. He speak enviously about  the PLO, which will be able to rule Gaza "without the High Court  of Justice and Betzelem." He does not miss an opportunity to  scourge the Histadrut labor federation, which he considers to be  the source of all his troubles (and recently, of his mistakes as  well). He compares the trade unions to Islamic terrorism and  yearns for Singapore, "where there is no Histadrut and no  nonsense." Rabin is particularly enraged by the independence of  Knesset committees. He terms the Finance Committee "one of the  sewers in which government decisions are stuck." He considers  television to be a yellow media: "Do people pay their fees for  this?" almost amounts to a call for civil disobedience. The  overt deprecation of independent bodies, especially those aimed  at setting limits and defining what is permissible and what not,  has gradually resulted in a "Nixonian rule" in the Prime  Minister's Office, which considers itself to be an imperial  structure disconnected from all the other power structures, and  whose main aim is self-preservation.    What one perceives at the present time is an extremely  pressured Rabin. Perhaps Rabin is beginning to suffer from the  syndrome of the leader who senses he has reached a dead end.  This is not the first time: Only Menahem Begin, as leader of  Herut, was able to give up the entire Sinai and to demolish  settlements in exchange for a breakthrough in the peace process  with Egypt -- after which he exhausted himself. Only Rabin,  with the security aura attached to his name, could recognize the  PLO and 'Arafat and implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho.  Perhaps, however, Rabin -- like Begin at the time -- has made  all the concessions he is capable of or wiling to make. Perhaps  deep down inside he knows that he has exhausted his potential.  This is why he is coming down on everybody like a yo-yo in the  land of monkeys' uncles.</p>

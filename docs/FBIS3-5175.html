			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, in  his capacity as chairman of the International Competitiveness  Enhancing Committee, disclosed that during its meeting yesterday  the committee reviewed the first chapter of the Industry  Ministry's white paper on Thailand's competitors and their trade  and marketing strategies.    Suphachai quoted the white paper as saying that China,  Indonesia, Mexico, and Korea are Thailand's major trade  competitors. Thailand has not yet lost its market share to these  countries, however, but certainly will in the future if it  remains idle and makes no further improvement.    The meeting also discussed potential markets for Thai  products and Thailand's dominance in different markets.    Suphachai talked about his recent visit to Israel and  several  issues that were discussed, particularly bilateral cooperation  in third country markets. At present, Israel is the only  country which has received trade privileges from the United  States, the European Union, and NAFTA. Suphachai said: "Israel  can send its goods to these markets without having to comply  with the quota system or facing tax barriers. For this reason,  Thailand will try to send its goods to those markets through  Israel. By so doing, the prices of Thai exports will have to be  increased by 35 percent."</p>

The  negotiators will discuss the security arrangements both in the  Gaza Strip and Hebron in view of the grave and explosive  situation in these two occupied areas.    Citing sources close to the negotiations, MENA says that no  agreement has been reached concerning the security arrangements  or the international protection in Hebron. The Palestinian  leadership has not responded to the proposals presented to it  after the round of negotiations that continued until early  today, MENA reports.    MENA also learned that the Palestinian side has proposed  that  100 international observers and 130 Palestinian policemen be  deployed in Hebron. But the Israeli side turned down the  proposal, MENA added.</p>

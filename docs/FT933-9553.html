			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swissair loss deepens to SFr125m at halfway SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, said its first-half loss widened to SFr125m (Dollars 82.7m), compared with a loss of SFr116m in the same period last year. Profit before depreciation tumbled to SFr60m from SFr81m, and the company said it would be difficult to meet its forecast of achieving a profit this year. Traffic volume improved 9.5 per cent and the overall load factor rose from 59.3 per cent to 62.5 per cent. However, revenues advanced only 2 per cent to SFr2.47bn. Swissair said the figures reflected 'the troubled state of the world's air transport industry, which remains plagued by a ruinous price war'. The company foresaw no improvement in revenues in the second half, and was continuing to concentrate on cutting costs. Costs rose 3 per cent in the first half, to SFr2.4bn, mainly because of fuel price increases. Depreciation charges were down from SFr197m to SFr185m. Swissair depreciates its aircraft rapidly and sells them while still relatively new. In recent years, only the proceeds from aircraft sales, which are booked at the year-end, have kept the group in profit. The airline said it had already recorded 'sizeable book profits' on aircraft sales this year.</p>

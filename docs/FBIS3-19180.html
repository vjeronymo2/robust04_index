			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with correspondent Bernard Volker by announcer </F> Claire Chazal--recorded]    [Text] [Chazal] On 18 February, we told you that the  Sarajevo market massacre, in which 68 people were killed on 5  January, had been provoked by a shell fired from Bosnian  Government lines. Correspondent Bernard Volker at the time gave  us details of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] report, and said  that Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference on former  Yugoslavia, had sent letters informing European foreign  ministers of the results of this enquiry. We can now show you  this confidential letter. This text confirms what we told you on  18 February. At the time, our report had been denied by the  United Nations.    [Volker] Let us first look at the text that I saw and which  we have filmed for you: Lord Owen, former British foreign  minister, represents Europe at the conference on former  Yugoslavia, which he chairs together with Mr. Stoltenberg, the  UN representative. On the evening of 12 February, Lord Owen  sent European foreign ministers copies of the confidential  report.    We have obtained access to the report. Here is paragraph 7,  which addresses the question of the 5 February Sarajevo attack.  Lord Owen says, I quote: 7. The Serbs, it appears, will not  give up their claim to part of Sarajevo. I fear the Serbs are  ready to sit tight and wait to see what happens in Sarajevo.  The Serbs expect the UN ballistic experts to confirm the story  about leaked UNPROFOR documents carried in TANJUG (datelined  Sarajevo, 8 February) about the shell that provoked the tragedy  in Sarajevo's open market. The spot from where it was fired  is some 1 to 1.5 kilometers inside the territory under Muslim  control, measured from the demarcation line with the RS  [Republika Srpska] army positions. This fact was confirmed  tonight for TANJUG by highly reliable and confidential sources  within UNPROFOR's HQ who wished to remain anonymous, and it was  also stated in the report by UNPROFOR's commission of experts  that conducted an investigation. The report was sent this  morning to the UN HQ in New York.    [Chazal] This confirms the information we had earlier given,  even though it had not at the time been confirmed by the United  Nations.    [Volker] According to this text sent by Lord Owen, which you  have just seen, the report outlining the conclusions of  UNPROFOR's inquiry was sent on the morning of 12 February to UN  headquarters, therefore to Mr. Butrus-Ghali. That was two days  after NATO had issued its ultimatum to the Serbs to force them  to lift the siege of Sarajevo. It was a truth that was rather  inconvenient at the time. The international community, Europe,  had for the first time managed to come to a real, firm decision  in Yugoslavia, and lifting the siege of Sarajevo was a priority.  That meant that our report had to be denied. The official UN  version was that it was impossible to say with certainty where  the shell had been fired from.    [Chazal] Can we be sure of the authenticity of this  document?    [Volker] I am certain of it. I had it in my hands just now.  I myself photocopied paragraph 7, which you saw a moment ago.  I noted the identification codes, which show with certainty  that this is a confidential document reserved for foreign  ministers.    [Chazal] Can you tell us who gave you this document?    [Volker] You know, since 18 February, this report was  confirmed to us, to you Claire, to me, to other journalists from  TF1, both in France and abroad, by several leading figures who  are in a position to be very well-informed. They asked to  remain anonymous. We will therefore not reveal their  identities. The truth is in fact often neither pleasant nor  convenient. I think that we nevertheless have a duty to say  what we know, having thoroughly checked the reliability of our  sources, and while maintaining professional confidentiality.</p>

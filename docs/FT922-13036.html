			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Stopgap offices open THOUSANDS OF City workers arrived yesterday at unfamiliar offices to try to ensure business carried on as normal after Friday's IRA bomb had damaged their familiar workplaces. 'It's an odd feeling to wake up in the morning and not knowing where you are going to work,' said Mr Hugh Scott, assistant secretary of Fosfa, a trading association for commodities' brokers and a refugee from the third floor of the wrecked Baltic Exchange. 'The bomb has put things in perspective for me,' he said. 'All those deadlines that seemed so important have passed without comment. It is going to be very difficult to pick things up again. 'At the moment we cannot access our fax machine, telephones or address system. We are out of touch with 600 member companies.' Ingenuity and effort over the weekend meant most displaced workers had somewhere to go. Up to 100 staff of James Capel, the securities house, worked through the weekend to construct a replacement dealing room from scratch. Commercial Union, the insurance company worst hit by the blast, was trading as normal. James Capel installed phones, computers and office furniture in spare premises on Devonshire Square in time to provide a full dealing service by 7am yesterday. The Stock Exchange loaned 35 Topic screens carrying its share dealing information service while Reuters provided trading screens and the Midland Bank offered office equipment including fax machines, desks and chairs. 'Everyone was incredibly co-operative,' said Mr Peter Letley, finance director. 'I really don't know who paid.' All Capel's 1,000 employees were called on Sunday night and told whether and where to go yesterday. The settlement department moved to the Devonshire Square site, but many staff were allowed back into Bevis Marks. 'Both buildings are running smoothly,' said Mr Letley. 'We should be back to normal by Wednesday. Our clients have been very supportive. One faxed me to congratulate us and send best wishes to the staff.' The Baltic Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering and more than half of world-wide ship sales, was even able to publish last night its Baltic Freight Index, the futures index recognised worldwide as a barometer of the freight market. Mr Peter Tudball, the exchange chairman, said: 'There has been no business lost on the London market. In fact, I think more people have been using the London market today because of this tragic incident than probably would have done last week.' Other companies took a variety of steps to continue operating. Staff from Shaw &amp; Croft, the solicitors, moved yesterday to the Great Eastern Hotel, and will transfer later in the week to premises in Gracechurch Street which they will occupy for three to six months. In the wine bars and coffee shops of the City yesterday, all talk was of the effects of the blast. One broker - whose business had not been affected - said: 'Hitler could not shake the spirit of the City and it will take more than a few bombs from the IRA.' A receptionist from St Paul Fire and Marine Insurance, which was operating in damaged premises on Lime Street, said: 'It is frightening. All the bomb scares make me very apprehensive. I am just wondering where the next one will be. But I will carry on business as normal - you can't let them stop you.' The regional director of a major UK clearing bank, puffing on his cigar, said cynically: 'I have seen it before, hurricanes, train strikes and so on. It will be the Dunkirk spirit for a day and then it will all die down. We need to capitalise on it today to get the bulk of the work done.' One office-less executive added angrily: 'Whatever the IRA do they are not going to threaten the viability of London as a major financial centre. It will continue to make a valuable contribution to the invisible earnings of the UK.' Mr David Swinglad, an employee with Trinity Insurance, located opposite the Commercial Union building, said: 'I had a window on my desk when I came in this morning, so I just changed desks and hoovered up and carried on.'</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUARTZ HILL CLINCHES A TIE FOR TITLE  </P> <P> On a brisk Friday night at Palmdale High, Quartz Hill smelled a Golden League  title.  </P> <P> And Palmdale was the worse for it.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill scored 35 second-half points in annihilating Palmdale, 49-7. The  win gave the Rebels a share of the league title and also status as the league's  No. 1 representative for the playoffs.  </P> <P> Palmdale, as it turned out, was just getting in the way. Before garbage time in  the final minutes, the Falcons had posted just one first down, and that came on  Anthony Ortega's 63-yard touchdown run, the game's first score.  </P> <P> After that, the deluge.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill (7-2, 4-0 in league play) scored on a 14-yard pass from Jake Haro  (four of 10 passes, 123 yards, two touchdowns) to Rob Keller with seven seconds  to play in the half. That gave Quartz Hill a 14-7 lead and the necessary  emotion to dust Palmdale (3-6, 2-2) in the second half.  </P> <P> "It really hurt them when we scored right before the half," Quartz Hill Coach  John Albee said. "That gave us a lot of emotion in our locker room."  </P> <P> Haro opened the second-half scoring with a 48-yard pass to David Nelson, who  was so wide open it appeared that he had jumped off the sideline and joined the  game somewhere down the field. Palmdale never recovered.  </P> <P> Quartz Hill's Erik Thomas joined in the fun, scoring three second-half  touchdowns and finishing the night with a game-high 147 yards rushing in 20  carries.  </P> <P> Nelson rushed for 79 yards as the Rebels piled up 440 yards total.  </P> <P> Excluding Ortega's 63-yard run, Palmdale gained just 37 yards.  </P> <P> "I think after the first touchdown of the second half they weren't the same  football team," Albee said.  </P> <P> Which was surprising, considering the emotion that Palmdale brought into the  game. After Ortega's run, Coach Kent Bothwell pumped his fists in the air as he  ran onto the field.  </P> <P> But Quartz Hill struck back after a key interception by Selves Smith at the  Palmdale 20-yard line. Three plays later, Haro stole in from the one. But the  kick failed and Palmdale stayed in front, 7-6.  </P> <P> Palmdale could muster little more against a Quartz Hill defense that has been  among the area's best all season.  </P> <P> This is the first Golden League championship for Quartz Hill since the school  shared a title in 1981. What remains is a game with Antelope Valley for the  Rebels to finish with a spotless league mark. Nevertheless, they will be the  league's top-seeded team.  </P> <P> Meaning?  </P> <P> "You think this was cold?" Albee said, referring to temperatures in the  low-40s. "Wait till two weeks from now, when it drops to about 30 degrees.  That's why I want that CIF game up here in two weeks."  </P></p>

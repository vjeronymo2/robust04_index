			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Letter: Minister defends science plans against 'caricature' Sir, David Sawers' article (Personal View, June 22) bears little relationship to the Technology Foresight Programme or to the other policies announced in the government's recent white paper. Mr Sawers claims the government is adopting the methods of the central planner in relation to government research expenditure. This is not the case. The purpose of Technology Foresight is to bring together scientists and working industrialists to share views about emerging generic technologies and market opportunities. The results of the partnership will be a greater common understanding of trends. Research councils will then be able to take strategic decisions on their research portfolios, against the background of the results of their programme. Individual firms and organisations will decide for themselves what use they wish to make of the results. Mr Sawers claims Technology Foresight usurps the role of the market economy. But it is not concerned with the commercial exploitation of products, but with generic technologies with wide applications across several sectors. It is inherently unlikely that a technique introduced to the US by President Reagan's administration would be inimical to the market. Mr Sawers claims the government is sacrificing excellence in basic science for utilitarian research. Not so. The research councils and Higher Education Funding Councils will continue to look for excellence when allocating funds for research. But no country can afford to fund all the basic research its scientists would ideally like to undertake. David Sawers describes technology foresight as a largely untried technique. I doubt if colleagues in the US, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Australia would agree. These countries have found foresight useful in helping them identify key generic technologies. The government clearly has a majority role in funding basic research, where the market will not necessarily supply what is needed. But circumstances can arise in strategic or generic research where market forces do not work satisfactorily and investments in research and development offering a good return to the nation will not go ahead without some public support. The policies set out in the white paper are far removed from those caricatured in Mr Sawers' article. We accept the importance of basic research, and the government's role as its main funder. There is nothing prescriptive in the white paper - which has been widely welcomed - about the emphasis on partnership between the science and engineering base and industry.

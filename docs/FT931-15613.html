			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Personal View: Italy fudges privatisation In recent weeks the Italian government has won approval from parliament for the privatisation of four state-owned holding companies - Iri, Eni, Enel and Ina. Each of these giants is an industrial or public services sector leader and, respectively, they embrace oil supply, refinery and distribution, electrical energy, and insurance. However, a closer look reveals that this is not a real privatisation process. In 1991, the global group turnover of Iri, Eni and Enel exceeded Pounds 67bn, but the net income was scarcely Pounds 450m and financial debts were Pounds 50bn. Employees totalled 650,000, thus accounting for 3.6 per cent of Italy's total workforce. In 1992, the performance of all these companies worsened. Meanwhile, the Ina insurance group's net premium was Pounds 2.3bn in that year. In the 20 years to 1990, the growth of the Italian economy was among the highest in the western world, second only to Japan in the Group of Seven. This spectacular growth was supported by a massive injection of public funds into the economy which helped to overcome the energy crisis and to keep the economy growing during the most severe world slumps. At the same time, though, it created the headache of an enormous public debt, requiring a debt-service cost of more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product per year. Simultaneously, an industrial structure grew up resembling that of a developing country rather than that of the US or Germany. For example, small and medium-sized firms account for the great bulk of Italian industrial production. Only seven Italian companies (Iri, Eni and a few other private companies) are included in the Fortune 500 world list, as compared with 43 in the UK. The present management of the companies controlled by Iri, Eni, Enel and Ina has a strong political orientation - particularly towards the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. The former has been present in government for the last 45 years without interruption, and has required management to pursue both technical and political goals. As a consequence, the political influence of management has grown to a point where it is able to obtain unusually favourable financial and legislative choices from parliament and government. Since parliament and government act on behalf of the companies' stockholder - the state  - the management's stockholder relationship has become contrary to normal practice. In recent weeks, Italy may seem to have been influenced by the wave of privatisation sweeping the rest of Europe. However, the Italian government merely wishes to strengthen the state-owned corporations and collect new risk capital through partial privatisation, without selling companies to private industrial investors, or liberalising monopolistic services. In other words, the government wishes to maintain state shareholding control, as does management, which is strongly opposed to complete privatisation. In the UK or the US, privatisation is partial when a public entity retains ownership of assets or infrastructure while operation and maintenance are carried out by private interests. In Italy, partial privatisation mostly means that a shareholder, such as Iri or Eni, sells a minority holding in its subsidiaries to private investors who have no interest in company administration or management. This explains why the Italian treasury minister is currently looking for partners among Arab investors, with the approval of the present management. The only complete privatisations in Italy are to be the sale of the Iri bank, Credito Italiano, and the Eni mechanical company, Nuovo Pignone. As such, they will be of interest to British investors. They also explain why the same minister is coming to London this week. The Italian government cannot be expected to do much better with its privatisation programme, for it is still based on the political alliance between the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, both of which are losing votes with every election and are traditionally suspicious of the private sector. Moreover, the government is precarious and somewhat weaker than the management opposing it. For this reason, a precondition of any real privatisation process in Italy will be a wholesale change in politics. A new government will be able to liberalise public services and sell ownership of state companies only if it is based on forces, or groups of people, free from old Christian Democrat and Socialist power. There are in Italy some liberal political groups and new growing forces which have condemned the old alliance and wish to break their exclusive right to control the supply of goods, services and politics. These groups and forces favour the reduction of public expenditure, the opening of all markets to small and medium-sized firms, and the linking of pay to performance. As the government is currently in financial difficulties, the wholesale change may be achieved more rapidly than people think.

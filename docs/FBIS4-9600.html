			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Banja Luka, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Republic of  Croatia is by all accounts intensively preparing for an imminent  attack on the Serb positions in Posavina, the press center of  the republic of Srpska army's First Krajina Corps said in a  statement today, citing well-informed sources. Croatia's army  has recently accumulated units and military equipment in  Posavina, on the left bank of the River Sava, mainly in the  wider areas of Slavonski Brod and Zupanja. According to the  same source, large numbers of Croats and Muslims from Posavina  are members of these units, and some new units have also been  founded. [passage omitted]    The press center notes that Croatian media have recently  carried an increasing number of "reports" about the Serbian  side's preparations for attacks against the Croatian positions  in Posavina. This is a typical form of media preparations: an  attempt to condemn the Serbian side in advance before strong  Croatian-Muslim attacks begin. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: RHYME THE BEASTIE WAY: STRONG, CLEAN, FUNNY;  </P> <P> THE BEASTIE BOYS "PAUL'S BOUTIQUE." CAPITOL *** 1/2  </P> <P> Rap is what you hear pounding from boom boxes. Metal is what you hear blasting  from '74 Camaros. The first Beastie Boys LP, "Licensed to Ill," was essentially  an awesome metal-rap hybrid -- Run-DMC wrote some of the rhymes, a guy from  Slayer played some of the guitar. The album didn't cross over as much as it  appealed to two distinct audiences: KDAY and KROQ both played the heck out of  it, although each station played different cuts.  </P> <P> Though the hard-core aesthetics are similar, metal basically serves the  function for white teen-agers (KROQ) that rap does for black ones (KDAY), which  is why you never saw the surge in white rap so many people predicted after  "Ill" went to No. 1. The would-be Big Daddy Kanes turned out mostly to be  would-be Metallicas.  </P> <P> "Ill" was produced by Rick Rubin, who more or less invented the rap-metal  thing. "Paul's Boutique," the new one, was produced by the Hollywood dance-club  phenoms called the Dust Brothers, roughly the team who gave Tone Loc's beats  their distinctive, shuffling sound. The low-tech amalgam of sly '70s soul here  is funky as can be.  </P> <P> The bratty Beasties from "Ill" still aren't what you'd call redemptive -- on  this one, they rap about egg fights, impersonate various armed drifters and  feature that thingamajig that moos like a cow when you turn it over -- but when  they go into the Dead End Kid riff, it at least sounds like self-parody now,  and they've resumed the use of their real names. (Horovitz isn't the easiest  name to rhyme, but they manage.) The rhymes are strong and clean and funny:  "You're all mixed up like pasta primavera/Why do you throw that chair at  Geraldo Rivera?

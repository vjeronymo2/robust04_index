			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Pact heads off pay crisis for French jobless FRANCE'S unemployment pay system was temporarily rescued from impending bankruptcy over the weekend by a hard-fought accord between French employers and a majority of trade unions. The Patronat employers' organisation and three of France's five main trade unions agreed to raise contributions to Unedic, the unemployment pay body, by a shared 0.8 per cent, and reduce payouts to those out of work for more than four months. Payments from Unedic, which is funded entirely by companies and their employees, would have dried up from October without the accord, which runs until the end of next year. The deal will save FFr25bn (Pounds 2.56bn) by then, easily clearing Unedic's more than FFr15bn deficit, said negotiators. The Communist-led CGT, France's largest trade union, refused to sign the deal on the grounds that workers and the unemployed were being asked to shoulder too much of the cost of the rescue. The FO union, which founded Unedic with the employers in 1958, reserved judgment. Despite the union split, the compromise deal is binding. The fruit of more than a month's negotiations, it culminated in an all-night bargaining session ending on Saturday morning. The talks have been followed closely by the government, which is powerless to intervene directly but eager to avoid worsening the plight of nearly 3m unemployed. The rise in contributions will be split equally, 0.4 per cent each way, between employers and workers. The 0.8 rise lasts until the end of the year, when the extra payment reduces to 0.5 per cent for the following six months and then falls again to 0.4 per cent until the end of December 1993, by when employers and unions will review the deal. From August, individual payouts will drop by 17 per cent from the fourth month out of work and again every subsequent four months.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRIME-TIME FLICKS  </P> <P> Explorers (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.), a 1985 kids-in-space adventure with the  euphonious team of Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, has some of the antic wit and  frenzied visual imagination director Joe Dante pumped into the Gremlins movies  but, at the end, it turns into a crazy sundae with the nuts on top: a space  cartoon climax full of nyark-nyark goofiness.  </P></p>

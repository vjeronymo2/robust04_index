Fearing that something  similar might happen in Tajikistan, Moscow has decided to  preempt the events, and on the night of March 4 Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin left for Iran to conduct  talks with the Tajik opposition. The purpose of the mission is  to persuade the opponents of the current Tajik leader, Emomali  Rakhmanov, to sit down at a "roundtable" of national  reconciliation.    Moscow's rush to reconcile the Tajiks is entirely explicable  -- the preservation of "social peace" in Tajikistan has cost  Russia dear. As early as last September, during Andrey  Kozyrev's visit to Dushanbe, the Russian foreign minister  recommended that the Tajik authorities agree to a dialogue with  that part of the opposition "holding a constructive stance."  Your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent has been told at the  Russian Foreign Ministry that at present the Tajiks are closer  to a dialogue than ever before. In fact, what remains is to  determine the location and the lineup of participants in the  "roundtable."    Currently, Moscow is also pinning hopes on Tehran's  assistance. A couple of years ago, the Iranians, drawing on  their close linguistic and cultural ties with the Tajiks, tried  to reconcile them without Russia so as to get certain dividends.  Tehran leaders have fairly quickly learned, however, that there  is no "struggle of the Muslims against the infidels" in  Tajikistan: The conflict has a clan bottom-line. Having  realized that its mediation has been in vain, Tehran recognized  Moscow's interests in Tajikistan and suggested that they act  together. Russia, for its part, relies on pragmatic Iranian  leaders, who are more concerned over the maintenance of peace  along the Iranian borders than the export of the Islamic  revolution. As they are not interested in escalating tensions  inside Afghanistan, these politicians may have certain influence  on pro-Iranian groups deployed in the area of the Tajik-Afghan  border (particularly those taking orders from Afghan President  Borhanoddin Rabbani or the Islamic Unity Party). Although the  question of how willing the field commanders are to pay heed to  Tehran's advice is still open, Mr. Adamishin is going to discuss  with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati the  possibility of coordinating the two countries' efforts to  stabilize the situation on the border.</p>

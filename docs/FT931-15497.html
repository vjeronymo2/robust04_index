			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Swiss acquire 11.9% holding in HunterPrint A SWISS Company has taken an 11.9 per cent stake in HunterPrint through the specialist printer's refinancing exercise. The share price rose 7p yesterday, closing at 50p - the same level as the placing price in December's Pounds 18.3m rescue issue. Ferag, which has supplied binding machinery to HunterPrint's Corby factory, becomes the largest shareholder with 6.9m shares. Its interest in the UK group, which lost Pounds 12.2m pre-tax last year, is described as friendly. Ferag is one of several new shareholders to emerge following the rescue issue, HunterPrint's second in two years. The first involved Sir Ian MacGregor, who was ousted as chairman in August. The take-up of December's issue by established investors was only 22 per cent. (*) The proceeds were mainly devoted to reducing lease obligations on printing machinery at the Corby factory. The lessors, who took part in the ordinary share placing, also received Pounds 5.2m of new convertible preference shares. Through the placing, three leasing companies have gained stakes of between 3 and 4 per cent. They are Summit Leasing, W &amp; G Equipment Leasing and Norwich Union Equipment Finance. The total number of shares held by these and three other leasing companies is 7.7m, or 13.3 per cent. In the refinancing Barclays agreed a new credit facility of Pounds 14.9m. (* A further 31.1m shares were taken up under the terms of a placing, 12.3m of them by established shareholders who therefore in total took 52.9 per cent of the new shares. A further 27.8 per cent were taken up by new investors and 19.3 per cent by lessors.)</p>

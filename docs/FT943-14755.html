			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (6): The honeymoon is over - Privatised companies are losing popularity Argentina's far-reaching privatisation programme is not popular with everybody. 'Public telephones are not working. You have a dual system so you need two types of phone-cards. Phones are being provided faster but we are paying outrageous rates that I think are the highest in the world,' complains Atilio Boron, director of the Centre for European-Latin American Research in Buenos Aires. He thinks dissatisfaction with privatised companies is already rebounding on to the government and its market-oriented economic reforms. 'My feeling is that the honeymoon is over because the model is not delivering the goods.' Given the state of the telephone system and other public services before privatisation, some may think the inconvenience of buying two phone cards is not too much to bear. Many feel the collapse of the public services before privatisation took a lot of the heat out of the arguments over privatisation. Argentines suffered six months of daily power cuts in 1989. 'The electrical crisis provided a dose of reality in the ideological debate,' says Gustavo Petracchi, president of the electricity distribution company Edesur. And the government, which was pouring more than Dollars 2bn a year in subsidies into the nationalised companies during the 1980s, has so far no regrets. According to a just-published study on Latin American productivity by the management consultants, McKinsey, overall productivity in the Argentine telecommunications industry had shown a great improvement after the 1990 privatisation, even by 1992. But at 55 per cent of US levels, total factor productivity was the lowest of the five Latin countries it surveyed. This, it says, is due to 'a chaotic situation' which previously prevailed, but agrees that telephone charges in Argentina are 'very high'. Faustino Rivero, chairman of Telefonica de Argentina, one of the two companies about which Mr Boron complains, says his company has put in 700,000 lines in 3 1/2 years, an increase of 40 per cent since it took over. Not only that, the company - whose region cost the state Dollars 400m in subsidies in 1990 - is paying taxes. Efficiency increases have been significant elsewhere: deregulation in the oil and gas sector and privatisation of the former oil monopoly YPF has helped the country's oil production to rise from 420,000 barrels per day in 1991 to 650,000 bpd now. Jose Estenssoro, president and chief executive, says YPF alone increased oil output from 289,000 bpd in 1992 to 326,000 bpd last year. 'We are trying to reach 450,000-500,000 bpd of oil by the end of next year and probably another 200,000 in oil equivalent of gas.' He says the company's workforce - 52,000 strong in 1990 - will have been slimmed down to about 6,000 by the end of this year. But the transition to privatisation has not been easy, not least for many of the foreign utilities that are operating the privatised companies. Metrogas, the gas company covering metropolitan Buenos Aires in which British Gas has an important stake, was plagued along with other gas companies with problems of low pressure last year, the first year of privatisation. Transportation capacity was inadequate to cope with demand last winter. This winter, says Rob Verrion, general manager of Metrogas, the company has expanded capacity - and will expand it further - and the complaints about low pressure have fallen. This was not the only problem. The standard of local contractors left much to be desired. As well as encouraging some local contractors to improve working standards, new contractors are moving in from abroad, including a subsidiary of the UK construction group Amec, an important contractor for British Gas. Dissatisfied with their invoicing contractor, Metrogas switched its entire database from one system to another overnight 'in what can be best described as a commando operation'. Without a good database it was impossible to put together effective credit controls - particularly important in a country with 'a history of not paying invoices for public services', says Mr Verrion. 'It's not everybody and it's not necessarily the poor people,' he adds. Stealing gas is one issue faced by the gas companies, but for the electricity companies, the problem of fraud was worse. Gustavo Petracchi, president of the distribution company, Edesur in which Chilean investors have an important stake, says that, when it took over, 26 per cent of the company's electricity was being stolen. 'The losses of energy through fraud in greater Buenos Aires alone could provide power for the city of Cordoba - which has 1m people,' he says. Fraud from Edesur has now been cut back to below 20 per cent, and by the end of the year should be 17 per cent. Mr Petracchi complains that the problem could have been tackled earlier if it had not been for political intervention by the province of Buenos Aires in early 1993. Since May, an agreement has been in place to allow the issue to be confronted. But at least Mr Petracchi avoided the difficulties of its neighbouring distributor. In May last year, a judge ordered the arrest of Angel Zapalorto, a manager at Edenor, after he cut off power to slums to stop illegal tapping into the electricity network. Mr Zapalorto spent 72 hours in jail before being released. The companies also suffered from internal fraud. Mr Petracchi said the workforce was 'riddled with corruption both open and hidden, and not only in the purchasing department'. Morale was low and still has not recovered, while the number on the payroll has dropped from 7,600 to 4,500. Workers laid off have received pay-offs averaging Dollars 30,000. Both gas and electricity companies have also received fines from their regulators. The companies have been unhappy about this, since they believe that allowances should be made for the dilapidation of the systems before they took over. 'We have a late 20th century regulatory model imposed on a gas system built in the early to middle part of the century,' says Mr Verrion at Metrogas. As the World Bank notes in its 1994 World Development Report: 'Although privatisation has occurred rapidly, the capacity for regulatory oversight has lagged.' Yet now that the regulators are showing their teeth, there remain concerns, even among impartial observers, that the regulatory bodies are excessively politicised.</p>

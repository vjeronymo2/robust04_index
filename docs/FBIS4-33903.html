			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Doing Radio" newscast] </F>   [Text] Over 10,000 efficiency assemblies have been held in  the country, it was stated by CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]  Secretary General Pedro Ross in a meeting with a delegation of  the All-China Federation of Trade Unions that is currently  visiting Cuba.    Ross, who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba  [PCC] politburo, explained to the labor union leaders of the  friendly nation that the assembly process is a result of the  Cuban workers' decision that labor unions become directly  involved in the solution of problems at their enterprises in  particular and the country in general.    Ross' statement was given at the Medical Biophysics Research  Center, a leading institution in Santiago de Cuba's scientific  sector that is in charge of manufacturing equipment for medical  diagnoses and research on diseases through the use of nuclear  magnetic resonance.    Xiao Zhenbang, a member of the PRC delegation, congratulated  the workers for their achievments, and he urged them to continue  their vital research for the development of the island's  pharmaceutical and medical industry.</p>

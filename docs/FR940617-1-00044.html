			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency also agrees with the comment which stated that it was an unproven hypothesis that overuse of an antiseptic causes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  overgrowth. The ``Summary for Basis of Approval'' from an approved NDA for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) cites a skin flora study that indicated that the axilla was an area where gram-negative micro-organisms continued to be isolated even though chlorhexidine gluconate has shown gram-negative effectiveness. The comment cited FDA's Division of Anti-Infective Drug Products' recognition that for health-care uses, such as surgical scrub and health-care personnel handwash, there would be no problem with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  overgrowth because the hands are an area of the body not likely to support the growth of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because of the lack of moisture. In defending triclosan, the comment contended that this ingredient is bacteriostatic and does not eliminate all gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it would not predispose for gram-negative overgrowth. Triclosan has been implicated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  contamination because it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria, has limited in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-negative bacteria, and no activity against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (43 FR 1210 at 1232). One report showed that triclosan was effective against some gram-negative micro-organisms, but not effective against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Serratia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Ref. 11).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Serratia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  resistance caused the contamination, not overuse of the antiseptic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency agrees with the comments that quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan have been implicated in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  hospital infections more frequently than povidone-iodine, but studies indicate that `overuse' of these or any antimicrobial has not been the cause.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  species may become dominant because of inherent resistant factors which enable them to survive the effects of many antibiotics and antiseptics (Refs. 12, 13, and 14). In addition, this genus is ubiquitous, found in both soil and water, and can multiply in almost any moist environment with even a trace of organic material (Ref. 15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that the data and reports have not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care antiseptics, including benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, have brought about overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria, particularly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The agency agrees with the comments that improper use, failure of hospital personnel to use according to labeling indications, nonaseptic technique in diluting and handling, and lack of good quality control to ensure sterility of items in contact with antiseptics, such as sterile distilled water, hosing, and receptacles, are responsible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3) shows that repeated in vitro exposure of seven gram-negative micro-organisms, including  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. aeruginosa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in povidone-iodine dilutions did not result in the development of resistance. The agency notes that CDC previously recommended povidone-iodine for use in intravenous catheter and other procedures (Ref. 2). However, there has been one report from CDC (Ref. 16) which described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pseudomonas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  hospital infections caused by intrinsically contaminated povidone-iodine (contaminated during manufacture, indicating failure of control of microbiological contamination). Compliance with the agency's regulations governing current good manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR part 211) should prevent intrinsic contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the agency concludes that a cautionary statement against overuse is not needed in the professional labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. Therefore, the previously proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a) is not being included in this tentative final monograph. If new information indicates a need for a cautionary statement, the agency will consider appropriate action at that time.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

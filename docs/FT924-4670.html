			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dutch put the wraps on the competition - The latest merger in the paper industry The creation of Europe's second largest paper and packaging group through the merger of three Dutch paper groups, Koninklijke KNP (KNP), Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG-Groep, is the latest example of consolidation within the industry. Swedish companies have been particularly active in consolidation during the last three years. SCA, Europe's biggest, acquired Reedpack of the UK for Pounds 1.1bn (Dollars 1.66bn), while Stora, Europe's largest paper group, bought Feldmuhle Nobel of Germany. Meanwhile, Kymmene of Finland acquired La Chapelle-Darblay, France's main producer of newsprint, and Arjomari-Prioux, the French group, merged with Wiggins Teape Appleton, the Anglo-US company. The consolidation is being partly driven by the need to build increasingly large plants. A world-scale competitive paper plant now has a capacity of at least 200,000 tonnes a year and sometimes more than 300,000 tonnes, explains Mr Denis Christie, paper, pulp and packaging analyst at James Capel. Each 100,000 tonnes of capacity costs about Pounds 100m, so competitive mills are only available for all but the largest groups. In addition, paper groups need to be larger to serve the entire European market. Mr Klaas de Kluis, the chairman of VRG and future vice-chairman of the new company, said that the group needed wide geographic coverage to meet the servicing and distribution needs of thousands of small to medium-size printers and other customers throughout Europe. A more immediate trigger for yesterday's merger announcement may have been the bleak outlook for the sector. Massive overcapacity and slowing growth rates in most paper grades have hit European prices and margins. The merger is also partly defensive: KNP has been the object of considerable interest from other groups, including Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British company. The three merger partners were at pains yesterday to emphasise that the link-up would produce a powerful new Dutch industrial grouping. This will undoubtedly prove popular in the Netherlands, where worries have arisen recently over the sale of industrial 'crown jewels' to foreign buyers, such as the planned sale of a 51 per cent in Fokker, the aircraft maker, to Daimler-Benz of Germany. The Netherlands, with its weak anti-monopoly tradition, is unlikely to raise objections to the mooted deal. However, the attitude of the European Commissions' merger task force will be more important and sceptical than that of the Dutch authorities. According to some analysts, the combined group will dominate as much as 90 per cent of the European solid board market, used to package fruit and similar products. The merged company will be by far the largest paper merchanting group in Europe. It will also be Europe's biggest producer of coated papers, inheriting the position built up by KNP in one of the fastest growing areas of the paper market, and it will also hold commanding positions in certain sectors of the cardboard packaging market. Europe accounts for 80 per cent of the turnover of both BT and VRG, while 90 per cent of KNP's annual production is sold on European markets. The groups say they have an annual paper and packaging turnover of Fl 13bn (Dollars 7.23bn), compared with Fl 15.3bn at Stora, Fl 10.1bn at SCA and Fl 8.2bn at Arjo Wiggins. The company will have two businesses of roughly equal size. The first is an industrial group bringing together KNP and Buhrmann's paper and packaging manufacturing operations. The second is a trading and distribution group comprising all Buhrmann and VRG's activities in the fields of graphic paper and graphic systems distribution, as well as information systems and office products. However, analysts expressed concern about the strategy behind the merger. 'It doesn't seem that logical given what the groups have said in the past,' says Mr Christie. He says Buhrmann had always said it was an independent paper merchanting company not tied to any one manufacturer. The concern is that other mills would be less willing to use the new company because they were KNP's competitors. Meanwhile, KNP appeared to have reversed its strategy of ridding itself of its paper merchanting arm which had previously been integrated into VRG. A further concern is the graphic equipment business. Buhrmann sells Heidelberg printing equipment in eight European countries, while VRG distributes products of its main rival MAN-Roland. Mr Mads Asprem, paper analyst at Morgan Stanley, says it is inconceivable the new company would be able to distribute both. Nevertheless, company officials played down suggestions that the German groups may seek alternative agents, noting that the Dutch companies' workforces were specially trained to install and repair the German equipment. At the same time, Buhrmann alone sells some 30 per cent of what Heidelberg produces, making a switch to another agent unlikely. The main benefits of the merger will be rationalisation, say analysts. 'This is a very bureaucratic structure. There is now a significant layer of management which needs to be cut to achieve synergies,' says Mr Christie at James Capel. Mr Asprem at Morgan Stanley says, 'Given there is no sign of an immediate turnround, the only way to improve margins is to cut costs.' However, the groups yesterday were anxious to play down the possible redundancies that might help them compete against the Swedish groups which have rationalised heavily in recent years.</p>

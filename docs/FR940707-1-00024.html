Shipping safety fairways and anchorages are established on the Outer Continental Shelf by the U.S. Coast Guard to provide unobstructed approaches for vessels using U.S. ports. This initiative arises as a result of requests by offshore oil companies for exemptions to the provisions of the rule because drilling and production technologies have greatly extended the range of deepwater drilling and the limits placed on temporary structures allowed within fairway boundaries may no longer be reasonable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be received on or before August 22, 1994.

This authority was extended to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by Section 4(f) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (67 Stat. 463; 43 U.S.C. 1333(f)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the cited authorities, the Corps promulgated regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 establishing shipping safety fairways in the Gulf of Mexico to provide obstruction-free routes for vessels in approaches to United States ports. The Corps provided these obstruction-free routes by denying permits for structures within certain designated lanes. In 1978, the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), was amended to delegate authority to the Department of Transportation and the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard to establish vessel routing measures, including fairways and fairway anchorages. In accordance with the PWSA, the Coast Guard completed the required studies and published final rules establishing shipping safety fairways on May 13, 1982. The Corps subsequently revoked its fairway regulations in &sect;209.135(d) but retained paragraph (b), which contained the conditions under which the nationwide permit for oil exploration and production structures on the OCS (33 CFR 330.5(a)(8)), was issued. On November 13, 1986, the fairway regulations were repromulgated in 33 CFR 322.5(l) to consolidate all permit regulations for structures in the same part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the regulations allowing temporary structures within fairways were promulgated by the Corps in 1981, deepwater drilling occurred in water depths of 300 to 600 feet. At that time, the limitation of 120 days that temporary anchors would be allowed within fairways was considered reasonable. If the exploratory well was successful, a conventional fixed production platform would be used and there would be no further need to maintain the anchors within the fairway. According to offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production companies, the existing technology has extended the range of deepwater drilling to water depths of 1,000 to 4,000 feet. As a result, drilling times have increased and production methods have changed. Today, the limitation on the length of time (120 days), that an anchor is allowed within a fairway is no longer appropriate, particularly in water depths in excess of 600 feet. The industry has available many different types of production platforms, including floating production systems that are anchored in place during the productive life of the reserves and then moved to a new location. In water depths greater than 600 feet, the floating production platform becomes an important production option and in water depths greater than 1,000 feet these units are essential. In many instances, the only obstacle to using this type of system to drill and produce hydocarbons is the location of a fairway. Current regulations require that the production system be placed a great distance from the fairway in order to keep the anchors clear of the fairway. The result is that there are many hydrocarbon bearing lease areas that cannot be effectively penetrated and produced. It should be noted that if one of the following proposals is adopted, the requirement that the rig must be situated as necessary to insure that the minimum clearance over an anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet, will not be changed, unless we find that an individual permit is required and the minimum clearance over an anchor line would be determined on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

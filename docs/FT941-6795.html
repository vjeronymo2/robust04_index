			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Repola back in the black Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, rebounded into the black last year after much improved performances from its main forestry and engineering activities. Profits after financial items were FM428m (Dollars 77m), against a FM810m deficit in 1992. The return to profit, after two years of losses, was mainly due to the weaker Finnish markka and a strong turnround at United Paper Mills, the forestry unit. Repola said the result was still unsatisfactory because of poor demand in Europe and high financing costs but its performance would improve this year due to lower debt and reduced interest expenses. Operating profits climbed to FM2.73bn from FM1.72bn on sales of FM25.3bn against FM23.7bn. Exchange losses wiped FM500m off the result, down from FM709m, while other financing costs were little changed at FM1.8bn. UPM contributed FM2.35bn to operating profits, benefiting from cost-cutting, lower wood prices and the start-up of a new paper mill. The unit's profit after financial items was FM1.20bn, equal to 7.3 per cent of net sales of FM16.4bn, compared with a loss of FM350m in 1992 on net sales of FM14.4bn. Operating profits at the Rauma engineering unit doubled to FM273m from FM136m.</p>

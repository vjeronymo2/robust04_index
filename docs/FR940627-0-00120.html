			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this rule, combustion emissions are the primary exhaust products of the combustion of a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in a motor vehicle engine and do not include secondary atmospheric transformation products. EPA recognizes that secondary air pollutants are a factor in the characterization of overall risks associated with F/FA emissions. However, it is not feasible to include this type of laboratory testing as a standard requirement at this time. When required in specific instances, transformation products will be addressed under Tier 3, as described in Section III.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, evaporative emission testing is to be performed for F/FAs meeting specific volatility criteria. While some commenters asked EPA to eliminate the evaporative emission testing from the program, today's rule maintains this requirement. EPA's decision is supported by the legislative history, which expresses the concerns of Congress about the public health impacts of emissions from both combustion and evaporative sources. Public exposure to evaporative emissions is still significant and, for many F/FAs, the toxicity of evaporative emissions as a whole mixture has not been characterized. Thus, this rule includes requirements for the characterization and biological testing of evaporative emissions in certain circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While combustion emissions are inevitable products of the engine combustion process, the significance of evaporative emissions depends on the type of F/FA product. As proposed in the NPRM, this final rule specifies criteria for determining the need for evaporative emission testing. For fuels that are supplied to motor vehicle engines by way of sealed containment and delivery systems, evaporative emissions testing is less important, since human and environmental exposure should be extremely low or nonexistent. Thus, evaporative emissions testing under this final rule would not apply to methane (compressed natural gas or liquified natural gas) or propane (liquified petroleum gas) formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For liquid F/FAs, the significance of vaporization varies widely, depending largely on the volatility of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. Thus, this final rule uses the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to determine its applicability for evaporative emissions testing. An RVP of 2.0 pounds per square inch (psi) is designated as the threshold for determining the need for evaporative emission testing for fuels. That is, fuels with RVP of 2.0 psi or greater are subject to the evaporative emissions testing requirements, while those with RVP less than 2.0 psi are excused from the evaporative emission testing requirements under Tier 1 and Tier 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to additives, the NPRM proposed to require evaporative emission testing if the RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture was increased by 0.1 psi or more in comparison with the RVP of the base fuel alone. However, methods for measurement of vapor pressure have a reproducibility of about 0.3 psi. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  To account for this limitation of measurement accuracy, especially when dealing with low pressure measurements, today's rule uses a 0.4 psi criterion (i.e., 0.1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.3) for additives. Accordingly, this final rule requires the evaporative emission testing of additives when the RVP of the associated fuel in the additive/base fuel mixture is increased by 0.4 psi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.0 psi or more. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  For example, an additive that causes an increase of 0.6 psi when mixed with a fuel with a vapor pressure of 1.0 psi (i.e., the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 1.6), need not be tested for evaporative emissions. On the other hand, an additive that causes an increase of 1.1 psi when mixed with a fuel with RVP of 1.0 psi is required to undergo evaporative emission testing because the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.1 psi. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``Standard Test Method for Vapor Pressure of Petroleum Products (Mini Method),'' ASTM D 5191&hyph;91. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement to test the evaporative emissions of a qualifying additive product do not apply if the manufacturer intends to satisfy the test requirements of the additive as part of a group, of which another member product or a base fuel serves as the group representative, and the manufacturer does not specifically test the additive apart from the group. See Section IV for a discussion on grouping provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above defined thresholds are used by EPA in determining the applicability of evaporative emission testing for the purposes of Tier 1 and Tier 2. However, EPA retains the authority to require evaporative emission testing under Tier 3 for fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures with low vapor pressure, e.g., RVP less than 2.0, if there is a health or welfare concern associated with the evaporative emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in question. For example, if a highly toxic substance is present in a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, EPA could require evaporative emission testing under Tier 3, even if the RVP of the F/FA product in question is below 2.0 psi. These special cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis under Tier 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Program Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of this rule apply to manufacturers (including importers) of designated fuels or fuel additives and to any F/FA manufacturer [see &sect;79.2(d) and (f) as amended in this rule] seeking registration under CAA section 211(a) and 211(b). A fuel is defined to be any material which is capable of releasing energy or power by combustion or other chemical or physical reaction [see 40 CFR &sect;79.2(c)]. A fuel additive is defined as any substance that is intentionally added to a fuel (including any added to a motor vehicle's fuel system) and that is not intentionally removed prior to sale or use (see 40 CFR &sect;79.2(e), as amended in this rule), including both bulk and aftermarket additives. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

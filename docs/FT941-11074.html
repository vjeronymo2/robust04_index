			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / BAe to confirm Cahill will quit as chairman British Aerospace is expected to confirm early next week that Mr John Cahill, its chairman for just 21 months, will leave the company in April. It is thought that the company has prepared for Mr Cahill's departure as executive chairman by seeking an outsider to become non-executive chairman. The announcement has been delayed by negotiations over Mr Cahill's compensation, which might be worth several million dollars. Mr Cahill succeeded Sir Graham Day as chairman in April 1992 to serve a five-year term on a salary of Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 533,300) a year, which for tax reasons is paid in the US. He was also entitled to share options worth more than Dollars 3m. Pressure has been mounting on BAe to clarify the situation after speculation that Mr Cahill would step down at the company's annual meeting in April. Last night BAe would neither confirm nor deny the reports. However, it is believed that BAe senior executives will meet this week to finalise details of the succession. Some BAe executives suggest tension had been mounting between Mr Cahill and Mr Dick Evans, the group's chief executive. Mr Cahill, who was yesterday in the US, where he lives, has been closely involved in BAe's unsuccessful attempt to form a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace for its regional jet business. The agreement last week to sell Rover to BMW for Pounds 800m largely completes the company restructuring Mr Cahill set out to achieve. BMW's relationship with Honda, the Japanese manufacturer that owns 20 per cent of Rover may be clarified this week. BMW expects that senior executives will within days arrange meetings with Honda. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the Honda president, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the company was open to a wide variety of three-way relationships as long as Rover did not lose its identity as a British company. But expanding his remarks on the BBC's The Money Programme yesterday, he said: 'If it becomes only a joint venture with BMW, and Rover thereby ceases to be a British company, our co-operative relationship with Rover will not last long.' A BMW executive said: 'We do not expect complications with Honda.' Honda was expected to retain its 20 per cent stake.</p>

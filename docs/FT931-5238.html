			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Books: A triumph over prudery - AC Grayling admires a different view of Henry Miller THE DEVIL AT LARGE by Erica Jong Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 16, 340 pages SET ASIDE your prejudices, if you have any, about Henry Miller and Erica Jong. In this account of her friendship with Miller, and of Miller's life, views and literary achievement, Jong gives us robust insights into the life of a writer and, more generally, the writing life. Miller might not have a place reserved on Parnassus's peak, but when the topography of 20th century literature in English is finally settled, he is assured of a place on - so to say - its pistes. Jong's book gives us some of the better reasons why. Shortly after the publication of her first novel, Fear of Flying, Jong received a congratulatory letter from Miller. It was the beginning of a friendship that lasted until his death. Partly because of Miller's support, Jong's novel was rescued from the oblivion that first seemed its destiny. Later, as if in repayment, she undertook to write his life. The task proved insuperably difficult, because Miller had laid so many false tracks in his voluminous writings and correspondence. In the end he told Jong that her best chance of getting his story right was 'to make it all up'. She has done the next best thing: she has mixed biography with literary criticism, polemic, and reminiscence. The result is a curate's egg of a book: hastily paced, especially when unsure of itself; sometimes hyperbolic; relentlessly crackling with noisy one-line opinions; but always interesting and not infrequently wise. Miller is most famous, Jong rightly says, for his worst books: the Tropic novels and other sexually explicit writings. But his best work, The Colossus of Maroussi in particular, shows him to be the master of significant powers. Miller was an artist, an ironist, a raconteur, and sometimes a very funny writer. His language is pellucidly honest, and rises at times to a sinuosity and strength reminiscent of Attic Greek. He is a prose Whitman of the 20th century; and indeed acknowledges the connection, claiming America's great confessional poet as his 'ancestor'. Although his sexually descriptive books are not Miller's best, they performed several important functions. Not the least was Tropic of Cancer's legal victory in 1964 over censorship in America. This and other Supreme Court triumphs, superintended in that heady liberalising time by the reforming Justice William Brennan, unshackled American literature, making Jong' s own work possible a few years later. For decades Miller had been silenced by censorship in his own country; triumph over the stiflers of expression was a sweet vindication. Jong gives a brisk account of Miller's literary development, from early disappointments in New York, through the finding of his voice in 1930s Paris, to the wise evening of his life in California's Big Sur and the Pacific Palisades. There is a strong smack of the creative-writing class in Jong's appraisal, but it is fascinating and perceptive nevertheless. Miller became at last able to write, she tells us, because he sloughed off the desire to produce Literature, and discovered courage in that freedom. The result was that he could write 'what none of the other books say'. His exuberant language, his electric humour, his wonderfully surreal sense of the poetry of things, refused to be squeezed into conventional forms. As soon as he stopped trying, his difficulties were over. Miller had many lovers, but the most important was Anais Nin. She was stronger than he, and gave him his platform, materially as well as intellectually. He was besotted, but she was having affairs with several others simultaneously. Nevertheless she ascribed a pregnancy to him, which ended in abortion. Later there was bitterness between them, but Miller continued to believe that Nin's diaries are an outstanding literary achievement. Jong addresses the three questions which invariably arise in discussion of Miller: his sexism, his treatment of sex, and his work's value. She defends him against her sister feminists, remarking that he showed more charity to women's writing than 'some feminist zealots, who judge every book against some imaginary yardstick of political correctness and care for neither irony nor imagination'. She applauds his part in liberating novelists from prudery, but says that his revolution remains incomplete, leaving Western culture still uneasily poised between mania and phobia about sexuality. And she argues that although Miller's art is flawed, and that most of his books are, in Norman Mailer's phrase, 'cakes which failed to rise', nevertheless his experiments with the confessional voice and with 'spiral time' have been a powerful influence on the shaping of modern American writing. These judgments are sound, and offer a useful counterpoint to the response, generally sceptical, that greeted Miller's recent centenary. Jong's account performs a valuable service, therefore, in letting Miller have his due, perhaps for the first time.</p>

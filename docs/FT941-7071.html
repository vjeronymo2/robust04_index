			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Tinkering, tailoring, soldiering on: George Graham on the role of the CIA after the arrest of a senior officer on spying charges Espionage, according to Mr James Jesus Angleton, the US master spy in the cold war years, is a 'wilderness of mirrors'. The mirror held up this week by the arrest of a senior officer of the Central Intelligence Agency on charges of spying for Russia reflects an unexpected light on the CIA. While senators fulminate at Russia's gall in continuing to spy on the US - a pursuit which has apparently already been curtailed because of budget cuts - another question has lurked unanswered: why should the CIA devote virtually as much effort to spying on Russia as it did for the old Soviet Union? The question is not being asked with great urgency in Washington at the moment. The immediate impact of the arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, a former head of CIA counter-intelligence activities targeting the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, was to expose shortcomings in the agency's internal security precautions. The case also showed that spying did not die with the cold war. On one level, it makes the CIA as necessary as ever, because it is obvious that the old enemy has not passed away entirely. But however devastating the consequences of Mr Ames's alleged treachery for the CIA's own operations - members of Congress have been told that he sent at least 10 Soviet citizens working for the US to their deaths - it seems in some respects part of a deadly game of little relevance to the wider course of world events. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, eliminating the greatest threat to US security, the intelligence services, like the military, have sought new challenges: the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, narcotics and economic intelligence. 'At no time during the last 30 years has intelligence been more important or more challenged than it is now,' said General James Clapper, head of US military intelligence. The CIA, in particular, has also put on a smiling public face to suit the times. Last year it published a 43-page Consumer's Guide to Intelligence - although the document is already out of print and unobtainable - and it has begun to declassify a large portion of its more historic intelligence analyses, not to mention its files on the assassination of President John Kennedy. Mr James Woolsey, its director since last year, has been more open than any of his predecessors; appearing not only in frequent public hearings on Capitol Hill but also on Mr Larry King's live call-in show on CNN television. But while some see a willingness to adapt to changed circumstances, others see another bureaucracy desperately trying to invent new missions to justify its bloated budget. The US intelligence budget is an official secret, concealed within overall Pentagon spending. Many senior members of Congress have begun to press for at least the total, widely believed to be about Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19bn) a year, to be made public. Of this, perhaps 15 per cent goes to the CIA, with the lion's share absorbed by the expensive satellites and electronic eavesdropping equipment of the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency - which, unlike the independent CIA, report to the defence department. President Bill Clinton requested a small increase in the 1994 intelligence budget, but Congress froze it. The administration's request for 1995, submitted earlier this month, is 'essentially flat', said Mr Woolsey. He told members of Congress this week that the total intelligence budget had fallen since 1990 by 14 per cent after adjusting for inflation, and that CIA, NSA and DIA personnel would be cut by more than 22 per cent over the course of this decade. 'United States intelligence capabilities are being reduced to a level where . . . we are skating on thin ice on a warm day,' Mr Woolsey said. But even if the budget is being curbed, some intelligence experts question whether the new missions the CIA has adopted are appropriate, or at least whether the CIA is the agency best equipped to carry them out. Some see a wasteful overlap, for example, between the CIA's expansion into counter-narcotics and the overseas undercover operations of the Drug Enforcement Agency, which comes under the aegis of the Justice Department. Narcotics activities are also said to have created morale problems within the agency for officers who have seen their jobs change radically. Even more questionable, to many, is an area described by Mr Woolsey as 'the hottest current topic in intelligence issues'. He said the CIA was being asked by the Washington administration to assess how some governments violated the rules of the game in international trade. 'This does not mean that the CIA is in the business of economic espionage - for example, trying to learn the business plans of foreign companies in order to give such information to American firms. 'It does mean, however, that we are paying careful attention to those countries or businesses who are spying on our firms to the disadvantage of American business and American workers, and to those governments and foreign companies that try to bribe their way into obtaining contracts that they cannot win on the merits,' he said. Many businesses are sceptical of Mr Woolsey's claim that the CIA has saved billions of dollars for US companies in this way. The claim is unverifiable for, as the CIA director said, 'most such companies never realise that they have received our assistance and even state publicly that they do not need it . . . That's fine with us. It's the nature of the intelligence business.' But the topic raises questions both within the agency, among officers who are ready to risk their lives for their country but not for IBM, and in Congress, where some members feel such intelligence does not warrant the use of taxpayers' funds. Even more fundamentally, Democratic Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska wonders whether the CIA does a better job of assessing economic trends or election outcomes than private sector information gatherers, such as financial analysts. 'I appreciate the world tour that you gave us and I find it to be very reliable and very dependable and very interesting, but I must say I had a recent world tour given to me by a currency trader in New York City that I find to be equally reliable and interesting and dependable,' Mr Kerrey told Mr Woolsey last month at a hearing of the Senate intelligence committee. Those who have seen CIA analyses say that their data are often banal and their judgments often misguided. They are also, frequently, less timely than Reuters or CNN. Mr Woolsey acknowledged that on many issues the CIA's hunches 'are not necessarily going to be better than that of a good university faculty or the newsroom of a good newspaper'. That may not be good enough to fight off the threat of deeper cuts in the intelligence budget.</p>

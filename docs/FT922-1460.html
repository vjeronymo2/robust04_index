			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (25): Think-tank kept from limelight - Xerox PARC XEROX HAS been on the leading edge of information systems technology for more than two decades. Much of the original research came from Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California and spawned many of the key developments in modern computing from Ethernet local-area networks, through graphical user interfaces and windows, to laser printer software and object-oriented design. But in spite of its impressive record, Xerox has derived only limited commercial benefit from PARC's innovations. Apple Computer is more likely to get the credit for inventing the graphical user interface as a result of the success of its Macintosh computer, and software company Novell is the main beneficiary of the success of the Ethernet technology used in local area networks. Similarly, credit for the recent innovations in object-oriented design - a new and promising approach to the design of information technology systems - is destined to go to others. This is partly because of Xerox's policy of supporting its employees in research into commercial products. Many of the innovations from Xerox PARC have been the basis of start-up companies which have gone on to gain considerable success in the commercial market - with Xerox's blessing. Xerox PARC was founded at the end of the 1960s as a think-tank and, during the early 1970s, researchers at PARC developed a stream of technologies which have had enormous influence on computing. Xerox was keen to invest the huge profits from sales of its photocopiers in maintaining an edge in the emerging office systems market. It effectively gave the PARC teams a blank cheque with which to come up with technology which would not only set the world on fire but also give Xerox a lead in the new style of computing. Xerox's researchers such as Alan Kay, one of the leading thinkers at PARC, saw computing becoming increasingly 'personal' and set about devising ways to make computers easier to use. The results of this work led to the Xerox Star system - the first commercial computer to use a mouse and a 'windows' graphical user interface (GUI). The Star was introduced in 1981 but it was too expensive (and too advanced) to become commercially acceptable. Xerox saw the Star system as an extension of its concept of an entirely automated office system. It was to be the 'window' into an electronic network based on the Ethernet technology and incorporating computers, communications and office peripherals such as photocopiers. It was not until the mid-1980s, however, that this idea gained commercial acceptability in the form of the Apple Macintosh - a personal computer which embodied Star's technology at an affordable price. Xerox PARC's contribution did not stop there, however. In 1982, John Warnock, another Xerox researcher, left PARC to set up Adobe, a company specialising in printing technology. Warnock spent four years at PARC working on a powerful language which could be used to describe printed material. The language, Postscript, quickly became the standard method of passing printing instructions from a computer to the new laser printers coming on to market. The combination of the Macintosh and Postscript (which Apple also adopted) created a new type of application - desktop publishing. Xerox PARC's influence has not waned and, if the promise of object-oriented systems is realised, it will continue to be important well into the next century. Object-oriented design views information technology as a set of self-contained 'objects' which combine both data and processes. An example of an object in common use is the standard printer driver programs, used on PCs. A driver is a general-purpose software module which can be used by other programs to access a peripheral device such as a printer or a display screen. Most personal computer programs use standard driver programs, which means that the special code need only be written once, instead of being incorporated in every program. This concept of re-using standard code is central to object-oriented design. The first serious use of this approach originated at Xerox PARC with a software environment called Smalltalk. It was used as the basis of the software for the Xerox Star systems and has had a persistent influence over the development of object-oriented technology across the computer industry. Object-oriented technology now looks set to become the basis for future computer systems of all types. Meanwhile, the ripples from Xerox PARC are not going to stop. Notebook computers, one of the most promising new areas for the 1990s, also had their origins at PARC. Alan Kay, who now works as an Apple Fellow, conceived the idea of a powerful notebook computer called the Dynabook in 1968, but the technology was not sufficiently advanced at the time to build one. He says he expects notebook computers to look 'very much like the Dynabook model' by 1995. Sadly, Xerox is unlikely to derive much commercial benefit from this and will have to be content with knowing that it was there first.</p>

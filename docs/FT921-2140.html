			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Minorco sees more acquisitions MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, spent more than Dollars 1bn on acquisitions in the past two years, but still had Dollars 1.8bn in cash at the end of December. The group, which collected Dollars 2.5bn from the sale of its shares in Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK following an unsuccessful bid, still generates most of its earnings from financial income. However, Minorco said yesterday that present conditions offered the opportunity to make strategic acquisitions at attractive values'. In the six months to December 31, Minorco's earnings before tax slipped from Dollars 115.9m to Dollars 105.6m. Operating earnings contributed Dollars 72.3m of the total and financial income of Dollars 102.6m, compared with Dollars 8.1m and Dollars 99.6m last time. This was better than most analysts had expected. Minorco described the results as satisfactory. However, it added: 'Prevailing economic conditions, with weak commodity prices and a trend towards lower interest rates, persuade us to remain cautious about our results for the second half.' Nevertheless, the company is lifting its interim dividend by 6 per cent, from 17 cents a share to 18 cents. In the half-year, Minorco bought Buxton Lime Industries in the UK from ICI for Dollars 207m, and acquired another quarrying operation near Berlin to add to Elbekies, one of the assets currently being sold off in east Germany. In the half-year, the German aggregates business did better than expected and turned in a 'satisfactory' performance. Minorco's biggest purchase was the Freeport McMoran gold operations, subsequently renamed Independence Mining, for Dollars 705m. In the six months, Independence produced 172,000 troy ounces of gold, a 22 per cent increase.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> MEDIATOR MAY MEET TEACHERS, OFFICIALS  </P> <P> A state mediator is tentatively scheduled to meet with Tustin school district  officials and members of the teachers union this week in an effort to reach a  contract agreement.  </P> <P> The previous contract for teachers, nurses, psychologists, speech therapists  and counselors in the Tustin Unified School District expired June 30.  Negotiations for the 1989-90 contract have been going on since April, and an  impasse was declared Oct. 27.  </P> <P> The mediator, Dave Hart, has met with district officials and members of the  Tustin Educators Assn. twice. He is tentatively scheduled to meet with the two  sides again Tuesday.  </P> <P> The primary stumbling block in negotiations has been salary. The district has  offered a salary increase of between 6% and 7% to the 425 employees represented  by the union.  </P> <P> Supt. Maurice A. Ross said the district has received state funding to provide a  4.6% cost-of-living increase and cannot afford to pay as much as the teachers  want.  </P> <P> The union wants a pay increase of between 10% and 10.5%, said Joyce Rohrbaugh,  president of the union.  </P> <P> Rohrbaugh said the district's most experienced teachers are paid less than  those with similar experience in other districts.  </P> <P> Ross said he is optimistic that a settlement will be reached soon, but  Rohrbaugh said she has been disappointed by the negotiations so far.

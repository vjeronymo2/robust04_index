			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Earnings up 74% at SA glass group AN IMPRESSIVE performance from offshore arm Belron helped Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), the glass group in the South African Breweries (SAB) stable, record a 74 per cent increase in earnings per share to 241 cents in the six months to the end of September, compared with 138 cents a year ago. The better performance was largely attributable to better results from Belron, the automotive glass company. Domestically, Glass SA's results held steady and PG Bison, the board company, improved on last year's performance. Management said earnings were expected to increase in the second half, but at a 'much lower' rate than during the first half. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to R1.58bn (Dollars 46.9m) from R1.35bn and operating profit was 47 per cent higher at R172.5m (R117.2m). Attributable income rose by 115 per cent to R73.4m (R34m). The dividend was increased by 31 per cent to 85 cents from 65 cents a share. HIGH financing costs and difficult trading conditions, aggravated by violence and political disruptions, saw Amrel, the clothing, footwear and furniture retailer in the SAB group, record a first-half loss of R8.4m against a R1.9m loss a year earlier.</p>

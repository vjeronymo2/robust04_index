			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. No Fund will purchase any Designated Shares, nor will it credit the Deferred Fee Accounts as though it had purchased any Designated Shares, before the requested exemptive order is issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sections 13(a)(2), 13(a)(3), 18(f)(1), 22(f), 22(g), 17(a)(1), and 17(d) of the Act and rules 2a&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;1 thereunder, taken together, might be deemed to preclude the Funds and their directors from implementing the Plan absent an exemptive order form the Commission. Each Investment Company and the Manager believes, however, that the Plan is and will be in the best interests of each Fund adopting the Plan and its shareholders and is and will be consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. In addition, applicants believe that exemption of the deferred fee arrangement and transactions related thereto from certain provisions of the Act is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants submit that the ability of the Funds to recruit and retain highly qualified directors will be enhanced if they are able to offer their directors the option of deferred payment of fees. Moreover, on a comparative basis, deferral would have a negligible effect on each Fund's total assets and liabilities because the total fees paid to each director will be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in relation to the size of each Fund, and will have no effect on net assets and net income per share. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any class of senior security or selling any senior security of which it is the issuer. In addition, section 13(a)(2) of the Act requires that a registered investment company obtain authorization by the vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy contained in its registration statement. The Plan does not and would not give rise to any of the ``evils'' that led to Congress' concerns in enacting these provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4. Section 13(a)(3) of the Act prohibits registered investment companies from, absent shareholder approval, deviating from any ``fundamental'' investment policy that is changeable only upon shareholder approval. The fundamental investment policies of certain series of the Funds <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  would prohibit investment in Designated Shares of other series offered by the Funds. Any series of the Funds with these types of policies would be prevented, without shareholder approval, from purchasing shares of other series of the Funds. If any such series of Funds are prevented from so investing, they will not be able to effect the matching of Designated Shares with the liabilities credited to the Deferred Fee Accounts. This matching is desirable because it will help ensure that the deferred fee arrangements will not affect the net asset value of any series' shares. Applicants believe that it is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act to exempt the Funds from the provisions of section 13(a)(3). The relief requested from section 13(a)(3) would extend only to the specifically named applicants and not to future investment companies or series because future open-end management investment companies or future series of currently effective open-end management companies will be able to establish fundamental policies with the necessary exceptions to accommodate purchases of Fund shares in connection with the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The specific Funds seeking relief from the provisions of section 13(a)(3) are: Twentieth Century's Cash Reserve, U.S. Governments Short-Term, U.S. Governments Intermediate-Term, Limited-Term Bond, Intermediate-Term Bond, Long-Term Bond, Tax-Exempt Short-Term Bond, Tax-Exempt Intermediate-Term Bond, and Tax-Exempt long-Term Bond, all of which are limited to the purchase of bonds and other fixed income securities; Twentieth Century's Balanced Investors, which is limited to ``common stocks *&blank;*&blank;* bonds and other fixed income securities''; Capital's Value which is restricted to ``securities that management believes to be undervalued at the time of purchase''; and Premium Reserves' Government Reserve, Capital Reserve, and Management Bond, which are limited to the purchase of bonds and other fixed income securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 22(f) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company from restricting the transferability or negotiability of any security of which it is the issuer unless the restriction is disclosed in its registration statement and does not contravene rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission. Section 22(g) of the Act generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> NO. 1 CHATSWORTH AGAIN FALLS SHY OF ITS OBJECTIVE  </P> <P> Perhaps the Chatsworth High baseball program should consider a new insignia.  Instead of a block C centered on a five-pointed star, a semicircle with a slash  through it might be more appropriate.  </P> <P> The Chancellors have mastered the incomplete task, missing out on yet another  shot at a City Section 4-A Division baseball title -- a step short of Dodger  Stadium.  </P> <P> Arguably the Valley area's most successful baseball program in the '80s,  top-seeded Chatsworth (21-7) capped the decade in familiar fashion with a 9-8  loss to Palisades in the semifinals Wednesday at Cal State Northridge. The  victory moves Palisades (25-4) into the 4-A final against Kennedy, an 8-7  winner over Sylmar, at 7:30 tonight at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Palisades last advanced to the City final in 1982, when Bret Saberhagen, then  of Cleveland, pitched a no-hitter.  </P> <P> The Dolphins rallied for two runs in the bottom of the seventh inning to extend  Chatsworth's reign of frustration. Since 1981, Chatsworth has reached the  semifinals seven times and advanced to the final only once, winning the title  in 1983. The loss also marked the third consecutive year in which the  Chancellors have lost in the semifinals.  </P> <P> Coach Bob Lofrano and his players argue that the evidence is only  semi-conclusive, attributing their annoying habit to coincidence.  </P> <P> "Sure, we're aware of it," senior second baseman Vince Simili said. "But it  doesn't have anything to do with the semifinals. Absolutely, I still believe  we're the best team in the City."  </P> <P> Pitcher Derek Wallace, who will attend Pepperdine in the fall, has waited three  seasons to make that claim but will end his career without a boast. Instead, he  will be stuck with the memory of one of his worst performances. He was hitless  in five at-bats, twice failed to produce a run with the bases loaded and gave  up the winning runs on a pair of ground-rule doubles in the seventh.  </P> <P> "I choked," he said. "I played a lousy game all-around."  </P> <P> With Chatsworth nursing an 8-7 lead in the seventh, Wallace relieved Jason  Evans with pinch-hitter Brett Garcia on second and a 3-and-1 count on Mario  Cobian. One strike later, Cobian lofted a fly ball down the left-field line  that dropped behind Nick Schultz and hopped the wall, scoring Garcia with the  tying run.  </P> <P> After a wild pitch sent Cobian to third, Wallace induced Jason Beckerman into a  ground out at third and then intentionally walked Mike Codron. Barry Levine,  who earlier belted his eighth home run of the season, then took a strike before  hitting a ground-rule double that scored Cobian with the winning run.  </P> <P> Wallace (9-3) won 16 games in his career and saved eight more, but Levine was  unimpressed.  </P> <P> "We kept hearing how great he was and we were nervous about facing their No.  1," Levine said. "But he didn't look that tough warming up. I thought Evans  looked tougher."  </P> <P> Evans, who worked 3 2/3 scoreless innings to earn the win in Tuesday's 11-6  victory over Grant, pitched two impressive innings of relief after replacing  starter Reed McMackin to open the fifth. He struck out the heart of the order  on 11 pitches and then started the sixth with two more strikeouts before  retiring the side in order.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Chatsworth recovered from a 5-1 deficit to take its only lead of the  game in the top of the sixth. With the Chancellors trailing, 7-6, Evans coaxed  a walk out of Codron, who improved to 9-3 despite allowing 19 baserunners.  </P> <P> Simili singled to left and Evans scored when Rich Aude's sharp ground ball went  through shortstop Larry Israel for an error. Simili moved to third on the play  and scored on Eric Johnson's fly ball to center.  </P> <P> After Israel made a diving play to retire Wallace on a ground out, Chatsworth  loaded the bases on walks to Kevin Chong and Doug Lambeck. But Codron struck  out pinch-hitter Ron Niemi to end the threat. Chatsworth stranded 12  baserunners in all.  </P> <P> Palisades scored single runs in the first and second and then struck for three  in the third on a run-scoring double by Codron and Levine's two-run homer for a  5-1 lead. Chatsworth, limited to Simili's second homer of the year through  three innings, tied the score in the fourth on a two-run double by Mike Mancuso  and Aude's two-run single, one of three hits for the Chatsworth third baseman.  </P> <P> Afterward, Lofrano ordered the players to sit quietly on the bench while  Palisades ran victory wind sprints in the outfield.  </P> <P> "The best thing to say at that moment is nothing," he said. "It's better to sit  and let all the frustration go. We've won more than our share of these kind of  games and I'm not going to look at this as a negative."  </P> <P> After six semifinal losses in the past nine seasons, Lofrano claims he harbors  no anger because of another such setback.  </P> <P> "I can't say that we should have won because they got two legitimate runs in  the seventh," he said.  </P></p>

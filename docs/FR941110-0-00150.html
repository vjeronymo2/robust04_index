			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters indicated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition of nurse aide training and competency evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs (NATCEPs) is a penalty which should be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the listing of available remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prohibition of a NATCEP is predicated on,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among other things, the existence of a nurse staffing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver, the fact that a facility has been subject to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended or partial extended survey, or the imposition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse action, including termination of the provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. The enforcement remedies, on the other hand, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consequences of facility noncompliance once deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been identified through the survey process. While the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproval of a NATCEP is automatic when criteria set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Act are met, the imposition of remedies is a matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring some discretion on the part of HCFA or the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is possible for a facility with a nurse staffing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver to be surveyed and have no deficiencies identified or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no deficiencies found which cause the facility to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of compliance. In these cases, an enforcement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be in order, even though other provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act and regulations would require that a prohibition of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NATCEP be imposed. Further, it would be possible for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility with no nurse staffing waiver, which had not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to an extended or partial extended survey, to have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty imposed as a remedy for deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified. In this latter case, the civil money penalty is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enforcement remedy, and not the prohibition of a NATCEP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is an automatic statutory consequence of the civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty being imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we believe that the Act, as well as regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published on September 26, 1991, separately address how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State arrives at the disapproval of a NATCEP as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how it or HCFA determines that an enforcement action is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order, we are not adopting these comments in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter indicated that denial of payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new admissions for certain diagnostic categories is too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to implement or monitor. Another stated that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is too broadly defined and that it was not the intention of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act to modify remedies included in the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first comment is discussed in detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under ``Denial of Payment'' later in this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the comment that the Act does not allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications of its listed remedies, we point to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(B),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(A), 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C), all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which indicate that remedies other than those specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act are allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters asked that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available remedy of denial of payment for new admissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain diagnostic categories be amended to ensure that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not promote discrimination against residents a facility does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not want to admit. Both indicated that a directed plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction should be required in these situations, and one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment further stated that the directed plan of correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should direct the facility on how to regain the capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to care for residents with the designated diagnoses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This issue is discussed in detail under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Denial of Payment'' later in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five commenters indicated that HCFA should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify in the regulation the criteria by which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will determine whether a State's alternative or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional remedies are as effective in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the remedies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the Act. Other commenters insisted that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative or additional remedies must be made available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for public comment before adoption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that there is a need for uniformity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the process which is used to approve State remedies which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are alternative or additional to those included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. While we will prepare manual instructions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will address how these reviews and approvals should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed, we believe such information is not appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the text of the regulation itself since it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible to contemplate the vast array of alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that States might propose. The Act does not require and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA will not require specific public notice procedures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit State prerogatives in the State plan amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

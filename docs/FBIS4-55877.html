			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F> Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces, by Reni  Neshkova; place and date not given: "In This Historical Cycle,  We Lead Hungary by a Head"]    [Excerpts] [Neshkova] Mr. Dimitrov, you have always said  you are a supporter of reasonable compromise in politics.  Surely the decision of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces]  Sixth National Conference to exclude the children of active  fighters against fascism and persons who have applied to join  the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party] from holding leading posts  in the SDS, along with other restrictions, goes beyond the  bounds of what is reasonable?    [Dimitrov] I have been able to state my view on this issue  on several occasions, and I would like to make this clear. The  conference was forced to make this decision because of  circumstances that everyone knows about. In Bulgaria a crazy,  untrue assertion is spreading and being repeated again and  again, that half of those responsible for the communist rule are  in the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], while the other half are  in the SDS. It is understandable that no political force with  any self-respect would, except on very rare occasions, place at  its head, in its most representative organs, people who are wide  open to attack. They may be the most conscientious people, they  may be the most competent ones, but if they are open to attack,  they will put both themselves and the political force in a bad  position. I assume that this was the motive for the decision --  an honorable one, if one supports this thesis.    [Neshkova] Nonetheless, surely one of the motives was to  settle personal accounts within the coalition?    [Dimitrov] Personally, I am against exclusive regulations  and said so at the conference, but the conference was evidently  inclined to adopt this decision on protective grounds. However,  I want to make it clear that this decision has not changed  anything substantial in the SDS. Of course, if the SDS wants to  win, it will be very difficult for it constantly to have to  explain why such-and-such or so-and-so is an exception to the  rule, and so forth. [passage omitted]    [Neshkova] You have declared that you oppose any mechanical  means of evaluating future SDS election candidates and that if  one of the proposed schemes is applied, Prof. Berov may receive  a very high classification.    [Dimitrov] This is not a completely reliable and sensible  method of assessing candidates. I believe that some way can be  found, and we already have enough competent people on whom we  can rely. At the same time, I believe that it is sensible to  discuss these candidates to obtain a sufficient guarantee.    [Neshkova] What exactly does the decision to boycott  parliament mean, now that the government is likely to be changed?    [Dimitrov] Please allow the political force the right of  surprise. The conference demonstrated a high degree of unity  regarding the radical issues concerning the national situation,  the ways of finding a solution to this situation, and its  responsibility for finding ways to provoke early elections.    [Neshkova] People are saying that the SDS "right wing," with  which you are identified, won the upper hand.    [Dimitrov] Responsibility means knowing what difficulties  lie ahead and how they can be overcome. This is a very  difficult position. [passage omitted]    [Neshkova] Is it not true that the BSP has been greatly  encouraged to act more independently, following the victory of  the former Communists in Hungary, for example?    [Dimitrov] I am sure that there are no grounds for this,  because this is a historical process that at various times  brought the former Communists to power in the former communist  states. What is happening now in Hungary happened in Bulgaria  in 1992, so that we are in front by a head in this historical  cycle, and I am sure that very soon we will push things in quite  another direction in Bulgaria.</p>

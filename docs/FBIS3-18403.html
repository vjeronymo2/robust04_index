Bik: "G-7 Outlining Requirements for Aid to </F> Russia"]    [Text] Bonn -- The seven major Western industrialized  nations (G-7) are willing to continue to support Russia only if  it pursues its reform process and shows some tangible results.  According to the G-7, the world economy is evolving reasonably  well, mostly thanks to the recovery in the United States,  Canada, and Great Britain. In France and Italy, privatization  programs should rev up the economy, while in Japan deregulation  and an announced stimulation program should do the same.    These were the conclusions of the talks between the finance  ministers and bank governors from the G-7 countries, which were  concluded in the German city of Kronberg last weekend. On  behalf of Russia, which attended the meeting as an observer and  the main beneficiary of aid, Finance Minister Dubinin came to  Kronberg. His delegation received many critical questions  regarding the progress of the Russian reform process. In a  nine-point statement, the G-7 states that Russian "goodwill" has  shown "insufficient results." Dubinin had announced that Russia  wants to push back the monthly inflation rate from 20 percent  now, to between 6 and 9 percent by the end of 1994. The budget  deficit should be maximum 5 percent of the GNP by then, which  Dubinin considered to be "quite feasible." Reactions to his  statements were sceptical, due to the success of the former  communists and ultranationalists in Russia's recent elections.    Aids of German Minister Theo Waigel reported that U.S.  Finance Minister Lloyd Bentson's attitude had been very  standoffish during the talks on the continuation of aid to  Moscow, because of the commotion around the Russian CIA spy  exposed last week. An important part of the $55-billion aid  agreed in 1992 and 1993, has not yet been provided, including  $10 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and $4.5  billion (out of 5 billion) from the World Bank.    Host Waigel made it clear that his country, which has  provided two-thirds of all Western aid (almost 100 billion  German marks) since 1989, for the time being must ease up  because of its own economic problems. Anyway, Waigel believes  an extension of aid is not necessary right now, although he  labelled the situation of the Russian economy as "infinitely  intricate."    European Commissioner Henning Christophersen stated that the  European Union is considering the possibility of creating a  free-trade area with Russia by 1998. However, a prior condition  for opening up the West European market to Russian products is  still that Moscow should guarantee the fixing of realistic  market prices and that subsidies to companies should be lifted,  a demand which is also applicable to other East European  countries.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Bonds: Focus shifts to pricing in subdued conditions PRICING and structuring provided the main talking points in the international bond markets yesterday, in a relatively subdued atmosphere for new issues. The Dollars 250m five-year issue from LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance was widely described as aggressively priced at 24 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, despite the acknowledged quality of the name, the triple-A rating and the explicit state guarantee. Traders felt the spread should have been in the low 30s, particularly in the light of this week's heavy supply of dollars at the short end of the market. LKB is understood to have swapped the proceeds into sub-Libor US dollars. The Dollars 150m five-year issue for Isveimer via Kredietbank in Luxembourg is being seen as an example of the kind of structure and pricing that Italian would-be borrowers will have to resort to in order to overcome investor fears about term investment in Italy. The structure offers investors a put option every six months, designed to give the borrower effectively medium-term funding and the investor a six-month deposit at a higher yield. The spread was described as generous and the fees as 'enormous' for what could be six-month paper if investors were to exercise their first option to exit. The collared floating rate note is bearing up surprisingly well in view of rising short-term dollar interest rates, say traders. But Lehman Brothers, which led a further Dollars 50m 10-year issue for the World Bank, fungible with a Dollars 100m issue led by Kidder Peabody in late October, says issuers need to remain prudent and tap this niche of the market only for small amounts. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also reopened an issue, offering a further ADollars 50m of bonds fungible with ADollars 300m-worth led by SBC Dominguez Barry in June. Traders described this as an opportunity for European investors to buy exposure to Australian dollars at a lower level. Expectations are mounting that Belgium will launch a Euroyen bond offering for up to Y75bn over seven years through Nomura International. The deadline for bids in the UK government's auction of privatised companies' debt is the close of play today. Baring Brothers, which is organising the auction, says it expects high bidding interest from the issuers (British Telecom and the electricity generators and distributors) and from third parties in the UK and overseas. A decision on whether to grant Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) leave to pursue an appeal in the House of Lords is expected in the next few days, according to sources close to the case.</p>

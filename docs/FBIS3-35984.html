Chernomyrdin said that during previous meetings with  Georgian  leaders the question of Georgia's entering the ruble zone was  not discussed.    The Russian prime minister believes that this problem might  be considered in the context of the realisation of the economic  union between CIS countries. He pointed out that countries  joining the ruble zone will have to sacrifice part of their  sovereignty and carry out tough coordination of economic reforms  between themselves.    In connection with the January statement made by Russian and  Belarusian leadership on Belarus' entering the ruble zone  Chernomyrdin pointed out that "it is naive to suppose that this  will happen at the expense of Russian tax-payers."  Chernmomyrdin pointed out that Belarus is not going to live at  Russia's expense. "Admitting Belarus into the ruble zone will  not be detrimental to Russia's interests. We shall not let it  happen," Chernomyrdin declared. [as received]    Chernomyrdin believes that one cannot speak today about an  anti- reformist policy of the Belarusian leadership. "I see  that the Belarusian Government is targeted at reforms," he added.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH WILSON  </P> <P> I was both annoyed and depressed by William Kahrl's article ("Can War-Ready  Environmentalists Deal With Wilson?" Opinion, Dec. 9) regarding "war-ready"  environmentalists' approach to Gov.-elect Pete Wilson and President Bush.  Concern for the environment is no longer and should not be limited to a few.  </P> <P> Wilson has never been a trail-blazer nor a strong supporter of much of anything  except his own career, and got on the off-shore drilling bandwagon only when it  looked as if it was politically expedient. Why should he have to be patted and  praised and coaxed to do what is right? The Reagan and now the Bush  Administration have been consistently anti-environment.  </P> <P> The subsidizing of wealthy agribusiness with cheap, taxpayer-supported water  has long been a disgrace not only in terms of the deficit, but also the very  real importance of water conservation, and Wilson should not have to be coaxed  to help correct this problem. And to blame environmentalists for using the  wrong tactics with these two gentlemen instead of blaming them for making poor  decisions is ridiculous.  </P> <P> AFTON SLADE, La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Branimir </F> Baron Brljevic; place and date not given: "`The Insane Serbian  Generals Have Been Staging a Conflict Between the U.S. and  Russian Armies in the Balkans!'"]    [Text] Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha is an integral  figure in the democratic changes in the most backward European  country, in whose towns the water and electricity supplies last  only a few hours a day, but where there are almost no large  buildings on which there are not at least several satellite  antennas. The man who woke this sleeping beauty and led it, at  a hardly bearable speed, away from its Middle Ages is an  internationally renowned cardiologist who was for many years the  personal physician to the ill-reputed dictator Enver Hoxha.    I found him angry with the latest announcement of the Greek  Government, which stated that Albania had not declared the  Orthodox Easter a national religious holiday. President Berisha  explained that it was with the intention of dispelling any  doubts about a religion being discriminated against that he  personally attended the central Easter celebrations, along with  the patriarch of the autocephalous Albanian Orthodox Church,  Anastos Janullatos, who is of Greek nationality. I let him talk  about the incomprehensible behavior of the once friendly  southern Greek neighbor, about the recent murder of two Albanian  border patrolmen, and about hundreds of thousands of Albanian  workers being expelled from Greece because of the alleged denial  of minority rights to the Greeks in Albania. He gave me only a  short smile after I told him that all his country needed after  the programmed destruction of public institutions, factories,  and schools that was conducted by the old regime just before the  first free elections, were neighbors competing at being hostile.  President Berisha is impressively modest: He is still living  in a two-room apartment with his wife and two children.  <H5>  Chief Support -- the West </H5>   [Brljevic] You recently received General Robert Oaks, the  U.S. Air Force commander. What did you discuss?    [Berisha] We discussed the preparations and military  cooperation in case the war in the Balkans escalates soon and  spreads toward the south. Mr. Oaks said he that agreed the  spreading of the conflict to Kosovo was possible and probable.    [Brljevic] Albania used to rely on the West. Are you not  afraid it will betray you again?    [Berisha] We have received firm guarantees that this will  not happen. We have had enough time to prepare the defense of  the country. It was obvious that if no one was decisive enough  to stop Milosevic, who now needs the war in order to survive,  then there would be a great war on the entire Balkans. I cannot  tell you state secrets, but you can believe that the West will  not leave us in the lurch!    [Brljevic] Have you not found the fate of the protected  areas in Bosnia instructive enough?    [Berisha] We should wait. The Serbs have been given  ultimatums in both Sarajevo and in Gorazde. It is very  important to avoid rash moves that some of the insane  bloodthirsty Serb generals are counting on to provoke  confrontation of the U.S. and Russian forces and thus definitely  make it into the history books.    [Brljevic] Was the recent murder of the two Albanian border  patrolmen programmed in the same context, to make the tense  situation in this part of the world even worse?    [Berisha] After the Serbian aggressor, the one who had  encouraged it appeared. The whole of Greece is in a nationalist  fever. The people of the Balkans have always been easy to get  out in the streets, but the price could be very high this time.  At a time when it is crucial that passions subside and possible  conflicts and escalations be prevented, the Greeks are doing  just the opposite. They have expelled hundreds of thousands of  our workers. It is true that many of them who are there are not  registered, and we are grateful that they are helping us  overcome our difficulties that way too, but it is completely  unacceptable to use that fact as a factor of political pressure  on our country. I want us to improve our relations, to solve  the issue of refugees, economic emigrants, and members of the  Greek minority in a humane way. I particularly want their human  and ethnic rights to be protected, but it is all in vain,  because the Greek authorities manipulate their minority and at  one moment they will accept our workers, while at the next they  expel them in a very uncivilized way. The latest incident has  forced us to put the responsibility on the Greek Government  because the commandos arrived from their territory and returned  there. We have demanded that they be identified.  <H5>  Chauvinists in Athens </H5>   [Brljevic] How did they reply?    [Berisha] That it was a contradiction. Allegedly we, at the  same time, accused them of a crime, and asked them to identify  terrorists. For heaven's sake, each government is responsible  for the crime that the terrorists who arrive from its territory  and return to it commit. We did not say they committed it; we  are only asking them to identify the perpetrators. Although  they have denied it, we cannot rule out the possibility that  they organized it. The Greek Government did not condescend to  show signs of regret or express condolences even several days  after the crime. If it had not been for the international  public, they would not have even issued the announcement on the  contradiction. We are aware that there are many people in  Greece who would like relations to be strained, but we do not  wish to contribute to that.    [Brljevic] Is that possible? One can see from the example  of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] that it will be difficult.    [Berisha] Greek politics seems to be one big outrage. The  first such outrage was the underhand alliance with Serbia.  Moreover, a very hostile policy is being conducted toward the  European Union, of which Greece is a member and which it will  continue to preside over for a while. Regardless of that, they  keep saying that Europe is against Greece, although Greece is  the nursery of civilization. At the same time, Greece is  probably the only country in the world in which the church has  not been separated from the state.    [Brljevic] How autocephalous is the Albanian Orthodox  church, considering the fact that one fourth of the Albanians  are Orthodox?    [Berisha] We insist that the Albanian Orthodox be  autocephalous. We did not oppose the Patriarchate of  Constantinople appointing Janullatos, a Greek, as patriarch,  because we do not want to meddle in the affairs of any religion.  The Greek authorities have recently demanded that I appoint  Greek ministers in the southern Albanian provinces, but I  answered that I had no intention of doing so. Namely, the  church has a hierarchy that has to be respected. I told them I  was very surprised by this demand of a government that is  supposed to be a democratic one.    [Brljevic] Did you communicate with the Greek authorities  directly?    [Berisha] During our first meeting, I asked them openly  about the so-called chauvinist circles. They said that they  could not do anything about it, that each country has its own  chauvinist circles. I told them that it was not right that  everyone should think the same and that I should see them all in  the same chauvinist circle.    [Brljevic] Do you think that this nationalism is  uncontrolled or that it is a product of a clever manipulation of  national feelings, an exponent of foreign, Serb, interests, and,  through them, Russian ones?    [Berisha] Greece is sailing, and constantly swaying, between  the East and the West, between these two tendencies. They are  dreaming about a Great Hellas with the Aegean capital at  Constantinople. They have got into the same nationalist fever  as the Serbs. I thought that both have paid a high enough price  for their blind nationalisms once in this century, but I was  wrong. Just look at the present-day Greece, talking about itself  as the nursery of civilization. It is to a much greater extent  Byzantine than it complies with the principles of modern  civilization. They, like their Orthodox brothers Serbs, are  much better at practicing Byzantine deviousness.  <H5>  The Fear and Lies of the East </H5>   [Brljevic] The Koran has been printed in Egypt in the  Albanian language. The introduction says that after the fall of  Communism a new plague, Christianity, hangs over Albania. Do  you not have the impression that nobody will leave you alone?    [Berisha] I agree with you. We are trying to act in  accordance with the principles of tolerance among the members of  all the three religions that have always been strong on the  Albanian territories. This is the reason this Koran, printed in  Egypt, has been the only book to be banned since I became  president. Perhaps it would be better to tear out the page, but  we decided to ban it by way of warning all those who could  attempt to do something similar. At any rate, the  above-mentioned sentence printed in the Koran opposes its  teaching, which does not allow favoring any religion.    [Brljevic] Is the impression that, despite your pro-Western  orientation, the Islamic countries have been investing more in  Albania, wrong?    [Berisha] Only partly. Europe is post-communist. After the  Iron Curtain came down, the duality on the continent was  revealed. The closeness of the Yugoslav conflict has also been  harmful to our economic development. Many Westerners have  promised to invest their capital once the war is over, and as  long as it seems that a great war is looming over the Balkans,  there is no chance of a stronger breakthrough of foreign  capital. Although we have opened our foreign policies toward  the world completely, they are still reserved about us because  we used to be so isolated. The greatest progress we have  achieved is with Italy, and we expect significant U.S. aid and  the aid of other, not only military, but also economic  superpowers. Croatia is surely one of our desired partners.  The neighboring Macedonia could also find a solution for the  relations with the Albanian ethnic community and become an even  more important economic partner for us.    [Brljevic] The people in all the post-communist countries  trust the United States more than Europe. Since this is also  the case with your country, how do you explain it?    [Berisha] All the newly-founded countries consider the  United States to be the main pillar of Western civilization.  The pro-U.S. atmosphere in Albania, including my own  disposition, does not in any way collide with the pro-European  orientation. In recent history, Europe would get involved in  wars as soon as the United States would take a distance, as soon  as it would stop functioning as the pillar of Western  civilization. The Westerners and Easterners have different  fates, different souls. One should always bear in mind that the  Easterners lived under dictatorships, which, together, made up  an empire founded on fear and lies. The people in this empire  aspired toward truth, the only light in their darkness. That is  why truth is their weak spot. Europe faced the fall of the Iron  Curtain unprepared. The entire West is now faced with the  crisis of civilization, the main expression of which is the war  in Bosnia. It clearly shows that the entire civilization, the  modern world, suffers from collective amnesia. Double standards  are used everywhere. We are all responsible for the evil that  is happening before our eyes, primarily Europe, in which the  public opinion has never been more tolerant of the horrors that  are happening in it, as they are now tolerant of the Bosnian  horrors.    No one can deny us the right to self-defense, as has been  done with the Muslims in Bosnia after the entire world had found  itself surprised with the Serb aggression. If the democratic  world order does not wake up in Bosnia, it could easily be  murdered in its selfish sleep. I have said this to every  Western politician I have had the chance to talk to.    [Brljevic] The West is still trying to make the Serbs come  to their senses through negotiations. In your opinion, how long  can this "Brusseling" and "Genevesing" last?    [Berisha] The international community must eventually take  specific measures, as sanctions, threats, and ultimatums are not  enough. Serbia, encouraged by the world's reluctance, can now  only understand the language of force, the speech of weapons.  It is still not too late for a military intervention. The  Serbs must pay for what they have done, they must bear the  consequences.    [Brljevic] Mr. Berisha, does the fact that they have only  been rewarded by the international community, which has agreed  to all the new conquests, not discourage you?    [Berisha] Double standards can be applied to almost  everything in this war. Plans, peace negotiations, and Security  Council resolutions are hardly more than alibis for passivity.  However, it is high time the world realized that any further  hesitation will lead to a great war on the Balkans. It is not  difficult to foresee what can follow.    [Brljevic] The Serbian repression in Kosovo is becoming more  intense by the day. Is that not a case of "ethnic cleansing"  without war?    [Berisha] Ethnic cleansing has been present in Kosovo for a  long time. The Serbian president has been trying to provoke a  war against the unarmed people in every possible way. Perhaps  the Greeks are provoking us with the same motives.  <H5>  Dialogue With Skopje </H5>   [Brljevic] What will you do if war breaks out in Kosovo?    [Berisha] We will not hesitate to help our brothers, you can  rely on that.    [Brljevic] Will Albania in that case declare war on Serbia  alone?    [Berisha] If there is a massacre in Kosovo, I am sure that a  NATO military intervention will be inevitable. The picture of  hundreds of thousands of people of Kosovo, our brothers, fleeing  to Macedonia before a massacre, means the explosion of  Macedonia. The next picture is giving a hand to the Albanian  brothers by Albania and Macedonia -- a new Balkan war.    [Brljevic] How have your relations with Macedonian president  Gligorov been since the Albanian minority was accused of  conspiracy and an attempt at creating Illyria?    [Berisha] Our overall relations are good, and we are  interested in the stability of Macedonia. There have been some  Byzantine tricks; the ones we remember especially well are the  ones organized three years ago.    [Brljevic] Albania has offered Macedonia access to the sea,  is that right?    [Berisha] We are glad we can help them. President Gligorov  has been trying to solve the difficulties in his country, torn  between Serbia and Greece, and sometimes he is suprisingly good  at it. Our joint interest is to create the atmosphere of  integration in the entire region, which has been falling apart  at the seams. The greatest enemy of the Balkans is after all its  allegedly greatest stability factor, the so-called Yugoslav  National Army. Its monstrous potential must be destroyed. The  United States has drawn the red line at Kosovo. President Bush  did it first, and President Clinton underlined it. Milosevic's  Serbia would be a factor of permanent instability on the  Balkans, a fact which has been taken very seriously in the  United States. Ten percent of the territory cannot dominate the  entire region.    [Brljevic] What are the indications of Milosevic's alleged  intention to spread the war on Kosovo?    [Berisha] Although he is pretending he would like peace,  Milosevic needs the war to stay in power. He has been promising  the Serbs peace for a long time, but the war is going on, and it  has become a way of life, a hypostatized Serb mentality. When  the Bosnian Serbs achieve their aims, which is evidently only a  question of time, Milosevic will need another conflict. While  the United Nations is protecting the occupied parts of Croatia,  they are cementing what has been conquered, and the danger of  the war spreading to the south after all is therefore much  greater.    [Brljevic] Meanwhile, Albania and Macedonia are competing  to acquire prophylaxis against Serb fascism, buying peace from  Serbia with oil?    [Berisha] These are only rumors. We are abiding strictly by  the embargo, since to support Serbia in its sick intentions in  this dirty war would be very stupid, dishonorable, and dangerous.  <H5>  The Recognized Borders </H5>   [Brljevic] Is the number of Albanian soldiers a secret?  What weapons do you have?    [Berisha] We have 35,000 soldiers. The outmoded Russian and  Chinese weapons have been preserved well; many Western experts  were surprised by how well preserved they are. Naturally, we  need new military technology, especially modern anti-aircraft  defense. We have warships, air forces, and heavy weapons. The  air forces are outmoded, but there is quite a lot of equipment.  We would like to reach European military standards. We have  reduced the term of compulsory military service. In agreement  with NATO we have carried out reforms in the army, which their  experts say are the most radical of all the reforms in the  former Communist countries. We have conducted an integral  reconstruction of our command staff in all the army corps. We  have democratized all the structures, which has significantly  changed the mentality of our officers. We have sent all those  above 48 years of age into retirement. However, it is not a  secret that in case there is a war we will be counting on NATO  and the United States. Albania has already joined the  preparations for the event a military intervention takes place  earlier.    [Brljevic] Could a possible intervention against Serbia  solve the problem of Kosovo?    [Berisha] No one can deny the Albanians of Kosovo the right  to self-determination. Serbia has violated the Yugoslav  constitution by denying Kosovo its autonomy, which is where  everything started. Up until then Kosovo was a constituent  element of the federation, two presidents of which were from  Kosovo. A military intervention would not solve the entire  problem, but it would certainly start the process of seeking a  democratic solution.    [Brljevic] Does that imply a Greater Albania?    [Berisha] There will be no changing of borders by force! We  have recognized the borders of the former Yugoslav republics,  and all we are asking is some democratic space for the members  of our nation, wherever they may be. We insist on the right of  a nation to make its own decisions about its future. In a  democratic atmosphere there is no need to "raise" borders.</p>

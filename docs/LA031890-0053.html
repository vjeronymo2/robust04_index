			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS HOPE TO GAIN FROM ROHRABACHER'S DRILLING STAND  </P> <P> Two days after the tanker American Trader began hemorrhaging off Huntington  Beach, U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher appeared at the oil spill scene and said the  accident underscored the need for more offshore oil drilling in California.  </P> <P> "I watched it on TV," said Republican Bob Ryan, a member of the Rancho Palos  Verdes City Council. "I thought, 'No, Dana, stay out of this, this is not the  time to discuss that issue.' "  </P> <P> Democrats working to dislodge Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) from his 42nd  Congressional District seat hope Ryan's fears were well-founded.  </P> <P> Faced with a district in which Republicans hold a decisive 53% share of  registered voters, Democrats are trying to turn public concern about oil spills  -- and Rohrabacher's advocacy of offshore drilling -- to their advantage.  </P> <P> An early sign of that strategy is expected Wednesday, when Guy Kimbrough, one  of three Democrats running for Rohrabacher's seat, plans to draw attention to  the oil issue by announcing his candidacy on Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> "This is a wedge issue," said Steve Beale, a Democratic organizer in Torrance.  "It's the kind of issue that can set Republicans against Republicans."  </P> <P> GOP strategists say the Democrats are clutching at straws. Said Steve Johnson,  director of the Los Angeles County GOP: "When the Democrats park their cars and  walk, maybe they'll have an issue."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, a former Reagan speech writer elected to Congress in 1988, does  not support offshore drilling across the board. He says he opposes sinking new  wells within sight of shore in areas that have not yet had any drilling, unless  the affected coastal communities support it.  </P> <P> To that end, however, he is working on a bill that would require the federal  government to share royalties from new offshore oil production with the  nation's coastal cities affected by the drilling.  </P> <P> He clearly hopes that such a measure would soften opposition to drilling in his  largely coastal district, which snakes south from Torrance and the Palos Verdes  Peninsula all the way to Huntington Beach. So far the local response has been  hostile, however.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher argues that extracting crude with oil platforms and piping it  ashore is sounder strategically and safer environmentally than receiving it  from distant states or foreign countries by ship.  </P> <P> He points to the safety record of oil platforms in his district off Long Beach,  Seal Beach and Huntington Beach. "A few gallons here, a few gallons there,  (but) there has never been a spill," he said in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> And Rohrabacher, who does not have a primary opponent, says he doubts that his  position will hurt him in the Nov. 6 general election.  </P> <P> "It's totally defensible," he said.  </P> <P> Democrats say Rohrabacher's drilling advocacy could hurt him more than he  thinks, particularly in light of events that might give Californians reason to  fear oil spills.  </P> <P> The most recent, of course, was last month's 394,000-gallon American Trader  spill, which killed more than 700 birds and closed 20 miles of Orange County  beaches, many of them for more than a month.  </P> <P> Democrats also point to the Bush Administration's consideration of a plan to  sell federal drilling leases in three offshore areas believed to be rich in oil  and gas: Lease Sale 95 off the Southern California coast, Lease Sale 91 off  Northern California and Lease Sale 116 off Southwest Florida.  </P> <P> Lease Sale 95 would encompass 6.7 million acres of ocean bottom stretching from  the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis Obispo County. Lease Sale  91 would cover 1.1 million acres off Mendocino and Humboldt counties.  </P> <P> In his latest campaign mailer, Democrat challenger Kimbrough juxtaposed his own  public statements in opposition to Lease Sale 95 with the pro-drilling comments  Rohrabacher made to reporters last month at Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Kimbrough, a political science instructor, thinks Rohrabacher's support for oil  drilling can be tied to his anti-abortion activism as proof that the  congressman, formerly a Libertarian, is out of step with the GOP rank and file.  </P> <P> The other Democrats in the race agree. Like Kimbrough, Jim Cavuoto, the owner  of a small publishing business in Torrance, and Bryan Stevens, former president  of the California Teachers Assn., oppose offshore drilling and government  prohibitions on abortion.  </P> <P> "Rohrabacher's views don't fit in with those of the average Republican voter  sitting at home," Cavuoto said. "If Republicans can see the clear alternative,  and that's our challenge, I believe that in this race, in this district and in  this year, many Republican voters will vote for a Democrat."  </P> <P> Republican politicians have a range of opinions on whether Cavuoto's analysis  is correct.  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilman John McTaggart said that on the Palos  Verdes Peninsula, Republicans are extremely concerned about Rohrabacher's stand  on oil drilling.  </P> <P> "This is a very important issue. Here, we have conservative people who are  environmentally minded," McTaggart said. "I've got to tell you, I think (GOP  strategists) are wrong if they don't think this is an issue."  </P> <P> Dan Walker, a Torrance City Council member, disagrees: "Republicans aren't  going to vote for a Democrat because of any single issue."  </P></p>

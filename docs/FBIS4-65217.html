			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Carmen del Riego and Rosa Paz report: "Madrid PSOE </F> Achieves Integration of All Sectors"]    [Text] Madrid -- The Madrid Socialist Federation (FSM)  congress closed yesterday with an integration agreement that  enables the four sectors represented -- renewalists, Guerraists,  Socialist Left, and Grassroots Renewalists [Renovadores por la  Base] -- to be on the new Executive Committee, confirming the  agreement previously reached by Joaquin Leguina and Jose Acosta  that the secretary general would be renewalist Jaime Lissavetzky.    This agreement encountered an obstacle when it came to  allocating the area secretaryships and, in particular, the  secretaryship for political and institutional relations, which  was being demanded by Guerraists and renewalists, nearly  thwarting integration. A further meeting of the two Madrid  leaders was needed for agreement to be restored.    The new Executive Committee, which was elected by 86.43  percent of the votes, is chaired by Jose Acosta, who, together  with Joaquin Leguina and Juan Barranco, who remain as members,  won the congress' loudest applause. With renewalist Jaime  Lissavetzky as secretary general, the rest of the leadership was  divided 50-50 between the two sectors, which had to negotiate  with the the other two -- United Left [IU] and the Grassroots  Renewalists -- in order to bring them into the Executive  Committee.    Joaquin Leguina had one of the greatest problems in ensuring  that integration reached all sectors with IU, which was backing  for the secretary generalship Pedro Sabando, who finally took  over the deputy secretary generalship. At 0400, following a  meeting of the IU delegates, these decided to join the  leadership in the posts offered to them by Leguina. The  agreement between Jose Acosta and the Grassroots Renewalists --  a sector that emerged from a split in the Madrid renewalists --  was easier.    As a result of these agreements, the Executive Committee  comprises 44 members, of whom 16 belong to the renewalist  sector, 18 to the Guerraist sector, six to IU, and four to the  Grassroots Renewalists. In this distribution, the Guerraists  take the chairmanship and the secretaryships for organization,  institutional policy, education and culture (which falls to a  Grassroots Renewalists representative), relations with society,  and training, while the renewalists have the secretary  generalship, the deputy secretary generalship, administration  and finances, studies and programs (held by IU), the  secretaryship for women, and a deputy secretaryship for  institutional policy.    The creation of this deputy secretaryship unblocked the  dispute between the two sectors, since in this way the  renewalists accepted that a renewalist -- Jorge Gomez, regarded  as belonging to this sector's flexible wing -- should hold the  secretaryship for institutional policy, while renewalist  Francisco Garrido will hold the deputy secretaryship.    The various FSM sectors acknowledged after the congress the  effort at integration made by everybody in order to reach an  agreement that would not represent a false conclusion, as has  happened at previous congresses. Achieving this solution, which  through concessions by all sides has secured an Executive  Committee that everybody asserts "will be able to work  unitedly," was facilitated by the political crisis suffered by  the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and the latest  corruption scandals, which were also the central aspect of the  congress proceedings and of the secretary general's speech.    The FSM acknowledges in a resolution "the damage caused by  the recent scandals," although it states that "the use made of  them by the right and certain news media is also very clear,"  and so there is a dual task: "to eliminate from our ranks all  the corrupt people there may be, acting diligently and  forcefully, and calling people to account where appropriate; and  to defend supportively all honest comrades who are falsely  accused, not allowing wholesale suspicion to set in." This is a  task which Lissavetzky summed up as follows: "Neither certain  corruption nor false accusation will go unpunished."    Corruption was mentioned by the new FSM secretary general,  who announced in his speech following the election of the new  Executive Committee the setting up of an ethics committee, which  will govern the Madrid Socialists' conduct "so that society will  realize that it is noble to work in politics and that most of us  are honest." Recalling an advertisement for a cleaning product,  he asserted that "we Socialists will pass the cotton test  clearly and will pass it easily."    But the main thrust of Lissavetzky's speech was directed at  unity and the loyal and integrative work that he believes has  been achieved with the new Executive Committee -- "a reflection  of the federal congress' spirit" -- and that, in his opinion,  ensures that the FSM "is not the PSOE's Bronx, and if we are, we  are a comfortable and habitable Bronx, but we will never be the  Socialist Party's ugly duckling. I am proud to belong to the  FSM."</p>

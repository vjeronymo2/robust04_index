The raided islands are Amamong, Ine Abasi, Utang Iyak, Onosi,  Uberofim, Akpa Edok, Edem Abasi, Ekpai, and Akwa Isong. The  NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA reports that some 4,000 refugees from the  islands, attacked by the gendarmes in an earlier raid on January  19, are now living in unhealthy and harsh weather conditions in  Abana and Atabong fishing settlements. Some of the refugees,  who accused the gendarmes of cold-blooded murder, said the  latest attack was the worst in the history of the peninsula.</p>

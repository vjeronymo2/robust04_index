			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY IS USED TO WORKING WITH A NET;  </P> <P> 3 GENERATIONS OF TUNA FISHERMEN SAW IT ALL CHANGE  </P> <P> In the early 1900s, Julius Zolezzi and his wife, Victoria, moved to San Diego  from San Francisco, bought the Pacaritto and began fishing for halibut and rock  cod with his son, John.  </P> <P> But in 1932, when Zolezzi saw that more money was to be made in the tuna  industry, he bought the Balboa, a seiner. The Point Loma family has been  fishing for tuna ever since.  </P> <P> Three generations and eight boats later, Zolezzi's great-grandson, John Zolezzi  III, is carrying on the tradition. The 33-year-old skipper and his crew are  scheduled to leave today aboard the Mary Antoinette on an expedition that will  last anywhere from five weeks to three months in international waters off  Mexico. Then he'll be back with his family for two or three weeks before  returning to sea.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Like It Used to Be'  </P> <P> Much has changed since his father, John Zolezzi Jr., 56, retired in 1974 and  turned the seiner over to his son.  </P> <P> Tuna fishing "is not a family operation like it used to be," said John Jr. "We  are one of the few family-operated and -owned tuna boats."  </P> <P> John Sr., 79, agreed. Families "are selling out to big corporations and foreign  companies," he said.  </P> <P> "There are people in the business that don't know anything about the business,"  complained John Jr.  </P> <P> He said it is the corporate-run fishing boats whose captains take shortcuts and  make trouble for other fishermen. He cited incidents in which porpoises, which  are often found near tuna, were killed after becoming tangled in the nets. The  seiners are now required to have an observer from the National Marine Fisheries  Service aboard while fishing, in order to protect the mammals, but even before  that rule, "we tried saving the porpoises all the time," he said.  </P> <P> "Without the porpoise, you can't find the fish. If you do this long-term, you  do what's proper."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $340 to $1,000 a Ton  </P> <P> The changing industry has also changed the face of San Diego. Only a few years  ago, the city's harbor bustled with tuna seiners that came to unload their  gorged bellies at half a dozen canneries. Since the last cannery closed in  1984, the Zolezzi family has gone to the only remaining one nearby, the Pan  Pacific Cannery at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. There, depending on the  size of the tuna, the Zolezzis are paid anywhere from $340 to $1,000 a ton.  </P> <P> In recent years, the family has made a determined effort to avoid the shores of  other countries. In 1979, John Jr.'s brother, Julius, owned one of the eight  seiners that was seized near the Peruvian border because it was fishing too  close to the coast. The family now stays 12 to 20 miles offshore. (Julius now  operates three seiners in the East Pacific, and is director of the American  Tuna Boat Assn.)  </P> <P> Despite these changes, the big advantage of being a family-run business has  remained: The Zolezzis are able to set their own schedules. As much as they  can, they try to stay home for the holidays.  </P> <P> "A corporation will send you out, Christmas or no Christmas. That's the  difference between being a corporation and a family," John Jr. said.  </P> <P> Still, he acknowledges that he is happier now that his son has taken over and  is thankful for the time he can spend with his grandchildren. "My kids grew up  and I didn't even know it," he said.  </P> <P> John III agreed that being separated from wife, Machelle, daughter, Chalise,  and son, John IV, isn't easy.  </P> <P> "For the first week, you don't even think that you're on the boat. Then you  realize that it's your business; it's your life. You accept it."  </P> <P> Will 7-year-old John IV be the next Zolezzi to fill the shoes of the fisherman?  His father doubts it.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty sure he'll go to college," John III said. "He loves the boat and  loves to fish, but I hope he does whatever makes him happy."  </P></p>

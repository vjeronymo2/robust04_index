			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises mildly, regaining 19,500 mark Stepped-up corporate and public fund buying helped stocks post a modest recovery in a quiet trading session, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 38.71 to 19,507.60, just above the 19,500 mark breached by Tuesday's 345.47 drop. The market traded in a relatively narrow range from a high of 19,566.01 to a low of 19,479.20. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by 541 to 432, with 206 stocks unchanged. Brokers attributed the rally to technical factors and the renewed participation of public funds, which had remained on the sidelines on Tuesday. Trading volume improved from 231.7m shares to 280m. The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 6.84 up at 1,569.59, but the second section index was off 12.00 at 2,219.43. The Nikkei 300 firmed 1.15 to 287.19 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.74 at 1,286.45. Japan Telecom fell for the third day this week, closing below Y4m for the first time since its listing on September 6. The closely watched new issue shed Y70,000 to Y3.95m. Investors who bought the stock in a pre-listing public offering and auction paid between Y4.7m and Y6.6m. Some brokers felt that many were now selling to cut mounting losses. Rising gold prices took Sumitomo Mining up Y26 to Y980 in the day's highest volume of 8.2m shares. Steelmakers were heavily represented among active stocks. Nippon Steel, the second most active, ended flat at Y385, but Kawasaki Steel rose Y6 to Y438 and Kobe Steel inched up Y1 to Y327. Automobile shares made a strong showing. Toyota Motor gained Y20 at Y2,030, Nissan Motor Y8 at Y794 and Honda Y30 at Y1,630. Major trading houses also gained ground. Itochu moved ahead Y17 to Y712 and Sumitomo Y22 to Y970. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y20 to Y1,580 after Tuesday's news that it would issue two domestic convertible bonds totalling Y200bn. Other electricals fared better. Hitachi rose Y7 to Y962, Oki Electric Industry Y20 to Y775 and NEC Y10 to Y1,180. In Osaka the OSE average advanced 16.11 to 21,859.98 in volume of 39.7m shares. Roundup Unchanged US interest rates after yesterday's FOMC meeting had only a limited effect on the region. Taiwan was closed for a holiday. SINGAPORE used the US Federal Reserve's decision as an excuse to go bargain hunting, and investors who had sold on expectations of a US interest rate rise were forced to cover sizeable short positions. The Straits Times Industrial index moved up 40.85 to 2,330.69, with an estimated 283m shares traded. Malaysian shares traded over the counter as measured by the UOB-OTC index closed 9.39 down at 1,267.76. MBf Capital led the actives, falling 18 cents to SDollars 1.88 in more than 24m shares dealt, while Samanda Holdings dropped 85 cents to SDollars 5.60 after news that its attempt to take a stake in MBf Capital had failed. HONG KONG closed off its highs in thin trade, but buying linked to the September index futures settlement today helped the Hang Seng index finish a net 83.25 up at 9,693.49 after touching 9,747.45. Turnover edged up to HKDollars 2.98bn from HKDollars 2.96bn. The Hang Seng H-share index jumped 31.62 or 2.3 per cent to 1,409.68. Analysts said shares in Chinese-incorporated companies were rebounding from recent weakness. SHANGHAI's A share index, meanwhile, closed just over 5 per cent better, up 45.36 at 943.22 in turnover of Yn3.62bn, on hopes for positive market news from the fourth plenary session of the 14th central committee of the Chinese Communist party in Beijing. SYDNEY stayed uncertain over the direction of interest rates, and the All Ordinaries index ended only 0.4 up at 2,014.2. Brokers said the market was disappointed that the US Fed left interest rates unchanged, and that they would have to rise sooner or later. WELLINGTON declined on high existing interest rates, the NZSE-40 Index slipping 14.98 to 2,068.60. MANILA took a sharp tumble and Wall Street was partly to blame. PLDT dropped by 2.7 per cent to 1,420 pesos following its Dollars 1 1/4 slide to Dollars 56 1/4 in New York overnight. Brokers blamed foreign exchange appreciation in recent weeks. The composite index fell 56.58 to 2,877.69. The other main contributor to the fall was Meralco 'A', 3.6 per cent lower at 267.50 pesos because a state pension fund offer of shares to its members at 250 pesos was encouraging arbitraging. SEOUL saw profit-taking, the composite index dipping 12.22 to 1,039.79. BOMBAY was still shaken by plague fears and the BSE 30-share index lost 37.73 to end at a provisional 4,406.83. KUALA LUMPUR encountered heavy afternoon profit-taking and the KLSE composite index shed 8.77 to 1,140.83 after a morning high of 1,158.88.</p>

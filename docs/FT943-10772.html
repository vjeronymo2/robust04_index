			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Observer: Glen who? So why does the international trading group Marc Rich want us to call it Glencore from now on? Is this the rump of two partners' names fused together, or perhaps the location of a Speyside whisky distillery? No, in the dreary fashion of our times it turns out to be yet another acronym - standing for global energy, commodities and resources. Still, it is a lot better than most of the gibberish titles, such as Zeneca, Varity, Navistar and Exxon, that companies shell out hundreds of thousands of pounds to have invented for them. A name change has been mooted since Marc Rich himself stepped down from the chair last December and reduced his majority stake to a 25 per cent holding. He plans to dispose of that too before very long. Rich has been wanted in the US on tax evasion, fraud and racketeering charges for more than a decade. So it is perhaps understandable that the company wants to dispense with a handle almost every public reference to which is prefaced by that embarrassing little word - 'fugitive'.</p>

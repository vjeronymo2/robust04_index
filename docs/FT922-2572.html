			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Nalgo to ballot on one-day strike NALGO, the public-service union, is to ballot 20,000 workers in polytechnics and further-education colleges on striking over a 4.3 per cent pay offer. If approved, a one-day strike would be held on August 20, when A-level results are announced. Meanwhile, the union's gas committee rejected a 4 per cent offer from British Gas, but is awaiting the outcome of talks next week before considering a strike ballot. The GMB general union is to ballot white-collar workers at British Gas over the offer.</p>

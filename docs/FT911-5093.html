			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / German builders win 7% wage rise A million workers in the west German building industry yesterday won a 7 per cent pay increase for this year, writes David Goodhart in Bonn. That is more than twice the expected inflation rate for 1991 and, in the light of recent warnings from the Bundesbank, increases the likelihood of higher German interest rates. The employers had hoped to keep the deal to just under 7 per cent. However, their acceptance of the slightly higher figure means the bigger negotiating group in the metal industry, covering about 6m workers, is also likely to win at least 7 per cent. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank board member, said yesterday German interest rates had to stay relatively firm to protect the D-Mark and limit domestic price risks. Lex, Page 20</p>

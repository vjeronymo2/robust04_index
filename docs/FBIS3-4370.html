			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Long Yongtu, director of the International </F> Bureau of the Ministry of International Trade and Economic  Cooperation, by Yuki Nagamochi; place and date not given]    [Text] A working-level meeting to examine China's  application to join GATT will start in Geneva on 15 March.  Fundamentally, Japan, the United States, and European nations  support the application to help China, which is making a  remarkable economic development, get used to the rules of  international trade. However, there is a gap between the  demands of China and other countries. This paper interviewed  Long Yongtu, director of the Ministry of International Trade and  Economic Cooperation International Bureau and leader of a  Chinese negotiation team, and heard "what China has to say."    [Nagamochi] Lately, China is stressing its "flexibility" at  negotiations for joining GATT. Why?    [Long] "The GATT member nations began to talk with us about  the emergency restriction on imports of Chinese products. To  us, this is discrimination. However, they explained to us that  it is a temporary measure which will be taken until China  establishes a market economy. This is the reason."    "However, it is still uncertain if we will ultimately accept  it. Such matters as a guarantee that it is a temporary measure  and that China will be allowed to have thorough discussions with  our partner nations until imposition of the restriction will be  preconditions for our acceptance. We will start official  discussions with the GATT members on such points."    [Nagamochi] China's average tariff rate is about 30 percent.  It is still high. Is China ready to lower tariffs?    [Long] "Needless to say, we will make significant reductions  on the basis of the agreement, reached at the Uruguay Round, on  lowering tariff rates. We already submitted our schedules for  abolishing the system of issuing import permits for many goods."    [Nagamochi] China is assuming the stand that "unreasonable  demands that transcend the level of our economic development  cannot be accepted."    [Long] We want to be treated as a developing country. For  example, World Trade Organization (WTO) member nations are  required to abolish their restrictions on business activities of  foreign-affiliated companies in their countries in two years if  they are developed countries. It is four years for developing  countries. China can abolish its restrictions in five years.    The American delegates, who visited China recently, made  unreasonable demands. We are applying for GATT membership on  the basis of our own needs. We will actively introduce measures  with the aim of joining GATT. However, we will not join GATT if  it will harm our economic and trade interests.</p>

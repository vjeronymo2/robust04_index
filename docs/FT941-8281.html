			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Management: Fast mover in a changing world - Bessel Kok's efforts to push Belgacom from bureaucratic leviathan to autonomous enterprise  / Euromanager to watch Bessel Kok admits that Belgacom's image was a standing joke when he took over as chief executive of Belgium's state-owned telecommunications group at the beginning of 1992. Delays in connecting subscribers were 'extravagant' - some 50,000 people were waiting for telephones. The mobile telephone service was 'lousy' and Belgacom, formerly called RTT, was seen as an unfriendly, bureaucratic leviathan. 'That's pretty heavy as a core service problem,' says Kok. His task - to transform Belgacom into an autonomous enterprise, free of direct government control - has been further complicated by European Commission plans for complete liberalisation of ordinary telephone calls by 1998. At the same time, the cash-hungry Belgian finance ministry has started to size up the company for privatisation, and telecoms competitors have begun forging international alliances. But on January 5 this year, Kok announced that Belgacom had achieved the goals of its ambitious 1992-93 strategy: it had reduced the time taken to connect most new customers to 20 days - and set a target of five days by the end of this year, launched a new image, and established a modern, digital mobile telephone network with Pacific Telesis International, a subsidiary of PacTel, the US telecommunications group. 'Some of you didn't believe we were going to meet this deadline,' he told journalists. 'But we have.' Kok came to Belgacom from Swift, the global money transmission network for banks, where he was chief executive for seven years. A dedicated chess fan and professor of strategic management at Brussels' Flemish University, he arrived with private-sector preconceptions about Belgacom's inefficient bureaucracy. However, he was 'absolutely astonished' by the attitude of most of the company's 26,000 staff. 'The company had a very strong willingness to change,' says Kok. 'It went very deep in the organisation. And if you really analyse it, that's logical: it isn't funny to be perceived by the majority of the public as a sleepy organisation that doesn't listen.' Kok's management style is direct. He began Belgacom's metamorphosis with a letter to staff telling them 'tomorrow will not be like yesterday' and that the old monopoly certainties were being undermined by technological advances and pan-European liberalisation. 'As an organisation, we believe that this is irreversible,' Kok said. 'As far as our company is concerned, we do not believe that there will be a return to what we call the old times.' Since Kok's arrival the group's 4m subscribers have become 'clients', whose needs are paramount. A marketing department was set up with 100 staff and a referendum issued to customers to find out what they thought about Belgacom. The 60,000 who replied said the biggest problem was still the long wait for service, from installation of a telephone to a simple directory inquiry. Kok has moved fast to find solutions to these problems. 'Belgacom was late in the process of transformation,' he says. 'That's why we were in a hurry. The Dutch, French, Scandinavians, even the Swiss, started their transformation programmes earlier than we did, which was a pity because in the late 1960s Belgacom was one of the leading operators in Europe.' Kok has tried the tempers of his political and boardroom bosses, some of whom he believes were still steeped in the public sector culture. In late 1992, only 11 months into the job, his management - particularly of the financial, personnel and mobile telephone dossiers - came under fire from the board. Kok says he had difficulty coping with the interventionist attitude of some directors and admits that at first he felt he had more support from below than above. 'It was extremely difficult for me to implement immediately what I call a private-sector model of authority and duties,' says Kok. 'In the beginning, the board perceived its authority as going far more into operational responsibilities than is done in the private sector.' Kok says the situation has been 'improved but not resolved'. Certainly his position no longer seems as precarious as it was painted 18 months ago. He is no stranger to combat between executive and non-executive directors. At Swift, which he joined in 1973, he struggled in vain with the organisation's dominant bank shareholders, who resisted his proposals to restructure the board, invest more power in the executive directors, and expand the network to users other than banks. At Belgacom, Kok also has to contend with the possibility that the government may launch a premature privatisation. The finance ministry has repeatedly hinted at partial flotation as part of its modest four-year privatisation programme, which ends in 1996. That is a short-term challenge which Kok could clearly do without. Although a fast worker, he believes a hasty privatisation could do more harm than good. As he put it in a speech in December last year: 'Privatisation should be based on a clear decision of the government to go for it and then be built on a scenario of careful trade-offs (between investment, social and budgetary concerns) and, especially, appropriate timing.' Kok's main priority now is to seek other international partners. He has already overcome some internal opposition. His executive committee warned him that giving Pacific Telesis a share of the mobile telephone joint venture was 'giving the jewels away and linking up with potential competition'. As it turned out, the two companies were able to transform Belgium's mobile network in five months.</p>

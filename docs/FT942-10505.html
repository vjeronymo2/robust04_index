			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Burns Philp lifts profits to ADollars 46m Burns Philp, the Australian group which has been disposing of non-core assets to concentrate on its food ingredients business, said it made a profit before interest and tax of ADollars 46.4m (USDollars 32.6m) in the third quarter to end-March. This compares with ADollars 39m in the same period a year ago, but includes ADollars 12m profit on asset sales. Without those, earnings would have declined 12 per cent. After-tax profits for the quarter were ADollars 20.5m, against ADollars 21.4m, and for the nine months, ADollars 96.8m, against ADollars 75.9m.</p>

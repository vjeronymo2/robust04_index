			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: US bank sees cut in derivative use Many companies are reducing their use of financial derivatives following the upheaval in financial markets of the past two months, a senior executive of Bankers Trust, the US bank, said yesterday. There was likely to be 'some slowdown (in the use of derivatives) as policies and procedures are tightened up among corporate users,' said Mr Tim Yates, the bank's chief financial officer. 'That in itself may be a good thing,' he added, and predicted that the use of derivatives to manage financial risk would continue to grow in the long term. Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank which has been one of the most active banks in selling derivative instruments to help companies manage risk, has been threatened with legal action by two companies in the past 10 days which have lost money on rate swaps. Procter &amp; Gamble last week put its losses at Dollars 102m, while Gibson Greetings, a US greetings card company, said on Tuesday that it faced a paper loss of Dollars 19.7m. These and other losses have led many companies to review the risks they may be running through their corporate treasury activities. Mr Yates said companies that had lost money on derivatives were a minority. A review of the trades with Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson had shown them to be 'correct and proper in every way'. Bankers Trust provided more details yesterday of its trading results in the first quarter, which were well below 1993 levels. The bank said it lost Dollars 49m on trading for its own account, an activity which made Dollars 594m in 1993.</p>

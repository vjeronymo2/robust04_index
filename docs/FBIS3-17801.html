Tomorrow, after presenting its report in Parliament,  the CEC will finish the activity, stated its president Nicolae  Timofte. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of  Moldova] leader, told BASAPRESS that the first Parliamentary  session will probably be opened by the most senior member,  Artiom Lazarev (the Block of the Socialist Party and  "Unitate-Edinstvo" Movement). First of all, the new  Parliamentary Speaker, the Vice-Speakers and the permanent  commissions will be titled; after that, the Parliamentary  guidelines will be announced, said Motpan. Projects of the  Constitution and of the special juridical status for the Eastern  and Southern regions will be debated, along with economic  questions. The PDAM will propose ex-speaker Petru Lucinschi for  Speaker and for Premier, Andrei Sangheli, the present premier,  said Motpan. Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party,  declared to BASAPRESS that his faction has already proposed for  the first session a draft decision for suspending the  Governmental decision on the linguistic attestation. In Senic's  view, priority will be given to the ratification of the CIS  Economic Union document and to regional problems in Eastern and  Southern Moldova. Alexandru Mosanu, leader of the Block of  Peasants and Intellectuals, told BASAPRESS that his faction will  insist on the adoption of a new agenda of the session reflecting  the crucial priorities; such problems as the granting of a  special status to Dniestr cannot be solved until after the  ratification of the new Constitution. The concept proposed for  the forming of the new parliament with the specification "13th  since the first Supreme Soviet of Moldova" is inadmissible in  principle, as the Parliament elected on Friday 27th is not a  constitution of the Moldovan Socialist Soviet Republic Supreme  Soviet. A basic task of the opposition will be the defense of  democracy and liberties which have been established and the  promotion of radical reforms, already being slowed now by forces  that form the Parliamentary majority, said Mosanu. Lurie Rosca,  leader of the Christian Democratic Popular Front, declared that  his faction will demand from the very first session efficient  actions for the release of deputy Ilie Ilascu. Rosca asserted  that the Parliamentary and Governmental leadership will be  "monochrome," and the opposition factions will be marginalized.</p>

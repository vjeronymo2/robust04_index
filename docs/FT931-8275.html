			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (3): Slow-down takes effect - David Buchan assesses the region's industrial prospects ECONOMIC slowdown generally comes late to the Rhone-Alpes, because the region has so many successful industrial firms, with diversified products and markets. But come it has, says Mr Etienne Subra, regional director of the Banque de France. Unemployment rose by 10 per cent during 1992. Mr Subra dates the downturn to last May-June, after domestic demand began to fall but before defence of the franc pushed real interest rates still higher. Again, the fall-off in export orders from Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain began before the currencies of the latter three countries depreciated against the franc in September. The depressing effect on the region's industry has been widespread, though Mr Subra reports that the food, glass-making, pharmacy and some parts of the textile sectors held up well through 1992, and says the improvement in the US economy is leading to more orders for the region's chemicals, capital equipment and aeronautic exports. The one real black spot, as elsewhere, is the property market. This is 'very bad,' says Mr Subra; Lyon now harbours 18 months' worth of unsold or unlet office space and 2 years' worth of residential real estate. Part of the rise in the region's unemployed (threatening, for the first time, qualified middle management on permanent payrolls), is attributable to company managers' fast reaction. 'It is not that the bosses are turning to redundancies as a first resort when orders start to fall,' says Mr Subra. 'It is just that they are much quicker to run through the whole gamut of austerity measures - reining in general costs, cutting down on stocks and inventories and, lastly, making redundancies - than they used to be'. The financial as distinct from the human consequences of this more active management style is the greater soundness of Rhone-Alpes companies; by the end of 1991 they had reduced their total debt to the level of their own funds and equity. Over the longer term Rhone-Alpes can count on the natural advantages of its central location to attract investment, domestic and foreign. Mr Jean Chemain, director of the Lyon chamber of commerce, believes that Switzerland's obtuse rejection in December of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty can only benefit Rhone-Alpes, as Swiss companies move investment westward to give themselves a base within the EC single market. Mr Phillipe Brossette, marketing director of Renault VI, the car group's truck-making arm, lists Lyon's advantages, which include good road and rail (TGV) links and direct flights to most European capitals (four times daily to London). These are just the sort of geographical merits which have made Mr Michel Coste, head of Lyon's Institute for the Ecu, a persistent champion of the city for the suggested European central bank. Mr Coste notes with delight that, against an EC majority preference for locating it in Bonn, the UK presidency touted Lyon at the EC summit at Edinburgh. But it is history, rather than geography, which has attracted to the region the two biggest employers: Renault VI and Rhone-Poulenc. Renault VI was formed out of the 1978 merger between Renault's (smaller) truck subsidiary Saviem and the (larger) independent Berliet company. The merged company made its headquarters round the Berliet operation in Lyon; far more extensive than Saviem's assets, and bringing with it 600 hectares of prime industrial land in the adjacent Lyon suburbs of St Priest and Venissieux. (Renault still grows maize on some of this land - until such time as its factories expand further.) Lyon is also the home of many of Renault's best clients, such as the trucking firm of Mr Norbert Dentresangle who, since he made his start taking apples to the UK, has built up a fleet of 2,400 vehicles. Today Renault VI - part-owned by Volvo - is third in Europe and the world. In 1991 it churned out 58,638 trucks in Europe and, through its wholly-owned Mack subsidiary, 13,229 in the US. For several years Renault VI's European market was better than the US one (the two almost cancelled each other out in the 1991 after-tax profits, which showed a FFrs 23m profit). Now the new world is being asked to redress imbalance in the old world. 'But the problem is that the European market is getting worse - truck output in France falling from 52,000 in 1990 to 35,000 last year - faster than the US market is getting better.' Renault VI is now demanding of its suppliers something of the same specialisation it has forced on itself. Just as each Renault factory in the Rhone Alpes region focuses on a single activity - truck assembly (above 18 tonnes) at Bourg-en-Bresse, gearboxes in St Etienne Boutheon, motors at St Priest/Venissieux, bus assembly at Annonay - so it is asking its suppliers to concentrate more on its needs. Its aim is to reduce by two thirds its existing 1,500 subcontractors, which range from Bosh in Germany, to Lucas-Girling disk brakes in the UK to a host of smaller suppliers in the Rhone-Alpes region. Part of this reduction is to have a closer, Japanese-style partnership with a larger and more capable brand of subcontractor. By contrast, Rhone-Poulenc, the region's top employer, has scattered 16,500 local employees across Rhone-Alpes in 16 factories, 14 technical and commercial centres and six research units. Chemicals have become something of a Rhone-Alpes speciality, with Elf-Acquitaine, Atocem, Lafarge Coppe, Roussel-Uclaf and ICI all attracted by abundant water, energy and opportunity to trade basic chemicals among each other. Inevitably, Rhone-Poulenc has come under local pressure to clean up its local act. 'We don't deny the necessity of doing this,' says Mr Xavier Patrouillard, the chemical group's Rhone-Alpes co-ordinator, 'but we do sometimes contest the deadlines by which we are forced to make urgent investments at very high prices, leaving less money for other projects. The Rhone may be cleaner, but there is perhaps more unemployment.' He concedes that Rhone Poulenc has an image to redress. 'Twenty years ago, if you worked for Rhone Poulenc, people thought that was fantastic. No longer.' But Mr Patrouillard believes the times may be changing. One reason for this is the economic climate, creating greater awareness of the opportunity costs of channelling very large amounts of money into the environment. Another reason is that the Lyonnais now know 'that their city pollutes the Rhone more than we do'.</p>

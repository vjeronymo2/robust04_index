			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Radio Contact With Four Missing UN </F> Soldiers"]    [Text] The Hague -- The Defense Ministry has reestablished  contact with four of the five Netherlander UN observers who were  missing in Bosnia.    The only person with whom contact has not been made is Major  Van Baal, who left to take leave 10 days ago in Sarajevo,  against UN advice.    Development Cooperation Minister Pronk made an appeal on the  radio this morning [20 April] for the West to send more ground  troops to Bosnia. According to Pronk, the Serbs must be  convinced by the reinforcement of the international peacekeeping  force that the international community is "serious."    Since the UN troops have only a peacekeeping mission, air  strikes are only allowed if UN troops are directly endangered.  Neither the Air Force nor the ground troops, who are in the  UN's service, have a mandate to impose peace. Moreover, they  operate only with the consent of the belligerents in Bosnia.    Within NATO, there have been hurried consultations to decide  whether NATO aircraft can also be put into action if the  populations of the "safe areas" are directly endangered, as was  the case in Goradze. The Security Council has never given a  mandate for ground actions. Ground troops must indeed protect  the population of the "safe areas" and provide assistance for  the passage of humanitarian transport.    Pronk's statements are causing increasing irritation at the  Defense Ministry and some high-level military officials fear  that the military and political opinions of the development  cooperation minister could cause confusion among the Netherlands  military regarding Netherlands policy. [Defense] Minister Relus  Ter Beek has repeatedly said that the Netherlands could not  deliver more ground troops since there are not enough  sufficiently trained career military personnel.    Ter Beek let it be known to those around him that Pronk was  speaking for himself and was not giving the government view.  The safety of the Netherlands troops has not been endangered  through actions taken in recent days, the Defense Ministry said.  At noon Friday, the Second Chamber will talk with the defense  and foreign ministers about the new situation in Bosnia. A  majority of the Chamber wants the Netherlands to make  politically active efforts in order to curb Serbian violence in  Bosnia. The parliamentarians initially wanted an emergency  debate but now they will settle for a statement.</p>

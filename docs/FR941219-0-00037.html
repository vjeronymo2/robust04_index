			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Increased opportunities for wildlife observation resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Improved commercial fishery harvest as a result of increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations of fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA (1994) assigned a monetary value to several of the use benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic benefits of EPA's standards are broader than protection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delta smelt, since EPA's standards are expected to positively affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all components of the food web. The total economic benefit of EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water quality standards and the designation of critical habitat for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt are reported as follows. The ecological benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved estuarine conditions are expected to generate at least $2.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million or more in net economic benefits to commercial and recreational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fisheries (particular salmon fisheries), and will have an associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment gain of approximately 145 full-time equivalent jobs (EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994). Benefits to the ocean sport fishery for salmon is estimated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about $708,000 annually (EPA 1994). This increase would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive employment effects on sport fishing-related industry, adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 70 jobs in this area. Annual benefits to the striped bass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sport fishing industry is estimated to be $57,500 annually (EPA 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An important avoided cost is associated with further declines in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recreational and commercial fisheries industry of the Bay/Delta,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is valued at $200 million annually (EPA 1994). Other avoided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs include government costs associated with crop deficiency payments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural drainage costs, and costs associated with the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in property value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of the Exclusion Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to determine the specific extent of designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act, the Service must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The benefits of including an area, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This process consists of (1) estimating the benefits of retaining or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluding land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay or river  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs; (2) weighing those benefits; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) determining if exclusion of an area or areas from critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or areas from critical habitat will result in eventual species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Extinction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are essential to the conservation of a listed species. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conservation (recovery) and extinction are separate standards. Recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recovery end of the continuum. It may be more difficult to predict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where recovery may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis to determine whether extinction will occur will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different for each species, depending on many variables, including a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' geographic range. The exclusion analysis also may be related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive success. Extinction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an annual species, like the delta smelt, most likely would occur when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rearing habitat conditions are poor enough for two consecutive years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that some minimum number of fish fail to survive to reproduce. Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions could become poor enough if pumping at Federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water project facilities and private diversions significantly reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outflow from the Delta. If a sufficient number of delta smelt were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrained in Federal and State water project facilities and private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversions so that a minimal number survived to reproduce, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population could decline. Extinction could result. The focus of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusionary analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and included consideration of habitat condition, functioning of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary ecosystem, and proximity of the delta smelt population to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal and State pumps during various life stages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

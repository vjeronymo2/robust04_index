			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca pricing dominates THE SWAN song for ICI in its existing form, marked yesterday by the pricing of the Pounds 1.3bn demerger rights issue, saw investors apparently moving away from Zeneca, the new bioscience operation which is being spun off. While the existing ICI shares progressed gracefully, this performance masked some brisk position-taking. Turnover in the existing shares of the company was, at 6.4m, far larger than normal but the share price rise of 22 to 1285p merely countered the previous day's fall. The unofficial market, sanctioned by the stock exchange and now involving 17 marketmakers, saw a shift of emphasis. ICI-ex demerger shares were actively bought up from 569p to 609p on turnover of 6.1m. Zeneca ex-rights were sold down 18 to 664p with 5.1m traded and the Zeneca nil-paid shares fell 20 to 66p with volume of 3.8m. The Zeneca side of the trading had prompted some confusion because the original 'grey market' set up by Salomon Brothers on April 26 had been trading Zeneca cum-rights rather than ex-rights. Consequently, the heralded Zeneca price of 600p a share seemed more generous to some than it actually was. There were also some cynical comments that the idea of a one-for-three cash call had been so thoroughly floated by lead broker SG Warburg that when the terms came in at five-for-16 the relative benefits encouraged buyers. Ultimately, the consensus was that new buyers were not the chief factor in the market yesterday. Marketmakers, arbitraging between the old and new prices, and institutions hedging underwriting commitments were more influential in the day's dealings.</p>

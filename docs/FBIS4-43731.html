			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer </F> by Fritz Vorholz and Christian Wernicke; place and date not  given: "`I Want To Try It at Least'"]    [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Minister, are you going to resign in the  next few days?    [Toepfer] Why would I? Certainly not.    [DIE ZEIT] You just took on an important post with the  United  Nations: you were just elected chairman of the Commission on  Sustained Development [CSD]. Can this mammoth task be done on  the side from Bonn, as it were?    [Toepfer] That is an honorific title. And I can quite  readily  combine it with the job of environmental minister of the Federal  Republic of Germany. But, of course, it requires lots of  concentration, coordination, and a good staff.    [DIE ZEIT] Environmental and developmental groups from many  countries take quite a different view. They fear that the  commission's work could trickle away through the sands, if you  do not meet the new challenge with all your energies.    [Toepfer] There is, clearly, the danger that the results of  Rio could be lost. On all sides, there is the concern that the  Commission on Sustained Development is not in a position to  advance the principles and the cause of Rio. Many, especially in  the developing countries, are convinced that the CSD has  accomplished too little in its first year.    [DIE ZEIT] The chairman of the UN General Assembly even  thinks that the decisions of Rio, and the partnership that was  concluded there between North and South, have long since been  forgotten.    [Toepfer] For precisely that reason, there would have been  many good reasons for saying: Even I cannot change it. But would  that be the proper conclusion? Either the matter is left to  trickle through the sands, or an attempt is made,  wholeheartedly, with all the risks that that entails, and small  chance of spectacular successes. But at least I want to, I must,  try to change this trend toward resignation.    [DIE ZEIT] That sounds very optimistic. What do you intend  to  do?    [Toepfer] The Rio process, that is to say, the partnership  that has been forged between north and south, must be advanced  honestly and substantially. At the present time, we are holding  one conference after the other. In September, the World  Population Conference is slated for Cairo, then there is the  World Social Summit in Copenhagen, then the Women's Summit in  Beijing, and so on--all events with a clear reference to  sustained development. But it must not come to pass that we rush  from one summit to the next, only to determine, in the final  analysis, that we are marching without a compass, without any  internal guidelines, without a common goal. Up to now, the  brackets between the conferences have been missing.    [DIE ZEIT] How do things stand with the often-cited global  partnership between north and south?    [Toepfer] For the developing countries, to an ever greater  degree, the tough consequences of the conflict between East and  West that has been overcome, are becoming apparent. In former  times, the north helped--in the East as well as the West, and  they did so, in part for strategic considerations; playing the  competing systems, one against the other, brought them  developmental opportunities, and material assistance. That is  missing now, and the poorest of the poor are suffering because  of it. Then, too, the long, deep recession in the industrialized  countries has been a factor, as has the economic break-up of  Central and East Europe.    [DIE ZEIT] So, you want to procure more money for the poor  countries?    [Toepfer] That plays quite a central role in the case of the  developing countries, of course. We must see what will become of  the "new and additional funds" that were decided upon in Rio.  There are positive signals, but it is also clear that because of  the economic problems in the donor countries, the monies are not  being made as readily available as the developing countries  correctly thought they would be in Rio. But it is not just a  matter of money; there is also the matter of transferring  technology, administrative assistance, and opening up the  markets.    [DIE ZEIT] Little is coming, even from Germany. In Rio, the  chancellor promised 780 million German marks [DM]. When it came  time to pay, not even DM400 million was left.    [Toepfer] It is correct that we, too, have to come to terms  with the economic break-up, but by no means have we sent out the  signal that we are getting out of the global partnership, which  is based on solidarity.    For the future, the question whether we develop and conclude  innovative financial instruments will be an important one. The  developing countries are calling for international taxes, a  supplement on airfares, for example, which would then be  funnelled to them. Matters of this type will occupy us at the  CSD.    [DIE ZEIT] What would be more significant than small gifts  are open markets.    [Toepfer] That is how things stand right now. To be sure,  due  to low raw material prices, the developing countries, in  particular, are suffering from the weakness of the world  economy. In Rio, we missed the opportunity to talk about trade  issues. Now, it is quite important not to disappoint anyone. The  positive conclusion of the GATT negotiations provides a very  good basis for this.    [DIE ZEIT] And yet, Europe unabashedly limits the  importation  of bananas from Latin America.    [Toepfer] That was and is, truly, a signal in the wrong  direction. And we must not arouse the suspicion that, under the  cloak of environmental policies, we want to establish new trade  barriers. Some politicians from the Third World are already  fearful that even eco-labels, like our blue environmental angel,  are signs of a green imperialism, as my Indian colleague, Kamal  Nath, has said. Environment and trade, therefore, are issues  that will keep us intensely busy. They are a very hot topic...    [DIE ZEIT] ...about which the World Trade Organization will  be occupied as well.    [Toepfer] But we cannot simply leave it to trade policy. For  example, in the UN Commission for Sustained Development, we  shall soon be dealing with matters of forest policy. In Rio  itself, the best we could do was agree on a few nonbinding  principles. Now the matter is beginning to pick up some  momentum. Think of Greenpeace's action against Canadian wood.  Something like that is effective. And so the question is raised:  What is sustained forest use? And, we must allow the question to  be put to us why we do we want to dictate to other countries  what they may do and what they may not. It is just the same with  social policy. We want neither social nor environmental  dumping--others want no hindrances to trade outside the  constraints of the rates insofar as environmental or social  standards are concerned. We must take care that our efforts on  behalf of environmental policy are not misunderstood as a  barrier to our own benefit.    [DIE ZEIT] But how is that done?    [Toepfer] I can give you an example: a German cement  producer  recently told me that at present, the cement from our Eastern  neighbors is delivered at prices that are lower than the cost of  the wages he must pay in Germany alone. One reason for this is  the lack of environmental surcharges in Eastern Europe. His  proposal was: let us collect an import duty that does not  disappear into our coffers, with the help of which the eastern  cement plants can be retrofitted. Considering something of this  sort is urgently needed at the CSD. In Rio we decided that  trade, the environment, and sustained development must be  mutually supportive.    [DIE ZEIT] Can you actually imagine such a form of  partnership?    [Toepfer] Certainly. By decreasing emissions of carbon  dioxide, which are harmful to the climate, we want to do  precisely that: the industrial countries promise to stabilize  their emissions, or better yet, to reduce them by a certain  amount, as we decided, in Germany's case, to reduce them by 25  to 30 percent. For what the industrial countries do together  with the developing countries beyond that to curb carbon  dioxide, they must, to some degree, be given credit.    [DIE ZEIT] Let us remain with the threat to the world's  climate. The International Energy Agency predicts that the  wealthy OECD countries, by the year 2010, will spew out  approximately 30 percent more of the greenhouse gas carbon  dioxide. That is in diametrical opposition to what was decided  at Rio.    [Toepfer] That stands in particular opposition to the Rio  climate convention, which is binding from the standpoint of  international law, and which, in the meantime, 68 countries have  ratified.    [DIE ZEIT] Evidently, that is not worth much.    [Toepfer] From the standpoint of international law, it is  binding! But it is all the more important that now all the  industrialized countries must get to work; for example, that we  in the European Union [EU] not only decide to stabilize carbon  dioxide emissions, but that we also provide the instruments for  doing so.    [DIE ZEIT] The carbon dioxide/energy tax.    [Toepfer] That is a must...    [DIE ZEIT] ...concerning which Brussels fights continually.    [Toepfer] There are precisely five reasons for that. The  southern Europeans say that the northern Europeans--that means  we Germans, too--with their high per capita carbon dioxide  emissions, should reduce these emissions and bear the cost  associated with doing so. Others say: if a tax at all, please,  only a carbon dioxide tax--whereas the critics see in that an  instrument for the promotion of nuclear energy. The third point  is the so-called conditionality: the EU should become active  only if the OECD countries--Japan and the United States in  particular, do something. The fourth group argues: with a tax of  $3 per barrel of oil, there will be no reaction at all insofar  as demand is concerned, and for that reason, it should be left  alone. And finally, the argument that the introduction of new  taxes is a matter that should be left to the member countries.  Things get hung up at that point and nothing moves.    [DIE ZEIT] Because, to put it quite simply, the political  will to do anything is lacking.    [Toepfer] That, among other things, certainly plays a  decisive role. And that is why I agree with my French colleague:  what is not done in this area in the next 12 months in the  EU--Germany, then France, will hold the EU presidency--probably  will not be done so quickly.    [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, we have the impression that your  election to the chairmanship of the CSD was a belated thank you  for your involvement at the Rio conference. Your colleagues in  Bonn seem to be less grateful.    [Toepfer] How do you arrive at that conclusion?    [DIE ZEIT] Think of your struggle against the superstition  that environmental protection costs jobs.    [Toepfer] It is sometimes enervating. That is true.    [DIE ZEIT] Think of your promise to fight the climatic  catastrophe. In the old laender, carbon dioxide emissions have  even increased slightly since 1987.    [Toepfer] They increased from 715 to 716 million tons, which  is to say they have remained virtually constant. At the same  time, however, the population in the old laender has grown by  circa 7 percent. That means that in terms of per capita emission  of carbon dioxide, we have had a definite decrease.    [DIE ZEIT] So you still believe you can keep your promise to  decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 by 25 percent with  reference to 1987 levels?    [Toepfer] If we can manage to control the growth process in  the new laender with the emissions level that has been achieved  at present--incidentally, this level is, per capita, still above  that of the old laender, then we shall have 15 percent less  carbon dioxide than in 1987, the base year for our reduction  obligation.    [DIE ZEIT] Ten percent is still lacking.    [Toepfer] By way of a variety of important measures, these  can still be reached: by way of the thermal utilization  regulation, by way of traffic-related measures, all the way to  the thermal protection regulation...    [DIE ZEIT] ...which a leading producer of building materials  has already characterized as "outmoded" before it was even  passed.    [Toepfer] I tend to be rather grateful for such criticism.  It  proves that legislative regulations are still being undercut,  but we also need the European carbon dioxide/energy tax. And we  need a European provision for limiting carbon dioxide emissions  from cars with the average of at most five liters per 100  kilometers. I agree with my French colleague that we shall  tackle the problem together if the commission does not soon  present a draft.    [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Toepfer, why would you not rather tackle your  task in New York wholeheartedly, and rid yourself of the  albatross that is hanging around your neck here?    [Toepfer] The new job, naturally, has much to do with the  fact that I perform a function in Bonn on the national level,  that we are held in esteem in terms of environmental policy  worldwide.    [DIE ZEIT] And your frustration threshold has not yet been  crossed?    [Toepfer] No. Quite the contrary. Even if one stands in the  midst of criticism in such a fascinating time of historical  changes, that does not mean that one has not moved anything or  that one has advanced nothing. And, in New York, I shall have to  face the question again and again how I do my homework. That is  the most important basis, even for credibility on a worldwide  scale.</p>

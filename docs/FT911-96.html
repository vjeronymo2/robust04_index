			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Brewers urge easing of pub age law THE BREWERS' Society yesterday called on the government to allow pubs in England and Wales to employ 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and to admit children under 14 for family meals. The proposals were part of a submission on the licensing laws sent to Mr Peter Lloyd, a junior Home Office minister. Such moves 'would allow the consumer greater choice and offer increased opportunities for the licensed trade over the next decade', the society said. It said the ban on employment of young people prevented the recruitment of good-quality employees and the development of career paths for new licensees. The society recognised that strict controls would be required. It suggested that young staff should be registered with local Training and Enterprise Councils and should be under the direct supervision of licensees. Pubs in England and Wales, like those in Scotland, should be able to apply to licensing justices for children's certificates allowing under-14s in bars until 8pm for meals with an accompanying adult, the society suggested.</p>

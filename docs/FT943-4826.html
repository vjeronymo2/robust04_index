			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (10): New starts, survivors, MBO - Rhys David charts the success story of community-based enterprises Mrs Alison Knight, a ceramic artist, found herself becoming a small businesswoman when she needed factory floorspace to lay out the tiles she had agreed to make for an architect working on a pop star's swimming pool. The contract fell through, but after discussions with the council covering the Ystradgynlais area, north-east of Swansea, she decided to start up on her own to make ceramic products. Six years and numerous business courses later, she has a projected turnover this year of more than Pounds 300,000, and a staff of 15. Her husband has joined her to help run the business, and the factory is being purchased. The outlets for her product - a range of perfumed pomanders - have expanded from craft shops in tourist centres to some of the biggest high street outlets, including the Body Shop, Boots, and from next year Marks &amp; Spencer, with mail order also being added. Mrs Knight's company, Alexander Ceramics, is one of a number of success stories in a part of Britain which - admittedly from a low base - has bucked the trend of declining manufacturing employment. New starts, re-starts, expansion schemes and management buy-outs - some involving incomers and others local people - have made it possible for employment to grow in the decade since 1981 by just under 19 per cent. The population of the area is now back over 200,000, reversing 100 years of decline. The attractions of mid-Wales to the independently-minded, keen to start up on their own are obvious, but the challenges of operating from the area have meant that only those with determination have survived. At Alexander Ceramics, turnover in the first year was a mere Pounds 6,000 and just double that in year two. The product line had to be pruned and effort concentrated on smaller items - ceramic shells, fish and farmyard animals - before growth really began, and as Mrs Knight points out, she has had to be involved as owner- proprietor in every aspect of running the business, from design through marketing to cleaning. Staff have had to be flexible, hand-painting her range of figures one moment, packaging them the next. With the exception of modest grants and loans from the local council and the Development Board for Rural Wales (DBRW), finance has so far been generated internally. The company is now preparing to scale up its operations, introducing products using non-ceramic materials, meeting bigger customer orders and servicing overseas markets. Several miles away at Abercraf, Mr Peter Taplow and his partner, Mr Nigel Bruce, are operating at a different end of the scale - making a success of their management buy-out of the remnants of what was until 20 years ago a substantial part of Britain's automotive instrumentation industry. Caerbont Automotive Instruments was established in the village of the same name, near Abercraf, to carry on the manufacture of automotive instruments on a much smaller scale after Lucas, the former owners, had decided on a new product line - wire harnesses - for the former Smiths Industries plant it acquired in the early 1980s in nearby Ystradgynlais. By the end of the 1980s ownership of the Caerbont factory had passed into the hands of German company, VDO, which had decided to move into the UK to supply the new Japanese car plants then being built. When, after a change of sourcing strategy, VDO decided in April last year to close the surviving Caerbont plant - at that stage down to a workforce of 100 - Mr Taplow persuaded the company it would be less costly to sell it to him and his partner for a total of Pounds 250,000. The partners' first stop was the DBRW which paid for a feasibility study by Touche Ross in Cardiff. 3i's Cardiff office eventually provided 25 per cent of the capital with a mixture of equity and mezzanine finance, but with the big banks and other financial institutions less than keen, the two partners had to find the remaining finance themselves. So far, the gamble is working. Caerbont supplies the spares market for the British instruments once fitted to all UK-made cars, as well as original equipment for Leyland Trucks, Land-Rover Defenders and LDV, the vans buy-out from Leyland Daf Trucks. (It also has a number of interesting niche markets, including one supplying the original, large-size, Austin Mini speedometer for retrofitting by Japanese enthusiasts into new Minis). The company is now making a profit on a turnover of more than Pounds 6m and has a strong current order book and sales well ahead of plan. Employment is up to 130 people from 105, investment is planned in research and development, new products are being introduced, engineers are being hired, and a modest drive will be made into export markets. The challenges faced by Caerbont and Alexander Ceramics are those of entrepreneurs everywhere. High interest charges have (temporarily) ceased to be a concern but sceptical banks, made cautious by the lending disasters of the 1980s and focused on security, are still a worry. For both companies the support given by the DBRW has been important, a point also made by other companies moving into the area, such as Beacon Foods - which in less than two years has grown to supply a total of more than 5 tonnes a week of pureed and peeled garlic, ginger and other products to food manufacturers and restaurants from a factory in Brecon  - and Brook Thompson, which has been supplying generating equipment for the plant hire industry, also from Brecon, since 1979. For many companies uncertainty over DBRW's remit has, therefore, been a cause of concern. Under plans announced by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, the board is retaining its promotional and development role but handing over its grant-giving functions to local authorities. A new grants administration structure has yet to be put in place, however, causing some businesses to put expansion plans on hold. The problems are being resolved but it is a reminder that confidence can be fragile. The concerns of businesses in the area are important, too, because of the continuing size of the task in mid-Wales. Most of the successes have been in the eastern part of the region, closest to the English border, but high unemployment still affects the western parts of the territory, and in south Snowdonia a big gap in the local economy will be created by the closure of the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. More entrepreneurs will have to be encouraged to set up or expand businesses in these areas if the board's objective of bringing the region up to European Union levels of prosperity are to be realised.</p>

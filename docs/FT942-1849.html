			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Thorn EMI music chief gets Pounds 13.5m package Mr Jim Fifield, who heads Thorn EMI's music business, has trebled his salary package to about Pounds 13.5m - a figure more than 23 times higher than the sum paid to the company's chairman, Sir Colin Southgate. The package includes his Pounds 2.105m basic salary and a Pounds 5.046m performance-related bonus, of which Pounds 1.5m is in ordinary shares. This was partly an annual bonus awarded by the board for achieving internal group targets, and partly from the music division's incentive scheme. In addition, Mr Fifield received 619,592 ordinary shares free of charge as compensation for changes to his terms of contract. Thorn refused to comment on the changes. At yesterday's closing price of 1034p, Mr Fifield's bonus shares were worth Pounds 6.4m. However, under the terms of his remuneration agreement, the shares cannot be sold until March 31 1998. Mr Fifield's remuneration is revealed in the latest report and accounts. Sir Colin's package includes a salary of Pounds 474,347 and a Pounds 110,630 bonus, which he took in shares. In the previous year, he received a total of Pounds 702,759. Thorn EMI directors' pay and bonuses are decided by a board compensation committee which is chaired by the group's non-executive deputy chairman, Sir Peter Walters, formerly head of BP. The committee consists of all the non-executive directors, including Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread and former president of the CBI, Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, and Sir Graham Day, former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes and British Aerospace. Leisure analysts expressed surprise at the payments to Mr Fifield, who earned Pounds 4.7m the previous year. 'Even though the music division has shown remarkable growth, Fifield's salary has gone a bit overboard,' said one. However, given the success of the music business and possible shareholder gains through a demerger, few thought shareholder dissent would be a serious problem. Thorn's profits grew from Pounds 273.5m to Pounds 326.5m last year, with the music division increasing from Pounds 196.9m to Pounds 246.1m. Thorn is renaming its rental business Thorn Group to differentiate it from EMI Music, which is based in New York.</p>

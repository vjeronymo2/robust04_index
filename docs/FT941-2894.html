			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UB shows transatlantic scars United Biscuits, the UK biscuits and snack manufacturer, showed the scars of competition on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday with sweeping restructuring charges totalling Pounds 121m. Its US subsidiary Keebler will undergo radical changes in distribution and manufacture. In Europe there will be 500 job losses, with three quarters of that in the UK. The charges helped pull UB's pre-tax profit down to Pounds 116.7m for the year, a fall of 28 per cent. Underlying profit was also lower at UB's all-important UK biscuit and snacks businesses. Mr Eric Nicoli, chief executive, said this was due less to competition than to rises in raw material prices, partly caused by sterling's devaluation, which the group was unable to pass on at a time of low inflation. In the US, restructuring costs will total Pounds 92.5m, of which Pounds 11.2m had already been announced for the closure of a snack factory at Raleigh, North Carolina. Keebler, which has only 4 per cent of the US salted snack market, is to withdraw from 25 per cent of the US geographically. UB said it lost money on Dollars 250m (Pounds 171m) of snack sales last year, and had made no profit in snacks since attacking the market five years ago. In US biscuits, UB said, most of the cost would be incurred in switching from an advance ordering system towards van selling. Some biscuit manufacturing lines would be closed, but no factories. Production was not expected to fall below last year's reduced level, and UB would not withdraw from any part of the US biscuit market. Mr John Warren, finance director, said job losses in Europe would come across all divisions, both in headquarters and at factories. Most of the jobs would be in middle management, he said, with losses in the UK proportionate to the numbers employed there. Mr Nicoli said recovery at Keebler, which had a management upheaval last year, was already under way. Profits in dollar terms were up 39 per cent before exceptionals, and by 55 per cent in the second half. 'The difference in calibre between the new management team and the old one is very marked,' he said. 'They have a very detailed plan for the next two or three years. The initiatives which underly the provisions are by no means the whole story.' Rebutting suggestions that Keebler's troubles made UB too dependent on the UK market, Mr Nicoli said Europe and the Asia Pacific region contributed 20 per cent of last year's sales and 22 per cent of profits. 'For the fourth year running we've reported improved sales, profits and margins in continental Europe,' he said. 'Not many people can say that.' Mr Warren said restructuring would involve cash outlays of Pounds 45m this year and Pounds 20m in each of the following two years. All the European costs would be incurred this year, while the US programme would be spread over three. The whole programme is claimed to yield savings of more than Pounds 50m a year by 1997. The dividend was held unchanged at 15.3p for the year. UB's shares rose 11p to 349p. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 23</p>

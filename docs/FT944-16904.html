			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAN press distributors merge to boost sales Eight mainly family-owned businesses in six European countries have merged their operations into a new company which will distribute printing equipment across the continent for German press manufacturer MAN Roland Druckmaschinen. All the companies forming the new Omnigraph group in the Netherlands already distribute MAN Roland equipment but hope to enhance their combined market position. The new group with have annual sales of Fl 630m (Dollars 364.1m). The Omnigraph deal, concluded at the end of last month, will provide MAN Roland with a commonly-owned chain of distributors similar to that used by its main competitor, Heidelberger of Germany. The move follows the merger in The Netherlands last year of three paper companies - KNP, Buhrman-Tetterode and VRG Group - which left the enlarged company, KNP BT, with interests in both MAN Roland and Heidelberger distributors. This deal gave KNP BT an 80 per cent share of its market in Belgium and The Netherlands. The European Commission gave the company until the end of this year to dispose of one of its interests. In a complex series of moves concluded by the formation of Omnigraph, KNP BT also sold its interests in two distributors of Heidelberger equipment in Hong Kong and South Korea earlier this year. KNP BT will have a seat on the advisory board of Omnigraph but will play no executive role. Omnigraph's shareholders believe the new company stands more chance of a stock market flotation than the individual businesses on their own. Omnigraph hopes exposure to more markets will help it to weather the cyclical demand for printing equipment. The company also plans to increase sales of items like rollers, inks and plates.

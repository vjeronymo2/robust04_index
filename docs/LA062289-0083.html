			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EFFORT TO BALANCE BUDGET;  </P> <P> COMPTON REPORTED READY TO LAY OFF 80  </P> <P> City officials are expected to send out layoff notices to about 80 employees  this week as part of an effort to balance the budget for the new fiscal year,  sources said.  </P> <P> Even with the layoffs, which would represent about 10% of the city's work  force, the new budget still has a $6-million shortfall that may require  additional payroll cuts, sources said.  </P> <P> City officials did not discuss the layoff plans Tuesday night at a public  hearing on the budget, despite repeated inquiries from residents.  </P> <P> Howard Caldwell, acting city manager, told residents that he would propose a  balanced budget. When one resident asked whether there would be layoffs,  Caldwell said he had not completed budget revisions, but that he would do  whatever is necessary, including laying off employees, to balance the budget.  </P> <P> However, a source said the layoff plans were disclosed earlier Tuesday at a  closed-door meeting of Caldwell, City Controller Timothy Brown and council  members.  </P> <P> Caldwell and Brown painted a grim financial picture during the closed meeting,  the source said. Even with the layoffs, the source said, the city is still $6  million short of balancing its 1989-90 budget, which the council must have in  place by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. Part of the problem, the  source said, is that this year's budget contains a $3-million deficit that must  be made up next year.  </P> <P> Caldwell told department heads Wednesday morning that he or his assistants  would begin meeting with them individually to disclose which positions must be  cut. Two department heads confirmed that Caldwell painted a "bleak" picture of  the city's budget situation during the morning meeting, but said Caldwell  insisted that the problems could be managed if everyone worked together in a  businesslike fashion.  </P> <P> Although few details of the impending layoffs are known, the source said that  the city's ambulance service would not be affected by the first wave of cuts.  City Manager James Goins, who was fired by the council last week after  introducing a $101-million budget, had suggested eliminating the ambulance  service.  </P> <P> City administrators, the source said, are anxious to get the layoff notices in  the mail as soon as possible because Civil Service rules require that those  being let go receive a 30-day notice. As a result, the city must continue to  pay their salaries into the new fiscal year that begins July 1.  </P> <P> The Goins firing last week underscored what has been a festering fiscal issue  for at least six months, ever since City Controller Brown began warning that  the city was spending too much money and would end up with a shortfall this  year and layoffs in the coming year. Goins was insisting that there was no  budget gap.  </P> <P> But last week, after he submitted a budget to the council which contained  layoffs in the Fire Department and cuts in the Police Department, as well as  new taxes and fee increases that the council had never approved, the city  manager was fired on a 5-0 council vote. Caldwell, senior assistant city  manager, was named acting manager and told to bring to the council a new budget  proposal that did not contain increased revenues from new taxes and higher  fees.  </P> <P> Though Brown declined to talk to The Times about the budget and the cuts, he  did say that he could come up with only $82 million in anticipated revenues for  the coming year. Goins' budget called for spending $19 million more than that.  </P> <P> Goins cut Brown out of budget preparations after the two officials differed  openly over the city's financial condition. Brown had warned that the city  would face a severe financial crunch. Goins insisted, however, that the City  Council could balance the budget and avoid layoffs if it approved new taxes and  fee increases.  </P> <P> Some council members told Goins during budget planning sessions that they would  be reluctant to approve such measures.  </P> <P> Caldwell said during a break in the council meeting Tuesday night that his  budget proposal will not include increases in municipal water rates or the  utility tax.  </P> <P> The council set another public hearing at 3:25 p.m. Tuesday to allow comment on  Caldwell's budget proposals. The budget document will be available for public  review by Friday in the city clerk's office.  </P> <P> Through a staff member, Caldwell said he would not be available for comment on  the layoffs.  </P></p>

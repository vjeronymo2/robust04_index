			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: "Not </F> Separation But Collusion"]    [Text] Broadcast reports from Seoul disclosed the fact  that Yi Pyong-tae, the recently appointed puppet defense  minister, was a member of the Hanahoe.    The Hanahoe, a political military club at the center of  criticism from every strata of South Korea, was a powerful group  of fascist military hooligans basically composed of former  members of the Chilsonghoe. The Chilsonghoe had consisted of  seven generals--namely Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Son Yong-kil,  Chong Ho-yong, Kwon Ik-hyon, Choe Sung-tae, and Paek  Un-taek--who hailed from Kyongsang Province and graduated in the  11th class of the South Korean Military Academy.    While under the patronage of traitor Pak Chong-hui following  the 16 May Coup, they changed the name of Chilsonghoe to the  Hanahoe when they were pinned with the insignia of major on  their shoulders. Being on the lookout to seize power, they  increased membership to approximately 200.    Following this, the rascals expanded their area of influence  to include all graduates between the 11th to 36th graduating  class of the South Korean Military Academy. Chon Tu-hwan, No  Tae-u, Chong Ho-yong, and Pak Chun-pyong, the chief culprits  behind the 12 December coup and the Kwangju massacre, were  Hanahoe members. Chang Se-tong, Ho Sam-su, and Ho Hwa-pyong,  the henchmen to traitor Chon Tu-hwan in the Fifth Republic, were  nests of the Hanahoe.    The fact that Yi Pyong-tae, who has assumed the position of  puppet defense minister, was a member of the notorious secret  military group shocks the South Korean people.    The appointment of Yi Pyong-tae a member of the secret group  of vicious military gangsters as puppet defense minister by  puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam all but shows his intention to  revive the Fifth and Sixth Republics's influence and repeat the  fascist suppressive rule of the Fifth and Sixth Republics in  South Korea.    As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam group has prattled as  though the Hanahoe had been broken up and took measures as  though to remove Hanahoe members not only from the puppet  regime, but also from the military when Traitor Kim Yong-sam  raved that he would wipe out the Hanahoe members from the  civilian regime, and the puppet Army announced that 10 colonels  who were Hanahoe members would be excluded from promotions.    However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean  people.  The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself  from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them.    With the people's spirit of resistance growing higher due to  the rice market opening, traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to  appease the people's protests by means of shifting the blame  onto his stooges and firing them, while naming vicious military  gangsters to important posts.    These facts show that the Kim Yong-sam group has not  eliminated the Fifth and Sixth Republics's forces and prove,  even worse, that it drew the rascals into its civilian regime in  order to resurrect the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military  fascist terrorist rule.    In reality, the Kim Yong-sam group is carrying out fascist  suppressive rule over the South Korean people more than ever  before. On 28 December, traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his visit  to the Seoul District Prosecution Office to check  end-of-the-year readiness, made outbursts that he would not  tolerate violent demonstrations. Even before taking office, the  puppet interior minister, raved that it is okay for the  investigators to torture political criminals.    By following the puppet traitor's suppressive order, South  Korea is dripping with a warlike atmosphere and the people's  righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and  reunification are now being brutally oppressed.    Needless to say, the worsening fascist suppressive maneuvers  of the Kim Yong-sam group are aimed at suppressing and  obliterating the people's struggle to oppose the rice market  opening.    Attempting to defuse his regime's crisis, puppet traitor Kim  Yong-sam named the Hanahoe group's military gangsters and  fascist oppressors whom the South Korean people criticize in  order to oppress and obliterate the people's antigovernment  struggle. Nonetheless, this is nothing but a last-ditch  resistance by one who faces a tragic end. The fascist  suppression will only heighten the resistance of the people and  hasten the self destruction.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: BAKING SODA, CORN STARCH TEAM TO CONQUER UNDERARM ODOR  </P> <P> Question: I'm having difficulty finding an underarm deodorant that will not  cause irritation. Within a day of using any deodorant, my skin develops a deep  red irritation. I have even tried natural products from health food stores, but  with no success.  </P> <P> The only non-irritant I have found is baby powder and corn starch, but I have a  stressful job and require more protection. Help!  </P> <P> Answer: Here are some hints to help prevent irritation from antiperspirants and  underarm deodorants. Never apply them after showering or shaving under your  arms. For greatest effectiveness, antiperspirants should be applied to dry skin  in the evening before bed.  </P> <P> If that doesn't work, here is a recommendation you may find helpful. A reader  of this column offers the following:  </P> <P> "After reading about underarm odor, I feel led to write you about a simple  solution to this problem. My daughter has underarm odor. I used to nag her to  wash herself better and use deodorant, but it never helped. One day I read  about baking soda. After much arguing, my daughter agreed to give it a try.  That was the end of her objectionable smell. But if she doesn't use it, I can  still smell her from across the room. Baking soda really works, and it is very  inexpensive."  </P> <P> This isn't the first time we have heard of this home remedy. A baking soda and  corn starch combination, dusted on, can be effective for some people.  </P> <P> Q. When I read the letter from the woman whose husband caught genital herpes  from her after 10 years of marriage, I wept. The pain she expressed reminded me  of the anguish my husband and I went through ourselves.  </P> <P> Herpes is a cruel disease, but Zovirax has helped us cope with the physical  symptoms. Our local support group has given us strength to deal with the  emotional symptoms. I highly recommend the Herpes Resource Center, which can  put people in touch with a support group in their area. The number is (919)  361-2120.  </P> <P> A. Thanks for the tip. People with herpes need all the help they can get. There  is also a newsletter put out by the Herpes Resource Center with information on  research and practical advice on dealing with this viral infection. Another  source of information about herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases is  the STD hotline: (800) 227-8922.  </P></p>

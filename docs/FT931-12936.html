			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok is encouraged by economic outlook - Victor Mallet assesses the market's recent rally Since the start of the year brokers in Bangkok have been asking themselves when, not if, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index would rise above the 1,000 mark. The economy is buoyant and still growing at around 7 to 8 per cent a year; the government is stable; and last year's gloom among local investors has dissipated with each day of the police struggle to prepare a case against Mr Song Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia Song, who has been accused of share manipulation. In the event the 1,000 level was breached on Monday, albeit briefly; the first time it has risen above this barrier since August 1990, the month Iraq invaded Kuwait. The SET index topped 1,001 that afternoon, before receding slightly to close 18.74 ahead on the day at 998.44 - nearly 50 per cent above its low in May last year when the Thai army shot pro-democracy demonstrators on the streets of the capital. Profit-taking yesterday saw the index fall 10.47 to 987.97. Most brokers expect the market to continue rising in the weeks ahead and do not consider the recent rally as just a short-lived bout of euphoria prompted by last weekend's festivities for the Chinese new year. With interest rates falling, investors are being encouraged to put their money in stocks rather than on deposit at the banks. Industrial companies with capacity to spare are deferring further expansion, thus restraining demand for credit (and rights issues), and the monetary authorities are also urging commercial banks to reduce lending rates and cut the wide spreads between lending and deposit rates. Ironically, bank shares, which represent 26 per cent of the index, have been in the vanguard of the market's recent surge on the strength of profits made out of those same wide spreads. To say the profits of Thai banks are healthy would be an understatement. Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, lifted net profits in 1992 by 45 per cent from the previous year's level to Bt10.54bn (Dollars 415m). Thai Military Bank's profits were up 79 per cent, Thai Farmers Bank's 53 per cent and Krung Thai Bank's an impressive 139 per cent. Although bank margins could narrow in the current year, the Thai Bankers Association is a powerful lobby group which will do its best to resist the pressure from the central bank. Furthermore, the costs of some banks will fall when they can access funds via the new Bangkok International Banking Facility with its various tax advantages. A foreign broker in Bangkok commented: 'I think the margin environment for them this year is going to continue to be very good.' The strong position of the banks has led to a revaluation of the whole sector. Typical price/earnings ratios have risen from about eight times to current levels of 11 or 12 and are expected to further increase to 14 or 15. Basic consumer stocks, such as Serm Suk and Haad Thip, which bottle Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola respectively, are also doing well as the wealth generated by economic expansion spreads slowly to the provinces. Franchise holders of luxury brand names are also being tipped as good buys. Among other contributors to the recent rise of the market are the leveraged property groups, which are benefiting from lower interest rates, and finance and securities companies, which have quickly rec-overed from the gloom over the Sia Song scandal and restrictions imposed on their loans to clients for the purchase of shares.</p>

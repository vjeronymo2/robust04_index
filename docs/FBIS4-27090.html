			<p>BFN     [Text] MANILA, May 29 (AFP) - French First Lady Danielle  Mitterrand is named on a list of foreigners banned by the  Philippines from entering the country to attend a conference on  human rights in East Timor.    Officials are under orders to refuse entry to anyone of the  36 peopled named on the list, a copy of which was seen here.    Mitterrand had accepted an invitation to attend the Asia  Pacific Conference on East Timor (APCET) to be held from Tuesday  to Friday, but later said she would not be coming, although no  reason was given for the change of plan.    Immigration officials at the Manila airport on Saturday  expelled Irish Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Maguire, 50, and  a companion. They arrived from Europe in defiance of the ban.    A court on Friday issued an order banning the private  conference, but leftist organizers vowed to defy the ruling and  risk arrest.    APCET spokesman Joel Saracho said Sunday that at least 12  foreign delegates are in Manila.    The 12 include representatives from the United States,  Australia and Canada, he said, but did not say when they entered  the country.    Immigration authorities at the Manila airport on Sunday  decided to expel American university professor Susan Castillo,  who was suspected to be one of the foreign delegates attending  the conference.    Castillo, 46, who teaches American literature at the  University of Porto in Portugal and translates books on East  Timor from Portuguese to English, was aboard a Lufthansa  airlines flight from Frankfurt and said she was a tourist.    Airport immigration chief Felino Quirante said Castillo was  expected to be put back on the same plane back to Frankfurt late  Sunday.    The woman had earlier said she was only a tourist but later  admitted during questioning she planned to attend the conference.    Also on Sunday, University of the Philippines officials  banned conference organizers from using the campus and its  facilities for the meeting.    The announcement was released through the presidential  palace.    Saracho said more than 60 other foreign delegates are  expected before the conference starts on the campus of the  state-run but autonomous University of the Philippines.    Saracho said government agents may have overlooked the 12  others since they were not on the list. Officials said the list  could be expanded anytime.    The 12 are "prominent in the sense that they have been doing  East Timor advocacy for a long time," Saracho told AFP.    President Fidel Ramos, whose move to ban foreign  participants  has been widely criticized here, has said that all  "non-Filipino" delegates, except journalists and exchange  students, would be prevented from attending.    Critics also noted that the judge who banned the conference  is a former military officer whom the West Point-trained Ramos  had appointed. The little known group which had asked the court  to ban the meeting is being led by a Ramos ally.    The East Timor conference has angered Indonesia, which  accused Manila of allowing itself to be used by the delegates to  subvert Jakarta's terrirotial integrity. It has asked Ramos to  stop the seminar.    East Timor is a former Portuguese colony which Indonesian  troops occupied in 1975 and annexed the following year.  International human rights groups have accused Jakarta of  alleged rampant human rights abuses in the territory.    Ramos has said he was powerless under a democratic  constutition to ban the meeting, barred foreign participants  after Jakarta threatened retaliatory measures such as stopping  to host peace talks betweeen Manila and Moslem secessionist  rebels in the south and cancelling investments.    Political commentators meanwhile said that while the court  ban has defused the diplomatic crisis between Manila and  Jakarta, it was a "foreign policy disaster" for the Philippines.    "The resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact that  the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in shambles," wrote  Amando Doronila in the Philippine Daily Inquirer.    He said it was Manila's "worst humiliation and degradation  at  the hands of another country since the Japanese occupation"  during World War II.    "Mr. Marcos is no longer around," said former senator Rene  Saguisag, referring to ousted Philippine dictator Ferdinand  Marcos' repressive 20-year rule.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Jessups back in the black with Pounds 189,000 Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, returned to profit with Pounds 189,000 pre-tax for the six months to February 29, compared with a Pounds 189,000 loss last time. Mr John Ganney, finance director, said the swing into the black had been achieved through cost-cutting and a reduction in interest charges. The decline in base rates and a fall in turnover, resulting in fewer leasing obligations, helped to cut interest charges from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 978,000. Debt was reduced from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 15m. Sales fell from Pounds 45m to Pounds 38.3m, and Mr Ganney warned that the figures continued to be depressed. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.</p>

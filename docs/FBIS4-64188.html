			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bavarian SPD Does Not Rule Out </F> Coalition With CSU"]    [Text] Munich, 25 Apr -- Several months before the  Bavarian Landtag election, Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] faction chairman Schmid has mentioned the possibility of a  coalition with the Christian Social Union [CSU]. If the CSU  achieves only a relative majority instead of an absolute one  and, if on the other hand, a coalition with the Greens and the  Free Democratic Party is impossible, the SPD would be ready to  form part of the government if only to prevent a coalition  between the CSU and the Republikaner. At an SPD regional  congress in Roding, Schmid called on the CSU to define its  stance as a prerequisite for a coalition. The CSU, he said, must  show that it is no longer the former Strauss party that could  afford one scandal after another.</p>

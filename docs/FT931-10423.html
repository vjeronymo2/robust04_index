			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil shake-up raises foreign hopes THE HEAD of Russia's state oil company is being sacked in a move that may herald yet another shake-up in the organisation and possibly a more open regime for foreign energy companies seeking to invest in the Russian oil sector. The decision to dismiss Mr Lev Churilov, a former Soviet minister for oil and gas, from his post as head of Rosneftegaz was taken by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and former Russian energy minister, at the end of last month while Mr Churilov was a business trip to Tokyo. Mr Churilov's office confirmed the sacking yesterday and said he had been appointed Russian trade representative to Nigeria, an important oil producer. His post as head of the state concern is being taken by Mr Ilya Leshenets, his former deputy. The sacking of Mr Churilov, an advocate of state development of the oil sector with as little as possible reliance on foreign investment, is seen as an encouraging sign for the major oil companies now seeking deals in the oil sector. Mr Chernomyrdin, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, explicitly singled out the energy sector as the area in which he most wanted foreign investment. However, the sacking is also seen as part of the struggle round the creation of a new state company - called Rosneft - that will take over some of the functions of Rosneftegaz. Rosneft was created last year by a decree of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to take over the management of the government shares in the oil companies which were to be privatised. No agreement has yet been reached on the closing down of Rosneftegaz and the assumption of its responsibilities by Rosneft. According to one senior oil ministry official yesterday, the history of Rosneftegaz has been one of guerrilla warfare between its management and the energy ministry over the definition of powers and responsibilities. One foreign analyst said that 'Churilov's sacking got him out of the way before they work out who will be the new leaders of the oil industry'. The leadership of Rosneft is at present in the hands of Mr Oleg Alekperov, formerly the head of Lukoil, one of the new state production companies. Lukoil itself, with the other state oil companies Yukos and Surgutneftegaz, will be outside the jurisdiction of Rosneft, thus further weakening its effectiveness. At the same time, privatisation of the oil industry, the key area as far as foreign investors are concerned, has gone slowly - and according to a report by the Interfax news agency yesterday, may have been stopped altogether. Interfax reported that Mr Pyotr Mostovoi, head of the State Property Management Committee, has sent telegrams to his regional branches telling them to cease to accept privatisation proposals from the oil corporations. It quoted Rosneftegaz officials as saying that the presidential decree ordering privatisation proposals to be ready by December 31 was 'unrealistic'.</p>

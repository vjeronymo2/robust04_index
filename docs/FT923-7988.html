			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: A patent for Dr Frankenstein - Celia Hampton and Simon Cohen on legal and moral problems of genetic research The US and UK patent offices face a delicate decision: whether to allow applications to patent human genes. The decisions, and any resulting litigation, will cover difficult technical issues and also ethical issues on which the law gives little guidance. A patent confers monopoly rights over its subject-matter so that the inventor can exploit it commercially for a period without having to face direct competition. One of the tasks of patent law is to define the scope of this incentive for innovation so that others are not unreasonably deterred from research in the same field. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are carrying out research to identify the hundreds of thousands of genes believed to exist in the human genome, or genetic map. The UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) and others are collaborating in the project. Individual genes have long been patentable in principle, but many scientists believe patents should be reserved for cases where the use of the gene is known: for one researcher to be given a monopoly over a gene of unknown function might discourage research by others into that function. On the other hand, the value of the research to the US biotechnology sector will be much reduced if the results cannot be patented. In 1991, with US government support, the NIH filed patent applications with the US Patent Office for some 3,000 fragments of human genes without knowing what they do. Scientists in other countries, including the UK, protested. Last month, however, the MRC lodged its own application with the UK Patent Office for about 1,100 human gene fragments. Dr David Owen, the MRC's director of industrial collaboration and licensing, said the main purpose was to secure its position should the NIH application succeed: the MRC can more readily discuss non-assertion of patent rights if it has some of its own. The US office is accelerating the NIH application, and is expected to deal with it at this preliminary stage more quickly and thoroughly than usual. If its decision is an unqualified negative, the MRC may well withdraw its application. If, as seems likely, it is a qualified affirmative, the deliberations of the UK office can be expected to take some time. There are three main issues under UK law: the distinction between a discovery and an invention; the requirement of industrial applicability; and morality. A discovery is made by finding out or characterising the existence of a property that already exists, but which was previously unknown. The sequencing and writing-down of the nucleotide sequence of any particular human gene fragment would amount to a discovery: it exists and always has existed - the difficulty has been in ascertaining its existence. In contrast, an invention involves the application of the property or the method of ascertaining its existence. Under section 1 of the Patents Act 1977, a patent is not available for a discovery, only for an invention. The English Court of Appeal had to consider this in Genentech v Wellcome (1989) RPC 147, a case relating to production of the enzyme, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). It said: '. . . you cannot patent a discovery but if, on the basis of that discovery, you can tell people how it may be usefully employed, then a patentable invention may result. This . . . would be the case even though, once you have made the discovery, the way in which it can be usefully employed is obvious enough.' In other words, the cataloguing of gene and protein sequences time - was an unpatentable discovery. But the existence of a practical use for this discovery in the production of commercial quantities of t-PA, even though itself obvious once the sequences had been discovered, transformed an unpatentable discovery into a potentially patentable invention. An invention must also be capable of industrial application - capable of being 'made or used in any kind of industry, including agriculture.' This requirement was new to UK law in the 1977 Act, so there has been little judicial interpretation of it. It would be difficult to argue that a gene is industrially applicable if its functions are unknown. It could be said that virtually every identified gene is or will be inherently useful, if not for its therapeutic properties, then in research as a genetic probe or as a marker, but this would effectively introduce a presumption of industrial applicability. In US law, an invention has to be 'useful' or to produce a 'specific benefit . . . in currently available form' (Brenner v Manson, 148 USPQ 689, 1966, US Supreme Court). The definition has been moderated to include materials still in the research phase but this still pre-supposes a specific potential use. This issue is likely to prove the most testing obstacle for scientists currently applying for patents on human gene fragments. But the moral issue must also be considered. A moral decision distinguishes between right and wrong. Arguably, this is a decision which patent offices should not be called upon to decide. The European Patent Convention (to which the UK is a party) precludes the patenting of inventions, the publication or exploitation of which would be 'contrary to ordre public or morality'. The UK Act translates this as 'generally expected to encourage offensive, immoral or anti-social behaviour'. According to the concept of the separation of powers, a moral decision should be reserved to the political power. When the choice has been made, it should be formulated in primary legislation, with the rules and guidance needed for its application in individual cases by the judicial power. While application of the law may involve a moral judgment in a marginal case, judges should not be called upon to make the essential moral choice. Where legislation pre-dates a particular development, it may not provide the guidance needed on any moral issues raised. Leaving these to judicial interpretation of wording not designed for that purpose risks politicising the judicial process - as witnessed by the abortion controversy in the US. Dr Owen takes the view that the moral acceptability of patenting human genes should be addressed by legislation. Patent offices apply a series of essentially technical tests to decide whether a patent should be granted. Adding the duty to decide the moral question is capable not only of failing to give a proper moral judgment, but also of muddling the technical assessment of inventions. The European Patent Office had to consider the issue in the 'Harvard Mouse' application (Oncomouse/Harvard (1989) OJ EPO 451) for the Oncomouse, a breed of mouse developed at Harvard that contains human cancer genes and develops tumours soon after birth. Balancing the suffering of animals and possible risks to the environment against the invention's usefulness to mankind, it decided that the 'Oncomouse's purpose of facilitating cancer research and treatment was of paramount importance for the welfare of mankind' and granted the application. Genetic science raises a number of issues which are not covered by patent legislation. The patenting of human genes raises questions of right and wrong, such as whether properties of human life and identity can be 'owned' by the patent-holder, and the line to be drawn between eugenics and a cure for cancer. Judges and patent examiners need guidance on these issues. The question of animal experimentation is another moral issue. Other issues of a socio-economic nature also need resolution at political level, including: does genetic engineering endanger the diversity of life forms; is the protection of health adequately secured; and is the environment adequately protected?

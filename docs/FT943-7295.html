			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Arts: Julian Joseph - Jazz It says something about Julian Joseph's energetic piano playing that, at 28 and with only two records behind him, he can already draw a sizeable crowd to the Barbican Hall on two consecutive nights. He came up in the late 1980s crop of young British jazz musicians which included Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson and like them his style is coruscating hard bop tempered by a more contemporary sound. Reggae shines through Coltrane for Pine, for Williamson it is funk and Joseph likes soul. But Joseph's irrepressible urge to swing his quartet is what really sets him apart. Once seated at the keyboard he simply cannot wait to push a tune along. On Sunday he started out with a trio, a vigorous three cornered work-out with Wayne Batchelor (bass) and Mark Mondesir (drums). Mondesir is the most combative drummer and engaged Joseph in some serious hand-to-hand, the pair grinning at one another wickedly throughout. Using his own material from the albums, Joseph took the substance of a good tune and worried it with percussive repetition until it was in the most satisfying shreds. When the barnstorming trio returned after the interval with a seven piece brass section clipped on one side and six reeds on the other, you felt seatbelts might be in order. Packed with top flight soloists - Guy Barker (trumpet), Peter King (alto) and Keith Waithe (flutes) - this orchestra soars. Joseph is new to big band orchestration but clearly it suits him. His arrangements on standards unfolded carefully and in a cool way but allowed for soloist's aerobatics between. 'Everything Happens To Me' featured Peter King at his most nimble and allowed Joseph a slot to serenade before revving up the ensemble again. Marcus Miller's 'The King is Dead' used a poignantly still duet between Barbara Wyllie's clarinet and Jamie Talbot's soprano before taking off into the blue yonder; 'High Priestess' had Guy Barker, Peter King and Patrick Clahah (tenor) out front, issuing slippery harmonies. In October Joseph hosts the first Wigmore Jazz Series in London and in November tours his extended group, The Forum Project. The third album is due next year. On the strength of this weekend's display, we have much to look forward to.</p>

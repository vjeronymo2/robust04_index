			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "The Republic Is Ready for </F> Elections: And, According to Sociologists' Data, Not Ready for  Withdrawal from the CIS"]    [Text] The Elections-94 independent press center has  distributed the data of a sociological survey of 1,737  respondents aged 18 and older which was conducted by the Kiev  International Sociology Institute at the Kiev-Mogilyanskaya  Academy in 183 villages, settlements, and cities of 24 oblasts  of Ukraine, Kiev, and the Republic of Crimea. According to these  data, to the question as to the direction in which Ukraine is  currently headed, those responding that it is headed in the  right direction constituted 7 percent in the cities, 10 percent  in the villages, and 7 percent in Ukraine on average; the "don't  knows" constituted 11, 15, and 13 percent respectively; those  responding that Ukraine is moving in the wrong direction  constituted 84 percent in cities, 74 percent in the villages,  and 81 percent in Ukraine on average.    For the answer to the question as to which problem currently  confronting Ukraine worries them the most, it was suggested that  those polled choose three problems, and the answers were  distributed as follows: 68 percent of those polled declared that  they were worried most by the state of the economy, 39 percent,  by relations with Russia, 35 percent, crime, 28 percent,  Ukraine's security, 8 percent each the nuclear weapons situation  and the Crimea problem, 6 percent, the position of Russian in  Ukraine, and 5 percent, the Black Sea Fleet, and 4 percent of  those polled either cited other problems or had no answer.    Sixty-five percent of those polled agree fully that it is  necessary to acquire the right to private ownership of the land,  only 9 percent disagree, and the rest are undecided. But only 29  percent of those polled are sure that the ordinary people would  benefit from the introduction of private ownership, 22 percent  disagree, and the rest of have not made up their minds. It is  hard to call these data anything other than a lack of confidence  in the economic policy of present Kiev officialdom. And the  following data are indicative with respect to the political  course of the present leadership of Ukraine: To a question  concerning the attitude toward the CIS, 79 percent of those  polled declared that Ukraine should remain in the Commonwealth,  10 percent, that it should quit the CIS, and 11 percent did not  know. Concerning the economic union with the CIS, 75 of those  polled responded that Ukraine should become a full member, 17  percent, that it should remain an associate member, and 7  percent, that it should quit the economic union, and 6 percent  of those polled did not know.    More specifically concerning Ukrainian-Russian relations: 18  percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should  coexist as two totally independent states with closed borders,  visas, and customs, and 39 percent of those polled declared that  Ukraine and Russia should be fully independent, but friendly  states--with open borders and without visas or customs. Forty  percent of those polled declared that Ukraine and Russia should  unite in one state, and only 3 percent are as yet undecided. The  sociologists circumspectly did not inquire as to what had  brought about this lamentable result of two years of Ukraine's  independence.    Thirty-nine percent of those polled see Crimea as an oblast  of Ukraine, 29 percent of those polled, as an autonomous  republic within Ukraine, 27 percent, as an independent state, if  this is what the people of Crimea want, and 12 percent did not  know.    Some 51 percent of those polled advocated Russian as a  second  official language, 33 percent of those polled supported it as a  second official language where this is what the public wants, 12  percent support the complete elimination of Russian from  official use, and 4 percent could not say.    Sixty-one percent of those polled declared that the Black  Sea  Fleet should be Ukrainian, and 18 percent, that it could be sold  to Russia, and the rest either suggested other options or could  not say.    Some 58 percent of those polled responded that they would  take part in the parliamentary elections if they were held  today, and 66 percent of those polled are prepared to turn out  for the elections in the villages, and 54 percent in the cities,  what is more. Twenty-nine percent of those polled would stay  away, and a further 13 percent were undecided.    Of those who declared a readiness to take part in the  elections, 5 percent named in response to the question of which  present people's deputy they would like to see in the future  parliament Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil. He was followed by  Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, with 4  percent, former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma with 3 percent,  Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, leader of the Democratic Party, and  Volodymyr Hrynyov, leader of the New Ukraine association, with 2  percent each, and Levko Lukyanenko, former ambassador of Ukraine  in Canada, and Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party of  Ukraine, with 1 percent each. The remaining 34 deputies named  mustered less than 1 percent of the vote.    Some 69 percent of those polled found it difficult to name a  modern political party of Ukraine for which they would vote were  the forthcoming elections to be conducted by party slate, and of  the 31 percent who named such parties, 10 percent supported  Rukh, 9 percent, the Democratic Party, 7 percent, the Communist  Party, and 2 percent, the Socialist Party, and the People's and  Peasant Parties, the Ukrainian Justice Party, and the Green  Party "garnered" 1 percent each. Among those who cited no party,  40 percent of those polled declared that they simply could not  recall the parties' names, and 37 percent, that they would be  voting for nonparty candidates, and the rest found it hard to  say.    It should be recalled in conclusion that there are 26 days  remaining until the parliamentary elections in Ukraine.</p>

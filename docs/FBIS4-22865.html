Shmelev (Atomic Reactors Institute, RNTs  [expansion not given] ``Kurchatovskiy institut''); received  April 30 1993; UDC 621.039.548]    [Abstract] Nowadays great attention is paid to analysis of  possible AES accidents caused by overheating of fuel that  results in global destruction and meltdown of the core and  release of fission products into the heat transfer agent and  beyond the primary loop and AES protective shell. To provide  reliable computer forecasts of accident development it is  necessary to know information on release of long-lived fission  products and use an adequate mathematical and physical model of  fission products release under conditions that are typical for  serious accidents. Experimental studies of release of fission  products in various media under different temperatures (up to  the uranium dioxide melting point) have been conducted for  several years at RNTs ``Kurchatovskiy institut''. The article  presents results of measurements of time and temperature  dependences of release of fission products such as [.sup]140[/]  Ba, [.sup]140[/]La, [.sup]95[/]Zr, [.sup]103[/]  Ru and [.sup]141[/]Ce when annealing  irradiated specimens in an inert medium under conditions that  simulate accident situations caused by overheating of reactor  fuel. Results of test conducted in an active medium are being  prepared for publication. The article describes the specimens  and procedure used for determining release of solid fission  products and presents experimental results. It was found that  release increases along the Ce- Zr- La- Ba series. Figures 5,  tables 3, references 4: 2 Russian and 2 Western.</p>

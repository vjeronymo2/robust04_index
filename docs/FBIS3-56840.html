			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Commission of the Saeima, does not consider as a change  in Russian foreign policy toward the Baltic states the views  expressed by the Russian foreign minister on Tuesday regarding a  need for Russian military presence in the republics of the  former Soviet Union. According to Kirsteins, Kozyrev's remarks  are only partly related to the recent visit by U.S. President  Clinton to Moscow, because statements made by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher during his recent visit to Latvia are  already evidence of the existence of an agreement between the  United States and Russia that Russia should maintain a military  presence in Latvia.    It has been clear for a long time that Russia will not leave  Latvia of its own accord and that it does not wish to withdraw  its troops from the Baltics, Kirsteins explained. He noted that  Russia always interprets differently remarks made by its  officials, and it is therefore necessary to receive from the  Russian Government a more detailed explanation of Kozyrev's  statement in the near future.</p>

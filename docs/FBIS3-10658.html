			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- The National Institute of Space  Research (INPE) already is testing Embratel's [Brazilian  Telecommunications Company] communications satellite  Brasilsat-B1, which should be launched in June. This will be  the first of two satellites that will be part of the second  generation of Embratel's communications satellites.  Brasilsat-B1, which arrived in Sao Jose dos Campos on 28  February, will be subject to final integration tests at INPE's  Integration and Testing Laboratory (LIT) until the end of April.  After being tested, the satellite will be transported to the  Arianespace's Kourou launch in French Guyana, from where it will  be transported into space by an Ariane rocket.    The tests at INPE, supervised by experts from INPE and  Hughes  Aircraft Co. -- a Los Angeles enterprise that built the  satellite, will verify all the Brasilsat-B1 systems.  <H5>  Second Generation </H5>   The Brasilsat-B1 and B2 are the same type and look like the  first-generation satellites--Brasilsat-A1 and A2, but are more  advanced technologically and have better performance. The  signals the new satellites send to earth are much more powerful.    The service life of the two satellites that will be  replaced,  Brasilsat-A1 and A2, estimated at eight to 10 years, is almost  up. According to Embratel, their replacement will not affect the  users, not even those who have parabolic antennas, who will  continue to receive their television programs normally. The new  satellites have an approximately 12-year service life, which  means that Brazil's communications are guaranteed until the year  2006.</p>

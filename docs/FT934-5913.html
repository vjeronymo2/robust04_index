			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / IRA hardliners set peace deadline: A deal might bring political gains to republicans. But, they could also face threats to their morale Republican sources say that hardliners in the IRA are giving the peace initiatives less than a month before they publicly blame the British government for their failure and declare the process dead. IRA leaders are reported to be weighing the political gains which could spring from a comprehensive agreement between Dublin and London against the risks to internal discipline and morale posed by the current reduction in activity which has, as yet, produced no political breakthrough. Mr Mitchell McLaughlin, a Sinn Fein leader and a leading republican political strategist, said this week: 'This situation could change tomorrow with the IRA using another bomb to signal they are back on the offensive . . . The war is still going on . . . and the bombing campaign could easily be resumed. This peace initiative is not open-ended. It is finite. There's no way it is going to develop into an indefinite ceasefire if London and Dublin do not move forward.' An uneasy lull in the violence after the recent atrocities has created a crucial breathing space in which the peace process embarked on by the British and Irish governments can develop. But there is also a growing belief that time is running out, and that should talks fail there may be a surge in violence which will match, and possibly exceed, the worst levels of the past 25 years. Nevertheless the IRA has scaled down its operations since the bomb on the Shankill Road in Belfast and the loyalist gun attack on a pub in Londonderry. This has been matched by a scaling down of army operations. Army tactics also seem to have changed. 'Target acquisition', where soldiers train loaded guns on passers-by in republican areas, and the 'bomb burst' where soldiers burst out of armoured vehicles and rush through the streets covering each other with their weapons, are no longer employed. In a more subtle de-escalation soldiers have tended to wear berets rather than helmets in less dangerous areas. Security sources also suspect that the IRA's military capability may have been temporarily weakened by a recent series of discoveries of arms caches in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and that a certain war-weariness may be behind the push for a peace settlement. But they do not doubt the IRA's own claims this week that it is still capable of striking heavily should a decision be made to resume action. According to security sources any resumption of a high-intensity military campaign by the IRA will almost certainly involve renewed attacks on commercial targets on the mainland. They say the IRA remains convinced that the bomb attack on the City of London in April was a major coup and that something similar should be attempted if the government seems to put Northern Ireland in the political background again. Sinn Fein has not yet written off the peace initiative between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic Labour Party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in spite of its rejection by Dublin and London. Sinn Fein believes that either the Anglo-Irish summit pencilled for next Friday or even informal contacts might produce key concessions facilitating a permanent ceasefire. Mr Tom Hartley, the Sinn Fein chairman, said: 'The process is not over yet. Politics is about looking for opportunities. I suspect the British government has no viable alternative to the Hume-Adams proposals and is just saying no . . . I will be looking for whatever emerges from the summit that can create a dynamic for change.' He added: 'It is possible that a response would not even happen at a public level but will probably be made in a private way,' suggesting that Sinn Fein hopes to reopen a secret channel of negotiation with the British government which it claims was closed off last July after unionist complaints. The dilemma for the two prime ministers, even if they were about to offer an olive branch to the IRA, is that there are growing concerns in the security forces about the threat posed by loyalist paramilitaries. One army source said: 'We are in a process of reassessing the threat. It has traditionally come from one side only but we are having to reorientate our planning to face a possible threat from the other side as well.'</p>

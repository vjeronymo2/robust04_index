			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Seoul March 7 TASS -- The South Korean Foreign  Ministry told ITAR-TASS there was no truth in recent Seoul press  reports that many North Korean woodcutters working in Russia  have been applying for political asylum in South Korea. The  South Korean Ministry said cases of defection could be counted  on the fingers of one hand.    A competent source in the South Korean Foreign Ministry said  about seventy North Koreans were seeking to settle in Russia for  fear their flight to South Korea could spell out disaster for  their families and relatives in North Korea.    The same source said that under the South Korean  Constitution  all inhabitants of the Korean peninsula are regarded as citizens  of the Republic of Korea. In this connection the Government of  the Republic of Korea shows interest in the fate of northern  compatriots. Seoul expects Russia to regard the North Korean  workers who fled from the North Korean labour camps as refugees  and, respecting their rights as such, not to deport them to  North Korea.    Seoul is now considering ways of bringing its internal  regulations and provisions for Korean immigrants and defectors  in line with international standards, the source said without  specifying what changes will be made.    The Seoul press alleged last month that between 100 and 150  North Korean workers escaped from Siberian woodcutting spells  and asked for political asylum in South Korean diplomatic  offices in Russia. North Korea rejected the allegations.    This year three North Koreans were reported have reached  South Korea from Siberia and obtained residence permits here.  They had not approached either the embassy nor the South Korean  consular offices in Russia.</p>

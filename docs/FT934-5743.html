			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Taiwan party stands firm Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party failed to suffer an expected setback in local government elections at the weekend, although its share of the popular vote fell below 50 per cent for the first time. The elections, which had been seen as a key test of the party's strength following internal dissension and corruption scandals, appeared to bolster the position of President Lee Teng-hui, who has led the island's democratic reforms. The Kuomintang held on to 13 county and city mayoral posts - the same number as it had previously held. Candidates backed by the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) won six posts, a net loss of one seat. The two others went respectively to a pro-DPP independent and a pro-KMT independent. Mr Hsu Hsin-liang, the DPP chairman, resigned to take responsibility for the setback and attributed the defeat to 'unprecedented levels' of vote- buying by KMT candidates, as well as to the impact made by President Lee, who as KMT chairman undertook an unprecedented personal campaign swing across Taiwan. However, the electorate gave the KMT only 47 per cent of 7.6m votes cast, down from 54 per cent in similar mayoral elections in 1989. The DPP, which advocates formal independence for Taiwan and social reform policies, gained 41 per cent, up from 38 per cent in 1989. The Chinese New party, a breakaway from the KMT, received only 3 per cent. The rest went to independents. Mr Hsu Shui-teh, KMT secretary-general, said: 'In an international environment in which many ruling parties are being turned out of office, we cannot say that to retain the same number of 13 mayoral seats was a loss.' Mr Hsu of the DPP said Mr Lee was now in a position to step up plans to push through a constitutional amendment for direct presidential elections and run for the post himself. But he said Mr Lee 'had expended much political capital' by exposing himself to criticism from the DPP in the campaign and would enjoy less political momentum going into a presidential race.</p>

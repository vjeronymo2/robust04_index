			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE FOR CARWASH  </P> <P> Feeding on what some journalists describe as an insatiable appetite for stories  about crackpot culture in sunbaked California, news organizations around the  world have devoured a story about neighborhood efforts to have a Studio City  carwash declared an architectural landmark.  </P> <P> In the past two months, people from Peekskill, N. Y., to Paris have learned  about one community's cry against a corner mini-mall. It has been a protest  cloaked in a preservation campaign, and it has reinforced a well-accepted  stereotype about the wacky West Coast.  </P> <P> "The whole thing was a natural," said Arthur Higbee, editor of the American  Topics column in the International Herald Tribune in Paris. "It was really one  of our better items. I think it was one of the more amusing ones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seems Perfectly Normal'  </P> <P> "Here's this city sort of designed for the automobile age," he said, "this city  that's got, or once had, more drive-ins per capita than any other, probably  more carwashes and gas stations than anywhere else. So it seems perfectly  normal that someone would suggest turning a carwash into a monument. It  wouldn't seem normal anywhere else, but it does in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> At the heart of the story is a community effort to thwart construction of a  $15-million shopping center at Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards. The  existing buildings, the carwash with its adjoining gas station and restaurant,  would be destroyed to make way for the two-story mini-mall.  </P> <P> But the showdown between homeowners and developers, though noted in stories  about the carwash, was generally buried or overshadowed by theatrics.  </P> <P> Editors and reporters said they pursued the story because it was entertaining  -- fun to write, broadcast, read and watch. And, they conceded, it played well  to the zany notions that the public holds about the movie capital of the world.  </P> <P> "I don't think it was a fruits-and-nuts piece," CNN Managing Editor Cissy Baker  said. "We would have covered it if it were somewhere else. But I wasn't  surprised it was in L.A."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times ran 14 stories about the carwash since the cultural  campaign began in May, most of them in the San Fernando Valley edition. Two ran  Thursday, the day after the city's Cultural Heritage Commission's decided that  the 28-year-old complex did not qualify as a city treasure.  </P> <P> Stories have also appeared in the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and the  Portland Oregonian. The magazine Business Week ran a short item in its current  issue under the headline, "Only in California: A Landmark Carwash?"  </P> <P> ABC, CBS and CNN carried the story. So did the "USA Today" television show, the  Canadian Broadcasting Corp., an FM radio station in Sydney, Australia, and a  television station in West Germany.  </P> <P> Carwash owner Pat Galati -- whose relatives in the Hudson River town of  Peekskill read of his struggle in the New York press -- thinks that the story  plays to public outrage about overdevelopment.  </P> <P> "I was overwhelmed until I stopped to analyze it," Galati said. "Then I saw  that people all over feel just as people in the state of California. They want  to retain something of their heritage. They don't want all the changes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right Buttons to Push  </P> <P> It was the silly side of the story -- not the development issue -- that  captured the attention of the press. And Jack McGrath, a savvy political  strategist who headed the "Save Our Corner" campaign, knew all the right  buttons to push.  </P> <P> "This thing's better than the Statue of Liberty," he repeatedly told reporters,  pointing to the boomerang-shaped beams that tower above the carwash. "The  Gateway to Studio City," he called them. "If we had an Empire State Building in  Los Angeles, we would make it a landmark. But our landmark is 55 feet in the  air and made out of steel."  </P> <P> In an attempt to save it, community activists appeared on the CBS Evening News  in T-shirts bearing the "Save Our Corner" slogan. "Is there nothing sacred any  more?" they sang. "Is our community going out the door?"  </P> <P> David Browning, the CBS correspondent who reported the story, said for years  that he has "put up with editors in New York who think all there is in L.A. is  wackos and palm trees."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggested Story  </P> <P> But it was Browning, not his editors, who suggested the story. "Every city has  its stereotypes," he said. "And everyone feeds on them once in a while."  </P> <P> Seth Mydans characterized his treatment of the story in the New York Times as a  playful attempt to tell his readers about the love affair that Los Angeles  residents have with their cars.  </P> <P> "It has fun with cliches about Los Angeles," Mydans said. "The car culture. A  little bit of outlandishness or garishness, as still perceived from outside. .  . . I don't think there is any harm done by having fun with aspects of a  culture. And one hopes that even in the heart of the fun, you're saying  something that's true. I don't think the story is misrepresenting or skewing  the realities of L.A. I think it's legitimate."  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a new city, still evolving, searching for a sense of history,  the journalists agreed. It lacks the grand architecture of European cities and  even of some cities on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Bruce Buursma of the Chicago Tribune, like Mydans, pursued that angle but not  exclusively.  </P> <P> "The notion that anyone in Philadelphia would ask an agency to declare as a  historic monument something 20 years old is, on the face of it, ludicrous,"  Buursma said.  </P> <P> "I tried not to treat the story as strictly a goofy California episode. It also  spoke to something about neighborhood integrity, and a sense of community and  the fact that you can rouse a bit of civic indignation in Southern California,  when another one of the misconceptions is that people sit around and  contemplate their navels and don't care about their neighborhood."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coverage Deeper  </P> <P> While the story appealed to correspondents and their editors because it  depicted the zany side of Southern California, they said their coverage of the  area runs much deeper.  </P> <P> "If the entire body of my work consisted of nothing but carwash stories and  quirky cultural artifacts of so-called California life style, I would be  embarrassed," Buursma said.  </P> <P> Many newspapers and television stations have no correspondents in California  and learned of the carwash controversy from wire service reports.  </P> <P> United Press International ran the story even though its Los Angeles-based  Pacific region editor, Jacques Clafin, holds a dim view of such pieces.  </P> <P> "I find it personally distasteful to file stories that confirm a lot of notions  that Easterners have about Californians being flaky," Clafin said. "I think  California should be looked at as a bellwether state. . . .  </P> <P> "These stories come up all the time. I had the same sense about the freeway  shootings. There was no way not to run it. Yet I knew in running it, it would  create in people's minds the impression that California is a lawless state. But  we're not into censoring ourselves. As a Californian, as a Western person, you  kind of hold your nose and file it."  </P></p>

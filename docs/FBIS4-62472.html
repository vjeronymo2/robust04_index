			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS -- A social affairs and  related areas ministers-level meeting of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania in Tallinn today signed a memorandum on social  security and protection.    The document, prepared at a meeting in the Lohusalu seaside  resort near Tallinn last weekend, deals with the developing of  the social security and social protection systems, health care  and labor market organization.    The problems of the three countries in this field are very  much the same and are mainly connected with shortage of funds,  Estonian Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin said. All  three countries are aiming toward creation of a social security  framework that would be suitable for a poor country and cover  the entire population, she added.    Also the health care structures of Estonia, Latvia and  Lithuania are facing common problems in their transition to a  so-called family doctors' general practitioner system to form  the basic level in their health care structures.    The third most topical issue is coordination of decisions  concerning the labor market and protection of the labor market,  the minister told reporters.    While introducing changes in these three areas the Baltics  are keeping in view their possible joining with the European  Union and are proceeding from the standards now valid in Europe.    The meeting also set up five different commissions -- on  social security issues, on social protection, on issues of the  work force market, on employment, and on health care. The three  countries are to draw up a common social development project to  be presented to European and worldwide forums.    This was also the first time for the social and related  affairs ministers from the three Baltic countries to meet at a  common table.</p>

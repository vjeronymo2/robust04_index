			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin, Russian </F> minister of economics, by Yelena Vishnevskaya; place and date  not given: "At the Bottom of the Crisis Pit"]    [Text] Many people took heed of a recent statement by  our prime minister to the effect that we are now at the lowest  point of the crisis. They began to comment on it. In reality,  the lowest point means there is nowhere deeper (read -- worse!)  to go, means that next we should begin to rise. The path is slow  and torturous, but it is upward. When will it start? How will it  proceed? By what signs can we determine that it has, all the  same, begun? How can we scramble out, albeit with bleeding  fingers, but without falling back into the abyss? We must get  through this low point as quickly as possible, feels Aleksandr  Nikolayevich Shokhin, Russian minister of economics, or else the  danger of falling to the bottom of the pit lies in wait for  us.    [Shokhin] Even if everyone scrambles for himself, the way  upward will become reality only when society comes to realize  that we are now completely tied up. There is nobody to throw  down a rope from the precipice -- preferential loans -- and to  pull up an enterprise that has gone under -- the state has no  money. Many captains of industry, however, still believe  religiously in a bottomless state pocket. If nothing comes out  of it, they explain that as the ill will of the government.  Recently, when picketing miners were standing around the White  House, I myself held in my hands the travel authorizations  issued to the miners. On them -- in black and gray:  such-and-such mine face worker is dispatched to Moscow to solve  the problem of financing the coal industry. What social harmony  we have here -- typical power methods!    [Vishnevskaya] All the newspapers have avoided the ZiL story  -- also the pressure on the president and the government. How  does the government intend to behave in situations like this?  After all, these giants constitute thousands of workers, and  this means a potential social explosion.    [Shokhin] What is happening there could not better reflect  what is happening in our industry and the desire of the  directorial corps to solve their problems by proven methods.  After all, two-thirds of the plant's shares belong to the  Mikrodin Company and the Moscow Federal Property Fund. So that  they won't picket it? No, the ZiL workers appeal neither to  commercial structures nor to the Moscow government. All because  both of them, for loans and the more so for financing, need an  effective production program and a guarantee of sales. Their  plant management cannot provide them. So we are looking for a  way to keep ZiL afloat.    [Vishnevskaya] Preferential loans without a guarantee of  selling what has been produced?    [Shokhin] No. Consultation with shareholders, working out a  program and a new management system. The Moscow authorities  decided to ease the load on ZiL somewhat, after taking on its  social infrastructure -- housing, medical institutions. I am now  trying to talk the capital's government into turning over to the  plant the land on which ZiL stands. With it as security, loans  could be attracted.    [Vishnevskaya] Mortgage rights, a mortgage -- some time ago  we began an active discussion of them, but things went no  further than talks. After all, commercial banks could also grant  a loan secured by land.    [Shokhin] This is one of the most important noninflationary  methods of stabilization in key sectors. In this case, state  guarantees might be given even to commercial structures  investing funds in the development of production. I feel in  general that the funds of Russian banks, commercial structures,  finance companies, and institutional investors (pension,  insurance funds) are a very important source of investment in  the Russian economy. It is possible that we may have to  guarantee the securities that they issue. But only when their  funds go toward projects specified in the program for structural  reorganization, agriculture, the defense complex.    [Vishnevskaya] Quite recently, when inflation was 20 percent  and more a month, it would have been laughable at the least to  talk about investments. Just who is going to invest money for  several years under such conditions? Right now inflation rates  have slowed noticeably. But they are linked to an unprecedented  production slump. Have we not got into a vicious circle: In  order for production to revive, we need money, and money means a  rise in inflation, inflation fattens up additional capital and  makes it unprofitable to invest in production?    [Shokhin] Some enterprises have already got into one, having  picked up commercial loans at a high interest rate, not even  thinking about how they will pay back the money. Even though, of  course, this rate is clearly too high, and speculative. Low  inflation has another advantage, however, which is somehow often  forgotten --the possibility of reducing the interest rate.  According to the information of the last three months, it could  have been reduced to 160 percent without hurting  credit-financial institutions. There are limits, of course, for  example, the market interest rate. Here the state, having worked  out a mechanism which makes it impossible to raise these  interest rates, might have its say.    [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, there are also loans  from international financial institutions -- the International  Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, the World Bank. Can we count on them? After all,  what we can owe is limited by our potential for paying off the  debt. What if we fall into a pit of debt.    [Shokhin] You are quite right. Right now we have submitted  to  the State Duma the draft of a law which limits aid to us to $5.7  billion. In no way can we go over this sum! Otherwise, in the  next few years "payment peaks" will arise and we will have to  pay back up to half of the new loans to clear off the old ones.  This is just about what happened in the last two years, when we  were getting interstate loans without giving much thought to how  to pay them back.    [Vishnevskaya] There are loans and loans, though. "Cheap"  loan money can be invested in more profitable projects. Surely?    [Shokhin] Not quite. In the first place, because you have to  pay more for a large loan. Even so, for 1994-1995 we invested  $4.5 billion in the budget (but for 1992-1993 -- only $2.5  billion). There are no more realistic possibilities, except  through cutting back expenditures on items other than social  ones. And in the second place, precisely because they are cheap,  it is not worthwhile, for example, investing them in the  development of the oil and gas complex. Commercial, more  "expensive" loans can be drawn in there. So through the cheap  ones, create a mechanism of social support for the population,  and adapt the reforms, if you like, to the social-political  situation in the country.    [Vishnevskaya] What do you mean?    [Shokhin] For example, practically everyone agrees that  taxes  have become too heavy for enterprises to bear. It would be nice  to lower taxes instantly by 10-15 percent. Then, however, a tax  gap is inevitable in the time between their reduction, and this  means a reduction in budget receipts, and the increase in  business activity, for which, strictly speaking, tax reform is  needed. There is no way to fill this gap other than with the aid  of foreign loans. Having obtained them in the autumn, and this  is presumably $4 billion, they could go toward tax reform.  Another direction for the use of "cheap" loans might be the  development of a social infrastructure, with its transfer to the  balance sheet of the enterprises (most of them have not had the  money for it for a long time) and to municipal authorities. We  could take out a social loan for this. Negotiations are in  progress concerning a half-billion dollar loan of this sort. As  for investment loans, here we must suppress our appetites a  little and pass from loans secured by government guarantees to  investments in specific projects, using a mortgage.    [Vishnevskaya] This is, though, a basically different form  of  borrowing money -- not from the government or international  financial organizations, but from private investors.    [Shokhin] Yes. It is a turning point in interrelations  between Russian and foreign entrepreneurs and banks. Private  investments are direct investments according to project  financing schemes. They will be given for a guarantee, not from  the government, but from the creditor himself, for example, with  land as security -- as we were talking about in the case of ZiL.    [Vishnevskaya] This mechanism presupposes not only the  direct  collaboration of two partners -- Russian and foreign -- but also  the responsibility of the former to the latter?    [Shokhin] Yes, if the debt is not repaid, the creditor can  sell the security (that same land), convert the rubles made to  currency and export it abroad. Neither pickets nor leaflets nor  meetings will help here.    [Vishnevskaya] But in order for a private investor to invest  his money in the Russian economy, he should still have some sort  of guarantee. If the Russian government does not pay back the  sums invested in a bankrupt enterprise, at least have stable  legislation -- customs, tax. In our country it runs up against,  to put it mildly, the inconsistency of the decisions made. For  example, why, suddenly, since December of last year, have they  begun to levy tax on the added value of capital imported into  Russia? After all, in September, an edict of the president  introduced a moratorium for several years (!) on the force of  the normative acts that worsen the conditions for the activity  of foreign firms on Russian territory.    [Shokhin] This is an example of our legislative instability  that worries actual and potential investors so much, an example  of what free interpretation can be like. Explanations must be  given here. The capital that was imported as part of the charter  capital is not taxed. As for the investments, the tax on them  immediately disappears, as soon as the equipment is installed,  that is, the investments become real. The technical question, it  is true, remains: whether to grant a deferment of the VAT  payment for the period until the equipment is installed or to  exact it right away, and then return the sum paid. There are  difficulties involved in both the first and the second case. In  the first -- how is the period for which the deferment is  granted determined, and in the second -- should the sum paid be  indexed on the basis of inflation. In any event, though, if a  new tax or duty is introduced, a certain "period of adaptation"  to the new regime is necessary.    [Vishnevskaya] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, it is not only  foreign  investors who need legislative and other stability in our  country, though, our entrepreneurs need it too. I meet many  plant and factory directors. Often they do not ask for  privileges, but they want clear-cut, clearly understandable  economic legislation, and also -- the removal of the  restrictions that fetter their work.    [Shokhin] There is no doubt about it, everyone needs  stability. Above all, one must adhere precisely to the laws, for  example on the customs tariff, which does not specify any  individual privileges. Even though, probably, we will not  succeed in refusing all privileges, for example, for projects  that are already being completed and established as privileged,  you do not stop construction because of the last nut. But you do  not have to pass these privileges through the budget and show  how much we lose on them and monitor their object-oriented use  as well. We must also remove thoughtless restrictions, for  example, the quota, for that same petroleum complex, on the  export of petroleum products. If nonpayments make it impossible  for an oil refinery to trade with fellow countrymen, then do not  stop production (and so on, meanwhile, along the chain, right  down to the oil extractors, who are faced with the problem of  whether to kill the wells!). Let them increase the export.    [Vishnevskaya] One hears all the time that there is not  enough money. We think about how to attract foreign loans and  investments and how to interest our entrepreneurs and financiers  in investing funds in the development of the economy. Again,  however, the draft of the state budget has been made up with a  deficit, and moreover: The State Duma is proposing that this  deficit be increased. After all, our country has its debtors. Or  have these debts already been relegated to the ranks of the  hopeless?    [Shokhin] There are, of course, hopeless ones. One must  remember that our debtors are the least developed countries. The  governments of some of them, on this basis, appealing to the  feelings of the Russian leaders, are asking that their debts be  remitted. To excuse the debts does not, however, mean forgetting  about them. In this case each debtor requires his own approach.  Libya, for example, is well enough off to pay us, for example,  for the supply of oil. For this, however, the UN sanctions  should be removed. Work is proceeding in this direction. In  another direction, though -- it is not proceeding. I mean that  many countries are already concluding pre-contractual protocols  of intent with Libya. There is a danger that, when the sanctions  are rescinded, we will not find ourselves first in this queue.    [Vishnevskaya] It is difficult even to get what is ours.  What  other methods can be used to recover our debts?    [Shokhin] This can be done, for example, through supply of  traditional export goods.    [Vishnevskaya] Like China, which offers its feather-beds and  track shoes in payment for the newest, most modern technological  equipment?    [Shokhin] This is not, of course, the most profitable  variant  for us. There are others, though. For example, converting debts  into property on the territory of the debtor-state.    [Vishnevskaya] But can we negotiate a debt to some other  state whose economic level permits it to expect repayment?    [Shokhin] Yes. The only question is, in the first place, how  much it will pay us, buying this debt, and in the second place,  must we ourselves in this way leave our debtor's country.  Perhaps we could work out a long-term scheme for repaying the  debt, but remain in the country. The important thing today is  not getting the money, even though we need it very much, but  being included in economic and political dialogue as a member  with equal rights.</p>

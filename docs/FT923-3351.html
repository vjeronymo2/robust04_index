			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Prices index shows lowest August rise for a decade THE DOWNWARD pressure on prices continued last month as hard-pressed retailers avoided repeating many of the previous August's price increases. The 0.1 per cent rise in the retail prices index from 138.8 in July to 138.9 last month was the smallest monthly increase for any August since 1982. Muted price increases for food, motoring costs, gas and household goods contributed to the fall in the annual rate from 3.7 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Seasonal food prices continued to show the most spectacular falls, dropping by 12 per cent last month compared with the same month a year ago. That was the lowest annual rate for nearly 10 years. Seasonal food prices normally rise in August, but increases this year were not as sharp as last year, with prices for fresh vegetables and fruit continuing to fall. The 1.1 per cent increase on the previous month was mainly the result of dearer potatoes. According to the figures from the Central Statistical Office, overall food prices dropped to their lowest annual rate of increase since May 1983. However, within that, non-seasonal food prices were boosted by more expensive confectionery, dairy products and imported lamb. The fall in clothing and footwear prices, compared with a year ago, reflected special offers for seasonal clothing and continued cut-price sales for women's clothes. Prices for menswear recovered slightly. The highest annual rates of price increases continued to be in the service sector. Household services rose by 5.9 per cent in the year to August, although lower house conveyancing charges and estate agents' fees led to a 0.1 per cent drop on the previous month. Personal goods and services and leisure services showed high year-on-year rates of increase. The 0.2 per cent monthly increase in housing costs mainly reflected an increase in mortgage interest payments. Fuel and light prices fell 0.5 per cent on the month as the second phase of the cut in gas prices continued. Motoring costs fell 0.2 per cent on the month, reflecting lower petrol prices, although the price of MoT tests increased in August. The disinflationary momentum in the economy is likely to continue this month, even though most summer cut-price sales will end and new stock will enter the shops.</p>

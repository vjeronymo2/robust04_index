The current AD also requires replacement of the clutch assembly at certain time-in-service intervals. This action would require the same inspections and replacements as required by the current AD, but would provide an additional approved replacement part number and provide a reference to three additional manufacturer service documents. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by October 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;27&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298.

AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 also requires replacement of the main rotor transmission clutch assembly (clutch assembly) when unairworthy, and establishes a 1,200 hours time-in-service retirement life on the clutch assembly. That action was prompted by several failures of the clutch assembly. Based on an analysis of the clutch assembly failure data, the FAA, in conjunction with The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation and Formsprag, the clutch assembly manufacturer, determined that the clutch assembly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;1 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;1 through &hyph;7), could not be safely overhauled and returned to service. The FAA has determined that premature failure of the clutch assembly due to a loss of lubricant creates an unsafe condition. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent failure of the clutch assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has approved the use of clutch assembly, part number (P/N) 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10), in addition to the earlier clutch assembly, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) as replacement clutch assemblies. Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09, The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0069, Revision A, dated July 9, 1990, that contains an overhaul time interval for clutch assemblies, P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;2 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;8) and P/N 28&hyph;13401&hyph;4 (Formsprag CL 40526&hyph;10). Also, AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 referenced neither Enstrom Service Information Letter (SIL) No. 0084, dated December 19, 1978, pertaining to checking the run-out of the main rotor pinion shaft nor Enstrom SDB No. 0068, dated May 8, 1986, subsequently reissued July 9, 1990, pertaining to the retirement life of the clutch assembly. Finally, a note contained in AD 89&hyph;04&hyph;09 incorrectly referenced SIL ``0038A''; the reference should have been SIL ``No. 0088, Revision A, dated August 6, 1980.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

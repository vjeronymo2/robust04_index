			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting gains at British Syphon BRITISH SYPHON Industries, the industrial group which is 70 per cent owned by management following an attempt to take the company private in 1989, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 3.02m, for the six months to June 30. The result was struck on sales down 14 per cent at Pounds 19.7m. Mr Bryan Morrall, chairman, said the gains had been made through cost cutting and tighter working capital. Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.5m. The group, which has cash deposits of Pounds 30m, also stressed its determination to seek a suitable acquisition at the earliest opportunity. It is likely to pay for a purchase with shares and would use the cash to pay off a target's debt. Any paper deal would dilute both the management and Mr Nathu Ram Puri who, with his private conglomerate Melton Medes, controls 25 per cent of British Syphon. Mr Puri's stake barred management from taking the group private in 1989. Mr Morrall said an acquisition would be in the interests of all shareholders. A paper deal would create a market for the shares and, in effect, return the company to the public arena. British Syphon has been actively looking for an acquisition in the manufacturing sector. It was reported to have been the suitor for Mosaic early this summer, before withdrawing at the last minute. During the first half, it took a Pounds 400,000 extraordinary charge for the costs of an aborted acquisition. Mr Morrall said the ideal target would roughly double British Syphon's market capitalisation of Pounds 30m at last night's share price of 88p. The group is to pay an interim dividend of 2p; it only returned to the dividend list after four years, with a payment of 3p, in December. Mr Morrall said part of the reason for resuming dividends was to increase the attraction of an all-paper offer. Earnings per share were 11 per cent ahead at 5.9p (5.3p).</p>

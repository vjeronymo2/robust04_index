			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The federal judge who presided over the breakup of AT&amp;T has been assigned  the Iran-Contra case of former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter.  U.S. District Judge Harold Greene was given the case in a two-paragraph order  signed by Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson, who has been handling the pretrial  proceedings. Robinson said in the order that he was handing the matter over to  Greene because "the case will be protracted and complex." Robinson is also  handling pretrial hearings in the Iran-Contra case of Richard V. Secord, who  asked Robinson in a court session not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges  against him contained in two separate indictments.  </P></p>

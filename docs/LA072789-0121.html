			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. DISASTER OFFICIALS GET SOME NEW WHEELS  </P> <P> With ambitious plans for a "command-and-control" helicopter still in a holding  pattern, Los Angeles officials are about to unveil two less exotic vehicles to  help them respond to earthquakes and other emergencies -- a pair of huge  recreational vehicles converted to provide work space close to a disaster site  for as many as 31 city officials.  </P> <P> The 36-foot-long roving "war rooms" basically re-create on wheels the emergency  operations center buried four floors below City Hall, where department heads  now gather to coordinate relief efforts. Dominated by rows of high-tech  workstations, the vehicles are designed to be connected at the scene to two  trailers, one carrying a power generator and the other filled with  communications equipment.  </P> <P> "No other government agency has what we're putting together," Los Angeles  Police Cmdr. George A. Morrison said of the $1.5-million cluster of RVs and  trailers known as the Mobile Alternate Emergency Operations Center.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, for Morrison and other members of the city's Emergency Operations  Board, the ultimate dream remains a one-of-a-kind helicopter that would enable  top managers from various departments to hover over the wreckage of the Big One  for as long as three hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Bids on Copter  </P> <P> Officials announced plans for the airborne control center two years ago,  envisioning a craft housing six computerized workstations hooked into video  cameras, infrared heat sensors and night-vision equipment. If a bridge were  destroyed, for instance, transportation and public works officials would be  able to decide immediately if it could be repaired and select alternate  evacuation routes.  </P> <P> After the plan won City Council approval and a 136-page bid request was sent to  manufacturers, the expectation was that the helicopter would take flight by  this summer.  </P> <P> But there was one problem -- the city's cost estimate of $4.5 million was so  unrealistic that no one would bid on the project.  </P> <P> Now city officials are getting ready to propose the copter again to the  council's Finance and Revenue Committee, this time with an estimated price tag  of $8 million to $10 million.  </P> <P> "We have come into this on a phase basis," Morrison said. "The helicopter is  the last phase. . . . I'm pretty optimistic we can come in close to the $8  million."  </P> <P> For the moment, however, emergency response teams will have to rely on the  custom-fitted RVs if the underground City Hall center is disabled or if they  decide that a command post should be established near the spot most heavily  damaged by an earthquake, brush fire, winter storm, toxic leak or other  disaster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Final Touches  </P> <P> The General Services Department is putting final touches on the 13-foot-high  vehicles in a caged area of the fortified C. Erwin Piper Technical Center,  where the police air support division and its 15 helicopters are based.  </P> <P> One of the RVs has 15 work stations, the other 16. At each station, a worker  will face a control panel that can accommodate a lap-top computer and tune in  18 radio frequencies or the city's microwave TV system, which can transmit  pictures of the damage taken by video cameras aboard police or fire  helicopters.  </P> <P> "It's not that this is going to sit around and wait for the San Andreas Fault  to go," Morrison said. "We will probably use it for training purposes on minor  emergencies . . . just to test it, give it a shakedown cruise."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY FILED BY JIMSAIR AVIATION  </P> <P> Jimsair Aviation Services, a San Diego aircraft fueling and service company  with operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field and in Palm Springs, has filed  for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.  </P> <P> President Phil Bracamonte said the company's high debt -- taken on to finance  expansion -- coupled with a downturn in business forced it to seek protection  from creditors.  </P> <P> There will be no disruption of services and no layoffs of the company's 65  employees, he said.  </P> <P> In an interview, Bracamonte said the company has $8.9 million in assets and  $8.4 million in liabilities. Among the assets is a lease for hangar space  through the year 2014 with the San Diego Unified Port District, operator of  Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> The company recently spent a considerable sum doubling its hangar space at  Lindbergh, but Bracamonte said problems with the Palm Springs facility were  more to blame for the financial difficulties that led to the bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> The company's major creditors include Textron, First National Bank of San Diego  and BP Oil, the firm's attorney Peter L. Duncan said Thursday.  </P> <P> Jimsair filed its bankruptcy petition in the court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  James W. Meyers. The company was founded in 1952, when it established a  presence at Lindbergh, Bracamonte said.  </P> <P> A sale of the company to Flightcraft of Portland, Ore. was announced last year  but fell through.

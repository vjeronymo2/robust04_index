			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS IMPACT OF THE QUAKE;  </P> <P> QUICK THINKING HELPS SMALL FIRM COPE  </P> <P> Joel Ritch's San Francisco office was intact when he arrived Wednesday, but his  business was a mess.  </P> <P> His firm, Professional Messenger, like many San Francisco small businesses,  does not have a contingency plan for emergencies. Instead, he has operated by  "instant, knee-jerk reaction." The office was without power when Ritch,  president of the firm, and two employees entered the brick building south of  downtown Wednesday morning. Ritch immediately rented a portable generator to  restore some of the power in the offices. By later in the day, one of seven  telephone lines started working.  </P> <P> On Thursday, nearly as soon as power had been restored, Ritch and his staff  found themselves out on the street: Police and fire officials ordered them out  as they closed a building next door because of suspected structural damage.  </P> <P> Ritch loaded important files and a telephone into a car, and operations  director Debra Steckel made arrangements for the firm's answering service to  take calls and forward messages to the Paradise Lounge across the street.  </P> <P> A bus stop then became the operation's center for Professional Messenger, which  has a staff of about 10 workers and contracts with about 20 messengers who  operate on bikes, motorcycles and cars, serving firms in the entire San  Francisco Bay Area.  </P> <P> Messengers, who on a typical day get directions by walkie-talkie or two-way  radio, swung by the bus stop for their orders.  </P> <P> "We have no idea where our drivers are," Steckel said. "This is a very complex  operation. Now it's a nightmare."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ritch began considering longer-term concerns.  </P> <P> With no offices, he attempted to reach the landlord of a building that the firm  had planned to move into in December to see if they might set up quarters  earlier there.  </P> <P> Other options included going to Ritch's home. "We could rent cellular phones  and pagers for all the messengers," said Ritch. "We could even do it right here  in the street."  </P> <P> The firm was able to remedy its problem at least for the near term, when, after  an hour of discussion with officials from the city's Building Inspector's  Office, Ritch and his staff were allowed to re-enter the building, but the  building's owner must immediately obtain a structural engineer's report that  the building could survive the crash of its neighbor.  </P> <P> Ritch was also trying to develop a plan to provide service from San Francisco  to Oakland, which has been made extremely difficult because of the collapse of  the Bay Bridge, which connects the two cities. "We'll hire people to ride the  BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to get across the Bay. On each side, messengers  will meet them at the station and go from there."  </P> <P> Ritch said that two or three days without doing business will wipe out profits  for perhaps two or three months. If his firm is forced to close six days, "It  would kill us."  </P> <P> "When you're young, you don't have an emergency plan. But we're also  adaptable," Steckel said. "This is the kind of business where we've got an  emergency every day. We just have to come up with a new solution for this one."  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sony blames strong yen for 49% profits fall Sony, the Japanese electronics group which also owns US recording labels and Hollywood studios, yesterday announced a 49.2 per cent fall in worldwide net profits to Y3.91bn (Dollars 39m) in the first quarter to June. The drop, which came in spite of a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y864.5bn and a 25.7 per cent jump in operating profits to Y31.8bn, was blamed on the rise in the yen. Sony said the increase in the currency cost it Y43bn in revenues when translated into yen. Through forward contracts it still achieved a net foreign exchange gain of Y7.5bn in the three months, but this was 63.2 per cent below the 1993 first quarter. Mr Sumio Sano, a Sony director, said its forex arrangements for the year as a whole were more favourable. This would be the main factor in allowing the group to meet its earlier forecast that full-year net profits would rebound 161 per cent to Y40bn, on a 7 per cent rise in sales to Y3,990bn. To counter the effect of the high yen on exports, Sony continues to move production of electronics hardware overseas. By next March, according to Mr Sano, sites abroad would produce 45 per cent of all output, up from 41 per cent now and 35 per cent at the start of the latest three months. The quarter was the first since the group was streamlined into largely independent business units each responsible for its own marketing. Sales of video equipment fell 1.3 per cent but audio products rose 5.2 per cent, supported by sales of MiniDisc players. Demand for television sets rose 10.1 per cent and other electronic products 3.4 per cent. On the entertainment side, which accounts for nearly a fifth of all sales, music business revenues rose 12 per cent on the back of hit albums by artists ranging from Pink Floyd to the Spin Doctors. Takings from the Columbia and TriStar film studios were down 4.3 per cent, mainly due to the effect of the stronger yen. On a local currency basis, revenues were up 1 per cent in pictures and 27 per cent in music. In Japan and Europe, which were its two weakest markets last time, Sony increased total sales by 3.9 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively. US revenues were up 1.6 per cent. The results reflect the performance of its 818 subsidiaries and 24 equity-accounted affiliates.</p>

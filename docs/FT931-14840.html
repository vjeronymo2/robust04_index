			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices sheltered from a turbulent week - High output has countered the effects of gales and air strikes TWO YEARS ago the threat of air strikes against Iraq was driving oil prices to the highest level for years, but the market barely batted an eyelid after this week's raids against Saddam Hussein's missile sites. Even several days' of production disruptions in the North Sea, with severe gales preventing tankers from loading, has failed to lift prices for Brent crude. The fact that both developments had little or no effect on world prices underlined the weakness of the market, which is primarily a result of over-production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. At the same time, Iraq is banned by United Nations' sanctions from exporting oil and tension between Washington and Baghdad constitutes no short-term threat to oil supplies. Prices for North Sea Brent crude edged upwards yesterday but traders are not expecting substantial gains: oil product stocks are high, Opec shows no signs of staunching the flow of oil to the market and demand remains depressed. Persistently high output has caused prices to slide by about Dollars 1 a barrel from the already low level which ruled at the beginning of the year, and several analysts are forecasting a further decline to Dollars 16 a barrel before the mid-February Opec meeting. 'There is still plenty of oil in the world, demand is not great and I see no upward pressure on price,' said Mr Tom Manning, market analyst at Purvin and Gertz, the Houston-based consultants. The International Energy Agency, the west's oil monitoring body, expects world demand for oil to rise by only 1 per cent this year, or 600,000 barrels a day to 67.6m b/d. Even this modest pick-up in consumption is not expected to materialise until the second half of the year as world economic activity increases. Oil companies have built up their stocks of crude oil and products significantly and are not selling them off as quickly as they usually do at this time of year, chiefly because the weather in North America and Europe has not been as cold as usual. The American Petroleum Institute reported late on Tuesday that US stocks of gasoline had increased by more than 5m barrels in the previous week. Although some refineries in the US have trimmed production rates, this has not been enough to soak up high product inventories. By cutting output Opec could throw support under current low oil prices, but the organisation is yet to show much political will for this. Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's minister of energy and mines and Opec's current president, is to embark on a tour of the Middle East next week in a bid to build consensus for a cut in production. He is unlikely to be successful unless prices fall far enough to concentrate producers' minds and many Opec watchers believe prices will have to decline by at least another Dollars 1 a barrel to galvanise member countries into taking action. Mr Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consultancy, believes the call on Opec oil will fall from about 25m b/d by at least 2m b/d in the second quarter which is in line with Opec's own forecast of 23.45m b/d. 'But there is a complicated process at work in cutting output because countries are simultaneously battling for market share,' he said. Opec members have steadfastly ignored November's production agreement, which called for cuts in output to a ceiling of 24.58m b/d, and actual production has totalled more than 25m b/d. Big producers are struggling to maximise market share, which improves their clout within the organisation. Saudi Arabia and Iran hold the key to a production deal as they pump the most oil. But traders at leading international oil companies say they have already booked their oil purchases from the two producers for February and are even buying March oil from Iran. Saudi Arabia's scheduled sales point to a production rate of 8.4m b/d in February, indicating a slight reduction since the kingdom's share of oil output in the neutral zone - between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - will be shut in for maintenance work. This implies a slight cut of about 150,000 b/d from January's production. Iran's sales programme points to a rate of 3.5m to 3.6m b/d - little or no reduction from current levels. Mr Joe Stanislaw, market watcher at Cambridge Energy Research Associates has blamed the current tension in the market on a 'triangle of contention'. This includes Kuwait's rapid production rebound, uncertainty over Iraq's resumption of exports and underlying competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran over market share, Opec leadership and, ultimately, regional pre-eminence. The bombing of Iraq will presumably extend the United Nations' ban on Iraqi exports of oil - giving Opec a breathing space on that score. But the governments in Riyadh and Tehran still need to agree on cuts and on a way to curb Kuwait's growing output. On top of the immediate imperatives, Opec nations are all lifting capacity faster than demand is rising. A report by the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London estimates Opec capacity will rise by 2.7m b/d this year excluding Iraq. The report warns that Opec must exercise restraint if it is to see prices rise. Falling production from the former Soviet Union has, in the past, given Opec room to manoeuvre on capacity increases. Production from the Commonwealth of Independent States dropped last year to 9m b/d from 10.4m b/d in 1991, according to the IEA. That decline should stabilise slightly this year, but the body still expects output to fall to 8m b/d. Opec nations are aware of the need to give the market a clear signal that they are prepared to make some production cutbacks in the second quarter. But if prices stabilise at today's levels, the political will to trim output will not be as great. The more prices fall, the more likely Opec is to cut.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Trade Union of Radio Employees has  declared a strike alert. The nearly 100 trade union members  also decided at a meeting in the afternoon that next Thursday  they will protest against the dismissals which have been  announced with a demonstration at the radio. The Independent  Trade Union of Radio Employees also protested against the fact  that the radio leadership, obviously for political reasons, has  launched disciplinary procedure against Laszlo Gyori, chairman  of the trade union and of the strike committee, and Peter  Borenics, chairman of the Council of Public Employees. The  Independent Trade Union of Radio Employees has confirmed its  previous stance that the illegal measures of the radio bosses  harm the listeners most of all, because such moves endanger  objective information and the implementation of the radio's  public service tasks.</p>

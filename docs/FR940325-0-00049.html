			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 182(b)(3) of the CAAA, States were required by November 15, 1992, to adopt regulations requiring owners or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate vapor recovery equipment at their facilities. The CAAA specifies that these State rules must apply to any facility that dispenses more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month or, in the case of an independent small business marketer, any facility that dispenses more than 50,000 gallons of gasoline per month. Section 324 of the CAAA defines an independent small business marketer, which is fully set forth in the TSD. The State has adopted the statutory definition of independent small business marketer in its regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has adopted a general applicability requirement of 10,000 gallons per month. The State has also chosen to exempt independent small business marketers dispensing under 50,000 gallons per month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As more fully discussed in the EPA's Enforcement Guidance and the General Preamble (57 FR 13514), the State has provided that the gallons of gasoline dispensed per month will be based on the average gasoline throughput for the most recent two year period without facility shutdown, and calculated monthly. If two year data is not available, the calculation is based on the monthly average for the most recent 12 calendar months (including only those months for which the facility was operating). The EPA finds the applicability requirements in the Louisiana Stage II rule to be acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of Stage II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAAA specifies the time by which certain facilities must comply with the State regulation. For facilities that are not owned or operated by an independent small business marketer, these times, calculated from the time of State adoption of the regulation, are: (1) Six months for facilities for which construction began after November 15, 1990; (2) one year for facilities that dispense at least 100,000 gallons of gasoline per month; and (3) two years for all other facilities. The Louisiana Stage II rule time schedule sets a compliance schedule of six months after State rule promulgation, one year after State rule promulgation, and two years after State rule promulgation, respectively for the above three deadlines. For independent small business marketers, section 324(a) of the CAAA provides that the time periods may be: (1) 33 percent of the facilities owned by an independent small business marketer by the end of the first year after the regulations take effect; (2) 66 percent of such facilities by the end of the second year; and (3) 100 percent of such facilities after the third year. Although Louisiana promulgated its Stage II regulations on November 20, 1992, five days after the SIP was required to be submitted, the EPA believes it is appropriate to accept the State's compliance schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is approving the submitted time table for the following reasons. First, the CAAA states that the adoption date must be used to calculate the compliance schedule for Stage II implementation at facilities. In this case, the EPA accepts Louisiana's approach of triggering compliance dates from the date when the regulations were promulgated. The compliance deadlines triggered by this date begin only five days after the time schedule specified by the CAAA. The EPA considers an additional five days to be of minimal impact and will have no adverse impact on the integrity of the program. Also, the timetable initiation date established by the State on November 20, 1992, began shortly after adoption of the regulations. Secondly, remedying this deficiency by amending the compliance schedule would cause further delay in the implementation of Stage II in Louisiana, in that a State revision to the Stage II rule could establish a new and later adoption date and hence later compliance deadlines. Lastly, the Louisiana rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements, and the EPA believes it will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated area. Therefore, the EPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make enforceable this requirement at the earliest time feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Program Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency. The EPA has indicated three acceptable methods of demonstrating a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency: (1) A method tested and approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB); (2) a testing program that is equivalent to the CARB program, that will be conducted by the Program Oversight Agency (POA), or by a third party recognized by the POA, and submitted and approved by the EPA for incorporation into the SIP; or (3) a system approved by the CARB. The State has chosen to use a system approved by the CARB, or an equivalent certification authority approved by the administrative authority*. The State regulations define the administrative authority* to include both the State Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA. Thus, equivalent system certification authorities would have to be formally approved by the EPA and could be incorporated into the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State requires sources to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test and a leak test prior to system operation and every five years or upon major modification of a facility's Stage II equipment (i.e., 75 percent or more Stage II equipment change). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann and Canal Plus agree to join forces Bertelsmann, the German multimedia group, and Canal Plus, France's leading pay-TV broadcaster, have agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the expected proliferation of new television services around the world. The move is intended to enable both companies to compete more effectively with the rash of Anglo-Saxon multimedia ventures already established. Bertelsmann is the largest multimedia group in the world after Time Warner, and Canal Plus the largest and most profitable pay-TV broadcaster in France. The deal will extend the co-operation between the two companies, already partners in the first German pay-TV channel, Premiere, into future cross-border exercises. 'It will ensure the development opportunities for both our enterprises in an important future area for the electronic media, including forms of pay-TV, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, and other special services,' they said. Bertelsmann pointed out that private television channels - like the company's highly-successful RTL channel in Germany - were reaching the limits of financing available from broadcast advertising. New channels would require new forms of financing. The advent of digital television would enable the distribution of a new variety of different channels and services, which would have to be financed by viewers as they watched or used them. It said the latest venture was the 'logical international extension' of last week's agreement between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and KirchGroup, to establish a service company to manage and distribute the future pay-TV and other services on the existing German cable network. The announcement of the deal comes at a turbulent time for the French group, which last month became embroiled in a row over the sudden resignation of Mr Andre Rousselet, its founder and chairman.</p>

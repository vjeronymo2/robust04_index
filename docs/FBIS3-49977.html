Mudresa: "Not in Montenegro's Interest"] </F>   [Text] Podgorica -- It is certain that the international  sanctions will remain in effect for some time. Therefore, the  healthy part of the economy that can produce and sell its  products must be stimulated. The new economic program for the  revival of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been drafted  by a team of experts and it would be good if the federal  government shared the responsibility for the program's  implementation. This was stated by Vojin Djukanovic, president  of Economic Chamber of Montenegro at a meeting with businessmen  and trade union leaders in Podgorica yesterday.    However, the majority of businessmen drew attention to a  number of unknowns contained in the program. Slobodan Lekovic  took the view that the elaborate program did not take into  account the interests of Montenegro, above all, those in the  maritime economy, tourism, and transportation infrastructure.  "Relations between the two federal units -- Serbia and  Montenegro -- in their joint state of Yugoslavia have not been  presented fully and clearly," Lekovic said.    Dr. Janko Radulovic expressed the view that reaching a  political consensus is a very important factor for the  realization of the program. He stressed that the program must  be accompanied by a number of operational and legal regulations,  adding: "The program is more turned toward the Republic of  Serbia and if it has any pretensions toward the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, it must respect the specific characteristics of  the Montenegrin economy more."    Danilo Popovic, head of the Montenegrin Confederation of  Trade Unions, said that it was not questionable that we needed a  program to solve the crisis, but expressed the doubt: "Who will  pay for it if it fails. A large number of workers, pensioners,  and disabled people, according to statistics, are paupers,  because they are surviving on about 10 German marks a month when  it is known that the minimum amount of money needed to survive,  according to international standards, is about 30 German marks a  month. Trade unions will demand wages to be paid in a stable,  convertible currency, or the new dinar, or in kind." Popovic  said that the Confederation of Trade Unions would today  officially inform the public about its objections to the  program. This will also be done by the Economic Chamber of  Montenegro in its assessment that will be sent to the federal  government today.</p>

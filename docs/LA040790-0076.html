			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAO SAYS S&amp;L COST COULD RISE TO $500 BILLION  </P> <P> The savings and loan bailout, already pegged as the most expensive financial  debacle in the nation's history, will cost at least $325 billion and could cost  as much as $500 billion over the next 30 or 40 years, the General Accounting  Office told Congress on Friday.  </P> <P> The $325-billion estimate by the auditing arm of Congress is $68 billion higher  than a GAO estimate last summer and is still "subject to significant change" if  optimistic Bush Administration economic assumptions of steady growth and  declining interest rates do not pan out, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher  told the Senate Finance Committee.  </P> <P> If those assumptions prove wrong and the economy stumbles, the outcome could be  far worse, Bowsher told the few senators who showed up at the hearing. "It  could easily go to $400 billion if more savings and loans fail and their asset  base proves to be as bad as it has in many cases," Bowsher said. "If there is a  recession, it could be as high as $500 billion."  </P> <P> Bowsher seemed to take a morbid sort of pleasure in the magnitude of the  eventual cost to the economy, noting at one point that it "would be bigger than  New York, bigger than Lockheed, bigger than all the bailouts we've had put  together." Warming up, he said: "It would be bigger than the Marshall Plan. It  would be bigger than the defense budget."  </P> <P> Moreover, even though the S&amp;L legislation contemplated that part of the  bailout costs would be covered by higher deposit insurance premiums paid by the  thrift industry and by the sale of assets held as collateral for soured loans,  most of the added cost would be borne directly by taxpayers, Bowsher said. "The  (thrift) industry is deteriorating badly. Most of these add-on numbers are  going to be taxpayer money."  </P> <P> But Bowsher said he could not estimate how much of the added cost would be  incurred during the next few years. Fifty-billion dollars has already been  authorized under the bailout legislation to cover the operations of the  Resolution Trust Corp., the new government entity created to close down  insolvent thrifts, sell their assets and pay their depositors.  </P> <P> He called on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Deposit Insurance  Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who is administering the bailout, to  "develop proposals to provide the additional funds." And he recommended that  twice a year the Resolution Trust Corp. and the FDIC give Congress updated  estimates of cash needs, costs and current income so the progress of the  bailout can be steadily tracked.  </P> <P> Bowsher's report made it clear, however, that about half of the estimated $68  billion in additional costs probably will be incurred during the next few  years.  </P> <P> For instance, the cost of the rushed closure of failing thrifts arranged by the  now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in the closing weeks of  1988 would cost $68 billion instead of the $56 billion originally earmarked.  The total, including the extra $12 billion, would have to be paid by 1999.  </P> <P> Similarly, the $50 billion set aside for Resolution Trust Corp. operations  through 1992 would have to be augmented by $13 billion. And, because it is  running up administrative expenses of $1.6 billion a year, the GAO estimates  that the trust corporation, which is supposed to go out of business at the end  of 1996, would cost an additional $10 billion by that date to pay for staff,  lawyers and administrative support.  </P> <P> The remaining $33 billion of the overrun could presumably be spread out over a  longer period. The biggest single added expense is $28 billion in extra  interest paid on the working capital that the Resolution Trust Corp. borrows to  liquidate the failed thrifts and buy up their assets. Many of those borrowings  are long-term, and the interest payments would be stretched out over the  nominal 33 years of the whole bailout.  </P> <P> The GAO tacked on another $5 billion to the interest cost of the $9.5 billion  in off-budget Resolution Funding Corp. bonds that have been issued so far. The  added interest results from the decision to stretch the redemption term on the  bonds a decade beyond GAO's original assumption, to 40 years.  </P> <P> The GAO report, although it had been expected to reflect substantially higher  costs for the huge bailout, was nevertheless greeted with cries of anguish by  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), Bob Graham  (D-Fla.) and Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), the only committee members present.  </P> <P> Riegle expressed great interest in Bowsher's observation that Seidman, in  previous public testimony, had noted that "60% of Resolution Trust  Corp.-controlled institutions have been victimized by serious criminal  activity" and that about 1,200 criminal referrals have already been passed on  to the Justice Department for prosecution.  </P> <P> Riegle wanted to know if any additional criminal activity could be traced to  the rush of "year-end deals" in 1988, but Assistant Comptroller General Richard  L. Fogel, who accompanied Bowsher to the committee, said the audit of those  activities had so far found none. Any criminal activity relating to the thrifts  involved in those deals seems to have originated in the management of the  thrifts themselves, not in the FSLIC stampede to close them.  </P> <P> Riegle said he would call on the Administration to come up with a funding plan  for the whole program at a hearing he intends to call next month.  </P> <P> Graham declared Bowsher's report a "devastating statement" that "should be a  call to arms for all people involved, from the Administration to Congress to  the industry."  </P> <P> "We've pretty much spent the peace dividend here," Pressler observed.  </P> <P> In reply to Pressler, Bowsher repeated the oft-stated observation that any  further delay in liquidating failed thrifts now in receivership would drive up  the costs still more. Over the last 14 months, regulators have seized 403  institutions but have disposed of only 52.  </P> <P> As an illustration of the point, Bowsher said his accountants estimated that,  instead of the now-predicted $325 billion, the multiyear liquidation and  bailout process would cost only $140 billion in "current value" if the entire  expense of the operation could be carried in the 1991 budget. That would about  double the deficit projected for the year.  </P></p>

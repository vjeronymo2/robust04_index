			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STICK TO REFORM PATH, GORBACHEV URGES PARTY;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: HE DEFENDS HIS PERESTROIKA POLICY. 'DARK TIMES' ARE AHEAD IF  CONSERVATIVES PREVAIL, HE SAYS.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening a crucial congress of the Soviet  Union's ruling Communist Party, defended his program of political and economic  reforms Monday and appealed for support to prevent a conservative takeover of  the party leadership that would end perestroika.  </P> <P> "Either Soviet society goes forward along the path of the profound changes that  have begun," Gorbachev warned, "or forces opposed to perestroika will gain the  upper hand, and then -- to be honest -- dark times are ahead for the country  and the people."  </P> <P> In a speech that defended as much as it advanced his reforms, Gorbachev  attempted to fend off an expected conservative assault on his reform program  and to consolidate his support at the outset of the 10-day congress.  </P> <P> "There are voices now -- in fact, more than that, an opposition has formed --  that says in all our failures, perestroika is to blame," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> This is "simply nonsense," he continued, blaming in turn "the extremely grim  legacy we inherited" from previous Soviet leaders.  </P> <P> Most of the nearly 4,700 delegates sat in stony silence, however, as Gorbachev  delivered his three-hour report, all but confirming that they are his critics,  making up the opposition against whom he was warning the nation in such caustic  terms.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, who has come under increasing conservative criticism for the  political philosophy underlying perestroika as well as for its practical  failures, also warned his critics on the left that the five-year reform effort  could be upset "if someone manages to split the democratic forces committed to  its principles."  </P> <P> "We must act even more resolutely because any delay is sure to aggravate the  situation in the country," the Soviet leader declared. "One of the serious  reasons for the difficulties we are encountering in many fields is the  resistance to change put up by the bureaucratic stratum in the managerial  structures and by the social forces associated with it."  </P> <P> This political showdown between Gorbachev and his conservative critics had been  building for weeks before the congress, and at the end of the first day, Vadim  A. Medvedev, the chief party ideologist and a close Gorbachev adviser,  portrayed the meeting as perhaps crucial for the forces of perestroika.  </P> <P> "We are living through a critical phase of perestroika," Medvedev told  reporters. "We are faced with the main issue of where the country will go,  whether the country will progress or recoil backward. . . .  </P> <P> "The danger of a conservative backlash or crackdown is looming larger. This is  the major problem we are facing here; it is the monumental threat that the  party congress faces."  </P> <P> Yet, Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative in the present leadership,  and Ivan K. Polozkov, the new first secretary of the Russian Communist Party  and an avowed conservative, both reiterated their support of Gorbachev as the  party's top commander.  </P> <P> And Alexander N. Yakovlev, the leading liberal in the Politburo, drew  thunderous applause -- far more than any other speaker Monday -- apparently  with the pure passion of his defense of perestroika.  </P> <P> "Dogmas can be saved for the time being, but history cannot be stopped,"  Yakovlev told the delegates. "Only a renovated, rejuvenated and  shifted-to-the-left party can lead the country ahead along the way of serious  changes. This movement is irreversible. It will proceed with the party, or  without it."  </P> <P> Members of the Democratic Platform, a faction in the party that has proposed  broader and faster reforms, said they feel that Gorbachev had tried to  accommodate their views in his report and they might reconsider their threat to  break with the party and establish their own after the congress.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev is trying to define a position for himself between conservatives and  radicals," Tamara Alaiba, a Democratic Platform delegate from the industrial  center of Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains, said. "But there was not an idea  that could unite the hall, this party. . . . You must have a great central idea  or proposal to do that."  </P> <P> But Polozkov, whose election last month as the first secretary of the Russian  Communist Party makes him one of the country's most powerful conservative  politicians, was even more dismissive of Gorbachev's report and the ideas in  it, though still pledging his support to Gorbachev for the party leadership.  </P> <P> "To calm the people would have been the greatest accomplishment," Polozkov said  after the lengthy speech. "We have talked a lot about things, but done little.  If people felt that something real was being done, they might respond.  </P> <P> "But there is no food, no gas, no clothing, no nothing, and we sit around  arguing about power."  </P> <P> In what may prove an important compromise with the conservatives, Gorbachev  appeared ready Monday to give up his proposal for the restructuring of the  party leadership to elect a chairman and one or two deputies and a presidium  made up largely of republican leaders.  </P> <P> Party traditionalists, who probably constitute a majority of the congress, have  argued in favor of maintaining the party's general secretary, perhaps with a  deputy, and the Politburo, a longstanding institution.  </P> <P> The change to a presidium headed by a chairman would be more than symbolic  since it would enforce the decentralization of the political leadership and end  the concentration of power that the Politburo has always represented.  </P> <P> This issue and others are expected to be debated later this week when delegates  discuss Gorbachev's report, the proposed party platform and the party's  reorganization. Originally scheduled to run a week, the congress was extended  to 10 days within an hour of its opening, and some political commentators  suggested it could go to 12.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, reminding delegates of how far the country has come in five years,  catalogued the changes in politics, in the economy, in the way that people  live, all to rebut conservatives' charges that perestroika is destroying the  country.  </P> <P> "The Stalinist model of socialism is being replaced by a civil society of free  men and women," Gorbachev said. "The political system is being radically  transformed, genuine democracy is being established with free elections, a  multi-party system and human rights, and real government by the people is being  revived. . . .  </P> <P> "The changes were pressing because the country was gathering speed in lapsing  into a second-rate state," he continued. "By the early 1980s, it had become  clear that our apparent well-being rested on a savage, wasteful use of natural  and human resources."  </P> <P> Arguing strongly for political pluralism and a market economy, Gorbachev asked  for a mandate to broaden and accelerate his reforms despite the conservative  opposition and the widespread apprehension about the impact of the changes.  </P> <P> Past mistakes and hesitancy "dictate the imperative need to accelerate and  radicalize the economic reform," he said. "We can no longer tolerate the  managerial system that rejects scientific and technological progress and new  technologies, that is committed to cost-ineffectiveness and that generates  squandering and waste. . . .  </P> <P> "The very logic of perestroika and the dramatic social and economic situation  in the country brings us face to face with the need for fundamental changes in  the economic system."  </P> <P> He sketched plans for further reforms aimed at transforming what is now largely  a state-owned, centrally planned economy to one that will be driven by the  market forces of supply and demand and where entrepreneurship and private  ownership will be encouraged.  </P> <P> "We regard the market not as a goal in itself, but as a means of making the  economy more effective and improving the standard of living," Gorbachev said,  replying to frequent conservative criticism of the plan. "By moving toward a  market, we are not swerving from the road to socialism, but are advancing  toward a fuller realization of society's potential."  </P> <P> The Soviet Union will move soon, he said, to permit private ownership in almost  all areas of the economy, to establish equity and commodity markets, to make  its currency convertible with Western currencies, to pull the government out of  industrial management and to reshape central planning to focus on the overall  strategy for the country's development.  </P> <P> Gorbachev criticized the government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and  his own Politburo for failing to take a comprehensive approach to economic  reform earlier and buckling under to the managers of the country's giant  industries. The leadership had also ignored for too long the growing shortages  of foodstuffs and consumer goods of all types, he said, and this had compounded  the crises here.  </P> <P> But he promised that the next reforms would not start with price increases, as  widely feared, and said that the government would first take steps to ensure  that workers do not suffer.  </P> <P> "The transition to a market economy cannot start with price hikes -- that is  absurd," he declared.  </P> <P> THE ELITE SPEAKS -- Career Communists rebut critics and voice dismay. A10  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT GORBACHEV SAID  </P> <P> Excerpts from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech to the 28th Communist  Party Congress.  </P> <P> On perestroika and party failures:  </P> <P> The Soviet citizen of today no longer accepts what he meekly tolerated in the  past. He reacts with understandable alarm and anger to the negative phenomena  that, like foam on the surface, accompany the turbulent and basically healthy  process of perestroika. . . .  </P> <P> We have inherited a heavy legacy. The deplorable state of our lands and economy  and the disastrous state of the energy sector . . . are not the result of  recent years. . . .  </P> <P> The Politburo does not deny its responsibility for these errors.  </P> <P> We must analyze the situation, and we must see what revolutionary  transformations will be made, because the U.S.S.R. is rapidly becoming a  second-rate power.  </P> <P> On human rights:  </P> <P> Human rights will retain priority over the interests of national sovereignty  and autonomy. This must be entrenched in the constitutional fabric of the union  and each of the republics. Nor must we depart even an inch from this principle,  which guides us on the international plane as well.  </P> <P> On chronic shortages:  </P> <P> I would subscribe here to everything that is said on this subject and express  solidarity with the most scathing criticism. But just fanning emotions won't  increase the amount of goods. . . .  </P> <P> In any case -- and this should be admitted -- the consequences could have been  less painful if the government had approached the economic reform  comprehensively, and had managed to stand up to the pressure of various  industries and the old managerial structures that sought to keep their position  and maintain command of administration.  </P> <P> On ethnic strife:  </P> <P> At present, as we embark on a succession of deep-going changes in our  multinational state, we need tranquillity, peace and cooperation in the  interests of all nations. I hope that this appeal of our congress will be heard  in all parts of the country.  </P> <P> On Eastern Europe:  </P> <P> Big changes are under way in Eastern Europe. When somebody says that this is  the "collapse of socialism," we counter it with the question: What socialism?  That which had been, in point of fact, a variation of Stalin's authoritarian  bureaucratic system -- which we have ourselves discarded?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PARTY CONGRESS: DAY ONE  </P> <P> Highlights of Monday's session of the 28th Communist Party Congress:  </P> <P> Starting the session: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president and party  leader, opened the congress in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses to elect a  party leader and a Central Committee and approve new party rules and platform.  It is scheduled to last until July 12.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's defense: Gorbachev attacked bureaucrats for hindering his reforms.  He admitted the party leadership made mistakes during his tenure but also  blamed the "heavy legacy" of previous leaders dating back to Stalin for food  and housing shortages, ecological and industrial disasters and ethnic  conflicts.  </P> <P> Resignation call: Nine minutes after the session started, coal miner Vladimir  Bludov criticized the leadership for not improving living standards and  proposed that the Central Committee and Politburo resign. Delegates voted to  postpone discussion of the issue.  </P> <P> Best-received speech: Politburo member and close Gorbachev adviser Alexander N.  Yakovlev delivered a stirring defense of the Soviet leader and his policies,  saying they should have come decades sooner. He won over deputies with his  uncompromising views and clear pride at having helped create perestroika.  </P> <P> Party unity: Outside the session, reformer Sergei Stankevich said the radical  Democratic Platform faction has scrapped its plans to leave the party at the  congress.  </P> <P> Party structure: Gorbachev said delegates told him they are against his  proposal to revamp top party organs and break up the job of party chief --  which he holds -- into a chairman, deputy chairman and first secretary.  </P></p>

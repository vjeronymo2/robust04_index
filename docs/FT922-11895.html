			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Bouygues edges up to FFr635m for year BOUYGUES, one of the world's largest construction groups, yesterday announced a modest increase of 1.4 per cent in net profits from FFr626m in 1990 to FFr635m (Dollars 112m) in 1991. This means that Bouygues, which is also the managing shareholder in TF1, France's biggest single television channel, has failed to meet the initial estimate of net profits of FFr660m that it made in January when forecasting the probable outcome for 1991. Bouygues, like other European construction companies, was affected last year not only by the slowdown in the property market but also by difficulties with the Channel tunnel project. Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman, said Bouygues had made a provision of FFr123m for its share of the losses on the project. Trans Manche Link (TML), the consortium of Anglo-French contractors in which Bouygues owns a 10 per cent stake, has been in dispute with Eurotunnel, which is orchestrating the tunnel scheme, over payment for its work on the project. Despite the slowdown in European construction, Bouygues' overall turnover rose by 13 per cent from FFr56.7bn in 1990 to FFr64.3bn in 1991. On a strictly comparable basis the rate of sales growth was slightly lower at 8 per cent. Bouygues benefited from expansion in international interests, which saw turnover rise by 43 per cent to FFr18.9bn. The group envisages a slight fall in turnover to about FFr64bn in the current year, mainly because of the weakness of the property market. Despite this, the board proposed raising the dividend from FFr15 in 1990 to FFr16 a share for 1991. Clarins, the French skin care and cosmetics group, shrugged off the slowdown in the international beauty industry last year with a 21 per cent increase in net profits from FFr158m in 1990 to FFr192m in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SHOWDOWN?;  </P> <P> GRAF, NAVRATILOVA ON COURSE TO THE FINAL  </P> <P> Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova can move another step closer today to a  showdown and a rematch of their 1987 U.S. Open final.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Graf plays third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini (the player she beat in  last year's Open final to complete her Grand Slam), and second-seeded  Navratilova plays sixth-seeded Zina Garrison.  </P> <P> Graf, 16-3 against Sabatini, said she will use her normal plan. "Just go for  the shots at the right time, just try to step in and always take the advantage,  to be the one who is dictating the game," Graf said. "I'll try to play my game,  not theirs."  </P> <P> A year ago, Graf was deluged with questions about her opportunity to complete  the Slam after winning the Australian and French Opens as well as Wimbledon.  But this year, Graf has kept a low profile with Chris Evert getting most of the  attention.  </P> <P> Asked if she felt the same as last year, Graf said: "I don't remember."  </P> <P> Navratilova remembers that she lost to Garrison in the Open last year.  Garrison's 6-4, 6-7 (7-3), 7-5 victory was her only win over Navratilova in 25  meetings.  </P> <P> "I'll always remember that loss," Navratilova said. "I'll always be sort of  paying her back for that." THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

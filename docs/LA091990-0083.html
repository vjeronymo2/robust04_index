			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARK'S TWO HOMERS LIFT GIANTS OVER REDS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: BUT THE POWER OUTBURST DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR A DISAPPOINTING SEASON FOR  SAN FRANCISCO'S FIRST BASEMAN.  </P> <P> Going into this season, Roger Craig, among others, rated Will Clark, the San  Francisco Giants' first baseman, the best player in the National League.  </P> <P> In four seasons, Clark had established himself as an outstanding hitter. Last  season, he batted .333, hit 23 home runs and drove in 111 runs.  </P> <P> Because Clark was only 26, his manager, Craig, thought it was reasonable to  expect more from Clark, already an exceptional defensive player.  </P> <P> It didn't happen. Injuries have slowed him in the second half of the season,  but he never did hit the way he did a year ago.  </P> <P> Clark, who will undergo foot surgery after the season, had one of his best  hitting days since early June Tuesday at Cincinnati to lead the Giants to a 5-3  victory.  </P> <P> He hit two home runs and a single and drove in three runs to keep the Giants  alive. After splitting the two-game set, the Giants are 7 1/2 games behind the  Reds but have only 14 games to play.  </P> <P> With the Dodgers beating Atlanta, the Reds, who begin their final six-game trip  tonight at Houston, have a 4 1/2-game lead.  </P> <P> "It helps morale," Clark said, "but I wish I could have done more this season.  I have had problems.  </P> <P> "Today, (Tom) Browning made the mistakes. The difference is I was able to  capitalize on them. I haven't been doing that for some time."  </P> <P> After 70 games this season, Clark had 13 home runs and 55 runs batted in. But  in the next 77 games he hit only three home runs and drove in 26 runs.  </P> <P> Rookie John Burkett (13-7) had a 5-1 lead and a four-hitter going into the  ninth, but needed Steve Bedrosian to get the final out with the potential tying  runs on base.  </P> <P> The Reds believe the race is over in the West, but are concerned about  Browning.  </P> <P> The veteran left-hander (13-9) has been ineffective since spraining his ankle  Aug. 19.  </P> <P> "I just haven't had good outings," he said after being chased in the sixth. "I  haven't pitched well. I have no excuses."  </P> <P> Another starter, Jack Armstrong, relieved in the seventh. Armstrong, bothered  by a sore elbow, said he still has pain. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Leaders and laggards in internal market Greece and Germany are trailing far behind other EU states in adopting legislation crucial for the free flow of goods, services and capital across the Union, and have contributed to a disappointing year for the internal market. Delivering its twice yearly roundup of delays to completion of the single market, the European Commission said yesterday that a lack of political commitment by member states had slowed progress. On the eve of the single market's second anniversary, Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, the commissioner responsible for the single market, told EU ministers that developments had been most disappointing in intellectual and industrial property, public procurement and insurance. League tables compiled by the Commission show that Greece, which has only implemented 77.9 per cent of the single market legislation, is the worst offender by a long way. Of a total of 217 measures, it has made no progress on 43. This compares with Denmark - the champion - which has only eight outstanding. The second slowest country is Germany which has made no progress on 26 directives, followed by Ireland with 24. France is the second most efficient, followed by Britain, which has still not adopted 14 bits of legislation. On average, 89 per cent of the legislation necessary to ensure the free flow of goods, services and capital has been adopted. But with some states trailing badly, and progress differing markedly across sectors, Mr Vanni D'Archirafi, stressed that much work remained to be done. It was not enough for states merely to adopt the legislation on to their national statute books. They had to ensure that national laws were of the right quality, and corresponded to the requirements of EU legislation. Brussels also accused member states of failing to respect the principle of mutual recognition, whereby they recognise each other's standards for goods and services where no harmonisation legislation is deemed necessary. Mr Vanni D'Archirafi said the Commission had investigated 4,112 cases - half of which concerned the single market - where it suspected that member states were not respecting EU legislation. Of these, a majority were in France and Germany. Member states now look certain to back a Commission initiative that will require them to inform Brussels every time any one of them intends to ban or refuse entry for a product which has been lawfully produced in another member state.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Some 129 U.S. research  teams planned to carry out various experiments aboard Russia's  Mir space station between 1995 and 1997, a report said today.    A news release from Boeing Defense and Space Group said some  129 research teams have submitted proposals to the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in response to a  NASA research announcement. The science proposals are directed  at research in environmental monitoring, biomedical applied  physiology, human factors, fundamental biology on humans, lower  vertebrates, non-vertebrate animals and plant life, and for  research to develop advanced technologies for life support.    As part of its restructured space station program, NASA will  be cooperating with the Russian space agency to conduct as many  as ten shuttle flights to the Mir space station from 1995-1997.  During this period, U.S. astronauts will be on board Mir for  four missions, the first lasting 90 days and the next three  lasting 180 days each. The research announcement the science  teams have responded to presents the opportunity to conduct  long-duration microgravity experiments during these four flights.</p>

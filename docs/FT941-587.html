			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (2): The radical charm of the bourgeoisie - Local politics At first glance the affluent Rhone-Alpes region, with its bustling commercial centres and its conservative-controlled hotels de ville (town halls) looks like a bastion of right-wing traditionalism. But beneath its bourgeois facade the Rhone-Alpes has a long history of radicalism. The citizens of Grenoble have long boasted that the Revolution began there in 1788, a year before the rest of France. The city of Lyon was the heartland of social catholicism in the 19th century. More recently the region has seen some dramatic squabbles on the French right. By far the most controversial of the Rhone-Alpes's latter-day radicals is Michel Noir, the 49-year-old mayor of Lyon, who has not only broken away from the Gaullist RPR to form his own political party but is now threatened by imprisonment over his alleged involvement in a fraud case. Only a few years ago Mr Noir appeared to be rising effortlessly through the RPR ranks. He served as a junior finance minister during the last centre-right coalition government, from 1986 to 1988, and was even tipped as a future successor to Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris, as the party's leader. But Mr Noir resigned from the RPR in late 1990, in protest at the bickering among the party leadership. He founded his own breakaway movement in the hope that other disillusioned French conservatives would follow. (In the event he was joined by only two colleagues and his new party has never taken off.) He has continued to clash with the RPR leadership - sometimes to Lyon's detriment. Most locals, for instance, are convinced that one reason for the city's failure to become the location for the European Monetary Institute was the lack of support from the French government. Yet Mr Noir has held on to the support of the Lyonnais voters. He now faces his toughest challenge so far. Pierre Botton, his son-in-law and former campaign manager, has already served five months in prison for fraud. Mr Botton has accused the Lyon mayor of misappropriating public funds. He has denied the charge but the case against him has yet to be concluded. If Mr Noir is found guilty he will almost certainly face the same fate as his estranged son-in-law: imprisonment. But a 'not guilty' verdict would confirm him as the Rhone's champion against the Parisian power-mongers  -and he could, in the words of one local politician, 'be mayor of Lyon for life.' His near neighbour, Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble, has also clashed with the RPR leadership, although not quite so spectacularly as Mr Noir. Mr Carignon, 45, was suspended from the party a few years ago for urging voters in a local by-election to support the Socialists rather than the extreme right-wing National Front. But Mr Carignon, unlike Mr Noir, has remained within the RPR ranks. He has also managed to repair relations with its leadership. He failed in his bid to become arts minister after the conservatives' success in last spring's legislative elections but was given the communications portfolio. Since then Mr Carignon has had to grapple with the task of pushing his broadcasting reforms through parliament. (He has also come under fire in the recent row over the future of Canal-Plus, the popular pay-TV channel, and the sudden resignation of its founder, Mr Andre Rousselet, as chairman.) His cabinet colleague, Michel Barnier, can count himself lucky to have been able to adopt a lower profile in his potentially contentious post as environment minister. Mr Barnier, 43, who has held the Albertville seat for the RPR since 1978, came into the limelight two years ago when he chaired the organising committee for the Albertville Winter Olympics. The environment ministry is his first big role in national politics - and might have been something of a mixed blessing, given the power of France's green parties. But the environmentalists have seemed more interested in squabbling among themselves rather than in attacking Mr Barnier, who has had a relatively smooth ride in his first year as a minister. Charles Millon, mayor of Belley and chairman of the Rhone-Alpes regional council, chose to opt out of the cut and thrust: he has refused no fewer than three times to accept the agriculture portfolio on the grounds that it could conflict with his commitment to European unity. Few people would doubt that he made the right decision after the rows over France's role in the Gatt negotiations. But Mr Millon, 48, has found himself in the party political firing line as the parliamentary leader of the UDF, the main opponents of Edouard Balladur's RPR faction within the ruling centre-right coalition. So far Mr Millon has avoided too many public rifts with the prime minister. But he has never been known to shrink from conflict in the past and rarely loses an opportunity to remind Mr Balladur that he and his fellow UDF adherents will not be content to play a passive role in the coalition. Of all the local political heavyweights, only Raymond Barre, the former economics professor who was prime minister of France in the late 1970s, has managed to remain entirely aloof from the fray in local and national politics. Now 70, Mr Barre is perfectly cast in the role of the grand old man of Rhone-Alpes politics and is an enthusiastic advocate for the region. He may have lost last year's battle to lure the European Monetary Institute to Lyon, but he recently scored a more modest success by helping to persuade the Aspen Institute to base its French headquarters in the city.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Living costs show biggest fall for over 20 years LIVING COSTS have fallen more in the past year than at any time for more than two decades, a study published today indicates. The Reward Group, a consultancy specialising in pay and consumer studies, calculates that in February a family with average needs in terms of housing and consumer purchases required an income 5.1 per cent less than a year previously to maintain its standard of living. The year-on-year fall in living costs is the biggest since Reward started its twice-yearly studies in 1972. This contrasts with the comparable year-on-year decline of 0.7 per cent last August. The findings support other indications of low inflationary conditions as a result of the recession. While the muted level of price rises for many consumer goods played a part in the overall fall in living costs, the biggest factor was that housing costs for home owners fell by 19.7 per cent in the year to February, mainly due to lower interest rates. For the relatively small number of people who rent their homes from local authorities housing costs rose 12.1 per cent because of higher rents. Reward bases its results on a survey of average costs for a group of eight hypothetical four-person families with different spending habits. The annual income needed to support the families - which in each case includes one adult in employment, a girl aged 10 and a boy aged eight - works out at between Pounds 11,728 and Pounds 71,215, depending on lifestyles. In terms of the incomes needed for a set standard of living, Greater London, Woking, Welwyn Garden City, Berkhamsted and Slough are the dearest places in Britain while Northern Ireland, Peterhead, Thurso, Doncaster and Barnsley are the cheapest. The current downward pressures on the cost of living are, however, greatest in Greater London, and lowest in Northern Ireland. The report says that in the past 12 months food prices have not risen at all while fuel costs have fallen by 0.5 per cent and transport costs have risen by 3.5 per cent.

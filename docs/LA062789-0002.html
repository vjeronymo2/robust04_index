			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Ambulance workers at two Sacramento companies have agreed not to walk off their  jobs until at least midnight tonight in hopes that county officials will  intervene. Jim Phillou, a field representative for the Hospital and Health Care  Workers Union Local 250, said the emergency medical technicians and paramedics  voted "nearly unanimously" to extend the strike deadline. The workers rejected  contract offers from Metropolitan Ambulance Co. and Sacramento Ambulance Co.,  but negotiations were still under way.  </P></p>

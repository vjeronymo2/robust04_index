			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Campbell's support on the slide SUPPORT for Canada's governing Conservative party has slipped since Ms Kim Campbell became prime minister, according to a poll by Gallup Canada, Reuter reports from Ottawa. The Conservatives' popularity declined to 33 per cent in July after rising marginally to 36 per cent after the party's leadership convention. Some 43 per cent of decided voters said they would support the opposition Liberals if an election were held immediately, up from 41 per cent in June. A general election must be held within four months. Ms Campbell was elected party leader, and and therefore prime minister, last month. Support for the opposition New Democratic party fell to 8 per cent in July, its lowest standing since July 1961. The right-wing Reform party received support from 7 per cent of decided voters; the Bloc Quebecois, which seeks autonomy for the province of Quebec, received 8 per cent. Twenty-five per cent of the 1,010 voters polled were undecided.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Karadzic agreeable to UN plan Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader said yesterday, he was ready to accept a UN proposal for a four-month ceasefire across the whole of Bosnia. But there was no immediate sign that Bosnia's Moslems and their Croat allies, who have been seeking a shorter truce, would agree at Geneva peace talks to do the same. Yasushi Akashi, the UN envoy said earlier he might have to suspend the negotiations later in the day and continue them soon in or around Sarajevo. The Japanese diplomat said he would prolong the talks for another day only if there was 'real hope' of progress.</p>

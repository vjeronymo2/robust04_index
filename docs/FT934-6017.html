			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Policy Portfolio advances 16% Policy Portfolio, the market-maker in second hand endowment policies which joined the main market in July, yesterday reported a 16 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 370,000 to Pounds 429,000 in the six months to September 30. Turnover grew to Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 3.56m) and included Pounds 206,000 of policies purchased on 'arms length' terms by certain directors and their families. Expenses more than doubled to Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 213,000) as a result of employing more staff - particularly in the sourcing department - and higher marketing costs, to pave the way for future expansion. Earnings per share fell from 4.5p to 4.3p. An interim dividend of 1.5p is declared.</p>

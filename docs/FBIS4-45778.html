			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Konstantin Gofman, managing director </F> of the ecological-economic research area of the Russian Academy  of Sciences Institute of Problems of the Market, under the  rubric "Finances": "The Salvation of Nature Is in Tax Reform"]    [Text] "Rent and Taxes. New Approaches to Reforming  Russia's Tax System." This was the title of the article in the  weekly supplement to DM [DELOVOY MIR] of 17-23 January of this  year. A number of pieces in later issues of the newspaper were  devoted to the need for tax reform and its possible variants.  Today the managing director of the ecological-economic research  area of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Problems of  the Market, Professor Konstantin Gofman, continues the  topic.    Russia is in the throes of both an economic and an  ecological  crisis. Is a simultaneous and mutually linked approach to  solving this situation realistic or, on the contrary, should the  country's ecological normalization be postponed "until better  times" and all efforts be thrown into economic revival?    The questions are by no means idle ones. The experience of  Russian reforms shows that ecological priorities in our country  are secondary not only in terms of their "official" status, but  even in public awareness. The warnings of ecologists remain  voices crying in the wilderness. Yes, it would seem, that is  true: should we care about them now? Is it perhaps actually more  sensible first to feed people (even with contaminated food and  water) and activate the mechanisms of "market prosperity," and  only then "readjust" them in the interests of protecting the  environment? It is not without reason that among ecologists in  rich countries the saying is common that "poverty is the chief  polluter."    This problem is by no means a simple one, and there can be  no  simple solutions which are to be adopted.    Voices are now being raised (including in DELOVOY MIR) in  favor of tax reform. I am certain: this is precisely the  lever which will link the needs for financial stabilization and  market liberalization of the economy with the requirements of  ecological normalization. But something else is also clear:  this reform cannot be done in one stroke. We need a long-term  program of ecologization of the tax system; that is to say, its  by-stage restructuring in the following basic directions:     -  gradually increasing the role of taxes on the use of the  natural resource potential in all tax revenue in the budgets of  the subjects of the Federation and local budgets;    -  expanding the base of natural resource taxation by  introducing  taxes on using the so-called assimilation potential of the  environment;    -  introducing excise-type ecological taxes on goods and  services  whose consumption involves higher ecological risk;    -  expanding tax benefits for enterprises and organizations  incorporating production of ecologically safe items or employing  closed (low-waste) technological processes, as well as for  physical and legal entities located in ecological disaster zones  and in ecological crisis situations;    -  restricting direct and indirect subsidization of types of  economic activity which are natural resource intensive and  dangerous to the environment.        Taxation can be ecologized without reducing total revenue in  the country's financial system, but it requires planned  redistribution of the tax burden among participants in financial  relations taking into account the tasks of economic  stabilization and the social, ecological, and political  priorities of society in conditions of the transition period. A  reduction in taxes on labor and capital, announced in advance  and carried out in stages, with a concurrent increase in the  scope of natural resource taxation will stimulate structural  reorganization of the economy to reduce its natural resource  intensity.  <H5>  Rental Income's Route into the Budget: Direct or Indirect? </H5>   At present the role of the tax on land and other natural  resources in the state's aggregate tax income is negligible. In  itself this circumstance certainly does not mean that most  rental income from nature use remains at the disposal of owners  or users of natural wealth. The socialization of rental income,  that is to say, its accumulation in state and local budgets  through the tax system, can be carried out on one scale or  another even without a direct tax on nature use--through  taxation of income of nature users and buyers of their output  (progressive taxes on personal income and profit, excise taxes,  and the like). But here rental income seems to lose its identity  and mix with other income in the "common pot" of the state  budget and as part of the income of taxpayers themselves after  they pay taxes.    However, the method of socialization of rental income--as a  direct tax (payment) for nature use or through taxation of  income of nature users and consumers of their output--has a  definite effect on the ecological character of taxpayers'  economic decisions and ultimately on the nature of society's  socioeconomic development.    The greater the extent to which state income is formed  through land tax (in the broad sense, that is, taxes generally  on natural resources) while correspondingly reducing taxation of  labor and capital, the stronger the economic stimuli for  developing production will be. In addition, turning land rental  into the main source for financing social (state) expenditures  complies with the principles of social justice, since land as  nature's gift is the property of the nation rather than the  product of labor and capital.    Of no small importance is the fact that taxation of land  leaves many fewer opportunities for tax evasion than taxation of  personal income and entrepreneurial profit.    And finally, the last but not the least important argument  in  favor of changing over to predominant taxation of natural  resource potential. Such a change would mean increasing economic  stimuli for full and comprehensive use of natural wealth, since  nature-conservative investments of labor and capital would be  relatively cheaper for entrepreneurs.  <H5>  The Main Difficulty </H5>   What is holding things up? Why not change over, and soon, to  the direct method of withdrawing rent into the budget? There are  in my opinion profound reasons which rule out the possibility of  transferring the focus in taxation to natural resource potential  all at once.    Introducing a high tax on the use of land and other types of  natural resources while correspondingly reducing other types of  taxation would be a "neutral" measure in relation to the budget  and taxpayers. But only on one condition--if the natural  resource intensity of the economic activity of taxpayers was  even roughly the same for everyone. But in reality indicators of  land use intensity, water consumption intensity, and volume of  harmful discharges calculated per cost unit of output produced  and so forth differ among various enterprises (depending on  their sectorial affiliation, technologies used, and the quality  of the fuel and raw materials used) by factors of 10's and  100's. That can be seen in the following table.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Differences in the Water Consumption and Ecological Stress Created by Harm-|  |ful Discharges into the Atmosphere and Water Sources, calculated per unit  |  |of gross output*                                                           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sectors Consuming |Water Consumption |Ecological Stress from Discharges    |  |Fresh Water       |Intensity         |                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |into the Atmosphe-|into Water Sources|                  |                  |  |re                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ferrous Metallurgy|0.10              |0.47              |0.45              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nonferrous Metall-|0.07              |0.45              |0.05              |  |urgy              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil and Gas Sector|0.10              |0.28              |0.08              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Coal Sector       |0.12              |0.98              |0.85              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Electricity Produ-|1.00              |1.00              |1.00              |  |ction             |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chemical Sector   |0.05              |0.34              |0.26              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Building Material-|0.02              |0.93              |0.36              |  |s Sector          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*The electricity production sector's indicators are expressed as 1.        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The table cites certain data which characterize the scope of  this differentiation broken down by aggregated sectors of the  multisectorial balance of the former USSR. It is obvious that  the gaps in natural resource intensity will rise many times over  when changing from the sectorial level to the level of specific  taxpayer enterprises.    For now payment for use of the natural resource potential  has  little impact on the economy of enterprises, and differences in  their natural resource intensity are largely nullified; while  taxation, especially in the form of value-added tax, maintains  the established proportions of distribution of national income.    The situation changes fundamentally with the transition to  taxation of natural resource potential. The disparity in the tax  burden which reflects the disparity in the natural resource  intensity of economic activity will in the long run undoubtedly  prompt taxpayers to cut back natural resource intensive  production facilities or reduce their natural resource  intensity. But a "shock" transfer, all at once, of the focus of  taxation to natural resource potential, that is to say,  establishment of a single payment rate for land and other  natural resources of the particular quality and location for  everyone, would inevitably result in the emergence of enormous  disproportions in the withdrawal of income from enterprises with  differing levels of natural resource intensity.    It is for that reason that a transfer all at once to  taxation  of natural resource potential while reducing other types of  taxation accordingly could lead to an economic "collapse" of  economic systems which in terms of its negative consequences  would exceed all the well-known results of the "shock" effect on  socioeconomic processes. The natural resource system of taxation  is incompatible with the "nonecologized" economic structure of  contemporary production and consumption oriented to the relative  cheapness and availability of natural wealth.  <H5>  It Is for the Regions To Decide </H5>   There is an important restraint on the development of  natural  resource taxation in the particular conditions of the Russian  Federation. The receipt into the federal budget of rental income  from using natural resource potential accumulated in the tax on  land and other natural resources will to all appearances meet  opposition from the subjects of the Federation and even provoke  separatist tendencies. Consequently taxes not directly related  to nature use, above all taxes on income of physical and legal  entities collected at rates which are the same for the entire  country, must maintain their significance as the main source of  income of the federal budget. In contrast, revenue from taxes  for using the natural resource potential of the corresponding  territories must predominate in the income of the budgets of the  subjects of the Federation and local budgets.    For at least two-three years into the future, large-scale  ecologically positive changes cannot be expected in the  sectorial, technological, and territorial structure of economic  activity. It is hardly possible within this time to  fundamentally increase financing of nature protection activity  from budget system capital. In these conditions a by-stage  redistribution of tax pressure on enterprises seems realistic: a  reduction for ecologically safe types of activity and an  increase for natural resource intensive ones. Until a market for  the right to land use (land ownership and rental) is formed  through a system of sale auctions of this right, it would be  wise to grant the subjects of the Federation the right to  determine the yearly estimated value of land for the  purposes of taxation. As rough estimates show, if taxation  of profit is limited exclusively by the needs of the federal  budget, the tax rate on profit could be reduced to one-third of  the present level. And here the amount of the land tax would be  increased roughly 12-fold as compared with the existing level.    But of course the transition to such an assessment of land  (as was said, specifically for the purposes of taxation) will  not replace forming a mechanism for its market appraisal through  the development of purchase and sale, security, and rental of  rights to land use, but it may become the transitional link in  bringing today's almost symbolic land tax rates closer to the  market value of agricultural and especially urban land. The  method of taxation itself is important here, in a percentage of  the appraisal of the land rather than in fixed rates per unit of  area. In principle this protects tax revenue from inflationary  depreciation better.  <H5>  The Problem of Appraisal </H5>   The enormous organizational-technical complications of the  practical realization of this concept must certainly be taken  into account. The concept presupposes a regular reappraisal of  land and other taxable natural resources as often as possible,  necessarily excluding from this appraisal the market value of  the real estate objects existing on it (the "pre-improvement"  value of the land parcel) as well as rental income from capital  investments which raise the long-term economic potential of the  object of taxation (investments in prospecting for and exploring  mineral deposits, in long-term improvement of agricultural land,  in the engineering and social infrastructure of urban  territories, and so forth). All rental income of this type  (according to Marxist terminology, differential rent II) is  income from capital rather than from land as such, and therefore  may be excluded from the tax base when the land tax is  calculated.    Even if all the methodological difficulties related to  computing the "pre-improvement" value of land parcels are  considered surmountable, it is obvious that the corresponding  appraisal work will hardly keep pace with the constant and  fairly rapid (as world experience shows) rise in the value of  land and other natural wealth. Consequently the need for  additional regulatory taxes on the profit of nature users, on  the sale of land, on security transactions with land parcels,  and the like will remain.    Information generated by the land market is essential in  order to accurately determine the value of land as an object of  taxation. The trouble is that when differential rent I is  completely taken from land users, the land market is inevitably  transformed into a real estate market for land and ceases to  generate information on the pre-improvement value of land  parcels.    Therefore, back in the early stages of the evolution of land  taxation, there must be intensive development of land appraisal  work oriented not only to the needs of city planning and  agricultural land management (which was characteristic of the  centralized economy), but also for the purposes of the  formation, functioning, and tax regulation of the land market as  part of the real estate market. This is a field of resource  appraisal work which is fundamentally new to our country, and it  is in dire need of scientific methods support and basic  interdisciplinary research.    As for enterprises of the mining sectors, here the strategic  direction should be a transition from a multitude of taxation  systems (excise taxes, payments for the right to use the earth's  interior, and deductions for reproduction of the mineral-raw  material base) to a system of unified territorial taxes on the  extraction of minerals. The object of taxation should be the  usable volume of balance reserves of fuel and raw materials,  rather than only the volume of saleable output as it is now.  Then losses and expenditures for inhouse needs as well as the  amount of reserves of minerals allotted to enterprises will be  "reckoned in." Tax rates should be set in percentages of the  value of the tax base in current prices with a differentiation  depending on the geological-economic conditions of extraction.    In this case, the amount of the tax on the extraction of  minerals will depend on three basic factors:    1) the level of prices for output being extracted,    2) the degree of completeness and intensiveness of the use  of  reserves, and    3) differences in the geological-economic conditions of  extraction. This taxation procedure will encourage conservation  of mineral reserves, which is extremely timely for enterprises  working in favorable geological-economic conditions and at the  same time ensures more complete accumulation of rental income in  territorial budgets.  <H5>  The Payment for Pollution </H5>   Since the late 1980's, Russia has been forming a unique  system, with virtually nothing like it in world practice, of  payments by enterprises of all forms of ownership for the  discharge (run-off) of pollutants into the atmosphere and water  sources and for waste disposal. Formed at the same time was a  system of state nonbudget ecology funds whose basic source of  capital was the payment for pollution.    Analysis of the results of the practical application of this  system in 1992-1993 shows that the fiscal function of payments  is being performed relatively successfully overall. Thanks to  the creation of conditions for financing protection of the  environment from the capital of nonbudget ecology funds,  independent of the budget, this sphere suffered to a lesser  degree from the investment "cave-in" of 1992. While the total  volume of investments in the economy declined by 45 percent in  1992, capital investments in environmental protection from all  sources of financing dropped by only 20 percent. To a  considerable degree the practice of exempting enterprises from  payments for pollution based on the amount of capital they used  to finance their own capital investments in environmental  protection helped achieve this. This system must be improved by  raising its incentive value.    From the editorial office: The number of Russian cities  declared ecological disaster zones is constantly rising. This is  the topic of the article by the DM columnist, Lyudmila  Biryukova, "The Sword of Damocles Has Gone into Action,"  published on pp 30-31.    [Box No 1]    The subject of this article is essentially not just taxes.  It  is rather the transition from the "well-traveled" but dead-end  road to a fundamentally new type of socioeconomic development.  The difficulties of the transition are obvious. Unfortunately,  as fundamental decisions are put off and palliatives are  substituted, these difficulties merely intensify. In both cases  society must pass between the Scylla of the socioeconomic  upheavals of the transition period and the Charybdis of  continuation of the old course.    But it must be resolved.    [Box No 2]    The author warns: We need a gradual increase in the role of  natural resource taxation in the formation of state income, a  role programmed for the long term and legislatively fixed,  rather than an "avalanche" of restructuring of tax revenue all  at one time...</p>

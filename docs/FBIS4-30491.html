			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Space Development Agency [NASDA]  compiled an estimate indicating replacing disposable rockets and  satellites by reusable ones can reduce operating cost to about  one- tenth. This will reduce transportation cost to a level  similar to airplanes, and will make many new projects, such as  lunar exploration and solar power generation satellites,  possible. This was the first time a concrete program, including  cost estimates, of reusable space systems has been made public  in Japan. As the enormous cost of massive space development  programs in the 21st century is becoming a problem, NASDA's  estimate will certainly animate the debate on this issue.    This estimate is contained in a NASDA report: "A Study on  the  Repercussion Effect of Space Infrastructure."    The report recommends replacing the present transportation  system using disposable rockets with a "new space  infrastructure" based on the concept of repeated use. It  proposes a "space shuttle system" going back and forth between  the earth and outer space like airliners.    Under this scheme, "orbit operations spacecraft" responsible  for maintenance work of satellites, "fuel stations," and  "inter-orbit transport spacecraft" moving between different  orbits will be launched in space. All these spacecraft are to  be reusable.    According to the estimate, a shuttle spacecraft (development  and operation cost estimated at $25 billion) and six inter-orbit  transport spacecraft (development and operation cost $7.6  billion) will be developed in 10 years from 1995, and these will  be in service for 20 to 30 years.    As a result, while accumulated cost for the reusable space  system, including development cost, will be overwhelmingly  higher than the original disposable system at the beginning, by  the year 2020, or the 15th year after going into service, cost  for the two types will be almost the same, after which the  reusable system will be more cost-efficient.    Compared to the annual operating cost of $7.5 billion for  the  current disposable system, cost for the reusable system will be  around $2 billion, or about 25 percent. With further efforts to  improve efficiency, it will be possible to reduce cost to 10  percent.    With the new "space infrastructure," it will be possible,  for  instance, to extend the endurance of artificial satellites  dramatically by replacing batteries or refuelling. Furthermore,  since repairs will be possible on the orbit, the extremely high  level of reliability required at present will not be necessary.  This will make lower development and manufacturing cost possible.    The study foresees a project of transporting several hundred  tons of helium 3, a nuclear fusion fuel which is abundantly  available on the lunar surface, to the earth. While the  transportation cost under the old disposable system makes up as  much as one-fourth of the entire world space budget (around $70  billion), under the reusable system, cost will be merely  one-tenth. Therefore, the project "is possible even without  obtaining new appropriations."</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Upward pressure on pay eases Pay settlements in manufacturing fell slightly in May, easing fears of further upward pressure on pay generated by rising inflation and tax increases, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, David Goodhart writes. Pay awards in manufacturing averaged 2.7 per cent between March and May, slightly down on the 2.8 per cent recorded for the three months to April. But service-sector settlements remain at 3.2 per cent. According to the CBI, one-third of all settlements in manufacturing and services were between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, and overall 84 per cent of settlements were between zero and 3.5 per cent. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said: 'Manufacturers are continuing to keep the lid on settlements, though since productivity growth is dropping the prospect for unit labour costs is not promising. Service settlements seem to be on the rise, especially in the financial sector. That is not good news.' Productivity in manufacturing improved by an average of 4.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with 4.7 per cent in the second half of last year.</p>

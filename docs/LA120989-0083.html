			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: NFL CLEARS RYAN OF BOUNTY ON COWBOYS  </P> <P> An NFL investigation has cleared Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan of offering  bounties to his players for injuring Dallas Cowboy players. Dallas Coach Jimmy  Johnson accused Ryan of that after a game on Thanksgiving Day.  </P> <P> The league warned, however, that severe penalties would be exacted against any  team engaging in such activities.  </P> <P> The NFL said its findings were based on an investigation by Commissioner Paul  Tagliabue.  </P> <P> Ryan said the statement confirmed what he has been saying all along: "The  Philadelphia Eagles did not place any bounties on Dallas players."  </P> <P> Cowboy kicker Luis Zendejas was disappointed by the ruling.  </P> <P> "All I know is that I told the truth," Zendejas said. "I guess it all depends  on how lightly the guys who were investigating it took it. I guess they didn't  take it too seriously."  </P> <P> The teams will play again Sunday at Philadelphia.  </P></p>

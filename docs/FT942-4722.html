			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: TR Property net asset value surges by 46% Strong performances by the smaller property companies, investments in which comprise 60 per cent of its assets helped TR Property Investment Trust achieve a 46 per cent increase in net asset value per share to 41.97p at the March 31 year end. This compares with a 29 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A Property Index. The company saw a 25.9 per cent increase in total revenue from Pounds 8.48m to Pounds 10.7m, including a Pounds 1.3m one-off profit on the disposal of a portfolio of development properties in an associated undertaking. Profit before tax increased by 38.5 per cent from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 5.4m, and a low tax charge of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.19m) helped earnings per share rise 50 per cent to 1.43p (0.95p). To help rebuild reserves and improve dividend cover an unchanged final of 0.5p is recommended, making a same-again total of 0.9p. There had been a 'strong market in property shares, particularly in the junior companies in which we specialise, as against lower returns from direct property,' said Mr Peter Duffy, director. Consequently, while 29 per cent of the trust's gross assets of Pounds 109m were held as direct property at the beginning of the year and the balance in securities, by the year end the direct property component had been reduced to 22.7 per cent of the Pounds 156m total. In April TR bought a Pounds 39m property portfolio from PosTel, and the percentage of assets held as direct property has risen to 31 per cent. It also raised Pounds 41m cash through a placing and offer, of which Pounds 25m has now been invested, said Mr Duffy, '90 per cent of it in middle-ranking UK property companies which offer the best medium term growth prospects'.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegians dismiss call to ease tax burden Norwegian petroleum authorities have rejected calls made by a government-appointed working group for an easing in the country's stringent tax regime The working group, established last May, warned that a major overhaul of petroleum operations to cut industry costs by up to 50 per cent over a five-year period would be necessary if Norway was to remain competitive with other producing nations once crude oil production fell sharply in the mid-1990s. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently produces about 2.4m barrels of crude a day. In a report delivered on Wednesday to Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and energy minister, Mr Torleif Enger, leader of the group and an executive with Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest listed company, said it could already be possible for oil companies operating in Norway to reduce costs by up to 30 per cent for fields now being developed by implementing measures such as standardising equipment for field developments, improving cost analyses, reducing documentation and duplication of engineering. But the report said that current profitability of operations on the Norwegian continental shelf was not sufficient to secure the competitive position of the shelf internationally. Mr Stoltenberg expected to respond to the report in a white paper on the future of Norway's petroleum industry, due to be presented to the Storting in a few weeks. But he said this would not address complaints about the tax regime. The report said that while oil prices were significantly lower than at the time the tax regime was established in 1975, the tax level was significantly higher.</p>

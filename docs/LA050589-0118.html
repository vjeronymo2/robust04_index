			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHILKRET, COE APPOINTED TO PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> For the past decade, Wayne Shilkret, performing-arts director of the Ambassador  International Cultural Foundation, has been perceived as the chief impresarial  rival of Los Angeles Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann.  </P> <P> But now that Shilkret, 55, has been named new general manager of Hollywood  Bowl, succeeding the outgoing Robert Harth on July 1 as second in command at  the Philharmonic, Fleischmann will be his boss.  </P> <P> In naming Shilkret to the newly created position, Fleischman commented he was  following the dictum, "If you can't beat 'em, have 'em join you."  </P> <P> Harth's duties -- his title is general manager of the association -- will be  split between Shilkret and NancyBell Coe, who has served as orchestra manager  of the Philharmonic since the fall of 1986. She will assume Harth's title and  responsibilities, except for Hollywood Bowl.  </P> <P> Fleischmann praised Coe's "meteoric" rise at the Philharmonic, since she joined  the organization as administrator of the Philharmonic Institute in the summer  of 1986. Coe, 40, a former New Yorker, was on the staff of the Spokane  Symphony, 1978-86.  </P> <P> Coe's promotion puts a woman in a top management position at the Philharmonic  for the first time in three decades. In 1960, after 11 years as orchestra  manager, Alice Taylor was succeeded by the late Jaye Rubanoff. In 1986, Coe  succeeded Deborah Rutter as orchestra manager when Rutter became executive  director of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.  </P> <P> Shilkret's Bowl responsibilities will include "management, production and  programming," according to Fleischmann. Asked what changes he might institute  at the outdoor amphitheater, Shilkret replied, "During this first season, I'm  just going to be looking around, seeing what may be needed." He acknowledged  that his first priority is "the physical plant and its upgrading."  </P> <P> Programming for the 1989 season is already in place, the two administrators  said, with the 1990 season "partially planned." Shilkret's contract, at an  undisclosed salary reportedly in six figures, is for two years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Pasadena, the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation has  announced that David Hulme, vice president of the Foundation and second in  command to Foundation Chairman Joseph W. Tkach, will assume Shilkret's duties  as director of performing arts. Unlike Shilkret, Hulme is a member of the  Worldwide Church of God, founder and sponsor of the Foundation.  </P> <P> Shilkret presented music and dance events at Ambassador, Pasadena Civic and  Shrine Auditoriums for the past 13 years. Harth departs Sept. 1.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT  </P> <P> The scene: "Tommy" at the Universal Amphitheater Thursday, featuring The Who  (Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle), plus guest stars Elton John,  Billy Idol, Steve Winwood, Patti LaBelle and Phil Collins. This was undoubtedly  the hottest ticket around; a publicist who couldn't come up with party passes  for an elected official was threatened by the official's aide. Several  charities benefited from the $1.4 million estimated net proceeds: The Gilbert  W. Lindsay Children's Center, the United Friends of the Children and the  Westside Children's Center will equally divide $1 million; the remainder will  be split equally between the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and the  Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Foundation. Following the sold-out performance  was a party on the Universal Tour for what seemed like most of the audience.  They ate, won stuffed animals on midway games, rode the merry-go-round and tore  Who posters off the walls while the A-list partied it up nearby in a  semi-secluded area. Security was tight as would-be gate-crashers came up with  every reason known to mankind why they should be inside.  </P> <P> The buzz: The Who's performance of "Tommy," followed by another set by the  group, won rave after rave from the audience. It was pretty obvious that the  crowd was ecstatically re-living the best years of their lives. Men and women  approaching middle age showed no embarrassment while dancing in the aisles and  playing air guitar.  </P> <P> Who was there: Hanging out backstage during the performance were Sylvester  Stallone, Fox's Barry Diller, Bianca Jagger, Elton John, Phil Collins, Atlantic  Records chairman Ahmet Ertegun and wife Mica, Alana Stewart and Madonna. At the  post-party were the Who, John's songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, Patti  LaBelle, rock promoter Bill Graham, Lionel and Brenda Richie, Whoopi Goldberg,  Billy Idol, Barbara and Timothy Leary, producer Douglas Cramer, Frank Stallone,  former L.A. Clipper Norm Nixon, Irving and Shelli Azoff (he's chairman of MCA  Music Entertainment Group, she was the benefit chairperson), James Brolin and  Michael Landon.  </P> <P> That was then, this is now: Then: Men with long hair and ponytails. Now: Men  with long hair, ponytails and bald spots. Then: Smoking pot during the show.  Now: Making business deals during the show. Then: Waving your fists in the air  and singing along with the chorus. Now: Waving your fists in the air and  singing along with the chorus.  </P> <P> Dress mode: Dress was split between leather minis or pants and shaghead  hair-dos and the more upscale hip baggy business suit look.  </P> <P> The food: Along Came Mary's extensive spread included pizzas, fajitas, mini  hamburgers, a fruit stand, fish and chips and English bangers, fruit, popcorn,  an ice cream sundae bar and enough cookies and brownies to cause instant sugar  shock.  </P> <P> Quoted: "I was amazed at how hard that group worked," said Shelli Azoff, about  the Who and the other performers. "They were here until midnight last night.  And, you know, it wasn't a party. They were working. And they didn't even get  paid for this performance." Patti LaBelle admitted to intense stage fright. "I  thought I was going to forget the lyrics, I thought I was going to fall or  something," said the singer, who appeared on stage in a 60-pound black and  fuchsia dress.  </P> <P> On a scale of one to 10: "This party is so definite!" said one enthusiastic  guest.

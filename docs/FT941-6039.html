			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Freeman ahead of forecast Freeman Group, the building products company which is the subject of an agreed bid from Sheffield Insulations, announced profits for 1993 ahead of the forecast in last month's offer document. Directors had estimated that the pre-tax outcome for the year to end-December would be not less than Pounds 950,000. In the event, the USM-quoted group turned in a profit of a little more than Pounds 1m, against Pounds 496,000. The improvement was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds 64.3m. The pre-tax advance was boosted by the release of a Pounds 40,000 provision for expenses on discontinued operations, against a Pounds 310,000 charge last time. Earnings per share on an FRS 3 basis came out at 10.4p (2.7p). A second interim dividend of 4p has already been declared, which will be paid within 14 days of the offer becoming unconditional. This will raise the year's pay-out to 6p (5p).</p>

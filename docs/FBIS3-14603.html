Bal'awi conveyed the Palestinian leadership's ideas on the  current stage of Palestinian-Israeli talks to the Jordanian  Government, and the circumstances that surrounded the adoption  of Security Council Resolution 904.    [Begin recording] [Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for  cabinet affairs and information minister] His excellency the  prime minister today received Hakam Bal'awi who, in my opinion,  presented a positive stand that covered many issues. We  explained to him our viewpoint, which I explained in detail  earlier, regarding our position on the Jerusalem issue. I think  that, henceforth, we need to coordinate our positions on  Jerusalem because this subject, as you know, is an Arab,  Palestinian, Jordanian, Islamic, and Christian subject. The  responsibility toward this subject is very great.    [Bal'awi] I had the honor to meet with his excellency the  prime minister this morning. I am here as the envoy of  President 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership to brief the  Jordanian brothers on all details that preceded and followed the  recent security council resolution, and on all Palestinian  contacts with the Israelis and Americans on developments in the  situation following the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron. Undoubtedly, the brothers in Jordan closely follow all  these speedy and important details. We should work together in  all fields. We are not neighbors, but one people in the same  geographic area. We work together and our capabilities are  devoted to attaining the Palestinian independence that will  eventually enhance the Jordanian independence, which will then  create the forthcoming Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion which, God  willing, will be a living model for the future, civilized Arab  situation in this area.

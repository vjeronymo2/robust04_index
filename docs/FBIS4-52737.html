			<p>BFN     [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Thai troops stopped about 100  terrified Cambodian civilians from crossing the Thai-Cambodian  border on Tuesday.    The Khmers were seeking temporary refuge in Thailand due to  fighting in Cambodia between government troops and Khmer Rouge  guerrillas.    At least two Cambodian civilians were injured when four  mortar shells, fired by the guerrillas, landed about one  kilometer from a market in Poipet border town.    The fighting prompted some 100 Cambodians to attempt to  cross  Mahot canal which demarcates the border. However, they were  stopped by troops from the Burapha Task Force.</p>

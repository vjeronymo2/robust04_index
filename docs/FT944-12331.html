			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Delays likely on building society law changes Ministerial decisions about changing the rules governing the way building societies operate are set to be delayed beyond the original deadline for the far-reaching government review - which could mean the changes would not become law before the next general election in 1996 or 1997. The two-stage review of societies' powers and duties of accountability to the millions of customers who own them was launched in January. At that time, the Treasury said it intended to complete the work by the end of this year. This summer Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister, insisted that this timetable would be met. But some of the largest societies have already told the Treasury that they will be unable to meet next Wednesday's deadline for comments on the second stage of the review. There is thus little time for ministers to take advice and reach decisions before they are taken up with the work surrounding the Budget and the annual public spending statement at the end of this month. The Treasury said yesterday that it was still aiming to complete the review by the end of the year. Timing of the review has already suffered one setback: announcement of the first-stage results, which had been planned for May, did not take place until July. One element in the delay was the extensive interest in the plans, which aim to give societies greater freedom to raise funds, lend to small businesses and own general insurance subsidiaries, from elsewhere in Whitehall including Downing Street, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Trade and Industry. The consultation paper for the second stage of the review, published in September, raises even broader issues about the structure of regulation for societies and how far new measures might make them more accountable to their members. If, as could well be the case, the conclusions of the government's review are not intensely party political, then legislation to bring them about could be included in the last pre-election legislative session - probably the one that starts in November next year. But the chances of a bill could be lessened unless the policy can be agreed in plenty of time. Even if the results of the government review are delayed into early next year, they may still not fit in with the timing of the inquiry into financial regulation by the Commons Treasury committee. The committee is to begin hearing evidence on building societies later this month.</p>

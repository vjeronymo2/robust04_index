The device has an  electric collapsible whip antenna and a magnetic loop antenna,  amplifiers, digital recorders for atmospheric phenomena, a small  computer, a CAMAC crate, color display, and printer. The range  is 300-2000 km. RMS range error is 7-10%, angular error  up to  2. Phenomena are received in the 5-20 kHz range. Readings  are taken 1-3 times per minite. Examples of the recording of  sources of thunderstorm discharges are presented on a map of the  territory under investigation. Activity can be tracked  simultaneously over the entire European region of Russia. The  results agree with meteorological data obtained at the same  time. The studies experimentally demonstrated the ability to  evaluate the current thunderstorm situation and the dynamics of  storm development in a territory with a radius of up to 2000 km.

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Employers suffer sharp pain from the bad back: Reasons behind the biggest ever health campaign THE SINGLE biggest cause of absenteeism arising from a work-related illness or injury is the bad back. It costs industry about 3m working days a year. This has sparked one of Britain's biggest ever health and safety at work campaigns under the slogan: 'Is your business at risk through sheer bad handling?' The Health and Safety Executive's campaign, launched tomorrow, is part of a three-year project aimed at reducing back injuries, as well as work-related complaints of the neck, shoulder and arms. The executive says back injuries arising from workers lifting or carrying objects account for more than a quarter of all notifiable accidents at work. An average of 20 days off work is taken for each reported accident. It adds that it is not only people doing heavy manual work who are at risk - nurses lifting patients can be injured, as can office workers moving equipment or even cartons of paper. The statistics understate the extent of the problem, the executive says. Many lifting and carrying accidents go unreported either because they are relatively minor - but nevertheless disruptive - or because they are cumulative and do not show themselves for years. The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 - which came into effect on January 1 this year - spell out employers' legal obligations in preventing back injuries. They oblige companies to: avoid the need for manual handling involving a risk of injury as far as is reasonably practicable; to assess manual handling operations where such handling cannot be avoided; and to reduce the risk to the lowest level practicable. For small businesses, in particular, this may sound like yet more Brussels-inspired bureaucracy and form-filling. The executive says a written assessment is necessary 'only if it is too complex to repeat when necessary'  -presumably to explain to an inspector. Consultants offering advice on the barrage of new health and safety legislation which came into effect from the beginning of the year should be viewed with some caution. The executive has warned that there are expensive and ill-informed cowboys about. For companies planning to do their own assessments quickly and at minimum cost, the executive advises asking: Do any tasks performed in the company involve holding loads away from the trunk of the body, twisting, stooping or reaching upwards? Are loads heavy, bulky or unstable? In the working environment, are there constraints on posture or are lighting conditions poor? Do tasks endanger pregnant women or call for special training? Any part of the operation which would lead to a 'yes' answer will need action if employees are not to risk being added to the statistics. Lighten the Load information pack for employers.

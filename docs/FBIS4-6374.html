			<p>BFN     [Text] The Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee issued a  statement denouncing the U.S. imperialists and South Korean  puppets for leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the  brink of war by deploying Patriot missiles. The statement reads:    Statement by the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee.    The entire nation and the world's peace-loving people are  strongly protesting and denouncing the maneuvers of the rulers  of the U.S. imperialist and South Korea to introduce Patriot  missiles.    In particular, South Korean students and youths, and people  from all walks of life are courageously waging anti-America,  antiwar, and antinuclear struggles day after day shouting the  slogans "We protest with our lives the deployment of Patriot  missiles which intensifies tension on the Korean peninsula" and  "Yankee go home."    This shows South Korean people's firm will that they would  never tolerate the maneuver to introduce Patriot missiles. This  is also a genuine, just, patriotic struggle to prevent the risk  of the approaching reality of a nuclear war, and defend the  country's peace and safety.    As has been exposed, the introduction of new missiles in  South Korea is one of the premeditated aggressive arms build-up  maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean war maniac  elements to make a preemptive attack on our Republic. The  Patriots missiles being deployed to South Korea are the most  advanced, highly dangerous, war devices [chonjaeng sudan] which  can strike any place and object depending on the type of  warheads installed.    Branding the Patriot missile deployment maneuver of the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of  the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the North-South joint  declaration on denuclearization, which were intended to  peacefully resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula,  the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee resolutely denounces the  undisguised military provocation aimed at unleashing at any  cost, another war -- a thermonuclear war in Korea.    The introduction of Patriot missiles that were constantly  rejected in many regions of the world is an inevitable product  of the despicable flunkyist and treacherous policy pursued by  the Kim Yong-sam group, which has turned South Korea into an  exhibition ground for new and old U.S. weapons and into an arms  market.    Following the collapse of the Cold-War system and the break  in the balance of power in the international arena, the monopoly  companies of the U.S. defense industry have faced difficulties  in selling weapons. Representing the interests of monopolies,  the Pentagon and the U.S. Administration are trying every means  to develop markets that stockpile various war equipment,  including already-produced mass destructive weapons by putting  pressure on the so-called allies and puppets under their  subjugation.    Kim Yong-sam the treacherous traitor, who has emerged as a  vanguard in carrying out the U.S. aggressive policy, already  vowed loyalty to his master during his U.S. junket at the end of  last year and promised to fill the stomachs of U.S. agricultural  capitalists and defense companies by opening the weapons market  along with the rice market.    The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working  contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and  the South which had been arranged with so much effort and,  later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about  someone's scheme to provoke a war against the South, and made  public even an aggressive war plan dubbed "new operation plan  No. 5027" against the North which had been secret. All this was  motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a legal pretext  for the massive shipment of U.S.-made destructive weapons to  South Korea, thus furthering the interests of the United States,  its master.    Not satisfied with selling out the rice market on which the  lives of South Korean farmers depend, the traitor Kim Yong-sam  gave out South Korea as a market for U.S.-made weapons, thus  showing that the rascals are treacherous traitors worse than the  five traitors of Ulsa.    It has become clear to everybody that as long as treachery  exists with the traitor Kim Yong-sam in power in South Korea,  the nation's interests cannot be defended and our nation cannot  avoid a nuclear war calamity. South Korean youths, students,  and people must invigorate the anti-America, antiwar,  antinuclear and antigovernment struggle to oust the Kim Yong-sam  group from power and establish an independent and democratic  government to block and thwart the introduction of the Patriot  missile by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique.    History shows how tragic the end is for traitors who run  counter to the general trend. If the United States and the  South Korean puppets ignore the aspiration of the times and the  demand of the nation and steadily reinforce the aggression  forces to finally start the fire of a nuclear war on the Korean  peninsula, the provokers will never get off safe.    The U.S. and South Korean rulers must clearly see the strong  spirit and iron will of the our people, who never pardon those  who infringe upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty  of the country, promptly stop the aggressive arms buildup  including the deployment of Patriot missiles and discontinue the  reckless war provocation moves at once.    [Dated] 19 April, 1994, Pyongyang.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Addressing the 21st anniversary of the United  Development Party (PPP) on 5 January, Party Chairman H.Ismail  Hassan Metareum stressed that the quest for greater political  openess and democracy has become a dominant issue in the life of  the people now. This is a consequence of the success achieved by  Indonesia during the first 25-year long-term development master  plan.    We agree with the PPP chairman's claim that the people's  increasing maturity in political affairs has led them to demand  for greater democracy and further encourage them to fight for  their rights and to protect their interests. These are the  products of the political development that has been continuously  implemented by the new order government. Likewise, the fact  that the people have higher aspirations and are becoming more  critical is inseparable from the development progress.    Many highly intellectual younger Indonesians, who have been  educated overseas, and their counterparts, who have been growing  up under the new order government over the last 25 years, did  not face the rebellion by the G-30-S/PKI [30 September  Movement/Indonesian Communist Party] at all. They did not  experience the struggle for national independence and the  physical revolution from 1945 to the 1950's. They only know  about these facts through reading material. This means that even  the current young generation, who are under 25 years old, was  not born yet when the country was struggling for independence.  They too are ignorant of the G-30-S/PKI uprising in 1965.    In view of this, we can expect the Indonesian young  generation, who returned to their homeland after completing  their studies overseas, and other youths growing up during the  new order's development program and those who were born after  the G-30-S/PKI uprising to have a dynamism, aspirations, and  visions that are different from those of the pre-G-30-S/PKI  uprising generation.    Basically, we can understand that it is difficult for the  youths, who are currently below 25 years old, to understand why  the government still fears danger from the leftist and rightist  extremists in the country.    We are highlighting these reasons to reaffirm Metareum's  statement on the current need for greater political openess and  greater democracy. Relatively speaking, when our current young  generation becomes more daring and expresses their ideas and  criticisms against government officials, this should be accepted  as something normal and as the outcome of the development  achievements in various fields.    In this case, the dynamism, aspirations, and visions that  are  spreading now would, perhaps, be different from those of the  older generation. This in turn should be considered fair,  frank, and constructive. It is hoped that our government  officials can be more accomodating of the dynamism and  development of political awareness in the country. They should  be tactful in promoting openess by holding dialogues with the  people without over-emphasizing approaches to national security.  [passage omitted]    There is a possibility that the selection of the PPP  leadership is based on the figures' political affiliations,  rather than on true qualifications. Factional differences,  however, could bridge together by considering the cadreization  system implemented by the figures running in the party election.    Even though we are a little late in sending our greetings to  the PPP on the occassion of its 21st anniversary, we hope that  the PPP will always be one of our successful socio-political  forces and is able to implement development programs as desired  by the new order government.</p>

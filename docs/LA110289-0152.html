			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS WIND UP CASE  </P> <P> Prosecutors concluded their closing arguments Wednesday in the record-breaking  McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, urging jurors to convict two former  teachers of molesting 11 of their pupils.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders will instruct the jury of  eight men and four women this afternoon, after which deliberations will begin.  </P> <P> The proceeding, now in its third year, is the longest and costliest criminal  trial in U.S. history. Since first being filed in 1984, the case has cost Los  Angeles County residents more than $15 million.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin, in her final summation, urged the jury to  believe the children who claimed that they were molested by former preschool  teachers Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62.  </P> <P> She also urged the panel to convict the two defendants of one count of  conspiracy and 64 counts of child molestation for allegedly sexually abusing 11  of their pupils at the now-closed Virginia McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan  Beach from 1978 until 1983.  </P> <P> "I submit to you that the children have told the truth," Rubin said. "They  bottled it up inside for a long time, but they had the courage to sit up on  that witness stand and recount how they were molested by Raymond and Peggy  Buckey at the McMartin Pre-School.  </P> <P> "What these teachers did to these children is really unfathomable," the  prosecutor said. "It's hard to believe. But behind the facade of what was  supposed to be a loving, kind preschool was a place that was really pretty  horrible."  </P> <P> If convicted, the Buckeys could be sent to state prison for the rest of their  lives.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys, who have steadfastly maintained their clients' innocence,  concluded their closing arguments last week.  </P> <P> The defense essentially argued that the children were manipulated by  prosecution social workers into falsely claiming that they were molested.  </P> <P> When filed in 1984, the case was the largest molestation case in U.S. history.  Since then, however, scores of charges and five co-defendants have been  dismissed because of insufficient evidence.  </P></p>

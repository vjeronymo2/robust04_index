			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Israel 'can do better' says Gatt Israel has made big strides in liberalising its trade regime over the past decade but needs to do much more to stimulate competition and improve the flexibility of its economy, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A Gatt secretariat report says the peace and economic agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organisation should help stimulate trade, investment and tourism. However, the main economic gains for Israel will come indirectly from a relaxation and eventual end to the Arab boycott and reduced political risks of investment. Israel's trade ministry, said there had been a partial lifting of the secondary and tertiary boycott but no moves to lift the direct boycott. The Arab boycott may have cost Israel as much as Dollars 40bn in lost trade and investment. Though trade with third countries is expanding Israel still does most of its trade on preferential terms with the US and the EU.</p>

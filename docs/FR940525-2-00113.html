			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes address the operability and surveillance requirements for the charging pump, HPSI [high-pressure safety injection] pumps, reactor coolant pumps, safety valves, PORVs, block valves, and the LTOP, boron dilution and SDC [shutdown cooling] systems. These changes were proposed to address four main issues: to reflect the guidance of GL 90&hyph;06 with respect to PORV and cold overpressure; to address boron dilution concerns; to address shutdown risk management lessons learned; and to address recent information on cold overpressure mitigation concerns. Generally, the changes are more restrictive than present requirements and are consistent with the recommendations of GL 90&hyph;06. Also, the changes provide the operator with additional guidance that was not previously available. Therefore, the changes will not impact the probability of occurrence or consequences of an LTOP event, boron dilution event, loss of shutdown cooling, or other event requiring emergency core cooling which has been previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> PORV Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.3 have been made to be consistent with GL 90&hyph;06. One enhancement has been made to the guidance contained in GL 90&hyph;06 and that was to replace the phrase ``because of excessive seat leakage'' with the phrase ``and capable of being manually cycled.'' Although the PORV may be designated inoperable, it may be able to be manually opened and closed and in this manner can be used to mitigate transients. For example, PORV inoperability may be due to seat leakage, instrumentation problems, automatic control problems, or other causes that do not prevent manual use and do not create a possibility for a small break LOCA. The wording changes are meant to be more specific while meeting the intent of GL 90&hyph;06. The additional enhancement to GL 90&hyph;06 includes Surveillance Requirement 4.4.3.1c whereby Millstone Unit No. 2 proposed to bench test the PORVs at a qualified laboratory under conditions representative of Mode 3 or 4 conditions. We believe this off site test will result in safer plant conditions than the in situ test proposed in the generic letter. The remaining changes to Technical Specification 3.4.3 incorporate the guidance contained in GL 90&hyph;06 and do not significantly increase the probability or consequence of an LTOP event or the failure of the PORV to operate as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Cold Overpressurization Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Changes are being proposed to Technical Specification sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.3, 3.4.9.1, 3.4.9.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.2, 4.4.9.3.1, 4.4.9.3.2, and 4.5.3.2 to incorporate the guidance of GL 90&hyph;06 as well as enhance the availability of equipment to reduce the shutdown risk while still satisfying the cold overpressure requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.3 will ensure only one charging pump and one HPSI pump are operable in Mode 5 or 6 with the reactor vessel head on with an available vent of less than 2.8 square inches. The remaining pumps will be secured. These proposed changes have been made to ensure Millstone Unit No. 2 does not create an LTOP condition by the operation of too many pumps injecting fluid, thereby increasing pressure in a low-temperature condition. These proposed modifications are consistent with Technical Specification 3.5.3 which has also been modified and will decrease the possibility of an LTOP condition from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.1 will ensure consistency between this technical specification and Technical Specification 3.4.9.3. The safety valves at Millstone Unit No. 2 are not used for LTOP mitigation. The PORVs, or RCS [reactor coolant system] vent at Millstone Unit No. 2 are used to mitigate an LTOP condition. Safety valves are required to be operable during operating conditions to automatically reduce system pressures. The use of the PORV, which allows manual control, for mitigation of an LTOP event, reduces the severity and consequence of a potential overpressure event by giving the operators more control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3/4.9.3 provide enhanced operational flexibility through the use of a PORV or RCS vent. The APPLICABILITY statement has been changed for clarification purposes with no change in intent and safety implications. The ACTION requirements for the LTOP system include a 7-day allowable outage time (AOT) to restore an inoperable LTOP channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken. In addition, new Action Statement `f' states that the provisions of Specification 3.0.4 are not applicable. Therefore, the unit may enter the Modes for which the LCO apply, during a unit shutdown or placement of the head on the reactor vessel following refueling, when an LTOP channel is inoperable. In this situation, the 7-day AOT applies for restoring the channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken. This is the same manner in which the ACTION requirements apply when an LTOP channel is determined to be inoperable while the plant is in a Mode for which the LTOP system is required to be operable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications 3.4.1.4 and 3.4.9.1 have been revised to address concerns identified in an NRC Information Notice regarding previously unconsidered pressure drops across the reactor. The modifications to these two technical specifications will ensure that unanticipated pressure rises do not occur and that there will be no increase in the probability or consequences of the LTOP event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the evaluation done in support of resolution to GL 90&hyph;06 regarding the LTOP system unavailability, NNECO concludes that additional restrictions on operation with an inoperable LTOP channel are warranted when the potential for a low-temperature overpressure event is the highest, and especially when the unit is in a water-solid condition. It is also concluded that these additional measures emphasize the importance of the LTOP system, especially while operating in a water-solid condition as the primary success path for the mitigation of overpressure transients during low-temperature operation. Therefore, these enhancements will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Boron Dilution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Changes are being proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, and 4.1.2.4 to provide added assurance that the boron dilution analysis remains bounding while allowing lower flow rates to reduce the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing at mid-loop operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.1.2.4, and 4.9.8.1 will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident. Tagging out of a charging pump, increasing shutdown margin, and reducing SDC flow will impact results of the boron dilution accident, but will not increase the probability of initiating events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An increase in the shutdown margin requirement as was done in Technical Specifications 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.8 will assure consistency with the Core Operating Limits Report which provided additional margin in a boron dilution event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

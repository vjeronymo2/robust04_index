			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / EU settles fishing row with Spain The European Union settled its long-festering fisheries row over Spain's access to the waters around Ireland last night, ending the threat of Madrid's vetoing the entry of Austria, Finland and Sweden into the EU in January. The UK was isolated after the German presidency of the EU took the unusual step of putting the dispute to a vote, producing 11 member states in favour and an abstention by Britain. The dispute, which dates from Spanish accession in 1986, could have led to a full-blown European crisis had it blocked expansion of the Union next month. In spite of its isolation, the UK government may have reason to be satisfied with the result. British obstruction tactics have limited inroads by Spain's large fishing fleet. Mr William Waldegrave, Britain's agriculture and fisheries minister, said: 'We have kept the Spanish out of the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel,' which he described as taking 'two thirds of the pot' while playing poker with a poor hand. Spain's fleet appears to have won less access to the waters west of the UK and Ireland than it was guaranteed in its accession treaty or than it was promised this year during entry negotiations for new EU members. Spanish officials said they were satisfied with the compromise. Madrid had made the entry of new EU members conditional on Spain's being given equal treatment under the Union's Common Fisheries Policy, which was not scheduled to come into operation until 2002. However, Article 158b of Spain's accession treaty gave rights for 70 Spanish fishing vessels to fish inside the so-called Irish Box - the waters surrounding Ireland - by the end of next year. Under last night's compromise, only 40 Spanish vessels gain access to the Irish Box, and two of the three areas at dispute with the British will be off limits. Spain's trawlers will, however, be able to fish in the so-called Celtic Sea  -the area between south-east Ireland and south-west England - which was always Spain's main objective. 'Mission accomplished,' said Mr Luis Atienza, Spain's agriculture and fisheries minister, at the end of the talks. His officials pointed out that Spain had never traditionally fished in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel anyway. Mr Waldegrave said: 'I would have liked to have (kept) the Celtic Sea as well.' However, he insisted, the main point was that 'there will be no Spanish free-for-all'. But Eurosceptic Conservative MPs - nine of whom refused to support the government's fishing policy in the House this month - attacked the deal. Mr Tony Marlow MP, a leading Eurosceptic, said the government had submitted to 'blackmail' from Spain and Portugal. British fishermen reacted with fury to the deal and threatened clashes with Spanish vessels in sensitive coastal waters around the British Isles.</p>

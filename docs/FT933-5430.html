			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: 'Decopier' wipes paper clean - Worth Watching The traditional photocopier has contributed more to world deforestation than most other office machines. Now Japanese manufacturer Ricoh has redressed the balance with a prototype 'decopier' - technology which removes the toner from the surface of copied paper. During the copying process the images are created with toner - resin powder  -on the surface of the paper. The images are fixed using a hot roller which melts the resin and applies pressure so that it soaks into the tiny spaces between the fibres. The 'decopier' reverses the process, applying a peel-off solution to the paper to reduce the adhesion. Heat is then applied to fuse the toner while pressure transfers the molten toner on to the surface of a roller. The prototype machine can recycle three A4 sheets a minute.

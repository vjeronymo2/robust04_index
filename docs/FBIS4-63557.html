			<p>BFN     [Text] Moldavia's [Moldova] President Mircea Snegur and the  Moldavian Parliament's Speaker Petr Luchinskiy met in Kishinev  [Chisinau] Monday [23 May] with President Stepan Topal and other  leaders of the non-recognized Gagauz Republic. The meeting took  place behind closed doors.    As INTERFAX has learned from a source close to the Moldavian  president, the leaders continued to discuss a bill on giving  Gagauz settlements a special administrative status. Conclusions  of experts from the Council of Europe and proposals of other  international bodies were taken into account.    The Gagauz side is reported to have accepted a compromise  formula, according to which the Gagauz country is an autonomous  ethnic territorial entity rather than a state autonomous  territorial entity on which it has insisted so far.    As the Moldavian President's State Counselor Victor  Grebenshikov has told Interfax, "there are reasons to believe  that the Gagauz issue will be solved soon." In his opinion, "a  parliamentary commission has been working hard to draft a Gagauz  autonomy accord."    "I think -- he remarked -- the document will ensure the  interests of Moldavia -- its territorial integrity and  sovereignty -- and will guarantee the existence and development  of Gagauz settlements."    Grebenshikov stressed that during their talks the leaders of  Moldavia and Gagauzia saw eye to eye on all matters discussed.    Meanwhile, during the work of the parliamentary commission  on  Gagauzia, the two sides have agreed to keep the concrete issues  under discussion out of media coverage to avoid agitation.</p>

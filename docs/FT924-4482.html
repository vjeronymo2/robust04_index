			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Starting on a new track - An Italian industrial landmark that escaped demolition Half-way round the steeply-banked curves of Fiat's roof-top test track at its former Lingotto factory in Turin, you begin to regret having chosen the gorgonzola sauce rather than the salad for lunch. From the passenger's seat of an Italian sports car, racing along the one-kilometre track is for many people a dream come true. Millions of youngsters must have imagined themselves behind the wheel on the extraordinary oval circuit, five floors above ground. Like many contemporary industrial wonders, however, Lingotto reached the end of the road. Built by Fiat between 1917 and 1920, it was for decades the biggest car factory outside the US, and an object of wonder even for architectural gurus like Le Corbusier. But what do you do with one of Europe's biggest empty spaces, encompassing 250,000 square metres, much of it in two narrow parallel blocks, and 350,000 square metres of ground, once production has stopped? And how do you protect such a site from environmental damage and vandalism? That was the challenge posed by Fiat to 20 architects in 1984, including Sir Denys Lasdun and Sir James Stirling of the UK, Austria's Hans Hollein, and Richard Meier from the US. Three of Italy's best-known architects, Renzo Piano, Aldo Rossi and Gae Aulenti, also took part. Many suggested transforming the big press shop into an exhibition space. Ideas for the two 500-metre spines were more varied, although theatres, hotels and conference centres often featured. And all retained the famous test track. That is roughly the mix of activities now under development in the L600bn (Pounds 285m) project for Lingotto, which recently marked an important turning point with the opening of the first big exhibition devised entirely by the new company running the site. Designed along Henry Ford's assembly line principles, the plant was conceived by the architect, Giacomo Matte-Trucco, to maximise output in the minimum space. Construction costs were kept down by using a rigid modular system. Surprisingly, Fiat's decision to pull out of Lingotto in 1982 was an industrial rather than an environmental choice. Ceiling and under-floor clearances were inadequate for modern motor production. All around the world, industrial mammoths like Lingotto were falling victim to new, single-level factories with huge, column-free spaces and high ceilings. With the old press shop having been partly demolished and rebuilt as exhibition space, Lingotto's five halls, covering 90,000 square metres, are now nearly complete. The whole project, masterminded by Piano, best known for the Pompidou Centre in Paris, has capitalised on natural light from existing skylights to provide a much less claustrophobic space than in most exhibition centres. Elsewhere, typical Piano touches like long multi-storey escalators and brightly painted pipework abound. But it is finding uses for the rest of the plant which has posed the biggest challenge for the sponsors. In a complex deal, Fiat sold Lingotto for L35bn payable in installments, to a consortium in which it will hold 37 per cent. Partners include Turin's chamber of commerce, and two local banks and an insurance company, which have 36 per cent between them. A sister company, owned by private and public-sector interests, will run the exhibitions. It will manage the halls and associated services for shows organised by third parties, such as Turin's book fair and the bi-annual Motor Show, which this year - the first at the restructured Lingotto - received 540,000 visitors. But to make a profit, the company must also devise new functions. One spin-off already under way is a series of Lingotto-branded products, to be manufactured under licence. A Piano-designed halogen lamp, based on the original 1920s light fittings and now installed in many parts of the building, is to be marketed by one of Italy's leading lighting manufacturers. Piano's plans for the rest of the site include a flexible 2,200-seat concert hall being dug out of the bowels of the building, which will have an adjustable roof, allowing it to adapt acoustically to the needs of conferences as well as concerts. Another area will be occupied by a 250-bed luxury hotel, while a row of shops will run along both spines. Further civic uses will be guaranteed by re-housing the science faculty of Turin University at the northern end of the building, with an additional wing. The plans include a three-storey business centre, while an 'incubator' for budding new companies near the university complex will complete the circle between basic research and commercial applications of new technology. The whole project, so far only slightly behind schedule, should be finished by 1995, when the university moves in. In the meantime, the hotel and congress centre are due to open next September, followed by the shops at Christmas and the innovation centre in 1994. Will it work, especially in a recessionary Italy? Many companies are already scaling down spending plans, while Piano himself earlier this year attended the opening of an equally big conference centre he designed in an old cotton warehouse in Genoa. The Torinese themselves are delighted that one of their city's most famous landmarks is being revived, even if there is concern about the cost. If Lingotto takes off, such caution will probably be cast aside by visitors strolling around the test track, which will be open to the public. If not, Lingotto's sponsors could find themselves with an impressive white elephant.</p>

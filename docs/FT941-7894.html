			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / US technology takes lead on HDTV: For once, the Japanese have been left behind in the consumer electronics field The establishment of a world-wide digital standard for high definition television appears likely following Japan's review of its support for the older, analogue system that it has previously promoted. The Japanese move comes as the US is poised to finalise its own digital HDTV standards and begin field tests of the new technology. The results of these tests will come under close scrutiny from Japan as well as Europe, raising the potential for world-wide adoption of the US system. The US HDTV standard has two important attractions. First, it can co-exist with existing analogue TV broadcast standards, so that consumers are not forced to buy new TV sets, although they must do so in order to receive high-definition pictures. Second, the digital US HDTV standard is well suited to interactive television that provides services such as 'movies on demand' and television shopping. Japan's early lead in HDTV spurred major efforts in the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s to develop competing technology. Ironically, however, HDTV is now considered to be of far less significance in the US than the development of interactive television services. With the US television, communications and computer industries now pouring billions of dollars into creating 'information superhighways' to distribute interactive television and information services, HDTV is taking a back seat. Leaders of the European broadcasting and consumer electronics industries have long seen a Japanese move towards digital transmission as inevitable, and were not surprised by the announcement of a review. Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics group, said it would make 'little difference' to Europe. 'In Europe the decision to move towards digital transmission for standard and higher definition television was taken over a year ago, and the TV production standard is already digital today.' Last September the European Union formed a Digital Video Broadcasting Group, under the aegis of the German telecommunications ministry, uniting 120 interested parties, including television manufacturers, broadcasters, satellite operators, governments and the Commission itself, behind a digital strategy. This was a deliberate shift away from earlier attempts to impose European HDTV standards. The group's first objective - largely attained - is to agree standards for digital satellite transmission at standard definition. It is also addressing terrestrial standards for standard definition. European digital satellite broadcasting is expected to start next year, as additional satellite capacity becomes available. The main aim is to use digital compression to increase the number of channels that can be broadcast. Most of the parties on the European broadcasting group are against the imposition of HDTV standards in Europe until a market is in prospect. Wide-screen sets for standard-definition signals is generally considered to be the next new market for hardware. Mr David Mercer, an analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions, an IT consultancy, said the Japanese move was a significant step. 'It leaves the way open for a common approach to digital standards between the US, Japan and Europe, though there is still a long way to go.' Officials in the European Commission yesterday indicated that the Japanese move was unlikely to have much impact on its own approach. One commission official said: 'The Japanese have to have some credit for being the pioneers. But it hasn't been a success in Japan and now everybody thinks the future will be digital.' He added: 'Everybody thought (in the 1980s) the Japanese system was going to be another Japanese walkover and there was indeed panic in Europe to get something up and running. I suppose this confirms us in what we did.' In the US, electronics industry officials said they did not yet know enough about the Japanese move to comment fully, but said it would not be surprising for Japan to conclude that analogue technology was inadequate in comparison to available digital technologies. 'We in the US have gone to all-digital technologies and we think we have leapfrogged the rest of the world,' said Mr John Taylor, a spokesman for Zenith Electronics, whose VSB transmission system was selected last week by a US 'Grand Alliance' of electronics manufacturers and laboratories as the basis for US HDTV. That selection is due to be presented to an advisory committee of the US Federal Communications Commission tomorrow for review and approval.</p>

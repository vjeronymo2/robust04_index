			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Terminborse sounds out new products THE Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options exchange, is considering introducing some new stock index products, following the success of its futures and options on the Dax 30 index of German stocks. Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of the DTB, said the exchange was sounding out interest in futures and options on a larger index. The Frankfurt stock exchange is currently investigating the possibility of starting a Dax 100 index, on which the DTB would then base futures and options. One potential problem is the lack of liquidity in all but the largest German stocks. In order for index futures to develop liquidity, marketmakers like to be able to replicate the index in the cash market, which is difficult if some of the stocks are illiquid. The exchange is also considering launching futures and options based on sector indices. On the interest rate side, the exchange is still considering launching futures and options on short-term German interest rates. Such a contract would be based on the Frankfurt interbank offered rate (Fibor). The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) already has a successful Euromark futures contract but the DTB is keen to offer the full maturity range of German interest rate products, to encourage spread trading. A new UK derivatives trade association, the Futures and Options Association, will begin soliciting membership on Friday, said Brian Williamson of the association's formation group. Michael Jenkins, chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox), and the former chief executive of Liffe, has been appointed association chairman, Reuter reports</p>

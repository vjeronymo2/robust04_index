			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Nordic parties swing behind EU Three political parties whose support is central to efforts to overcome strong opposition to European Union membership in the Nordic applicant countries have swung behind the campaign for a Yes vote in referendums to be held in the autumn in Finland, Norway and Sweden, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. Yesterday special congresses of Norway's ruling Labour party and Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party - both the biggest political parties in their respective countries - -voted by wide margins to support membership. On Saturday, the Finnish Centre Party, led by Prime Minister Esko Aho, decided by 1,607 votes to 834 to back a pro-EU line despite considerable scepticism among its grassroots rural supporters. The Labour party in Norway, skilfully led to a pro-EU stance against the current of national opinion over the past two years by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, voted to support membership by 197 votes to 93. Similarly, the Swedish Social Democrats decided by a margin of 232-103 to join the Yes campaign.</p>

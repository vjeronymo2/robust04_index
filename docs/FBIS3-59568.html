Optoelectronic Devices Can Become  Smaller and Less Expensive/Resolution of 0.3 Nanometer"]    [Text] Frankfurt--Holographic gratings are optical  microstructures that can be used in numerous ways in optical  measuring systems and in laser equipment. The Berlin Institute  for Optics GmbH [Limited Liability Company] (Rudower Chaussee 5,  12484 Berlin) has developed new kinds of holographic gratings  that can be used in spectrometers for environmental analysis and  for optimization of the application of high-power lasers.    As Dr. Christel Budzinski reports, optical microstructures  like holographic gratings can be fabricated by processes that  come from microelectronics. They include photolithography and  dry etching. Holographic gratings can help to reduce the size of  optoelectronic devices. The cost of these devices can also be  lowered by the use of gratings.    Spectrometers in the field of environmental analysis are an  application possibility. Incident light is split up spectrally  and analyzed in spectrometers. These instruments have to be  especially lightweight and compact if they are used in  satellites for remote sensing, for determination of the state of  terrestrial vegetation, for example.    A grating from Berlin specially developed for this purpose  can help here. The spectrometer required operates in the  spectral region of 650 to 800 nanometers. An image of a strip of  the earth's surface (swath) is formed by means of a lens in the  entrance slit and is then directed to the grating, where the  spectrum is split into individual colors. The spectrum is then  picked up by a photodetector array (CCD) and can be analyzed.    Atmospheric gases and changes in them as well as the state  of  vegetation can be detected in this way by estimating the red  shift of chlorophyll margins. The holographic grating is the  chief component. It defines the precision of the measurements.  The spectral resolution, that is, the precision with which  individual wavelengths can be differentiated, is especially  decisive.    The resolution comes to 0.3 nanometer for the grating  developed for the remote-sensing spectrometer. This also enables  the spatial resolution of measured values in a modified  spectrometer. Thus, the values for a swath can be associated  with individual elements of the earth's surface, and this  enhances the strength of the evidence of environmental analysis.    Laser technology is an additional application possibility  for  holographic gratings. CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  lasers above all have  recently taken on importance in medicine and in the working of  materials. This type of laser is very efficient and can be  handled with precision.    This precision is closely associated with the diameter of  the  laser spot. The smaller the diameter of the beam, the higher the  energy density and the more finely detailed the work that can be  done. Now holographic gratings can help to reduce the laser  spot's size. However, conventional gratings fabricated by  photolithography do not have especially high stress tolerance.    The gratings are ruined even at lower laser outputs. That is  why the scientists in Berlin have fabricated holographic  gratings by means of a molding process and with copper as the  substrate. These gratings have substantially higher stress  tolerance and thus can contribute to higher precision when  working with high-power lasers.</p>

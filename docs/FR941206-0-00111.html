These incentives will: allow cable operators to offer new product tiers (``NPTs'') to be priced as operators elect, provided certain limited conditions are met; permit cable operators to add new channels to existing cable programming services tiers (``CPSTs'') subject to certain price caps; and create an additional option pursuant to which small cable operators may recover headend costs expended plus programming costs when they add channels to CPSTs. In addition, the Commission determined that a la carte packages are CPSTs and therefore subject to rate regulation. The Commission also confirmed that cable operators do not have to obtain the affirmative consent of subscribers before making rate adjustments so long as the changes are permitted under our rules and the fundamental nature of the affected tier is unaltered. Finally, the Commission decided not to adopt its proposal modifying restrictions on transactions between cable operators and their affiliates; instead it will retain its existing cable affiliate transaction rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also has adopted a Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which is being printed separately in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 1, 1995, with the exception of &sect;76.922(e) (1), (2), and (7) and &sect;76.987(g) which contain new reporting requirements which will be effective on that date or as soon thereafter as they may be approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this order, the Commission modifies its rules in light of comments, filed, in response to petitions for reconsideration, and on its own motion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this Report and Order, unless indicated otherwise, the Commission uses ``CPSTs'' to mean cable programming service tiers that are rate regulated under &sect;76.922 of its rules. Although new product tiers are CPSTs within the meaning of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2), in this Report and Order, they are separately referred to as new product tiers or NPTs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. New Product Tiers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Cable Television Consumer Protection Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), 47 U.S.C. 543(c), requires the Commission to ensure that CPST rates are not unreasonable upon the receipt of a specific complaint. The Act requires the Commission to establish criteria for determining whether a rate is unreasonable after considering a number of factors, such as the rates of similar systems, the rates charged by cable operators that face competition, and the operator's costs and revenues. The 1992 Cable Act also permits the Commission to consider other relevant factors for determining what constitutes unreasonable rates for CPSTs. In the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 (``Rate Order''), 58 FR 29736 (May 21, 1993), the Commission adopted benchmark and cost-of-service rules which reflect a reasonable balancing of the statutory factors. The Commission has also adopted rules which allow cable operators to increase rates for their Basic Service Tiers (``BSTs'') and CPSTs to reflect inflation, increases in external costs, and the addition of new channels. The current formula for channel additions permits operators to collect a sliding per channel adjustment for adding new programming channels to CPSTs and to recover all programming expenses associated with adding channels, plus a 7.5% mark-up on new programming expenses. 47 CFR 76.922 (d), (e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

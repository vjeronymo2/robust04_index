			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 23 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] With regard to the issue of resuming the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, a senior official with  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said on  22 April, "Japan and the United States will hold informal  consultations to discuss resuming the stalled framework talks  after the May holidays." The MITI senior official expressed an  eagerness for a resumption of the stalled framework talks,  saying: "During the consultations, Japan and the United States  will discuss not only such macroeconomic measures as continued  tax cuts and an increase in public investment, but also the  adoption of objective criteria to measure the openness of the  Japanese market and individual sectors. Japan seeks to reach a  set of agreements with the United States in the framework talks  prior to the industrialized nations' summit (the Naples summit)  scheduled for July."    The senior MITI official indicated that vice-ministerial  officials from the two countries will hold the informal  consultations, adding that "the two countries need to hold  several rounds of informal consultations before the summit talks  are held." The MITI official went on to say: "In order for the  stalled framework talks to be resumed an early date and for the  two countries to reach a set of agreements, the macroeconomic  measures are important, but Japan should not defer the  discussion of individual sectors at the framework talks. The  two countries need to reach a set of agreements on both  macroeconomic and microeconomic measures prior to the summit  talks."</p>

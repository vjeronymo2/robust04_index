			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the Arkansas River shiner was widespread and abundant throughout the western portions of the Arkansas River Basin in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. There is one record from the Arkansas River at the mouth of Piney Creek in Logan County, Arkansas (Black (1940), as cited in Robison and Buchanan (1988)). A record (one individual) also exists for the Red River Basin in Oklahoma (Cross 1970), possibly originating from a release of bait fish by anglers. Within the last 20 years, this species has disappeared from over 80 percent of its historic range and is now almost entirely restricted to the Canadian (South Canadian) River in Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. A non-native population of the Arkansas River shiner has become established in the Pecos River of New Mexico within the last 15 years (Bestgen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent surveys for the Arkansas River shiner were conducted at 155 localities within the Arkansas River Basin (Larson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1991). Fish collections were made at 128 of 155 localities; the remaining 27 sites were dry. The surveys resulted in the capture of 1,455 Arkansas River shiners from 23 localities: 14 in Oklahoma, 5 in Texas, and 4 in New Mexico. No Arkansas River shiners were captured in Kansas. The decline of this species throughout its historic range may primarily be attributed to inundation and modification of stream discharge by impoundments, channel desiccation by water diversion and excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture, stream channelization, and introduction of non-native species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arkansas River shiner began to decline in the Arkansas River in western Kansas prior to 1950 due to increasing water diversions for irrigation and completion of John Martin Reservoir in 1942 (Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1985). The Arkansas River from Coolidge to near Great Bend, Kansas, is frequently dewatered (Cross  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1985). Habitat alteration following construction of Kaw and Keystone reservoirs on the Arkansas River in Oklahoma, in conjunction with completion of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System in 1970, greatly reduced Arkansas River shiner habitat in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Arkansas River shiner no longer occurs in the Arkansas River in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arkansas River shiner was once common throughout the Cimarron River and its tributaries (Pigg 1991). The abundance of the Arkansas River shiner in the Cimarron River declined markedly after 1964 (Felley and Cothran 1981). In 1976, the Red River shiner ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notropis bairdi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) was first recorded from the Cimarron River (Marshall 1978). Since that time, the Red River shiner has essentially replaced the Arkansas River shiner. Habitat alteration and resulting flow modification also contributed to the decline of the species from the Cimarron River. A small, remnant population may still persist in the Cimarron River, based on the collection of nine individuals since 1985.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arkansas River shiner was first reported from the North Canadian (Beaver) River drainage in 1926 (Hubbs and Ortenburger 1929). Collections between 1947 and 1976 indicated that the Arkansas River shiner occurred in large numbers in the river and some larger tributaries despite the construction of Optima and Canton reservoirs (Pigg 1991). This fish was still sporadically collected from the North Canadian River until 1987. Several collection attempts at 15 localities over the next 2 years failed to capture any Arkansas River shiners (Pigg 1991). In 1990, four specimens were collected from the river south of Turpin, Beaver County, Oklahoma (Larson  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1991; Jimmie Pigg, Oklahoma Department of Health, pers. comm., 1993). Commercial bait dealers were observed flushing their tanks in the vicinity of the site where the Arkansas River shiners were captured and may have been responsible for the unintentional release of this species back into the North Canadian River. The species has not been captured from the North Canadian River since 1990 (J. Pigg, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, the species occurred in the Canadian (South Canadian) River from its confluence with the Arkansas River near Sallisaw, Sequoyah County, Oklahoma as far upstream as the Sabinoso area in central San Miguel County, New Mexico (Pigg 1991, Sublette  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990). Construction and operation of Ute and Conchas reservoirs in New Mexico, Lake Meredith in Texas, and Eufaula Reservoir in Oklahoma altered or eliminated sections of riverine habitat and diminished the range of Arkansas River shiners within the Canadian River. Eufaula Reservoir isolated Canadian River populations from the Arkansas River and, in combination with Lake Meredith and Ute Reservoir, confined Arkansas River shiners to two restricted segments of the Canadian River, one between Ute Dam and the upper reaches of Lake Meredith, and the other below Lake Meredith to the upper reaches of Eufaula Reservoir. The reservoirs function as barriers, significantly inhibiting dispersal and interchange between the two segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

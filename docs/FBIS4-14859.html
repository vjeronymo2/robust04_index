			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "When Choosing Between Reforms </F> and Power, Politicians Usually Choose Power"]    [Text] Last week's statement by the president's press  secretary that B. Yeltsin might participate in the next  elections for head of state not as a voter but as a contender  has sparked a succession of statements from prominent  politicians that they have no ambitions for the presidency. F.  Fedorov and V. Chernomyrdin, in particular, have told the public  so.    Meanwhile, at Saturday's fifth congress of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] V. Zhirinovskiy was declared as the  party's presidential election candidate. At the same time, the  Liberal Democrat chairman received virtually unlimited powers  from his comrades in arms and now has the opportunity to  personally decide all party problems, including those which are  the exclusive responsibility of the congress. "When we say the  leader we mean the party, and when we say the party we mean the  leader," V. Zhirinovskiy stated.    The LDPR congress graphically demonstrated that a vigorous  aggressive political force is rapidly taking shape in Russia and  that the opposition's main problem, as a result of which it has  constantly been defeated in the struggle against the president,  seems to have been resolved. And this in turn is creating the  preconditions for attracting into the LDPR's orbit not only an  increasing number of rank-and-file supporters but also  additional social groups and political movements. The presence  of V. Achalov, who recently left Lefortovo, on the congress  platform and of A. Lukyanov and Sterligov on the platform of the  Congress of Slav Peoples is ample illustration of this. In  brief, the congress slogan "The LDPR -- Heading for Power"  should be taken extremely seriously.    The political situation currently developing in Russia is  beginning to increasingly resemble the situation which existed  in the USSR in mid-1991. Now, following the adoption of the new  Constitution, the president has finally moved from being a  leader of the populist, democratic type to being the leader of  the nomenklatura. He has become this both in his  (constitutional) capacity as head of state and in his (de facto)  capacity as head of the executive. But, despite everything, the  state apparatus remains the most powerful political and economic  force alike in our country. Thus, the president does not need  his own party, talk about which is now into its second year. If  B. Yeltsin enters the next elections, he will do so as the  leader of the party of the nomenklatura. And it is no  coincidence that the main theme of his message to parliament was  the problem of strengthening the state. And the steps we are now  seeing to strengthen and bolster the state apparatus are the  logical continuation of his report.    But it is at this point that an inevitable contradiction  arises. The more powerful the state nomenklatura, the greater  its leader's apparent chance of winning the election. But the  strengthening of the nomenklatura constrains a civil society,  which in this situation is bound to move across to opposition to  it. You see, as we all remember, B. Yeltsin won precisely as  the leader of the anti-nomenklatura opposition, and on the road  to victory he had to pursue a policy aimed at weakening the  nomenklatura and, as a consequence, weakening the state machine.    Furthermore, since in our country the state is still more  powerful than civil society, it is the head of state who bears  the responsibility for the state of affairs in the country, and  first and foremost the state of the economy. And although it is  well known that the state of the Russian economy reflects the  state of society as a whole and is largely independent of the  president and that the present crisis is inevitable, and that  one of the main reasons for it is Russia's shortage of skilled  cadres capable of working actively in market conditions, it is  nevertheless B. Yeltsin who will have to carry the can.    The greatest likelihood, therefore, is that unless there  are some real changes for the better in the country's economy  before the next presidential elections, B. Yeltsin will find  himself in the same situation as M. Gorbachev in 1989-1991,  while a rival will find himself where B. Yeltsin was at that  time, since his future rival will speak out against the state  machine, which, furthermore, is much weaker than it was under  the first president of the USSR. This is another reason why the  hints from the top echelons of power that they will not allow an  undesirable figure to come to power look somewhat unconvincing.  Just how can you prevent the legitimate winner of presidential  elections coming to power? Another attempted putsch? There is  little reason to believe that if such an attempt failed in 1991,  when the putschists had all the power of the empire available,  it would be successful now.    By announcing through his press secretary the possibility  that he might participate in the next presidential elections B.  Yeltsin has put himself in a pretty difficult position. On the  one hand, the intensification of nomenklatura power lessens his  chances of winning the election. But on the other, the  weakening of this power leads to the weakening of his party.  The president therefore has an extremely difficult task to  resolve: How to regain the status of a political leader while  also remaining the leader of the nomenklatura. There appears to  be only one possible solution: Going into the elections as  leader of all the democratic movements while at the same time  gambling not on strengthening the state but on reducing the  state apparatus to the optimum size, democratizing it, bringing  the apparatus into line with the requirements of a market  economy and the new conditions taking shape in the regions, and  reforming local self-government (including the holding of  elections of leaders of local administrations). That is,  following the path of strengthening a specifically democratic  state, which means strengthening those state institutions which  are based on a civil society.    At the same time the developments currently taking place in  the state apparatus provide grounds for concluding that what we  can see there is, on the contrary, an intensification of the  trend toward restoring the administrative system which existed  in Russia for decades -- a rigidly centralized executive  hierarchy. But in general this is natural if you consider that  state apparatus cadres consist mainly of members of the party  and soviet nomenklatura. They have moved up from the number  three or number four jobs to the top jobs. But their psychology  and mentality are still the same. There is a perfectly obvious  desire to transform the President's Administration into an  analog of the CPSU Central Committee and recreate an  administrative model of the Central Committee-oblast  committee-rayon committee type, relying in the regions on  governors linked tightly to the center.    This model is already beginning to come into conflict with  Russia's embryonic civil society. Maritime Kray Governor Ye.  Nazdratenko fired the legally elected mayor of Vladivostok.  Soon after this, Mayor D. Bednyakov of Nizhniy Novgorod, who  had every chance of making the transition from an appointed to  an elected mayor, found himself removed from his post. The head  of St. Petersburg is demanding Moscow's permission to put  military patrols on the streets. Here they all invoke the need  to establish iron discipline.    All the indications are that the state apparatus is  approaching the limit of its potential for simultaneously  resolving -- as it has been doing these past two years -- the  two tasks of implementing reforms (taking account of its own  interests, of course) and strengthening its own power. The  contradictions are becoming unsurmountable, and a choice has to  be made: reforms or power. Taking account of the fate of all  Russian reforms this century -- Stolypin's, the New Economic  Policy, Khrushchev's -- it is not hard to guess what the choice  will be.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ex-Granada chief in satellite venture MR DEREK LEWIS, former chief executive of the Granada television group, is to set up a satellite television entertainment channel in a joint venture between Thames Television, which lost its franchise in last year's competitive tenders, and the BBC. The venture will draw on the programme libraries of Thames and the BBC. The channel is expected to be launched towards the end of this year. Mr Lewis was forced to resign as Granada chief executive last year. One of the factors which helped undermine Mr Lewis was Granada's investment in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. His investment is now seen in a more positive light following BSkyB's move into profit on an operational basis. Doubt has been been expressed about whether the BBC can take part in a satellite service launched by the Independent Television Commission. Thames is confident, however, that a suitable shareholding structure can be found. Reeves, Thames Television's loss-making US production subsidiary, has won a contract to make a series set in medieval England for the ABC television network.</p>

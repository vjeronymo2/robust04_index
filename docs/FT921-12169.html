			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Bad instructions at 48p a minute A nasty little habit appears to be creeping into the mores of British computer companies. They are using premium-rate telephone lines to provide technical support. A portion of the call's cost on these lines goes to the information provider, in this case the computer company. Customers are increasingly being forced to fork out 48p a minute at peak times - and most services are only available at peak times - to discover how to get their computers to work. Ordinarily this wouldn't be such a cause for griping. A problem clearly exists for the computer companies. In the past they have provided technical support free of charge, creating a demand limited only by the willingness of callers to pay small amounts for phone calls. And although lengthy calls have cost customers very little, they have proved highly expensive for the companies providing the necessary back-up. It has also proved irritating for customers - the lines seemed permanently engaged. Times are tough in the computer industry. So the decision by Amstrad, Alan Sugar's British computer company, and Locomotive software, suppliers of the Locoscript word processing program, to use 0898 premium rate numbers is at one level understandable. Howard Fisher at Locomotive says the company used to end up answering every question under the sun about their product and those of others. As many of their software packages were selling for Pounds 30 it just was not financially viable to provide 30 minutes of support over the telephone. Meanwhile, Amstrad says it is not embarrassed about introducing premium-line services in spite of a certain resistance from customers. The group claims its 12 customer-support staff have been able to handle 25 per cent more calls because users, aware they are spending 48p a minute, take less time to make their queries. Both Amstrad and Locomotive also say people now tend to be more careful to read the manuals before they phone. Reading the manuals before ringing is a good idea. What I resent is having to pay extortionate amounts to a company which has produced a completely incomprehensible manual. So here's the gripe. My father recently purchased an Amstrad SX9600AT facsimile machine, including bells, whistles, a button for accessing the Mercury telephone system and a completely useless manual. Having persuaded my father - incapable of operating a video machine after more than 10 years  -to sign-up with Mercury, it was left to me to program the fax machine with the Mercury access code. Being a bit of a technophile, I thought this wouldn't be too tricky. I turned to page 33 of the manual. I defy anyone to be able to program the machine for Mercury from the instructions there. It appeared necessary to have read the manual step-by-step from page one to 33 before setting-up the Mercury line. The result was that I was forced to spend money on the telephone rewarding Amstrad for writing an incomprehensible and impossible manual. So I'll make a plea to electronic hardware and software companies. Technical support has to be paid for, and if the cost isn't covered in the price of a product, by all means use premium-rate numbers for recouping expenses. Most customers won't mind spending a little extra on a premium-rate telephone call. But please give the customer a chance. Write manuals that are comprehensible in the first place. Electronics companies shouldn't be rewarded for writing poor manuals. I'll be writing to Alan Sugar asking him to invest my Pounds 2.40 in new instructions.</p>

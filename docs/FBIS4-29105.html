			<p>BFN     [Text] A team, which includes Governor Ota, that is  visiting the United States to demand a resolution on the issues  of bases in Okinawa ended its activities in Hawaii on the  morning of 12 June (at dawn on 13 June, Japan time) and is  heading for the U.S. mainland. The team extracted from the  commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii a partial  abolishment of the training across Okinawa Prefecture's Route  104. On the issue of the naval port in Naha, rough going was  indicated for specifying a place to move it. The team is facing  bright prospects and thick walls. The stage for negotiations is  moving to Washington, where attention is focusing on whether the  team will be able to gain concrete answers from the State and  Defense Departments and whether its members will be able to gain  support from Congress.    The U.S. Military has continually emphasized its  contribution  to the security of Asia and its consideration for the lives of  residents. The team does not wish to interpret as lip service  the declaration of former Marine Commandant Stackpole, attached  to the Pacific Fleet at Okinawa, that there would be a partial  abolition of training across Route 104.    Whether the "partial abolition" of training becomes a step  to  the total abolition of the training that crosses Route 104 and  whether it will become linked to an abolition of gun platforms  near residential areas, self-control over their use, and a  decrease in the frequency of training are all specific points  that need to be ascertained through talks with high-ranking  government officials.    Concerning the reversion of the naval port in Naha, while it  has become a formal topic for the Japan-U.S. joint committee,  the team's having received the explanation that the endeavor is  facing difficulties shows that one cannot view with optimism the  governor's negotiations in Washington.    The team visiting the United States has three important  proposals, including the return of Yomitan Airfield. The team  will also ask for items on which Japan and the United States  have not yet agreed: Futenma Airfield, the Okuma Recreation  Center, and the return and/or reduction of water and air areas.  Their diplomatic skill will be called into question on whether  a hole can be opened in the thick walls of the U.S. side.    The group learned from the Hawaiian State Government the  details on how the Kahorawe [name as received] Island training  ground used for live-firing exercises by the U.S. Navy and  Marines and in Rimpac exercises was returned through the union  of the residents' movement, the state government, and the  state's congressmen. On the basis of special U.S. Congress  legislation, the state and the military authorities reportedly  agreed on a plan to dispose of unexploded bombs and use the  site. The legislation now before the Diet for the transfer of  specified facilities from the military appears realistic. From  the record of Kahorawe's return, Governor Ota's team obtained  information for promoting the future return of the bases and use  of the sites.</p>

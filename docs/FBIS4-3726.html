			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has revoked licenses of 7,500 unqualified overseas-funded  enterprises over the past 14 years, averaging 535 a year.    This figure accounts for 4.3 percent of the total  overseas-funded enterprises in the country, according to a  recent national work meeting on the management of registered  foreign-funded enterprises in this capital of Anhui Province.    "In line with international conventions, we will fully  support enterprises with favorable economic results and have to  cancel or revoke licenses for those unable to resolve troubles  so as to ensure healthy development of the whole range of  foreign-funded enterprises," an official of the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce said.    China has 175,000 registered foreign-funded enterprises so  far, most of which are profitable. The number of countries and  regions making investment in the country rose from 122 in 1992  to 146 last year.    According to the official, there are still a few enterprises  which have gone through necessary formalities but have not made  any investment on the mainland at all; are engaged in smuggling,  speculation and profiteering; have promoted the sales of  inferior equipment at a high price; have existed in name only;  or fell into general debility.    Analyzing why such practices persist, the official said,  "the  main cause was that, for a long period of time, it was foreign  business people that selected us as partners, and some places  paid attention only to the numbers of foreign-funded projects  and not the quality."    He stressed that this tendency must be checked and called on  localities to study and solve the issue.    A survey shows that China approved of the establishment of  85,000 overseas-funded enterprises last year, an increase of 180  percent over the previous year.    Foreign business people have shown more interest in  investing  in coastal, interior and border areas including Jiangsu, Anhui,  Shandong, Sichuan, Hubei, Henan and Heilongjiang Provinces.</p>

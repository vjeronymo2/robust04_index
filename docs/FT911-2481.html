			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Banco Hispano sells stake BANCO HISPANO Americano, one of Spain's large commercial banks, has taken a further step towards protecting itself from unfriendly takeovers with the agreed purchase of 2.76 per cent of its capital by the Mexican group, Bailleres, which has interests in industry and retailing. Banco Hispano also recently announced that it hoped to conclude an asset swap with Banco di Roma later this year, which would result in each bankholding some 5 per cent of the other.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Investors, donors ponder Indonesia's new cabinet: President Suharto is steering the ship of state on a more anti-western course MEMBERS of the new Indonesian cabinet, named last week, will by now be hunched over desks charting the country's course for the next five years. They will be aware of anxious people - foreign donors, local businessmen, international investors - looking on, following the replacement of the three ministers who had, since 1988, steered the country's economy. President Suharto ditched Mr Radius Prawiro, Mr JB Sumarlin and Mr Adrianus Mooy. All three were western-educated, liked by donors and Christian, notable in a country with an 87 per cent Moslem population. Their removal has resulted in some bitter reaction. 'It reflects a more basic anti-western stance,' says the head of one foreign broking house in Jakarta. 'Those who favoured reform have not been carried over.' His concern is that a shift towards a more Moslem oriented cabinet may signal a slowing of economic deregulation and antipathy toward the World Bank and other western advisers. Economic policy since the early 1980s has been to exploit Indonesia's comparative advantage of cheap labour to fuel an export-driven economy. In its place, the government might turn to import substitution and the nurturing of higher-technology industries through protection and state subsidies. But a dramatic change in policy is unlikely. As Mr Manu Bhaskaran, economic research director of Crosby Securities, explains, incoming ministers responsible for the economy maintain 'a sensible approach to economic reform.' 'Last year Saleh Afiff (the new co-ordinating minister for the economy) called vigorously for reform in areas which were considered taboo, such as agriculture and food processing. These are the reforms foreign investors and donors would like to see,' he says. The rumoured antipathy of the new economic ministers to foreign advisers is also overstated. Mr Mar'ie Muhammed, the finance minister, in his previous post as director-general of tax took advice from, among others, the US Internal Revenue Service. Mr Sudradjat Djiwandono, the central bank governor with ministerial status, is typical of Indonesia's economic technocrats. Educated in the US, he is an economist by training and a former assistant to the co-ordinating minister of economics. While the stated aims of the three men to continue their predecessors' policies should comfort reformers, the balance of the overall cabinet has shifted toward those espousing greater state intervention. Mr Afiff's desire to deregulate the agro-sectors has been made more difficult by the transformation of the National Logistics Agency (Bulog) - which regulates key commodities such as rice, flour, sugar, palm oil and cement - into a full ministry. He must also face fierce lobbying from private companies which have virtual monopolies, granted by government, in the distribution and processing of many commodities. Indeed, requests for favours from politically well-connected companies are likely to increase with President Suharto entering possibly his last term in office. This could place the economic ministers under intolerable pressure. And as one foreign adviser notes, if faced with a barrage of demands from vested interests, the ministers may opt to 'roll over, play dead and not move forward on economic reform.' Playing dead, however, may be difficult given the presence of donor agencies, which last year pledged Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.36bn) and are increasingly concerned at the close relationship between government and some private companies. As a result, programmes which should receive donor support, such as participation of private companies in power generation, are already becoming matters of dispute. Donor officials disapprove of the involvement of the Bimantara Group, led by President Suharto's second son, in the Dollars 4bn Paiton power project and the granting of a monopoly in power supply to five industrial estates in Jakarta to a group of well-connected businessmen. For ministers, however, to take the side of foreigners against domestic companies can be easily portrayed as betraying national interests. Ministers may be preoccupied with fending off criticism to the detriment of policy making, a situation which bedevilled the last administration in its final two years. As they take up office, therefore, the biggest challenge facing Messrs Afiff, Muhammed and Djiwandono is to keep economic decisions free of politics.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Damovski: "Serbian Political </F> Branch Office in Macedonia"]    [Text] After a brief "consolidation of its ranks," the new  leadership of the Democratic Party of Serbs [DPS] in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], finally  came out in public at a news conference for the Macedonian media  (the first one was organized only for reporters of the press of  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). And all of a sudden, in  conformity with a political beginning aimed at impressing its  membership that it is "resolute in the struggle for the rights  of the disadvantaged Serbs in Macedonia," we heard accusations  and threats from the new DPS leadership.    At the news conference held two days ago by the DPS leaders  there was an overwhelming wish to be provocative, to express  hatred for the country where they live and work (except for  party president Dragisa Miletic, who works in Pristina). The  Serbian media and the DPS leaders in Macedonia are consistent in  using the temporary name of Macedonia in the United Nations.  For them, the only legitimate president of the Serbian people  everywhere is Slobodan Milosevic. In the event of war on the  territory of Macedonia the DPS would call for the defense of  only Serbian property and the orthodox brothers "who deserve  it." Moreover, in accordance with its ambition to be the only  legitimate representative of the interests of the Serbian  national minority in Macedonia, the DPS has already studied the  possible reaction of the Serbs in the country to possible NATO  air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- attacks against the U.S.  troops in the state. "The problem of reintroducing the Serbs  and Montenegrins in the Constitution is burning slowly, but it  could easily become a conflagration that could consume all of  us." This was the first threat conveyed by the DPS to the  Macedonian public. The second went like this: "We shall wait a  while longer, and then the people will have to decide what  happens then." Once again in the name of the people, one of the  DPS hawks Stojan Trajkovic said: "Any use of the territory for  intervention in former Bosnia-Herzegovina will be lethal for the  FYR Macedonia."    Well-known threats, well-known propositions and the twisting  of facts... but in the spirit of the chosen recipe of the policy  of our northern neighbor -- Serbia. There was a short-lived  shift of the party's policy to take account of the actual  situation in the country where this political subject is  registered, and then the activities resulted in personnel  changes and shifts in the party's course toward northern  political orientations. The previous DPS leadership succeeded  in recognizing the peril of that orientation and changed its  course and behavior in relation to the Macedonian authorities.  The new leadership is again at the beginning of the road that  repeatedly coincides, not by chance, with the new settlements of  the Balkan situation. Whenever a settlement seemed near, one of  the main roles was always played by the political leadership of  Serbia which, despite the public manifestations of the DPS,  apparently plays an important role in all that. The aim, once  again, is very transparent and is to be expected from that type  of politician -- apprentices. The Greek blockade has nothing to  do with them, nor does the wish to destabilize Macedonia. For  them Macedonia is the FYR Macedonia, but parallel with that,  there is the strong wish to introduce Serbs and Montenegrins to  the constitution of a state by the name of the Republic of  Macedonia (although it is not yet clear whether as a national  minority, a nationality, or certainly, as a people). For them,  the fact that there are 300 U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means  that Macedonia is "a U.S. protectorate and its puppet state."    All this would be welcome in moments of appropriate  assistance to orthodox brothers in the "south Vardar regional  unit" and in the reestablishment of the "interrupted orthodox  vertical axis."    No matter where they may be on the territory of former  Yugoslavia the "emotional Serbian people" are sensitive to  injustice. The political leaders therefore have no choice.  Until then, the provocations and irritations of everybody's  emotions remain the main political strategy of these political  branch offices.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / White House quandary on Court post The White House is exploring ways of nominating Senator George Mitchell to the Supreme Court while retaining his services for the rest of the political year as Senate majority leader, in a move likely to face political opposition. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the president's legal counsel, said this was 'legally possible' but carefully added: 'Whether it would be politically possible, I don't know.' Justice Harry Blackmun, whose retirement was announced on Wednesday, is willing to stay on until the end of September, when the current Court term expires, or until a replacement is installed. Senator Mitchell last month said he would not seek re-election to the Senate in November. One option is to nominate Mr Mitchell, an indispensable congressional manager of the administration's domestic agenda, but to delay a confirmation vote by the full Senate until the last days of the legislative session in October. Another is to push through his confirmation earlier but for him to delay taking the oath of office as a Justice until after the autumn recess. An early warning of the arguments against such a move came in a New York Times editorial yesterday, which sniffed that 'a delayed appointment. . . suggests that the Court has a lower priority than the partisan needs of the White House.' It took President Bill Clinton nearly three painful months last year to come forward with the nomination of Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg to fill the previous Court vacancy. He is committed to a speedier process this time. Mr Mitchell, who said he would consider any offer to serve on the Court, should have few problems winning the endorsement of his colleagues, though the right wing will rake over his record. Though a lawyer by profession and a former federal judge, he would be the first practising politician to sit on the bench since the retirement in 1969 of former Chief Justice Earl Warren, who was previously governor of California. The potential political problems of his nomination, however, means that other candidates are under active consideration. Mr Bruce Babbitt quickly withdrew, saying he wanted to remain as secretary of the interior, but Judge Jose Cabranes from Connecticut and Mr Drew Days, now the solicitor general, have emerged as leading alternatives. Both have excellent legal reputations and both would add the ethnic diversity to the Court that Mr Clinton has pursued in other appointments. Judge Cabranes is of Hispanic origin, hitherto unrepresented on the highest bench, while Mr Days, previously law professor at Yale, is black and would balance the conservative judicial opinions of Justice Clarence Thomas. A third female Justice also remains a possibility, to join Justices Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor. The New York Times editorial yesterday particularly commended Ms Judith Kaye, chief New York State judge.</p>

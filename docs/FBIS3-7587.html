Shigetake Ogata, speaking to the House of Representatives  Budget Committee, said that about 247,000 Korean residents are  Chongnyon members, including 56,000 in Chongnyon affiliates,  while 369,000 are members of the pro-Seoul Korean Residents  Union in Japan (Mindan). Ogata also said that 63,000 Korean  residents profess to be neutral.    According to the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau,  about  688,000 Koreans were living in Japan in 1993. The agency  determined the breakdown of statistics through figures provided  by the agency's offices in each prefecture.    Regarding the sending of money to North Korea by  pro-Pyongyang Korean residents, Ogata said that the residents  send the money through a number of routes, including trade  payments, remittances to relatives and friends in North Korea,  and joint business ventures, and donations to the Korean Workers  Party [Workers Party of Korea] and government organizations. He  added that some of the money, estimated to be between 60 billion  and 80 billion yen, is sent through banks or taken along by  residents visiting North Korea.    The issue of Korean residents sending money to North Korea  has gathered attention with increasing talk of economic  sanctions against Pyongyang for refusing to permit full  inspections of nuclear facilities suspected of being part of a  secret atomic weapons plan.</p>

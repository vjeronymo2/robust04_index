			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / MPs to censure Bank over BCCI: City criticised for failure to act against fraud as attacks on regulators mount THE BANK of England will face sharp criticism from an all-party House of Commons committee next week for failing to take prompt action over fraud at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The conclusions of the report, the second attack on City regulation by MPs expected within days, are also understood to imply criticism of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse for failing to identify the scale of fraud at BCCI before it collapsed in July 1991. The report, to be discussed today by the Commons' Treasury select committee, will follow a highly critical report on Monday from the Commons' social security committee on UK pensions industry and the late Robert Maxwell. That report will also criticise the City regulatory system and call for widespread changes to the law governing pensions. The MPs' criticisms of the Bank of England are likely to increase pressure on the government to help victims of BCCI's closure. Ministers are understood largely to have escaped blame in the draft report. However, one Labour MP on the committee - Mr Brian Sedgemore - is pushing for amendments blaming Mr John Major for not taking action earlier. Mr Sedgemore contends that, as chancellor at the time, Mr Major should have acted when the Bank of England received reports of 'false or deceitful' practices at BCCI as early as April 1990. Mr Sedgemore is threatening to vote against the report for being too lenient on the government. He has prepared extensive amendments, in effect amounting to a separate report, which he is prepared to publish. Separately, the Treasury confirmed yesterday that Lord Justice Bingham's report into BCCI, set up by the government, will not be ready before a possible April 9 election. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said last year he hoped that it would be published before the election. This now seems highly unlikely. A Treasury official said the Bingham report, which is expected to examine Mr Major's role in the affair, is likely to be released in 'spring or early summer, it is hoped'. The Treasury committee's report is expected to reflect serious concern that the Bank of England failed to act swiftly enough over BCCI. In evidence to the committee, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, said that sufficient evidence of fraud to justify revoking BCCI's banking licence did not emerge until 1991. The committee also heard from Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of banking supervision. In particular, the MPs are expected to question the effectiveness with which the Bank exercised its regulatory functions - a lapse which led to big losses for many depositors and created a political storm. Mr Leigh-Pemberton told MPs how the Bank had received a Price Waterhouse report in April 1990 saying some accounting transactions at BCCI 'had been either false or deceitful'. This report was followed by a shake-up at BCCI and a restructuring of its balance sheet. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he had talked to Mr Major, as chancellor, about the restructuring but not the contents of the April 1990 report. He claimed that hard evidence of massive and widespread fraud needed to justify the swoop to close BCCI was obtained only after a follow-up report by Price Waterhouse was delivered to the Bank in June 1991. The MPs' report is written in temperate language, reflecting the caution of Mr Terence Higgins, their Tory chairman, but its criticism of the Bank of England is said to be clear cut.</p>

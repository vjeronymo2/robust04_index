			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Rival to BT wins national licence NATIONAL NETWORK, a private UK telecommunications operator based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, is to receive a full domestic telecommunications licence from the Department of Trade and Industry, putting it in direct competition with BT and Mercury. It is the first important implementation of the government's policy of liberating the domestic market further. National, which already provides a telephone service over the Post Office's internal network, expects to take about 4 per cent of the UK market by the end of 1996. The company plans to invest about Pounds 150m in the next few years to build up its own fibre-optic network, the first phase of which may be completed by the end of 1994. National uses the Post Office network, the UK's biggest private network, to connect callers to about 40 countries at rates that are up to 30 per cent below BT's and 15 per cent below Mercury's. Its services have however been restricted to large companies with substantial telecoms traffic. That is because the lack of a full domestic licence has meant that customers have had to be connected to its network by private lines installed by BT. The domestic operator licence will enable National to extend its service to smaller customers by reducing the cost of signing up for its services and making them more quickly available. Mr Michael Davis, National's chairman and majority shareholder said: 'The government (has) put National Network on an equal footing with BT and Mercury domestically.' National has yet to obtain a full international licence. It offers services to North America and Japan but not to the Continent, for example.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aharon Barne'a from Oman] </F>   [Text] Addressing the multilateral water talks yesterday,  Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin-'Alawi said that it is time to  stop emphasizing the very fact that the conference is being held  and to start acting. Thus, a mere few hours later, the Israeli  delegation and the Omanis reached an agreement -- the first of  its kind -- on regional Omani-Israeli cooperation in solar  energy development. Israeli experts will visit an Omani solar  energy center in about two weeks, and Omani solar energy experts  will visit Israel several weeks later to promote the issue.  Thus, Omani-Israeli cooperation on solar energy is to be  launched in the coming weeks.    So far, all the Israeli proposals at the multilateral talks  have been submitted through third parties, but today Israel  itself will submit a proposal on a project for sea water  desalination for small towns.</p>

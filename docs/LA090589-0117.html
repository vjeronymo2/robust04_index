			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 'BIZARRE' WOMAN DIES IN CUSTODY  </P> <P> A woman who struggled with police while being taken into custody for a mental  evaluation collapsed at the Van Nuys Jail and later died at a hospital,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old woman's name and hometown were not released pending  notification of relatives, Detective Ron Karlson said. Los Angeles police  subdued the woman after being summoned to the 12700 block of Mercer Street in  Pacoima at 2:30 p.m. Monday, Karlson said. Officers were called by paramedics  who had responded to a report of a woman acting "bizarre" and falling on the  street, Karlson said.  </P> <P> Four officers restrained the struggling woman and handcuffed her as she was  taken into custody for a mental evaluation, Karlson said.  </P> <P> She was taken first by ambulance to Olive View Medical Center for psychiatric  evaluation, but before she was admitted police determined that she had several  outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrants and she was then taken to the jail.  While being booked, the woman collapsed and stopped breathing, Karlson said.  </P> <P> The jail doctor attempted to revive her and paramedics took her to Valley  Hospital Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead at 4:27 p.m., Karlson  said. The cause of death was unknown.  </P></p>

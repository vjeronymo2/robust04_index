			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Dollar and sterling hit by poor US jobs data: Fed funds rate cut - Economy weaker than expected THE DOLLAR and sterling came under renewed selling pressure yesterday after worse-than-expected US employment figures indicated that the economy was far weaker than thought. After the news that US non-farm payrolls had plunged by 83,000 in August, the Federal Reserve further relaxed monetary policy by signalling a cut of 1/4 point to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate, at which US banks lend to each other. The jobs data reversed the revival of the dollar and sterling which had followed the UK government's decision on Thursday to borrow Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.27bn) of foreign currencies in the coming months and sell them for pounds. The dollar yesterday fell by nearly 4 pfennigs in the space of an hour, hitting DM1.3940 at one point before recovering to close at DM1.4030 in London, nearly a pfennig down on the day. In New York, it closed at DM1.4017. Sterling lost most of the gains it had made in the previous 24 hours to close unchanged in London at DM2.80, a level it maintained in New York. The payroll report showed that the US economy is in a worse state than had been expected and was seen last night as an embarrassment to President George Bush's administration. Analysts had been expecting employment in the US to rise by about 150,000 last month. The news was particularly gloomy because it incorporated the benefits of the US government's summer jobs programme, without which employment would have fallen by 183,000. 'The report is an across-the-board disaster', said Mr Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 'It raises the possibility that the economy may be slipping into another decline.' The cut in the Fed funds rate was the first reduction in US interest rates since July, when the US central bank cut both the discount rate and the Fed funds rate by  1/2 point. The Fed funds rate sets the level of short-term interest rates throughout the country but is less influential than the discount rate. The UK government's large foreign currency borrowing plan was intended to protect sterling against a cut in US interest rates as well as against uncertainty within the European exchange rate mechanism in the run-up to the September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The Fed has lowered short-term interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since the recession began in the summer of 1990. Although these rate cuts have had little impact on the economy, they have helped to depress the dollar. With official short-term interest rates in Germany at 9.75 per cent, yesterday's move seems set to increase the incentive for investors to move funds into D-Marks from the dollar. The US employment figures also checked the sharp rise in equities that followed the announcement of the British foreign borrowing plans. After rising by 68.9 on Thursday, the FT-SE 100 index closed down 19.7 at 2,362.2. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.27 to 3,281.93. The Bush administration drew some comfort from a slight decline in the unemployment rate, to 7.6 per cent compared with 7.7 per cent in July, even though this reflected the impact of the summer jobs programme on teenage unemployment.

			<p>SUMMARY                                    Pyongyang's carefully calibrated media campaign against  Washington and Seoul over the nuclear issue seems designed to  convey the impression that while the North Korean leadership is  prepared to deal with the full consequences of its refusal to  abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), it still  hopes for a negotiated settlement of the nuclear inspection  issue.                                END SUMMARY        A measure of rhetorical restraint was evident in a 28 March  Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, the first authoritative  statement observed to have been carried by Pyongyang media on the  reported U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the South  (Pyongyang radio, 28 March).  The statement "sternly denounced"  the prospective shipment of Patriots to South Korea, calling it a  "dangerous" and "irrational" military action.  Seeking to refute  the U.S. assertion that the Patriot is a defensive weapon, the  statement contended that the topography of the Korean peninsula  enables the missile to be used to strike any target in the North  with a change of its "warhead" and that it could be used for a  preemptive strike on the DPRK.  Nevertheless, the statement fell  short of an ultimatum and warned only of unspecified "grave  consequences" while calling on Washington to give the issue  "profound and deliberate consideration."         The 28 March statement was in sharp contrast to Pyongyang's  earlier nonauthoritative pronouncements, which the North Korean  leadership has used for its more vituperative attacks.  The  shrillest of these pronouncements, carried by Pyongyang radio on  26 March, characterized the reported U.S. plan to resume Team  Spirit and deploy the Patriot missiles as actions that are  "dangerous in the extreme" and as moves that could bring on "a  catastrophic crisis."  It accused Washington of "frantically"  attempting to "isolate and crush" the DPRK.  Similarly, a 26  March Pyongyang radio commentary described U.S. plans to deploy  the missiles as "sinister" and charged that there is a U.S.  contingency plan to mobilize "two marine divisions, more than 200  warships, and over 1,600 planes" from the U.S. mainland to Korea  in case of war, and claimed that the carrier Carl Vinson and 30  other ships have already been deployed "near" the Korean waters.  The commentary warned that while Pyongyang does not want war, it  is "by no means afraid of war," and went on to liken an attempt  to "swallow" North Korea to an attempt to "break a boulder" with  "a rotten egg."        Harsh as these pronouncements may sound, the North seems to be  holding back bigger ammunition in its rhetorical arsenal.  For  instance, North Korean media have not been observed to repeat  once-standard phrases such as "the U.S. imperialists are the  sworn enemy with whom the Korean people cannot live under the  same sky," "the Korean people will certainly make the enemy pay a  thousand-fold for the blood shed by fellow countrymen at the  hands of the enemy," and "shameful and humiliating defeat to the  aggressors."  Such expressions surfaced briefly after the North  Korean withdrawal from the NPT last year (Pyongyang radio, 17  March 1993; KCNA, 13 May 1993).         Talks With U.S. Pyongyang also seems to be seeking to  foster the impression that it is interested in somehow preserving  dialogue with the United States.  For example, the 28 March  Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, by contending that the  introduction of the Patriots would violate last June's DPRK-U.S.  joint statement, also seemed to imply that Pyongyang still  regards itself and Washington as bound by the statement's  principles that have served as the basis for further Washington-  Pyongyang dialogue.  Further signaling Pyongyang's lingering  interest in pursuing dialogue with Washington, the spokesman's  statement, by accusing the South Korean government of trying to  "frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks," intimated that resumption of the  talks is a goal to be striven for.         Although Pyongyang media have begun criticizing U.S.  Congressional and Administration leaders, such as Secretary of  State Christopher and Secretary of Defense Perry (KCNA, 24 March;  Pyongyang radio, 28 March), they have so far refrained from  personal attacks on President Clinton.  For instance, KCNA on 23  March used the proper title and name--"U.S. President Bill  Clinton"--in criticizing the President's decisions on Team Spirit  and the Patriots.         Talks With South     Pyongyang media treatment of South Korea  since the breakup of the inter-Korean talks on 19 March also  seemed designed to convey the impression that the North has not  totally ruled out dialogue with Seoul.  Pyongyang media have so  far withheld authoritative comment on South Korean Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae's recent remarks suggesting that the South  would view any attack by the North as "an opportunity" to reunify  the nation (Seoul Chungang Ilbo, 24 March).  Moreover, the 28  March Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement used the neutral  term "South Korean authorities" to refer to the ROK Government.  Although nonauthoritative pronouncements coming from the North  have continued to refer to ROK President Kim Yong-sam as a  "traitor" and "puppet," these pronouncements have also contained  the less pejorative references to "the Kim Yong-sam regime" and  "the Kim Yong-sam group" (KCNA, 25 March).  Even a statement  attributed to the League of Socialist Youth of Korea, a youth  organ traditionally among the most vituperative in its  denunciations of South Korean leaders, has mixed terms such as  "the South Korean authorities" and "the Kim Yong-sam group" with  the "puppet clique."         Implications     Pyongyang media's fine-tuned campaign against  Washington and Seoul suggests that, in spite of its recent  hardline stance on the nuclear inspection issue, the North Korean  regime finds it politic to convey the impression that it has not  ruled out a negotiated settlement of the issue.

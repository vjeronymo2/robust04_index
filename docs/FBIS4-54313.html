			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Talk: "Our Principled Stance on the Nuclear </F> Suspicion Commotions"]    [Text] The great leader comrade, in his answers to  questions raised by the director general of the PRENSA LATINA  News Agency of Cuba, has expounded extensively on our principled  stance on the nuclear suspicion commotions perpetrated by the  reactionaries at home and abroad while finding faults with us.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The  government of our Republic is striving consistently to realize  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It is a  consistent stand of our party and the government of our Republic  to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    We have already put forth on several occasions the most  reasonable and fair proposals and suggestions for the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and are doing all we  can for its realization. However, the United States and the  South Korean authorities are viciously clinging to the  anti-Republic commotions, finding fault with the fictitious  nuclear issue of ours. The nuclear suspicion commotions staged  by the United States and the South Korean authorities while  absurdly placing blame on us are an extremely unjust act that  will never get through anywhere.    Its purpose is to strengthen the country's power industry  base while speaking of our country's nuclear activities. Our  nuclear program is, to all intents and purposes, peaceful. We  have clarified more than once that we have neither any intention  nor capability to develop nuclear weapons. The whole world knows  about this. As a matter of fact, we feel no need to develop  them and, even if we were to manufacture one or two of them,  they would be useless.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by  the United States, not by us, which brought in the nuclear  weapons into South Korea and posed the nuclear threats against  us. As has already been exposed, the United States occupied  South Korea, a strategic point, and brought massive nuclear  weapons into South Korea from the mid-1950's to realize its  aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic. Since  then, South Korea has been turned into a nuclear advanced base  which is the largest in the Far East region in which some 1,000  U.S. made-nuclear weapons of various type are deployed. In  order to make a preemptive nuclear attack on us, extremely  dangerous nuclear war exercises, such as the Team Spirit joint  military exercise, are continuously staged in South Korea.    This shows that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  has  cropped up entirely due to the United States and the South  Korean authorities. This is also clear proof that the nuclear  threat comes from the South, not from the North. Regardless,  the United States is frenzied in the nuclear suspicion  commotions while placing blame on us. In recent years, the Cold  War has ended internationally and the non-aggression agreement  and the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula have been adopted between the North and South. Under  such conditions, the United States has lost any justification  for the presence of the nuclear weapons and aggressive troops in  South Korea. Therefore, the United States has conjured up a  fictitious nuclear suspicion about us and is deliberately  increasing the tension on the Korean peninsula to a critical  point so as to trump up an excuse for a continued occupation of  South Korea and in order to isolate [korip] and crush [apsal]  our republic which is advancing under the banner of socialism.  The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new war  provocation maneuvers, following the U.S. nuclear commotions, to  crush the fellow countrymen with swords borrowed from outside  forces so as to achieve reunification by prevailing over  communism.    The United States and the South Korean authorities, the ones  who brought the issue of nuclear threats on the Korean  peninsula, are perpetrating the nuclear suspicion commotions by  placing blame on us who have neither will nor capacity nor need  to develop nuclear weapons. This is an act like a thief turning  on the victim with a club and should never be tolerated.    Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has stemmed  from the United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK, it must  be resolved through dialogue between us and the United States.  The United States also admitted the need and negotiated with  the DPRK last year. The joint statement agreed upon and  published by both sides at the talks points out explicitly that  the United States should not pose nuclear threats against us;  that both countries should respect each other's sovereignty and  should not interfere in domestic affairs; and that they support  the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States  has overturned the agreements it reached with us and brought the  DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, driving the situation in our  country to extremity and setting even international  organizations in motion to put pressure upon us. This shows that  the United States is persistently adhering to the anti-Republic  maneuver even after the announcement of the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement.    However, pressure can never be a solution to the problem. It  is a miscalculation if it thinks that our people who regard  independence as their lifeblood, will be brought to their knees  by means of pressure and force. If the United States continues  to clamor for putting pressure on our republic, we will be  compelled to take due measures of self-defense to safeguard the  dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country.    Whether the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is  resolved  in a peaceful way or not depends entirely on the attitude of the  United States. If the United States sincerely wishes the  resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must  suspend the international pressure commotions against our  republic and take a sincere attitude towards the DPRK-U.S.  talks. International organizations must not comply with the  unjust demands of a big country, but abide by the principles of  justice and fairness to render contribution to the resolution of  the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula.</p>

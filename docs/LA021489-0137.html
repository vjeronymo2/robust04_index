			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> ESPERANZA GIRLS NO. 1 IN 4-A  </P> <P> In its first year in the 4-A division, Esperanza High School gained the top  seeding in the Southern Section girls' soccer playoffs.  </P> <P> Esperanza, 22-0-3 overall, is the only undefeated team in the 4-A division.  Last season, the Aztecs reached the final of the 3-A division before losing to  Buena, 2-0.  </P> <P> This season, Esperanza, which was moved up to the 4-A division along with the  rest of theEmpire League teams, has shown strong improvement in its offense,  while maintaining its tenacious defense.  </P> <P> But Esperanza, strong as it is, is in for a battle. No. 2 Capistrano Valley  (17-5-1), No. 3 Royal (18-1-2), No. 4 Mission Viejo (18-2-1) and No. 5 Simi  Valley (20-2-2) make this year's 4-A division the toughest in recent history.  </P> <P> While Esperanza might rank as the division's toughest defensive team -- the  Aztecs have shut out 18 opponents and allowed only seven goals this season --  Capistrano Valley is well-balanced. Royal, led by striker Tanya Schraml and  sweeper Stevie Campbell, is a finesse-oriented team, while Mission Viejo has  won the past three 4-A championships.  </P> <P> Agoura (20-0), the Southern Section 2-A champion the past three years, is  considered by many to be almost unbeatable this season. But if any team has a  shot, it could be No. 2 Mater Dei (17-4-2).  </P> <P> Other top 10 3-A teams include No. 5 La Habra (12-3-4) and No. 6 Canyon  (15-2-3).  </P> <P> In the 2-A division, No. 5 Valencia (14-6-0) is the only Orange County team in  the top 10.  </P> <P> In the 1-A division, only two Orange County teams -- Capistrano Valley  Christian and Santa Margarita -- are involved, and both must play wild-card  matches Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] We reported in our 26 February issue, based on a  report filed by the Noyan Tapan news agency, that "the French  authorities officially applied to the Armenian embassy in Paris  with two questions: a) Is Armenia prepared to accept Simon  Nairian? b) Is Armenia prepared to offer him permanent  residence?" Noyan Tapan picked up this news from the Committee  for the Defense of Armenian Political Prisoners. A member of  that committee, Armenian Supreme Council Deputy Aleksandr  Manucharyan, rushed to gather signatures in parliament to appeal  to the Armenian president to grant citizenship to one of the  principal figures of tragic incident at Orly airport in Paris in  1983. Nairian is now completing the last weeks of his 15-year  sentence in a French prison. Manucharyan's initiative is based  on the premise that "if Armenian citizenship is not granted to  Nairian, after he is released he will be turned over to Turkish  authorities who will definitely hang him." Nairian is a citizen  of Turkey where he has been condemned to death in absentia.  However, when our correspondent in Paris contacted the Armenian  embassy in France to verify these facts he was given an  ambiguous answer. He was told that neither the French  authorities nor any official person has come to them with any  such problem and that they consider the uproar that has been  raised in Armenia a tempest in a teacup. What remains unanswered  is from where the Committee for the Defense of Armenian  Political Prisoners picked up this information and what basis it  has for its verity.</p>

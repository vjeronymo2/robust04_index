			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market down after US labour contracts agreed A POTENTIALLY huge disruption to the aluminium market was removed yesterday when the Aluminium Company of America, the world's biggest producer, and Reynolds Metals, the third biggest, agreed new three-year contracts with unions at their US plants. Between them Alcoa and Reynolds have the capacity to supply nearly 3m tonnes of primary aluminium, or 20 per cent of the western world's output. And so, even though agreement was widely anticipated, aluminium prices weakened after the announcement yesterday. On the London Metal Exchange, aluminium for delivery in three months ended Dollars 6.50 a tonne down at Dollars 1,143.75. Agreement was reached four hours after the previous 36-month contract, which was extended for a year, ran out at midnight on Monday. Alcoa said the new contract included a 25-cent increase in basic hourly wage rates, at present ranging between Dollars 11.90 and Dollars 15.39, from June 7 and an additional 25 cents an hour in June 1995. For those on the lowest rate this amounts to a 4.2 per cent increase over the three years and for those on the highest rate one of 3.25 per cent. Negotiations took place at a time when aluminium prices were near their lowest ever in real terms, forced down by a sharp increase in net imports from the former Soviet Union and the reluctance of western producers to make the production cuts necessary to reduce record stocks.</p>

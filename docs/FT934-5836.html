			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Fashion: To hell with colour - black is back / Brenda Polan dresses down - deliciously - in every woman's favourite fashion classic It was the kind of party which, a year ago, would have been a raucous festival of colour: bright satin, aggressive taffeta, dazzling lame. It would have been cheerful with feathers, beads, diamante buttons and flamboyant bows. This year, however, the room was a haven of sombre sobriety. It was difficult, on first entering, to distinguish the black-clad men from the black-clad women. Only the flashes of female flesh, the bare arms, shoulders and nearly-bare bosoms which glowed under the dimmed lights, offered a few clues. This sea of darkness elicited a strangely mixed response: disappointment that the eye-stimulation offered by a rich variety of colour and texture was missing; and a relaxing sense of familiarity and safety. This, after all, was just the way it was in the mid and early 1980s before designers 'rediscovered' colour. Those, of course, were the days when most of us wore little else but black at any time of the day, a phenomenon jointly induced by the Milanese designers with their passion for an urban uniform of black, white and grey and the new wave of Japanese designers with their bag-lady, post-holocaust monochrome palette. Fashion victims of the time would confess to having inadvertently bought the same black jacket twice, to having another eight similar ones in their wardrobes and to being made nervous by the sight of anyone wearing something colourful. Men and mothers got very depressed at what they perceived as a morose and deliberately disfiguring uniform. For, in our culture, black clothing carries deep-seated associations of loss and self-denial, mourning, guilt, gloom, sorrow, sin and death. It is the non-colour worn by nuns and widows, celibate priests, ascetic scholars, avenging goddesses and cauldron-peering witches, by the Furies, Hamlet, Queen Victoria - and Dracula. So whenever it is worn by someone who falls into none of those categories, it has, traditionally, a perverse, dramatic effect. Beau Brummell's falling out with the Prince Regent may have degenerated into name-calling but it began as a clash of styles when Brummell discovered he was bored with jewel-coloured brocades and embroidered velvets and got himself up in sober black, relieved only by a simple white stock. The entrance he consequently made has, as he might have wished, reverberated through history. It was the start of an unstoppable revolution in men's clothing and the Prince's subsequent temper tantrum only made it more likely. On women, particularly young women, the dramatic effect is further heightened. Traditionally, as the debutantes presented at Queen Charlotte's Ball can testify, white and its pastel near-neighbours are the appropriate colours for maidens. White is the colour of purity and innocence, simplicity and hope. Black, its opposite, manages to imply impurity, experience, sophistication and, if not cynicism, then knowingness. It was only in the early years of the century that it became permissible for a woman to wear black for evening glamour rather than because she was in mourning - and even then, if she was not an actress, she had better be married. This was a proviso which operated even when Coco Chanel introduced the first official Little Black Dress in 1923. It was very much a grown-up's dress, a dress worn by a woman of the world with a long sautoir of pearls and a cigarette in a holder. So much of recent fashion history is a matter of Chanel inventing and Yves Saint Laurent revising that it is hardly surprising that, the LBD having been reworked by every couturier in between, it was young Yves who gave it new life in the shape of the Smoking, a dress which mimicked the lines and satin revers of the gentleman's tuxedo. Simultaneously the last of the exclusion clauses became inoperative. The self-dramatisation of Beatnik black had deliberately set out to undermine all kinds of conventional ideas about dress. The young women of the 1960s loved it for its moodiness, its hint of threat and danger, the fact that it shocked their mothers. They embraced Saint Laurent's Beat leathers and black Smoking with equal passion. However, shock value is easily attenuated by familiarity. In the last 30 years the LBD has become a staple of most women's wardrobes not because of its drama but because of its lack of it. It is the equivalent of the man's evening suit. In it, a woman feels secure in the knowledge that she is appropriately dressed. She will never look as if she has tried too hard - much worse than looking as if she hasn't tried at all. Unless the LBD in question is particularly extravagant in style, she will never look dated and, more important, she will never look like mutton dressed as lamb, a serious hazard when fashions in eveningwear become glitzy, colourful and overtrimmed. So, at last week's party, among the LBDs, the Smokings, the black palazzo pyjama suits, the black all-in-ones and the black velvet Biba knock-offs, regret and disappointment were fleeting. Gratitude and relief will last a lot longer. My escort, an amateur sociologist given to sweeping interpretations of fairly frivolous trends, observed portentously: 'Ah hah, sackcloth and ashes. The eighties are really over. They've all gone into mourning for their Chanel handbags. It's nineties self-denial.' No, no. It's nineties ease and comfort. You can only sustain high anxiety for short stretches of time and that is exactly what getting into a party dress used to be like. Me? I was wearing a black trouser suit over a black lace body. Wouldn't you have been?</p>

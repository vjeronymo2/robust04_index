			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / National Trust wins action over Pounds 20m fire THE National Trust yesterday won a High Court action against a building contractor over the fire in which 17th century Uppark House, West Sussex, was gutted in August 1989 when two workmen using an oxyacetylene torch on the roof went for a tea break. The workmen's employer, Haden Young, of Southgate, north London - part of the BICC group - admitted that the fire was caused by its negligence but denied liability for the restoration costs, which may run to Pounds 20m. Haden Young said that under the terms of contracts between itself, the trust and the main contractors - Midhurst and Fernhurst Builders - the trust was to bear the risk of loss and damage by fire. Mr Justice Otton said the contractual arrangements did not excuse Haden Young from the consequences of its negligence. He adjourned the assessment of damages, which are to be decided by a High Court official, and ordered Haden Young to pay the trust's costs. The trust's contract with Midhurst and Fernhurst had not provided for the trust to bear the fire risk, he said. Haden Young had not contracted with Midhurst and Fernhurst on the basis that the trust should bear that risk, and the trust had not agreed to insure anything for the benefit of Haden Young.</p>

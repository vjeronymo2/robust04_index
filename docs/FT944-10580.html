			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Kennedy clan bucks the trend While many Democrats were buried in Tuesday's landslide, Kennedy clan candidates proved resilient, writes Nancy Dunne. Senator Edward Kennedy, the family's patriarch, was in danger of losing his Senate seat for the first time since 1962 but ultimately won handily against a young, telegenic political neophyte, Mitt Romney, son of a former Michigan governor and presidential candidate, George Romney. Senator Kennedy was once hailed by President John Kennedy as the best politician in the family. Now aging and overweight, he rallied former aides and old friends to his standard and mortgaged his house to raise funds. Four members of the younger Kennedy generation also were in contests. Two ran and won seats in the US House of Representatives - Joseph Kennedy, son of the slain Robert, in Massachusetts, and Patrick Kennedy, son of Edward, in Rhode Island. Mark Shriver, son of the first Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy, won a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, daughter of Robert, is in a race for Maryland lieutenant governor that yesterday was too close to call.</p>

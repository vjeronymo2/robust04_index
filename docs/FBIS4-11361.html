			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] On Thursday, the Legislative Assembly approved 48  reforms to the Labor Code. The reforms were agreed upon during  the recent Forum for Economic and Social Consensus. It also  approved the creation of a Higher Council of Labor and the  prompt resumption of work at the Forum for Economic and Social  Consensus to deal with several pending issues.    Deputies of the Political and Labor and Social Welfare  Commissions issued the surprise approvals, which were in turn  approved by all political sectors represented at the Assembly.  The reforms recognize the existence of trade, business,  industrial, and independent contractor unions. The Ministry of  Labor will aid in forming these organizations. The unions will  be prohibited from denying nonunion workers the right to  employment, [forcibly] enrolling such workers in unions, or  refusing them the right to resign from unions. There will be  penalties for those who violate the code's provisions.    [San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish at 1800 GMT on 22  April reports that the National Peasant-Worker Union, UNOC,  expressed its disagreement with some of the reforms. UNOC  leaders believe "the Legislative Assembly has taken a step that  may not prove very positive for the working class in general."  They added that some of the reforms "are detrimental to worker  interests." The reforms, they say, were hastily approved to  meet "a requirement of the foreign trade authorities of the  United States."]</p>

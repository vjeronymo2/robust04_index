			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Medical devices listed in 21 CFR 2.125(e);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lubricants, coatings or cleaning fluids for electrical or electronic equipment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which contain class II substances for solvent purposes, but which contain no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other class II substances;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lubricants, coatings or cleaning fluids used for aircraft maintenance, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain class II substances for solvent purposes but which contain no other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II substances;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Mold release agents used in the production of plastic and elastomeric materials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which contain class II substances for solvent purposes but which contain no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other class II substances, and/or mold release agents that contain HCFC&hyph;22 as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant where evidence of good faith efforts to secure alternatives indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, other than a class I substance, there are no suitable alternatives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Spinnerette lubricants/cleaning sprays used in the production of synthetic fibers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which contain class II substances for solvent purposes and/or contain class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances for propellant purposes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Document preservation sprays which contain HCFC&hyph;141b as a solvent, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which contain no other class II substance; and/or which contain HCFC&hyph;22 as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant, but which contain no other class II substance and which are used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely on thick books, books with coated, dense or paper and tightly bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Portable fire extinguishing equipment sold to commercial users, owners of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine vessels or boats, and owners of noncommercial aircraft that contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II substance as a fire extinguishant where evidence of good faith efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to secure alternatives indicate that, other than a class I substance, there are no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable alternatives; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wasp and hornet sprays for use near high-tension power lines that contain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class II substance for solvent purposes only, but which contain no other class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not propose any exceptions for propellant uses of class II substances since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient propellant substitutes are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uses of HCFCs granted an exemption under section 610 based on the lack of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives will not face further restrictions under the SNAP program and authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 612, since the express purpose of the SNAP program is to restrict substitutes only in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases where other alternatives do exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Substitutes for Aerosols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The class I substances that are currently being used in aerosol applications include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and methyl chloroform (MCF). Class II substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are currently being used are HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;141b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has elected only to discuss alternatives for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, MCF,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b, and HCFC&hyph;141b. The uses for CFC&hyph;12 and CFC&hyph;114 are as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellants in medical applications and will not be discussed here because the substitutes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these applications are currently being developed and will have to undergo FDA review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Possible substitutes in this application include HFC&hyph;134a and HFC&hyph;227ea, which both have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low toxicity and zero ozone depletion potential. Regulatory approval for these compounds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, is contingent on FDA approval, which will likely occur over the next several years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's review of these substitutes will focus exclusively on environmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A variety of chemicals are currently being used or are being considered as substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for class I and II controlled substances used in non-inhalation aerosols and pressurized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers. The suitability of alternatives depends upon the product in which they are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these alternatives has its own physical and chemical characteristics which make it an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optimal choice for the product in question, in terms of such factors as solvency properties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellant characteristics, performance, cost, and environmental considerations. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency believes that the majority of the substitutes considered to replace the class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances used as propellants or solvents in aerosols and pressurized containers as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellants and solvents are currently available and easily integrated into existing aerosol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary substitutes for the propellant uses of CFC&hyph;11, HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Saturated hydrocarbons (C3&hyph;C6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Dimethyl ether. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HFCs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compressed gases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alternative processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

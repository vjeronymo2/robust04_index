			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux gains 5.4% Generale des Eaux the French utilities and communications group, yesterday posted net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 245m) for the first half of 1994, an increase of 5.4 per cent over the same period last year. The improvement was achieved on sales of FFr72.8bn, a rise of 2.9 per cent. According to the group, sales for the full year should rise by about 4 per cent above the FFr154bn recorded in 1993. Profits are expected to increase by a similar proportion, the company forecast. The strongest growth in sales during the first half came from foreign markets. Turnover outside France rose by 13.1 per cent to FFr20.8bn, reflecting strong demand for the company's core utilities activities. The company said that activity in the French property sector remained weak, claiming that 'the small number of new projects weighed heavily on turnover.' Losses at Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, the group's property division, prompted a fall of 23.8 per cent in operating profits to FFr1.8bn. Generale des Eaux said it continued to invest heavily in its telecommunications activities. These include its Cofira-SFR subsidiary, one of the two mobile telephone networks currently operating in France. Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the French life insurance company scheduled for privatisation by the end of this year, yesterday predicted it would generate full-year profits of FFr1.4bn, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. It said negotiations that had reopened with the French post office, over the continued sale of its products, would be completed by the end of November. For the first six months CNP's profits rose 15 per cent to FFr692m, CNP said. The developments are likely to have an important effect on details of the pricing of the shares in the privatisation. About FFr17bn of its FFr33bn in sales of life assurance to individuals came through the post office, where CNP has enjoyed nearly all of the sales of policies.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Three killed in Bosnia as UN relief convoy comes under fire TWO DANISH drivers and a local interpreter were killed yesterday, and four Danes wounded, when artillery fire hit their UN relief convoy in northern Bosnia, a UN spokesman said, Reuter reports from Geneva. The 12-truck convoy came under attack while unloading food supplies for the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj. Meanwhile, UN and European Community officers said there was still a remote chance that one or more of the three Italians, reported shot by gunmen while carrying food aid in central Bosnia on Saturday, might still be alive. Earlier, UN military officials at Vitez said three UN drivers had been killed and at least nine injured. In Sarajevo, two shells landed on a football match, killing at least 11 people and wounding about 100, city hospitals said. Sarajevo radio said three children had been killed earlier in Serb shelling, which continued throughout the night, but President Alija Izetbegovic and other local people ventured to the city's largest mosque for the traditional Moslem religious ceremony of Bajram. Anti-aircraft machine-gun fire hammered the city centre throughout the night. Dozens of people were reported killed and scores wounded in the weekend flare-up in Sarajevo. The radio also said the situation around the east Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde was still fraught, with Bosnian defence lines pierced by Serbs. Gorazde authorities appealed again for UN observers.</p>

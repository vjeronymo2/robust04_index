			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Germany's role As President Bill Clinton reminded Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn yesterday, Germany's partners have a right to expect an active and constructive role from united Germany on the world stage. The country's six-month presidency of the European Union which started this month will provide a test of whether it can live up to these expectations. The federal republic's geographical enlargement since its last European presidency in 1988 has increased its political weight, but has also made its internal problems more complex. When they scrutinise Europe's senior economic power, Germany's partners are sometimes not averse to employing double standards. Germany is frequently criticised for not making a weightier effort in international peace-keeping. But when Germany tries to take a stronger policy line, for example in its desire for a permanent seat on the UN security council, it faces suspicions that it is unduly flexing its muscles. An important milestone is expected today with a judgment from Germany's constitutional court clearing some legal obstacles on the use of Bundeswehr troops outside Nato. However, the electorate's aversion towards using German troops in foreign conflicts has been increased by the international community's failures over Bosnia. The troop deployment policy will remain highly restrained. In the EU presidency, punctuated by the October general election, caution will be a watchword. The German electorate favours European integration, but has become more hesitant about policies constraining national decision-making. Mr Kohl wants to widen the EU towards central and eastern Europe, yet he is well aware of the economic reasons ruling out rapid membership for these countries. Mr Kohl also has the responsibility of bringing the search for the next president of the European Commission to a successful conclusion. In trying to push through Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, Mr Kohl showed insufficient regard for his EU partners, but during the 10 days since the Corfu summit, he seems to have digested the lessons of that misjudgment. If Bonn can steer through agreement on a new candidate at or before Friday's summit in Brussels, that would be welcome evidence that Germany can adapt national goals in the interest of finding compromises. As the pivotal power in Europe, Germany has to accomplish the difficult balancing act of setting a lead for its EU partners and at the same time of taking account of their sensitivities towards a larger nation at the centre of Europe. Nearly four years after unification, Bonn has yet to come to terms with its new position. If it still leans more towards hesitancy than towards assertiveness, that is partly because Germany's partners and neighbours make clear that, on balance, they prefer the former to the latter.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOOVER DEFENSE SEEKS MISTRIAL OVER DOCUMENTS  </P> <P> Arguing that prosecutors deliberately withheld "critical" statements by J.  David (Jerry) Dominelli that could clear their client, lawyers for Nancy Hoover  Hunter on Wednesday asked a federal judge to dismiss the 234-count indictment  against her.  </P> <P> In a written motion filed with the court, Hoover's attorneys cited transcripts  of grand jury testimony and other documents in which Dominelli claimed that  Hunter, his former live-in companion, was unaware of the illegal activity that  led to the collapse of J. David &amp; Co., the La Jolla investment they  operated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyer Wants Dismissal  </P> <P> "The prosecutor's suppression of Dominelli's statements exonerating Hunter from  involvement in major aspects of his fraud mandates the dismissal of the  indictment," the lawyers said in the motion filed with U. S. District Judge  Earl B. Gilliam.  </P> <P> The lawyers, Richard Marmaro and Robert S. Brewer, based their motion on a  federal court rule known as the Brady Doctrine, which requires prosecutors to  turn over to defense attorneys all information favorable to the defendant,  generally as soon as the material is discovered.  </P> <P> Marmaro and Brewer have been engaged in an unusually bitter dispute with  Assistant U. S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo over the production of documents since before  the trial began nearly two months ago. The defense has made repeated motions  for a mistrial, all of which have been turned down by Gilliam.  </P> <P> "On May 18, 1989, the prosecutor, in one fell swoop, topped all of her previous  misconduct by disclosing heretofore suppressed Brady material which had been in  her possession for years," the lawyers said in their motion Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This is critical exculpatory material as well as evidence which could have  been used by the defense to effectively cross-examine several of the  government's witnesses who have already testified," the motion says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accused of Suppression  </P> <P> The lawyers said there is "no plausible explanation or justification" for the  prosecution's withholding of Dominelli's statements, and accused Hugo of  deliberately suppressing the information.  </P> <P> "She has stopped playing by the rules, and she has adopted a 'win at all costs'  strategy, trampling along the way on court orders, due process rights and  fundamental fairness," the motion says.  </P> <P> Gilliam is expected to hold a hearing on the motion today or Friday.  </P> <P> Because of a gag order imposed by Gilliam last week, Hugo was not permitted to  respond to reporters' questions about the new defense allegations.  </P> <P> Hunter is charged with 234 counts of fraud, conspiracy, income-tax evasion and  making false statements to a federal agent. The charges stem from her  involvement as a top executive in J. David &amp; Co., which collapsed in 1984  when nervous investors forced it into bankruptcy court. The ensuing  investigations revealed a huge Ponzi scheme, in which money from new clients  was used to pay off old investors and little or no trading was done.  </P> <P> Dominelli pleaded guilty to federal charges and is serving a 20-year prison  sentence.  </P> <P> Hunter's lawyers are attempting to convince the jury that Dominelli alone was  responsible for the $180-million fraud, and that Hunter was blinded by her love  for him.  </P> <P> At issue in the mistrial motion are six documents dated from Feb. 15, 1984, to  Jan. 28, 1988. The defense obtained the documents last week from the  prosecutors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dominelli Interview  </P> <P> In one of the documents, an FBI memorandum prepared April 16, 1985, an unnamed  agent summarized an interview he had with Dominelli.  </P> <P> "Dominelli advised that no one else involved in J. David &amp; Co. or J. David  Banking Co. Ltd. knew of the fact that the business was a sham, including . . .  Nancy Hoover or any of the salesmen. . . . He said no one ever knew of the  financial trouble the company was in until the end because he discussed it with  no one, including (Mark) Yarry, Hoover or anyone else," the memorandum says.  Yarry was another top J. David executive.  </P> <P> Another of the documents is a note written by Dominelli on Feb. 15, 1984, about  the time the firm was collapsing. Referring to Yarry and Hunter, Dominelli  said: "At no time were they aware of any actions I may have taken with regard  to client funds entrusted to me or any of my companies. . . . I assume full  responsibility for any and all discrepancies that may arise . . . ."  </P> <P> Also at issue is a transcript of Dominelli's testimony before a grand jury on  May 20, 1986. During that session, under questioning by Hugo, Dominelli said  that he, not Hunter, opened all the mail containing confirmation information  about trades he made through brokerage houses. Hunter, he said, opened all  other mail.  </P> <P> Hugo had claimed in her opening statement to the jury that Hunter opened all  the firm's mail.  </P> <P> "This testimony is a direct rebuttal of the government's theory," Hunter's  lawyers said in their motion.  </P> <P> They also alleged that Hugo was guilty of "blatant lies" when she said in court  more than a month ago that all so-called "Brady material" had been turned over  to the defense.  </P> <P> The trial continues today.  </P></p>

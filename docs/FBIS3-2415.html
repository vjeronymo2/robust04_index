			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 9 (AFP)--Governor Chris Patten  forged ahead Wednesday with his democratic reforms for Hong  Kong, tabling stage two of his proposals in the Legislative  Council despite a souring of Sino-British relations.    Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng told  legislators they should aim to adopt the reforms before July in  order to prepare for 1995 legislative polls -- the last before  Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. "The timetable is very  tight... We must press ahead as quickly as we possibly can," he  said.    China ruled out any more talks with Britain on Hong Kong's  political development after the Legislative Council, ignoring  its fierce protests, adopted the first stage of Patten's reforms  on February 23.    Stage two calls for broadening the voting franchise in 1995  so that all 2.7 million workers in Hong Kong will be able to  cast ballots for 30 seats reserved for special interest groups  and industrial sectors. It would also make directly-elected  district board members responsible for filling another 10 seats  in the 60-seat legislature -- in which only 20 seats will be  filled by direct election.    Shortly before Wednesday's tabling, China's de facto  consul-general in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, said they would make no  difference to the way China will govern the thriving territory  after 1997. "The Hong Kong British government can do whatever it  likes... It's not at all surprising," he said in Beijing.    Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren,  currently  visiting Hong Kong, said he wished the row over Hong Kong's  political future would not overshadow other 1997 issues. "Our  wish is to resume cooperation in other areas," he said.    The reforms' first stage, intended for local-level polls  later this year, abolished appointed seats on municipal councils  and district boards, lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to  18, and enshrined the principle of British-style, single-seat  constituencies.    Political analysts say Patten's reforms would tend to favor  liberal politicians who are openly critical of communist-party  rule in Beijing.    Wednesday's tabling came a day before the opening in the  Chinese capital of the annual National People's Congress, which  last year mounted fierce attacks on Patten's policies.</p>

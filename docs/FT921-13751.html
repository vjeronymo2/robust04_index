			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / A last chance to ring the changes: BT is about to come under the most intense scrutiny since privatisation Sir Bryan Carsberg has one final important task before he moves from the Office of Telecommunications to the Office of Fair Trading in June: to review BT's prices. The review, due to start on January 30, is perhaps the most important in his nearly eight years at the top of Oftel. This will be his final testament to the telecommunications industry - his chance to draw together all the regulatory techniques he has helped to pioneer since taking the job before BT's privatisation. It is not only BT's prices that will be under scrutiny, but also Sir Bryan's actions. This is partly because the review is taking place in the run-up to a general election. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, has called for cuts in BT's prices on the grounds that the company is earning excessive profits. Sir Bryan has always tried to avoid political pressure, arguing that economic and accountancy theory should determine regulatory policy. But keen political antennae will be required to steer a course between the competing interests of BT's customers, shareholders and rivals. Customers have an interest in lower prices, although there is a potential conflict between what business and residential customers want. Shareholders would like BT to keep its prices high. Rivals, such as Mercury Communications and the cable television companies which are moving into telephony, also have an interest in BT's prices staying high. The higher they are, the easier it is for other companies to compete. Sir Bryan may wish to correct a perception that he was too soft on BT the last time the company's prices were comprehensively reviewed in 1988. Since then, profits have increased sharply to Pounds 3.1bn last financial year. Sir Bryan has been criticised for failing to control its international prices until last year. The pressure on Sir Bryan to produce a regime that is seen to be fair is one of the reasons that the consultative document, which will kick off the review at the end of the month, will be more comprehensive than the one four years ago. It also explains why Sir Bryan, who in the past has been criticised for negotiating with BT behind closed doors, intends to be more open about how he reaches his conclusions. When BT was privatised in 1984, some ministers hoped that the need for price regulation would diminish as competition developed. But the group's continuing dominance of the industry - its market share is more than 90 per cent - means that few now doubt that its prices need to be controlled to protect customers from overcharging. BT claims that the prospect of more competition - more than 20 companies have asked for telecoms licences following the government's policy review last year - should mean it has more flexibility in how it prices its services. But even it accepts that price control will not be completely abandoned. Sir Bryan will have decide whether the company's profits are 'reasonable' before he decides how tightly BT's prices should be regulated. A Financial Times analysis last year concluded that BT could cut its charges to customers by Pounds 1bn and still earn profits comparable with telephone companies elsewhere and with the rest of British industry. But BT's head of UK regulation, Mr John Basgallop, says the company's profitability is within the range of what was expected when prices were last reviewed. Sir Bryan will also have to form a view on how much further BT, which has been cutting about 15,000 jobs a year, can continue to improve effidirector of public communications products, says: 'We would expect to be able to maintain similar improvements as in recent years.' But profits will not be the only determinant of price control. The UK approach to regulating privatised utilities is designed to give them an incentive to continue improving efficiency. Instead of limiting BT's profits to what is judged to be a reasonable level, in the past a price cap has been set which was expected to deliver acceptable profits if the company made reasonable progress to improve efficiency. This gave BT an incentive to over-achieve, because it kept any extra profits. Sir Bryan believes in this type of incentive regulation, but that does not mean that the current procedures will remain unchanged. Last year might have to pay back to customers part of any 'excess' profits. Apart from general principles, the review is expected to examine the following issues: Should the price cap be tightened or loosened? At present, BT is required to cut each year the price of a basket of its main domestic and international services by 6.25 per cent less than inflation. A regime designed to reduce the company's profitability substantially might tighten this to 10 per cent or more. But BT argues that a relaxation in the price cap is needed to maintain its profitability. Should there be a one-off cut in BT's prices? Such a move would bring down the company's profits immediately rather than phasing a reduction over several years. How much flexibility should BT have to move the prices of specific services within the overall basket? The group is currently prevented from increasing residential line rental charges by more than 2 per cent above inflation. BT wants greater flexibility in order to be able to compete more effectively against rivals. A Labour government might resist such a move on the grounds that it would make it more difficult for poorer households - for which the rental charge is a large portion of their bills - to afford a phone. How should new services such as call diversion and messaging be priced? Should BT be able to offer residential customers discounts if, for example, they rent more than one line? Should BT be restructured to help competition develop? The Liberal Democrats have argued that long-distance and local operations should be split in much the same way that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was broken up in 1984. Should the 'wholesale' prices BT charges its competitors for using parts of its network be cut? Mercury argues that, as retail prices come down, so should wholesale prices. Otherwise, competitors will face a squeeze on margins. Should prices vary with the amount BT invests? Some observers argue that the company does not need to keep prices high because investment has been falling. But BT says prices should reflect past, not future, investment. Should BT's core UK operations be 'ring-fenced' from new businesses into which it has been diversifying? Robert Fleming Securities estimates that BT has lost about Pounds 1bn as a result of overseas expansion. This figure is calculated by combining the reduction of the value of BT's investments with the cost of financing them. Should prices vary with quality of service? One idea floated in the past has been that, if quality falls, so should prices. But defining quality in a way that could fit into a mathematical formula might prove impossible. Whatever Sir Bryan decides, he will need the agreement of Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, to implement change. If he fails, he could refer the company to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Timing could be critical. If negotiations go well, a deal could be struck before Sir Bryan moves jobs. However, he is aware of the dangers of getting boxed in to an artificial timetable which could undermine his negotiating position. BT itself might feel it has something to gain by spinning out the negotiations until after Sir Bryan has left. But even if the review - which will heavily influence BT's prices, profits and business strategy for years to come - is not completed by June, most of the parameters will be set by then. Sir Bryan will go, but his shadow will linger.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TELEPHONE COMPANY PROFITABILITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US Regional Bell       Operating return     Net income     Cash surplus/ Operating                  on net            per line        (deficit) Companies              property, plant      (Dollars)        per line (RBOCs)             &amp; equipment (per cent)                   (Dollars)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ameritech                  16.6                76                7 Bell Atlantic              13.4                75               15 Bell South                 12.7                93                4 NYNEX                      10.2                62               (3) Pacific Telesis            13.0                73               19 Southwestern Bell          12.6                91               16 US West                    13.4                95              (22) Average                    13.1                81                5 Europe BT                         22.6               144               34 SIP                         6.1                15             (153) Telefonica                  8.2                59             (330) Japan NTT                         7.3                37                6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Data for last completed financial year, translated at recent exchange rates (Pounds = Dollars 1.760.

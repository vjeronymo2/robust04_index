			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Observer: Saintly work Here's a nice little earner. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has placed an ad to find a UK representative for St Helena, to be based in the UK. The salary, about Pounds 20,000 annually, is not inordinate wealth, but perhaps appropriate to the task of representing an island measuring just 10 miles by five miles. Apart from ensuring the Federal Bureau of Investigation properly conducts its analysis of Napoleon Bonaparte's nine hairs - the FBI has been searching for traces of arsenic in the remains of the island's most famous inhabitant  -and overseeing the recent introduction of television for the 5,700 inhabitants, the job might not be thought onerous, especially given the steady decline of the island's flax industry. Preference will be given to St Helenians, 'but consideration will be given to any appropriately qualified non-islander' in possession of financial/commercial experience and 'current knowledge of St Helenia' (sic).</p>

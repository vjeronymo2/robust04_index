An anonymous caller  threatened that Zilk will suffer the same fate as city  councillor Heinz Nittel, who was shot dead on 1 May 1981. Party  secretary Grete Dumser stated that the caller told the central  office of the SPOe that he wanted to "make a political  statement." He was then connected with the party's service  office where he voiced his threat. The state police have  initiated investigations.</p>

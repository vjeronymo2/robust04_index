			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Major may back target for training MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected to announce this week that more than 1m people should be training for the new work-based qualifications by 1995. He may also give the target government backing. Mr Major will be speaking at a conference on Thursday attended by 300 industrialists and organised by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. The council was set up five years ago to create National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) which would be applicable to all sectors of industry and commerce. The choice of 1m by the council is the first time a specific target has been set for the numbers of people expected to participate in NVQs. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, abandoned ambitious targets set for proportions of young workers by Sir Norman Fowler, his predecessor, after what is believed to have been the personal opposition of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister. The government, however, has given its support to similar but voluntary targets set last year by the Confederation of British Industry in consultation with other bodies including the Trades Union Congress. These include the attainment by 1997 of NVQs at level two, (the vocational equivalent of four GCSEs) by at least 80 per cent of 16-to-18-year-olds. The present figure is 45 per cent. The UK has the lowest proportion of 17-year-olds in education among its competitors even though the range of subjects covered by NVQs means that they are now available to about 40 per cent of the UK national workforce. But it is believed that fewer than 300,000 people are now involved in training leading to NVQs. Much of the workforce and industry are ignorant of NVQs, which are intended to provide a comprehensive and coherent framework for vocational qualification. At present most are for jobs below management level, but it is intended that the framework will extend to management and professional jobs. According to a survey published by the council, British workers are more receptive than ever to work-related qualifications. The council said that was a big improvement over previous studies, in which 40 per cent of workers said they could see no benefit in undertaking vocational qualifications.</p>

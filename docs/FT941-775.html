			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US adamant over worker rights talks The US and developing countries were yesterday on a collision course over Washington's demand for worker rights to go on the agenda for world trade talks. After again failing to win support for their cause at a meeting of top trade negotiators in Geneva, US officials said they would continue to press the issue when ministers from over 120 nations meet next month in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. This, many countries fear, could lead to a full-scale row at a meeting intended to underscore harmony and set the tone for increased global economic co-operation. The US wants wording in the draft ministerial declaration urging the new World Trade Organisation, which will succeed Gatt next year, to give 'early consideration' to the relationship between 'internationally recognised labour standards' and the world trading system. Barring a sudden change of heart before tomorrow, when negotiators meet formally to approve the Marrakesh documents, there will be no agreed declaration for endorsement by ministers.</p>

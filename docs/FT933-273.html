			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / French government considers publicy owned company requests The French government is considering requests from publicly owned companies for more than FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in new capital. In general it has resisted large injections of capital in an attempt to limit the budget deficit, targeted at FFr317bn this year. According to the Ministry of Transport, Air France, the loss-making airline, has requested about FFr5bn in recapitalisation, while Compagnie Generale de Maritime wants FFr500m. Aerospatiale, the aerospace group, said yesterday that it sought about FFr3bn to finance new programmes. Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer which is drawing up a restructuring plan, would not confirm it wanted FFr9bn.</p>

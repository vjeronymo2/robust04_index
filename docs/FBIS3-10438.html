			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] "Brazil's problem is not foreign enemies, the Cold  War, or internal ideologies but its ruling elites who are behind  the times and reactionary, and who at no time have concerned  themselves with Brazil's growth," PT President Luis Inacio Lula  da Silva said yesterday at a lunch for 170 businessmen at the  Brazil-Japan Chamber of Commerce. There will be no mention in  the PT's platform for governing of a moratorium on the external  debt. "New financing for the production sector will be assured  only if we renegotiate our debt," said PT Deputy Aloizio  Mercadante from Sao Paulo, at the lunch he attended with Lula.    Mercadante, who is also an economist, made it clear that the  party knows that a unilateral moratorium, should Lula become  president, would not help the country at all. Tapped by the PT  candidate to take the lead in drafting the economic plan for the  would-be administration, the congressman said that "the  moratorium is not a banner, but a political instrument."  According to him, although the question of a moratorium is  controversial, the platform will not deal with hypothetical  situations.  <H5>  Coordinator </H5>   Mercadante was assigned to present Lula's economic program  to  the businessmen. It is already known that the PT president was  extremely irritated by the preliminary proposals in the  platform, such as the debt moratorium, and decided that  Mercadante will be his strongman and economic spokesman in  coordinating the plan. The deputy's presence at yesterday's  lunch and his participation in the discussion served notice to  the party.    To Mercadante, the external debt issue is not the main item  on the internal agenda. However, that does not mean Brazil will  not demand more compatible terms of payment, and it will be  tough in negotiations with its creditors. "If it is compatible  with a resumption of growth, we will work out the debt payments  at a new level," he said. "It is not true that the entire  external debt is to be paid under the conditions in the loan  agreements," he argued. And he urged that dialogue and  credibility be the hallmarks of the negotiations.    The PT deputy also talked about Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso's economic plan. He said his party opposes it,  although it believes the fiscal adjustment is needed. And he  advocated a far-reaching tax reform. "Hardly any of the cuts in  public spending have actually been made, and the Social  Emergency Fund took money from education, social security, and  unemployment insurance." Meanwhile, the expenditures by the  judiciary and legislative branches have increased. "Fernando  Henrique has broken the force of the wind," he added.    As for the internal debt, Mercadante insisted that  "unilateral actions are not part of our scenario." According to  him, negotiations must be held to stretch out the terms of the  debt. "The states must respect the loan agreements and fulfill  them." In his opinion, Brazil will become modern not only by  opening up its markets, but by redefining public policies,  financing, and incentives to modernize and improve efficiency.  Economic stability and an end to inflation are vital. "Stability  is not easy to achieve, because you have to confront powerful  interests in business sectors that are accustomed to earning  without producing."</p>

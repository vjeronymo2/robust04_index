			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sanyo profits tumble 82.5% SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported an 82.5 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y3.34bn (Dollars 267m) in the half year to May. Sanyo blamed the sharp drop in its financial performance on weak economic conditions as well as on increased operating costs, rising research and development expenses and an increase in depreciation charges following a period of high capital investment. Consolidated sales fell by 1.7 per cent to Y737.9bn. Domestic fell by 0.2 per cent to Y448.7bn, while overseas were off by 4 per cent to Y289.2bn. Domestic sales of telephones and colour televisions rose, but those of camcorders, microwave ovens, refrigerators and vending machines declined. Sales of notebook computers in the US fell, while video recorder and camcorder sales in Europe were down. Net after-tax profits fell by 93.2 per cent to Y452m, amounting to 0.1 per cent of sales. Sanyo has said it would reduce its 30,000 workforce by 2,000 people in the next three years through attrition. On a parent company basis, Sanyo's performance was even more difficult. Sales dropped by 3.9 per cent to Y546.9bn, while the company lost Y6.1bn at the operating level, compared with a profit of similar magnitude last year. In spite of Sanyo's declining profitability, the company's balance sheet remained relatively strong. Net borrowing increased from Y185.2bn to Y239.3bn, or 32.6 per cent of equity. However, the unrealised profits from Sanyo's portfolio of securities declined from Y314bn to Y172bn.</p>

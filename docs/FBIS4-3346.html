			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The total sum used for  Chinese bank loans to support science and technology development  has increased hugely over the past decade.    Bank loans which went to science and technology sectors  increased from merely 15 million yuan in 1984 to 6.3 billion  yuan in 1993, according to a conference sponsored by the China  Commission for the Promotion of Relations Between Science and  Technology and Banking, which was held yesterday in Nanning,  capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    At present, only about 15-20 percent of the scientific and  technological achievements in China can be put into practical  use, due to the lack of necessary funds, according to the  meeting.    However, banking services related to science and technology  undertakings have been developing rapidly over the past few  years since the People's Bank of China initiated a science and  technology loans project and various professional banks started  similar services.    Banks have become another accelerator for the development of  science and technology following state budgets and funds raised  by enterprises on their own.    In 1984, the Bank of Industry and Commerce and the Bank of  Agriculture took the lead in granting loans to the development  of science and technology, which reached 15 million yuan for the  year.    The figure reached 6.3 billion yuan in 1993 when the  country's finances were in disorder for a time. Of the loans,  1.2 billion yuan went to the "Spark Program" in favor of local  economic development, 1.7 billion yuan went to the "Torch Plan"  in support of the development of high- and new-technology  projects, and 900 million yuan went to a program which is aimed  at the promotion of new technologies among traditional  enterprises.    The other funds went to research programs on the application  of military technology to civil use, application of achievements  of research institutes, exploration of resources, environmental  protection and the development of new medicines.    Under the coordination and support of the People's Bank of  China, professional banks have developed the services for nearly  a decade and have achieved great economic gains.    Statistics from Shenyang, a major industrial city in  north-east China's Liaoning Province, show that high and new  technologies contributed to about 31 percent of the output value  yielded by the enterprises in the city last year, largely  because of support from bank loans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Word of Love" column by Muhammad al-Hayawan] </F>   [Excerpts] The government could end its troubles, be  happy, and make others happy if it would accept the formation of  a medical and judicial committee to investigate the reasons for  the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. Any result from such  an investigation would be to its favor. If the death were  natural, caused by asthma, there would be no problem. If it  were natural, caused by other reasons, death is something  inevitable and there would be no case. If there were an injury  that resulted in death and the Interior Ministry brought the one  responsible to trial, this could serve as a model of justice.  In the past the Interior Ministry has brought more than one  officer to trial on charges of attacking citizens. This improves  the image of the police and is considered a sign of respect for  the feelings of people. The government could gain a great deal  as a result of this. [passage omitted]    Resorting to the prosecution and the courts does not tarnish  the image of the police. It would show that the government  respects human rights and wants justice to be done. It also  would end the complaints that some people have against the  government. It is true that terrorists must be dealt with  firmly if they try to resist or attempt to resist. Our  disagreement with the government is on its measures for  detaining people and the need to respect human rights during  questioning. It is better for the government to capture people  alive, because they can provide information.    The Egyptian Human Rights Association issued a statement  about the incident which did not make any specific charges, but  expressed doubts. Nothing can remove these doubts except a  neutral judicial- medical investigation. [passage omitted]</p>

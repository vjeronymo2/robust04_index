			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kamran Qarah Daghi] </F>   [Text] London--Well-informed Iraqi sources confirmed to  AL-HAYAH, following reports regarding a campaign of arrest and  executions of scores of people in the wake of aborted a coup  attempt in Iraq that took place last July, that the majority of  those targeted by the campaign were influential personalities  that belong to the al-Tikriti aristocracy. But these sources  explained that these people were the target of repression not  because they actually staged a coup, but also because they held  meetings and contacts during which they discussed the  deteriorating situation in the country. Some sources added that  these people probably addressed a memo to Saddam Husayn calling  on him to step down from power.    In the meantime French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  that  his government supports maintaining UN sanctions against Iraq  until it implements all the UN resolutions, including Resolution  688. He added that Paris supports sending UN observers to Iraq  in order to monitor human rights violations.    With regard to developments in Iraq, Iraqi sources said one  of the victims was 'Ali 'Abd-al-Rahman Ahmad al-Dawud  al-Hamadani, who was a security officer in the national command  of the ruling Socialist Arab Ba'th Party who was arrested last  Saturday.    The sources said that Safar Mawlud Mukhlis and his cousin  Jasim Amin Mukhlis were among the victims. The first was a  retired lawyer and was considered one of the traditionally  eminent personalities in the Tikriti circle. His father, Mawlud  Mukhlis was one of the leading personalities in the area and one  of the early pioneers who cooperated with late King Faysal I in  establishing the state of Iraq in the twenties. Because of this  background his family enjoyed special respect and influence,  even among the ruling al-Tikriti family, particularly during the  era of late president Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. But the family's  influence diminished in Saddam's era.    Persons arriving in Amman from Baghdad said it was customary  of Safar to talk in his regular private meetings about Saddam  Husayn with sarcasm, sometimes calling him "this 'ajay," which  in al-Tikriti slang means scoundrel, as an expression of  contempt, which the al-Tikriti aristocrats feel toward al-Majid  family, to which the Iraqi president belongs. As for Raji 'Abbas  al-Tikriti, he, too, is considered an "aristocrat." In the  seventies he was the commandant of al-Rashid military hospital,  then director of medical affairs in the defense ministry. He was  doyen of the doctors' association in 1990-92.    On the other hand, Iraqi experts and opposition members told  AL-HAYAH yesterday that bringing Husayn Kamil, President Saddam  Husayn's son-in-law, back into the government and appointing him  minister of industry and minerals; and appointing Safa' Hadi  Jawad al-Habbubi minister of petroleum; is an indication that  the Iraqi president intends to concentrate further on mobilizing  the country's resources to serve military industrialization.    The sources said that al-Habbubi (47 years), whose family  name did not appear in the list of the new ministers, was an  undersecretary for the ministry of military industrialization,  which was headed by Husayn Kamil and was responsible for the  Iraqi armament program, including nuclear and chemical programs.  Up to that time he was director of the British Matrix Churchill  company, which supplied Iraq with equipment for the manufacture  of a giant gun. He is one of those accused in the case of the  BNL Bank and in February 1991, he was charged with fraud.    The sources noticed that even up to last year's winter he  frequently traveled to Tunis via Amman in order to follow-up  contacts with European companies specialized in armament. He  invested his money in Jordan in order to buy a company for metal  manufacturing. But he stopped traveling after he was involved in  a car accident after which he was taken to the Amman Surgical  Hospital. Husayn Kamil sent a squad of bodyguards to protect  him. The sources said that the WASHINGTON POST in the United  States reported then that al-Habbubi, who is in Jordan, is  wanted for justice in the United States.    In London, chairman of the executive council of the Iraqi  National Congress, Ahmad al-Chalabi was informed through a  message from the French foreign minister that Iraq has been  urged to implement all the UN resolutions, including Resolution  688 that forbids the regime from repressing civilian  inhabitants. He pointed in this regard to France's participation  in the Western force to protect the Kurds.    He said Paris's demand to ease sanctions on Iraq depends on  Iraq's implementation of all the Security Council resolutions.</p>

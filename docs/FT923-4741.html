			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Aker executive quits after heavy write-off AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday announced the resignation of a senior executive following the disclosure that the group has written off NKr400m (Dollars 69.3m) against its annual result. The write-off relates to engineering changes the group has been forced to make to a NKr25bn oil platform project being constructed by a subsidiary. The group's A shares fell NKr7.50 to NKr 32.50 and the B shares dropped NKr 6.50 to Nkr36 following the announcement. Mr Gregers Kure, president of the group's oil and gas technology division, who was heavily involved in the Heidrun project - the world's first floating concrete tension leg platform being built for Conoco Norway - resigned. In August last year, Aker was forced to take a NKr300m charge against accounts after a concrete platform it was building sunk in a fjord. Four months later, the company extended another platform by four metres, following changes made to specifications by the operator of the project. Aker said yesterday: 'Preliminary assessments indicate that Norwegian Contractors (the subsidiary) will record a loss in 1992 of around NKr400m.' Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's president and chief executive, stressed yesterday that the group would post a profit in 1992, and would suffer no liquidity problems as a result of the charge. Last autumn, Conoco extended the dimensions of the platform which increased costs of the project by NKr2.1bn to NKr25bn. But this change had been taken into account when Conoco last December was awarded a NKr2.5bn contract covering engineering, procurement and construction of the platform. Mr Oeyvind Kvall, a Conoco Norway spokesman, said that alterations to the design had also been made last winter, incurring costs of NKr170m which the two companies agreed to split, but denied that fresh changes had been made. Industry experts suggest that Aker grossly underestimated the technical scope of the Heidrun project and that due to the complex, technical nature of Norway's North Sea oil and gas developments, domestic engineering firms were being pushed to their limits, and possibly beyond, by the oil companies.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL BOWING OUT AMID MISGIVINGS  </P> <P> It is fourth and long. All the receivers are covered. And the Foothill League  is about to be sacked.  </P> <P> In fact, one might say that the league already is "in the grasp."  </P> <P> This is the final year of the Foothill League. Last April, Foothill-area member  schools approved by a 26-to-16 vote a releaguing plan that will disband the  league and place Burbank, Burroughs and Hart in a revamped, eight-team Pacific  League.  </P> <P> Alhambra, San Gabriel and Schurr, the Foothill League's remaining teams, will  join Arcadia, Bell Gardens and Montebello in the fledgling Renaissance League.  </P> <P> Coaches and administrators from both the Foothill and Pacific leagues have  appealed in vain to the Southern Section executive council to keep both leagues  the way they are. Another appeal is planned in September.  </P> <P> "It has a great reputation and a lot of tradition," Burbank Coach Randy Stage  said of the Foothill League. "We don't want to lose the name."  </P> <P> At this stage, however, any appeal is a Hail Mary pass. Southern Section  Commissioner Stan Thomas described the prospect of a successful appeal as "very  thin."  </P> <P> "I can tell you that, right now, it's done," Thomas said.  </P> <P> And so, the league's swan-song season it most likely will be. And Stage, along  with Hart Coach Mike Herrington and Burroughs Coach Butch McElwee, will say  goodby to years of allegiance to one of Southern California's oldest and most  competitive leagues.  </P> <P> Stage, 33, entering his second year at Burbank, ran pass patterns through  Foothill defenses as a wide receiver at Burroughs -- Burbank's archrival --  from 1970-72.  </P> <P> Herrington, 31, in his first season as coach at Hart, bucked and slugged in  Foothill trenches as a member of the Hart offensive line from 1973-75. From  1980-87, he roamed the sidelines during Foothill games as an assistant coach at  Hart.  </P> <P> And McElwee, 42, entering his third season as coach at Burroughs, patrolled  Foothill secondaries as a defensive back at Burroughs from 1963-65.  </P> <P> All three, more or less, have the Foothill League in their blood. And they  don't want a transfusion.  </P> <P> "What's in a name?" Stage asked rhetorically. "But there is something in a  name. What's the sense of tradition for these kids? A lot of people are proud  to have played in the Foothill League and this is the last year. For someone  who has only been in the league three or four years, big deal. But for Burbank  and Burroughs. . . ."  </P> <P> Burbank has belonged to the Foothill League since the league's inception --  which, according to some accounts, dates to 1927. Burroughs has been a member  since the early '50s, and Hart, with the exception of a four-year stint in the  Golden League from 1977-81, has been a member since 1974.  </P> <P> Herrington, who long had coveted the head coaching job at Hart, said that his  allegiance is to the school first, the league second.  </P> <P> "I don't really care about the name," he said. "But I'd like to have it stay  status quo. I think it's a good league."  </P> <P> Herrington's attitude is understandable. In this decade, Hart has dominated the  league, winning five consecutive titles from 1983-87 and Southern Section  titles in 1983 and '86. Meanwhile, Burbank has not won a league title since  1972 and Burroughs has not won since 1981.  </P> <P> Hart, which won 22 consecutive league games from 1984-88, is 78-27-2 in this  decade and should rebound from last season's disappointing third-place finish.  </P> <P> Who would want to leave a league in which your team is a proven power?  </P> <P> "That's part of it," Herrington said. "But I like a six-team league. If we went  in with the teams in the Pacific League, it would be more challenging."  </P> <P> Indeed, the new Pacific League, which will include Crescenta Valley, Glendale,  Hoover, Muir and Pasadena, figures to be more competitive.  </P> <P> Muir (8-4) and Pasadena (7-4), co-champions last season, long have been area  powers. Muir won a Southern Section title in 1986, flattening Antelope Valley,  a Golden League power, 37-0.  </P> <P> "A few teams will very seldom have a chance to go to the playoffs," McElwee  said. "Muir is always going to go to the playoffs. Pasadena, right next door,  they're always going to have a lot of kids. And Hart always has a lot of  players."  </P> <P> McElwee, in contrast to his colleagues, favors the new Pacific League over the  existing Foothill League.  </P> <P> "I would rather get into the new league simply because there are rivalries," he  said. "Our rivalries are with Glendale (area) schools. We don't have anything  in common with Schurr. We don't have anything in common with Alhambra. From the  kids' standpoint, they go out and play San Gabriel and they don't know who San  Gabriel is. Even with the Pasadena schools, there is more of a rivalry than  there is with Hart. I don't mind this league; we have always done well in it.  But the rivalries aren't there."  </P> <P> McElwee is no traitor. Rather, his allegiance is to the Foothill League of  yesteryear. During the '60s, the league consisted of Glendale, Pasadena, Muir,  Crescenta Valley, Hoover, Burbank and Burroughs.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a bad league," McElwee said. "Muir never destroyed us. My senior  year, they beat us 12-3. I wouldn't mind going back to the original Foothill  League."  </P> <P> Well, for the most part, he will be going back. As for this year, the Foothill  League doesn't exactly figure to make a dramatic exit.  </P> <P> In recent years, the league has been a showcase for talented players. Jim  Bonds, quarterback at Hart in 1985 and '86, is now a UCLA sophomore. Former  Hart offensive lineman Brian Jacobs, a 1987 graduate, and tight end Brian  Allen, who graduated in June, also attend UCLA.  </P> <P> Jeff Barrett, who graduated in 1988 as Burroughs' career passing leader,  attends Nevada Reno.  </P> <P> But this year, Hart quarterback Rob Westervelt, who passed for 2,130 yards and  21 touchdowns as a junior last season, appears to be the only proven marquee  player. Seniors Dennis Rodriguez of Burroughs and Jeremy Sparks of Burbank both  are inexperienced at quarterback.  </P> <P> Hart senior tailback Howard Blackwell, who rushed for 850 yards and two  touchdowns in 172 carries last season, is the league's premier ballcarrier.  </P> <P> "The league is not going to be that good," McElwee said. "It's a little bit  weak as far as having an overall lot of talent. In the past, you had the  Bondses and Barretts and Allens. This year, they're not there."  </P> <P> But the Foothill League -- and the honor of being crowned its final champion --  is.  </P> <P> "We're going to go out and play to the best of our potential and try and win  it," Stage said. "And then wave 'Bye.' "  </P> <P> Tomorrow: the Pacific League  </P> <P> </P> <P> FOOTHILL LEAGUE  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:2.88IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An orchestrated propaganda scheme being developed in  Monrovia by a gang of Communist-minded individuals, to divert  international attention and counter continued calls by former  President Taylor for the total and unconditional withdrawal of  the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and move towards the  establishment of a national army, has been exposed. A series of  [word indistinct] activities, with the backing of the local BBC  correspondent -- who is an ECOMOG paid agent in Monrovia -- sent  panicky waves of fear in Monrovia and elsewhere of an imminent  war, despite calls for the cessation of all hostilities in the  country. The exposure of the Nigerian complicity in aiding and  abetting splinter armed groups in Liberia, particularly, the  Liberian Peace Council and one of ULIMO's [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] factions, has led to harsh  international criticisms and demands by local interest and  pressure groups for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal  of the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG from Liberia.</p>

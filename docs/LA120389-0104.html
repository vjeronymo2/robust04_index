			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNESSEE SURVIVES CLOSE ONE;  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS: THEY RALLY TO BEAT VANDERBILT, 17-10, AND EARN A BERTH IN THE  COTTON BOWL.  </P> <P> No. 8 Tennessee, trailing 10-3 at halftime, rallied for a 17-10 victory over  Vanderbilt Saturday to earn a share of the Southeastern Conference championship  and a trip to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on New Year's Day.  </P> <P> The Volunteers, who finished in a three-way tie with Auburn and Alabama for the  SEC title, will play Southwest Conference champion Arkansas. All three schools  finished with 6-1 conference records.  </P> <P> Auburn's 30-20 victory over Alabama Saturday caused only the second three-way  tie in SEC history.  </P> <P> Tennessee, 10-1 overall, was expected to have an easy time against Vanderbilt,  which finished 1-10 and 0-7. But the Volunteers fell behind as Vanderbilt  scored on Brad Gaines' one-yard run and Johnny Clark's 35-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Tennessee tied, 10-10, on a four-yard pass from Andy Kelly to Carl Pickens late  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Pickens, who also plays safety on defense, intercepted a pass by Mike Healy  minutes later and the Volunteers drove 70 yards in 11 plays for the winning  points, with Tony Thompson scoring from the one with 7:11 remaining.  </P> <P> Thompson, a reserve tailback, led Tennessee in rushing with 128 yards in 33  carries.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad the game's over," said Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors, whose team  concluded its first 10-victory regular season since 1970.  </P> <P> "I'm sure Vanderbilt people are very proud of their team and coaches. They did  a terrific job. I commend the job they did. It was just outstanding."  </P> <P> "Our defense played one fine football game," said Vanderbilt Coach Watson  Brown. "Maybe we're growing up."  </P> <P> After Tennessee went in front on Thompson's touchdown, Vanderbilt's next two  possessions ended with interceptions by Tennessee cornerback J.J. McCleskey, a  walk-on who earned playing time late in the season.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt had one last chance after DeMond Winston forced a fumble, but Gaines  could not hold a fourth-down pass from John Gromos.  </P></p>

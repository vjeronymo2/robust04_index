			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eagle Star Pounds 12m in red THE LEGACY of its expansion in the late 1980s yesterday came back to haunt Eagle Star, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, which reported unexpected losses of Pounds 57m on its discontinued mortgage indemnity business in the first six months of 1993. The deficit offset a profit of Pounds 45m on other lines leaving the group with Pounds 12m pre-tax losses. Pre-tax profits at Allied Dunbar grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 74m. Farmers' produced a 6 per cent increase in its trading result to Pounds 216m, lifting overall profits from financial services to Pounds 303m (Pounds 208m). The new mortgage indemnity losses have arisen on agency pool business, in which Eagle Star insured loans made by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and some centralised lenders. The policies provided additional insurance cover to lenders for any losses suffered on the sale of repossessed properties, and are usually additional to domestic mortgage indemnity policies. While domestic mortgage indemnity usually cover losses equal to up to 30 per cent of the value of a mortgage, the agency pool policies typically cover any remaining exposures. The group withdrew from these lines of business in 1990 but Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, is expecting further losses in the second half of 1993. 'It is very difficult to read but my best guess would be a further Pounds 50m in losses,' said Mr Broughton, adding that Eagle Star had also been surprised by a 25 per cent increase in the average cost of agency pool claims to Pounds 26,000 in the first half. Total losses from agency pool business amount to Pounds 200m, contributing to an overall deficit to date from commercial and domestic mortgage indemnity insurance of more than Pounds 900m. Excluding agency pool losses, underwriting deficit fell to Pounds 97m (Pounds 172m).</p>

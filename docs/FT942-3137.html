			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Spottiswoode finds some comfort Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, drew comfort yesterday from being attacked left and right for her decision on how much British Gas can charge competitors to use its delivery system. She inferred this to mean that her formula was about right. Even so, the strength of British Gas's reaction - its warning about dividends and the threat to gas-industry investment - will be hard to ignore. Similarly, the accusation from the independent gas companies that the formula is too weak and will leave consumers paying far more for their gas than they should be, will provide critics powerful ammunition. Yesterday's move places one more building block on the competitive market for gas, which is gradually being constructed following last year's monopoly inquiry. Large consumers are already able to buy from suppliers other than British Gas. Domestic consumers will begin to get a choice in 1996. But all suppliers will have to use British Gas's network of pipelines and storage to transport their gas. So the level British Gas can charge for this service is key because such charges account for about half the cost of gas delivered. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission made several recommendations. One was that British Gas should hive off its transportation and storage business into a separate unit - which is now being done. Another was that transport and storage prices should be governed by an inflation-linked formula. A third was that the formula should allow British Gas a return of 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent on assets, and 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent on new investments. British Gas had sought a return 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new, while the independent gas companies were arguing that British Gas's assets were overvalued at Pounds 17bn, and should be recalculated. Ms Spottiswoode is proposing to set a price of 14.16p per term starting on October 1, with a formula adjusting it by at least the rate of inflation minus 5 per cent each year until 1997. She said that this would give British Gas a rate of return 'towards the bottom end' of the range suggested by the MMC, but with the strong implication that British Gas could earn more if it tried harder - specifically, by continuing to reduce its costs by 2.5 per cent a year. She also said that she had accepted most of British Gas's figures and forecasts without question, which was 'generous'. But there were two points where she took issue. One was British Gas's assumption that the recent spate of mild winters would continue. It is clearly in British Gas's interests to give a low forecast for gas use, because this justifies a higher unit charge to achieve the agreed rate of return. Instead, she has assumed average winters. The second is over the cost of splitting the transportation and storage business into a separate unit. British Gas says the cost of this is heavy because it involves setting up large computer systems. But Ms Spottiswoode says that British Gas should be able to recoup that cost through greater efficiency. To the disappointment of the independent gas suppliers, however, she declined to revalue British Gas's assets, leaving this for a further review which will set the next price formula after 1997. 'We would like to see this done earlier,' said Ms Caroline Harper, managing director of Amerada Hess Gas, who believes the assets may be overvalued by 20-30 per cent. The two issues which arise from the decision are British Gas's claim that it could throttle investment in the transportation and storage system, and the effect on end-user prices. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas finance director, said it could probably achieve the predicted return in the first year, but would fall below it in subsequent years as the price formula began to bite. The view among many industry observers was that the formula was indeed tough and that British Gas might have insufficient incentive to continue investing at the current rate of Pounds 900m a year. Mr Jonathan Stern, a consultant with Gas Strategies, said: 'It's severe, specially if you assume that inflation will be low in the years ahead.' On the other hand, the more gas British Gas can pump through the system, the bigger its profits. So it does have an incentive to expand and upgrade capacity. Ms Spottiswoode said the formula would drive prices for gas suppliers down by 3 per cent from next October. The formula would also help offset any price increases for consumers who live in remote areas once the free market develops. Until then, householders would be protected by a separate ceiling on prices. The independent gas suppliers also emphasised yesterday that prices would go down because competition would eat into British Gas's heavy costs. Main points of the Ofgas document British Gas transportation and storage prices to be controlled by RPI-5 per cent formula until March 1997. Price to start at 14.16p per therm on October 1. Formula designed to give British Gas a rate of return 'towards the bottom end' of the 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent range suggested by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Wide-ranging review of T&amp;S business to be conducted as basis for price regime after 1997.</p>

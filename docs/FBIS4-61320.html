			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 04, BNS -- Latvian Saeima (parliament)  Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs addressed reporters Wednesday [4  May] with a speech, dedicated to the adoption of the  Independence Declaration on May 4, 1990.    In his address, Gorbunovs thanked the former Supreme Council  deputies who started to form the structures of the independent  state regardless of the counteractions by Moscow administration.    Commenting on the present political situation, Gorbunovs  said  he could "support radical changes in the life of our society" if  it stabilized the Latvian situation.    The most important future issue is the choice of Latvian  citizens on the chief issues of national development and  politics, Gorbunovs said.    Answering on journalists' questions, Gorbunovs said he hoped  that the Saeima opposition and the ruling coalition would narrow  their differences to avoid hampering the work of the parliament.    Gorbunovs said that the opposition ideas to propose  extraordinary Saeima elections were logical from the opposition  viewpoint because it could not have more influence in the  present Saeima as it already had.    "The government of the Latvia's Way and the Farmers' Union  is  a minority government but the government that the opposition  could form would be even more unstable minority government,"  said Gorbunovs.    Gorbunovs characterized as immature the idea to adopt a  public reconciliation declaration because "the issues of the  offenses by former KGBs and communist nomenklatura officials  have not been sufficiently considered yet." "People who were  humiliated now wait for amends," he noted.    Finally, Gorbunovs claimed that the Constitution should be  amended to avoid various interpretations by deputies.</p>

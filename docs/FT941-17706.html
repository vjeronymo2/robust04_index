			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Leading Article: A prudent year for UK housing In any sane society, house price inflation would be regarded as particularly malign, since shelter is, after food, the most essential of goods. Equally, falling prices would be viewed with delight. UK nominal house prices fell, on average, by about 15 per cent between mid-1989 and early 1993, while the ratio of house prices to earnings is at levels last seen in 1985. Is joy breaking out? Alas, no. The reason for the despondency is not hard to find, Houses are not merely nests; they are nest eggs. In the UK, 68 per cent of housing is in owner-occupation. At the end of 1992, net housing wealth was almost a third of the net wealth of the personal sector, even after three years of declining prices. No wonder millions of owner-occupiers pray for the return of house price inflation. Fortunately, they are unlikely to get what they want, at least in the near future. This sounds hard-hearted, particularly when many still suffer from the new disease of negative equity. Fortunately, even the very modest price increase of 2 per cent estimated by the Halifax Building Society for 1993 has reduced the number of victims quite sharply. Recently, the Bank of England has calculated that negative equity afflicted 1.2m households at the end of the third quarter of 1993, down from 1.8m at the end of the first quarter. The value of negative equity also fell, from Pounds 11.7bn to Pounds 7.3bn. This suggests that the 5 per cent price increase forecast by the Halifax for 1994 might reduce the numbers affected considerably. Hapless victims In any case, these people are the hapless victims, not of the inevitable price adjustment of 1989-92, but of the period beforehand, when house prices rose some two and a half times. The British middle classes had to learn that buying a bigger house than they could afford and borrowing close to 100 per cent of its value was not the best way to become rich. The lesson was brutal, as such lessons tend to be. It fell not on the beneficiaries of house price inflation but on their children. But they at least must have learned their lesson. Or have they? Within 20 years the UK has had two house price surges, in 1971-74 and again in 1985-89, along with a mini-surge between 1978 and 1980. What is to prevent another one? In the short run, painful memories should do the trick. Over the long term, people must believe that the authorities would not permit another inflationary burst. Price correction This confidence will not be easy to sustain, since some price correction is unavoidable after the recent decline. If prices rise faster than nominal interest rates, even cautious buyers may feel forced to jump into the market. As prices rise, negative equity will also diminish quite rapidly. The value of negative equity is, in any case, only about 1 per cent of the net value of the housing stock. Also important will be the combination of low rates of interest on deposits with the rampaging bull market in financial assets. People will seek other investments, with property standing out for its cheapness. What does this mean for the authorities? It means they should be on their guard. They should become nervous if house prices rise faster than interest rates for a lengthy time. They should feel panic if housing-related credit starts to expand rapidly. And if the next cut in the base rate of interest were to come after this year's round of annual mortgage interest adjustments, they should feel rather pleased.</p>

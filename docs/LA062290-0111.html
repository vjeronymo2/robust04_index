			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAPPERS TO GET HELP FROM INDUSTRY ASSN.;  </P> <P> THE COURTS: IT WILL ENTER A BRIEF ON BEHALF OF 2 LIVE CREW IN THE APPEAL OF A  RULING THAT DECLARED THE 'NASTY' ALBUM OBSCENE.  </P> <P> After months of sitting on the sidelines, the nation's major record companies  -- through their industry association -- are stepping into the legal  controversy surrounding Miami rap group 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA), told  The Times that the association will enter a friend of the court brief on behalf  of 2 Live Crew in the group's upcoming appeal of a June 6 ruling by  Florida-based U.S. District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez that declared obscene its  "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album.  </P> <P> The RIAA's participation in the case -- which has led to the arrests in Florida  of a record store owner for selling the album and two members of 2 Live Crew  for performing a song from the album in an adults-only club -- is unusual in  that 2 Live Crew leader Luther Campbell's company, Luke Records, is a  non-member independent record company.  </P> <P> "I think this case raises some of the most fundamental issues regarding freedom  of speech," Berman said in a telephone interview this week from his Washington  office. "We're very troubled by certain ideas addressed in the judge's  obscenity decision. It has implications which we believe will not only affect a  group like 2 Live Crew, but the music industry as a whole."  </P> <P> The Miami rap group's attorney filed an appeal of the decision on June 11, but  a court date has yet to be scheduled. Berman said his group is preparing  arguments for the case focusing on First Amendment issues and has contacted the  band's lawyer to offer legal assistance.  </P> <P> "I am so troubled by the opening line of Judge Gonzalez's ruling, where he says  this case is about a battle between two ancient enemies: Anything Goes and  Enough Already," Berman said. "That is such a total and preposterous  mischaracterization of the facts and it indicates to me that we have a very  serious problem here about First Amendment protection regarding artistic  expression."  </P> <P> Debbie Bennet, publicity director at Luke Records, was delighted that the  record industry was finally stepping in.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful to know that people in the business are finally getting behind  us," Bennet said in a phone interview. "I wish it hadn't taken so long for them  to get involved, but hey, better late than never."  </P> <P> Responding to criticism that his organization was slow in responding to the 2  Live Crew controversy, Berman explained that the RIAA has been preoccupied  fighting off mandatory labeling bills proposed in more than a dozen state  legislatures across the nation.  </P> <P> "For the past six months, we've had to devote almost all our time and resources  to defeating government sticker laws," Berman said. "It's not as if we've been  sitting around here waiting for the shoe to fall. We haven't.  </P> <P> "I represent over 50 companies," Berman said. "They just don't move with  lightning speed. It's hard to get them to agree on any one particular thing."  </P> <P> Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences,  said he was also pleased to hear that the RIAA had finally decided to get  involved in the 2 Live Crew court battle.  </P> <P> "We're very excited that the RIAA is coming forward in a leadership role on  this important issue," Greene said. "The industry needs to galvanize and  protect our right to artistic expression."  </P> <P> In an effort to address industry-related First Amendment issues, Greene said  NARAS is putting together a massive "freedom of speech" protest march and  concert, which is scheduled to take place in Washington late this summer.  </P> <P> "The more I think about how these conservative crusaders have tried to turn  this into a religious issue, the angrier I get," Greene said. "I don't think  the majority of American citizens intend to tolerate this kind of right-wing  environment in America."  </P> <P> Virgin Records president Jeff Ayeroff, a staunch opponent to government  interference in the record business, also applauded the RIAA's stance on 2 Live  Crew.  </P> <P> "I hope this is just the beginning," Ayeroff said. "I think we need to register  our constituency to vote. We must strike back like the pro-choice advocates are  doing with the abortion issue and let politicians like Bob Martinez (the  Florida governor who called national attention to 2 Live Crew after ordering an  obscenity and racketeering probe of the rap group in January) know that if you  mess with rock and roll, you will be voted out of office."  </P></p>

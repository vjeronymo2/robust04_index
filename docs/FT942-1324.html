			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tom Brown's survival days - Tim Burt considers the strategy to turn round United Industries When Mr Tom Brown took control of United Industries last year he pursued a single strategy: survival. Burdened with debts of Pounds 6.6m, he knew the precision tools and springs manufacturer needed major surgery if it was to make it through the recession. Three months after his arrival he unveiled the first part of his 'pain first, relief later' strategy by announcing losses of Pounds 3.63m, including Pounds 2.27m of exceptional costs, and warning of choppy conditions ahead. Having abandoned the helm at Fenner, the engineering group which he likened to steering an oil tanker, Mr Brown soon realised he was on board a much smaller vessel. 'The company was being run to keep the banks from the door. The debt repayment programme was stripping all our funds and my job was simply to keep it afloat.' A year later, United Industries has undergone a refit which saw it double in size and emerge with a new management crew. Although Mr Brown has been widely credited with the relaunch, he claims the initiative was born not in the company's Leicester headquarters but in the City offices of Smith New Court. Concerned at the group's lack of working capital, he asked the financial advisers to consider a Pounds 2m rights issue to raise fresh cash and reduce debt. Smith New Court was unimpressed. 'They told us we were just fiddling with deck chairs and to go for something bolder,' recalls Mr Brown. Encouraged to think big, United began casting around for acquisitions which would return it to profitability after three years of losses. The search ended with a familiar partner - BBA Group. The engineering company, which effectively gave birth to United in 1988 by selling it stakes in United Spring &amp; Steel Group and Ratcliffe Industries, attracted Mr Brown's attention last August when it unveiled plans to sell up to 12 subsidiaries with a combined turnover of Pounds 200m. Following lengthy negotiations, United last month announced the Pounds 25m acquisition of three BBA businesses, Holden Hydroman, Perplas and Railko, funded with a Pounds 26m placing and open offer. Ironically, the deal, which doubled the group into a business with turnover of Pounds 60m a year, probably would not have taken place had it not been for the steady fall in United's share price following the October 1987 crash. BBA, which received a 21.23 per cent stake in United for Ratcliffe and United Springs, could not afford to sell after the shares tumbled from more than 140p to about 14p. 'Had it not been for the recession and collapse in the share price, BBA would have got out and we might not have survived,' admits Mr Brown. Having resuscitated the group, Mr Brown has begun focusing on expansion and strengthening its three pre-acquisition divisions - materials handling, springs and precision machinery. He discounts a fire sale but admits that doubts remain on the long-term future of subsidiaries which continue to suffer in worsening markets. In the bleakest scenario, United would no longer be able to sustain its existing businesses and become dependent on the plastics and seals activities of the acquisitions. While declining to predict the future shape of the group, Mr Brown has indicated his determination to concentrate on the purchases. 'At BBA these businesses had a Cinderella complex because they were always on the periphery. We've brought them centre stage and we're offering them new challenges and access to international markets.' There is also a growing awareness that some United products might sit more comfortably within other groups, but wary of demotivating its workforce, the board declines to specify its main areas of concern. Nevertheless, some industry analysts believe the materials handling business, which makes automated storage systems, may be sold. They point to United's recent nine month results, showing losses of Pounds 1.5m, in which it highlighted very difficult conditions in the division. Cautious by nature, Mr Brown says only: 'We cannot have any weak positions. Something which isn't strong, I'd like to see in other hands.' He is, meanwhile, pressing ahead with a reappraisal of group strategy and instilling his expansive vision of a business which can no longer rely on sales in Britain and Europe alone. If his gamble pays off, the latest acquisitions will provide the springboard to new markets and product areas. Predicting a return to profitability this year, he says: 'We have to grow and put more emphasis on marketing, then volumes will come up. That is the key to our survival.'</p>

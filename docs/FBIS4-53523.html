			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Discussion by Hiroko Ota, Osaka University visiting </F> professor, and Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni and Associates;  place and date not given]    [Text] What should be done to eliminate Japan's  current account surplus? The problem isn't one that can be  solved by expanding imports. Rather, a reduction in the surplus  will come about when there has been economic structural  reform.  <H5>  Why Trade Surplus Continues </H5>   [Akio Mikuni] It is very difficult for borrower and creditor  countries to settle their accounts with each other. This can be  seen quite clearly, for example, in the case of automobiles.  Japan's production capacity far exceeds domestic demand while,  in the United States, production capacity is insufficient to  meet domestic demand and cars have to be imported. As a result,  Japan has a current surplus. To settle its accounts, the United  States must sell a lot of cars to Japan and repay its debt with  the proceeds from its sales. But, here, we seem to come up  against a dilemma. Since it has excess capacity, Japan can't  very well import more than it does. In the United States,  production levels are so low as to make it necessary for  Americans to import cars, so unlike Japan, they can't very well  export more.    People often argue that everything would be all right if  only  the United States were paying its bills. That Americans keep  buying cars from Japan means their manufacturers haven't  increased their production capacity or their labor force  sufficiently to offset the need for imports, but that situation  of course won't last forever.    [Hiroko Ota] In my view, the current-account surplus itself  isn't a problem.    If one were to say there is a problem, it's mainly on the  side of the country with the current-account deficit and in its  having steadily built up a loan balance that keeps getting  bigger in proportion to its GNP. The responsibility for that is  on the debtor's side. It's a problem for the debtor-country to  solve.    Textbooks would say there is no direct connection between  the  trade or export-import imbalance and the current-account  surplus. In other words, in an open economy under the floating  rate system, the exchange rate goes down and there's an  adjustment that way when the balance tilts too much toward  imports. Looked at from a long-range perspective, I think the  surplus in the current account can be explained in terms of the  balance between domestic savings and investments.    Because of Japan's current surplus, it is often said we are  exporting unemployment, but here, too, a strong connection  between the current-account balance and employment can't be  substantiated. Rather, a more important factor is the labor  market, and I don't think a current-account deficit is the  reason that unemployment is increasing. Nor do existing data  substantiate such claims.    Another argument that is often made is that the growth of  Japan's surplus is robbing the United States of effective  demand. Here, too, if we look at the problem from a  mid-to-long-term perspective, I don't think that argument can be  made. In other words, to stimulate effective demand and  influence the GNP is only a short-term approach to the problem.  The only way to correct the current-account imbalance, I think,  is to change the ratio between savings and investments.    Actually, what is happening is that the outflow of capital  from Japan is financing U.S. investments and thus creating  employment. So, I don't think we can necessarily say Japan's  current surplus is hurting effective demand in the United States  or increasing unemployment there.    [Mikuni] If the same methods that we use to analyze  financial  statements were used to analyze national economies, various  perspectives would emerge, just as they do in the case of firms.  So, I think it's quite valid to argue in terms of the  savings-investment balance when considering the current account.    Only, I wonder if we can really say current surpluses don't  pose a problem for creditor nations? For example, Japan has been  extending a lot of credit to other countries. But that credit  isn't worth as much with the yen's appreciation. By continuing  to have a surplus, a creditor nation will see its currency  valued upwards to a large extent and will suffer a loss in real  terms.    When the current account balance continues to be in surplus,  the exchange rate changes under the floating rate system, and  the trade balance moves toward equilibrium. Such changes in the  exchange rate are harmful to profits, and manufacturers quit  making products and quit exporting them. Conversely, the import  industry benefits by seeing higher profit ratios, so it imports  more. Naturally, when this situation continues, the gap between  imports and exports tends to narrow, and the surplus is  eliminated. In Japan's case, however, this mechanism isn't  entirely working.    There are two reasons. One is that Japanese industry has to  persist and keep on producing. Given its system of lifetime  employment, Japanese industry can't very well just start  dismissing workers. Nor can it do away with its plants and  facilities. In any case, what happens is that existing  production capacity is maintained and manufacturers take  whatever opportunity they can to increase exports.    The second reason is that, when profits are suffering in a  country where the financial capital market is operating to some  extent according to the market principle, rising fund-raising  costs will act as a brake. In Japan's case, the Ministry of  Finance will not let a single bank fail. Nor will main banks let  [client] companies fail. In short, things are set up so that  large enterprises don't go bankrupt. The environment makes it  easier, in other words, to avoid the kind of situation where  fundraising costs go up when corporate profits are down, and  production therefore has to be cut back.    [Ota] I agree that part of the current-account surplus  reflects a structural problem.    Only, I don't think the Maekawa Report was right in its  approach; in other words, I don't think it was right to consider  the surplus itself the problem and to make it the target for  macroeconomic policy, do you?    Expanding imports in the long term will not reduce the  current surplus. I agree it's necessary to expand imports, but  for a different reason. Imports should be expanded--not only to  raise the level of world trade, but also, for example, to raise  the quality of life at home.    [Mikuni] I won't go so far as to say a continuing surplus is  itself particularly a problem. But when we look at the profit  ratio of the manufacturing industry while that surplus is  growing and accumulating, we see that operating profits relative  to sales for sectors heavily based on exports--for example, of  automobiles and electrical products--have been falling sharply  and, as a result of declining net receipts from exports due to  the stronger yen, companies are no longer showing a profit.    For high-level growth, a steady growth in production volume  is probably necessary. But high-level growth has become an aim  in and of itself. As a result, exports are extremely important  for them if they are to maintain their existing rates of  operation. Therefore, they export. No one considers such  profitless "busy work" strange any more.    Another thing is that, when people import products, they are  usually profitable, but we have quit importing those things. In  addition to these two "absurdities" we also have an  "unreasonably strong yen."    [Ota] Certainly, there's an element of self-inflicted injury  here. The trade surplus and yen appreciation are indications of  that, and in that sense, I think the current imbalance is a  problem. Another big problem is how Japan, as a creditor nation,  allocates funds on a macro-level.    As high as our savings ratio is, it doesn't translate itself  adequately into a higher quality of life or into questions  concerning Japan's future development. Rather, not a small part  of these savings is going overseas as credit. This credit is  necessary, but at a time when our social infrastructure is so  poor, we see overseas credit holdings growing at a faster pitch  than efforts to improve social capital.    Moreover, foreign credit holdings are themselves exposed to  various investment risks, including the risk of exchange rate  fluctuations, so valuable savings intended for our aging  population are not being turned toward building up our "stock"  at home. Nor are they being linked to the creation of an  information and communications network or an industrial base for  the future. The fact that these savings are not connected to the  future wealth of Japan or its development, I think, indicates a  structural problem.    [Mikuni] Yes. Before taking a lot of money overseas, we  ought  to look into whether more investments aren't needed at home.  Most important, housing investments haven't really been  seriously given any thought.    Fortunate Circumstances    [Ota] Americans are criticizing Japan, saying that Japan's  closed markets are the main reason for our current-account  surplus, but theoretically that argument is flawed.    It's possible, by increasing trade, to influence the  current-account balance temporarily, but the exchange rate will  change. In other words, when imports to Japan increase, the yen  tends to go down in value, with the result that exports are then  increased, offsetting the increase in imports. In the long term,  because of changes in price levels and the exchange rate, there  is almost no effect at all.    Even in the short run, because of changes in the exchange  rate, there will not be as much effect on the current surplus as  one might expect. That would be even more the case, I think we  can say, if we were to increase imports in specific areas like  the Americans want. It would have only a very limited effect and  not have any influence, in macro terms, on the current-account  surplus. So, it's hard to justify the U.S. demands, and I really  can't understand why they are being made.    [Mikuni] The aim of U.S. policy is neither clear nor easily  understood.    Another reason--which is different from yours--is that, even  if imports were increased to some extent, that in itself  wouldn't be enough to reduce the surplus sufficiently to affect  our trade or current-account balances given the size of our  surplus. It would be very hard, I would think, to reduce our  surplus without reducing our exports. What effect that will have  on the macroeconomic side would require a separate analysis,  however.    [Ota] I have a feeling that various frustrations--such as  the  perceived lack of transparency in Japan's markets, our  certification system, etc.--have come to a head and are finding  their outlet in the current-account imbalance. But, I do think  expanding imports and easing regulations are, in themselves,  goals we're going to have to aim for.    [Mikuni] Japan's current production capacity is the highest  in the world. We have built up a capacity that far exceeds  domestic demand. With the end of the Cold War, the United States  is shifting from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy. As  that shift occurs, we will probably be seeing Americans  importing fewer durable consumer goods from Japan. With the  United States moving in this direction, the Japanese economy  will have to move seriously toward increasing domestic demand.  This is probably what the Americans believe. From Japan's  perspective, too, I would think it is necessary to attend to  various unfinished business and expand domestic demand while  supporting the world economy to some extent.    [Ota] The Japanese are very fortunate right now in that what  they have been wanting--to build the social infrastructure and  to improve their standard of living and lower the cost of goods  by way of more imports--are now goals they can pursue while, at  the same time, easing foreign criticisms of Japan.    [Mikuni] So, the idea of making the shift--of moving in a  direction where Japan can renew its industries and technology,  raise its standard of living, and thus forge new products from  new domestic demand--the shift, in other words, from a copycat  economy to a creative one is really the most important thing,  isn't it?    [Ota] Yes, I agree. Rather than looking for solutions to the  present situation by simply responding to foreign pressure,  Japan has to put its energies into restructuring its enterprises  and its domestic market. Probably two things are required of  Japan. Since Japan's surplus is actually being put to good use  in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, one of those  roles is to provide funds. The other is to provide a large  market for other economies. It is particularly in this role as a  consumer that you seem to be addressing yourself, and that, I  think, will create the seeds for the future development of the  Japanese economy.    [Mikuni] Yes. So, the question that's become of the utmost  importance is how we are to expand this kind of consumer demand.    Surplus Reduction as an Outcome    [Ota] I think it was a mistake for the Maekawa Report to say  that the current-account imbalance was itself a crisis and then  set it up as a policy objective.    Of course, if we looked around us at the time, we could see  that the U.S. debt had grown and had reached critical  proportions relative to its GNP. Admittedly, the situation then  was even worse than it is today.    Only, it is very important to understand and examine where  the problem lies with regard to the current-account imbalance.  If it reflects a problem in the domestic situation, then the  policy objective should be to find a solution to that problem.    In fact, many of those who took part in the Hiraiwa Report  suggested taking the opposite approach from the one taken in the  Maekawa Report. In other words, rather than thinking that the  current-account surplus had to be reduced and using that means  to improve our quality of life, they advocated an approach which  would first tackle the structural problems that exist at home.  In effect, that approach would then result in the reduction of  the current-account surplus, it was thought. I would agree, and  I think we expected to see these views reflected in the Hiraiwa  Report.    In the end, the weakest part of the report was the route  linking views on the current-account surplus to domestic  structural problems.    Particularly, in questions concerning the current-account  surplus and structural reform, what is important is whether one  chooses to get the money to improve the social infrastructure  through taxes or through government bonds. Since the  current-account balance is what is left when you subtract the  fiscal deficit from the savings-investment balance, I think an  important route to take in order to improve the quality of life  and reduce the current-account surplus is to issue government  bonds and improve the social infrastructure. Among other things,  because the Ministry of Finance was extremely opposed to the  idea, that route wasn't suggested.    [Mikuni] Depending on whom you talk with, you get different  views and ways of thinking about the current-account surplus. In  Japan's case, however, I think the biggest factor [behind the  surplus] is that Japanese industries have built up their  production capacity out of proportion to domestic demand.    About 20 years ago, I remember reading a paper written by  Osamu Shimomura. He was arguing from the perspective of  "comparative advantage"--if you can get something good but  cheaper as an import, then that was the way to go, he was saying.    In the Maekawa and Hiraiwa reports, the idea is to make  choices based on rational economic principles, choices about  which things to do and which things not to do. Like a gardener,  you have to decide which trees and which branches need pruning  and which should be left to grow in order to have a beautiful  garden full of well-shaped shrubs and trees.    In Japan's case, the process of making such decisions--I'd  call it allocating resources by deductive reasoning--has been to  have some kind of goal and then for government to lead the way  in reaching that goal or for government and the private sector  to be as one in allocating managerial resources.    However, with that kind of setup, it is very difficult to  make choices--to decide, in terms of policy, which industries  will remain or which enterprises will survive or how production  capacity is to be reduced. In both the Maekawa and Hiraiwa  reports, the problem is in deciding what to do in order to get  specific results.    New Form of Investments    [Mikuni] Everything is macroeconomic policy these days, and  to some extent we can expect to see a recovery.    But it seems to me that, with the yen as high as it is,  enterprises, especially those in the manufacturing sector, are  no longer earning profits from their export-related activities.  Consequently, I think plant and equipment investments are going  to continue to be stagnant. To make the shift toward increased  demand, then, we need policy that will give a serious boost to  housing investments.    As the United States is doing, this means recognizing the  interest on housing loans as a necessary expense. If the full  amount can be deducted from income, people can buy a home or  build a bigger one. The spread effect from this will be quite  significant.    Again, it's important of course to save money for when our  society grows older. But there are advantages, for example, in  building the kind of houses now that will last another 50 to 100  years. It would mean no more housing will have to be built when,  in another 20 or 30 years, there's even a greater proportion of  elderly in Japan and a much smaller productive population. So,  in this sense, too, such investments would be very logical.    Until now, macroeconomic policy has been formulated in an  economy which, if anything, has been running in a "catch-up and  overtake" mode and has been an effort to somehow bring about a  business recovery. But nothing has been done yet about  structural reform. I think that may have been a major factor in  the ineffectiveness, in the true sense, of economic policy and  stimulus measures until now.    [Ota] At this point, an income tax cut or policy to  stimulate  effective demand alone probably won't do any good. Even in the  long term, rather than redistribute resources by way of an  income tax cut in order to stimulate already ample private  consumption, I think we should focus on the poverty of our  social infrastructure.    I think we need to put our energies into this  infrastructure,  and fundamentally reconsider our basic plans for public works  investments, not only in terms of amounts, but also in terms of  content and the system for carrying these plans out.    Since the yen's appreciation in the second half of the  1980's, we have been trying to expand domestic demand through  monetary policy, and it was this that led to the bubble economy.    Now is the time to put public funds into greater action. For  the current-account surplus to have grown to the extent it has  means that there is now much broader leeway to expand fiscal  expenditures. So, this is the time when we can give our  attention seriously to issuing construction bonds and improving  the social infrastructure. This is our last chance to do so.    But rather than a macroeconomic perspective, policy has  strongly reflected the views of the Ministry of Finance; namely,  its desire not to severely restrict the budget-making process  and also to keep restrictions on future budgets to a minimum.  Thus, needed macroeconomic policy has not been adopted.    [Mikuni] In the case of public works investments, here, too,  we can see that the path which has been taken so far has  reflected certain value judgments; namely, the importance of  efficiently building up industry.    For example, in large foreign cities like London or New  York,  places with the best scenery are reserved for residential use  and for hotels. In Japan, offices are found on those sites.  Here, too, we need to change our values.    [Ota] For starters, we need to be able to change our way of  doing things. We've taken public works investments and housing  investments as policies to stimulate the economy, and that has  distorted the way things really ought to be done and haven't  produced results commensurate with the investments.    Rather than measures simply to stimulate the economy, we  should, for example, be trying to improve our social  infrastructure (this term needs to be defined more strictly),  especially in terms of building the foundation for future  industry, whatever form that takes, and those things that are  related to our daily lives.    [Mikuni] "Future industry" sounds simple enough, but  actually  there is no consensus as to what future technology or the future  form of industry will be. How do you make new industries and new  technology possible? In the final analysis, only those things  that the consumer supports are going to survive.    Relaxing Regulations Is Also Necessary    [Mikuni] Which is to say, the most fortunate aspect of the  Japanese economy right now is that individual financial assets  total 1,000 trillion yen. Its production capacity is also quite  formidable. If in such a country domestic demand is expanded, it  is quite possible to see new technologies and new products  developing and those developments having an impact on industry.  It is of the utmost importance, I think, to somehow realize this  potential.    [Ota] Yes. And for that purpose, it is very important to  relax regulations. We should have more faith in the strength of  the market and government should try as much as possible not to  intervene. Another thing, whenever I visit a university, it  strikes me how shabby the research facilities are. We also have  to build up our research and development infrastructure. And,  like President Clinton's information highway, we too will have  to build an information and communications network.    To do these sorts of things is to effectively utilize our  national savings as an objective of macroeconomic policy, and to  relax regulations and stimulate domestic investments. In short,  it is to aim for the expansion of domestic demand and reduce the  conditions that make it necessary for people to save so much.  These things will be linked to a reduction of the  current-account surplus.    We are in a very favorable position to be able to implement  macroeconomic policy objectives. Restrictions due to the labor  shortage have eased up, and fortunately, land prices have come  down. So, we're in the best position now to be able to implement  them. If the Hiraiwa Report and others had clearly indicated  that structural reform would have an impact, in terms of  outcome, on reducing the current-account surplus, then perhaps  the United States and Japan would have been able to come to a  better understanding or find a better resolution to their  disagreements.    [Mikuni] In effect, we have to move in a new direction and  change the way we have been doing things. In a sense, it is the  market which will define that "new direction," but we have to be  ready by creating managerial resources that are more fluid.    Probably one of those ways is to relax regulations, but it  is  also necessary to improve the fluidity of things like the labor  market, the financial capital market, and our product market.    In order to have the kind of system that gives play to the  market function, we have to make those market "rules" much  clearer and try to maintain them. Of course, such a system  doesn't give us the right to act arbitrarily.</p>

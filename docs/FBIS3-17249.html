			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kholenko: "Spring Cleanup for City </F> Trash"]    [Text] The theme of spring trash cleanup in Vladivostok  continued Thursday, following the cleanup from the city  administration of its previous leaders. A conference was held  in the mayor's office on the emergency situation in the city  with respect to medical-sanitary conditions.    "By 9 May the city of Vladivostok must be 'licked  clean'"--stated new head of administration, Konstantin  Tolstoshein, at the outset of the conference. Everyone present  agreed with him.    Attending the conference were the heads of reinstituted  rayon  administrations, militia representatives, medical-sanitation  inspection personnel, and housing department officials. They  reported on the situation and proposed measures for bringing  sanitation order to the city.    The following measures are contemplated. As soon as the  weather brings positive temperatures, work will begin on the  repair and asphalting of city roads in disrepair. Commercial  stalls and sidewalk vendors--the main "suppliers" of trash in  densely populated areas--will be administratively punished for  refusal to clean up their vicinity, up to and including removal  of business licenses and cancellation of contracts for lease of  the land their stalls occupy. It will also be proposed that  enterprises of all forms of ownership conduct trash cleanup of  their surrounding areas.    A problem arises regarding the cleanup of housing unit  areas,  insofar as residential building maintenance services simply lack  the resources to accomplish this. Konstantin Tolstoshein  proposed reinstitution of the fine old tradition of subbotniki  [days of voluntary unpaid labor], so that tenants--to put it  bluntly-- collect the trash around their homes for the city  services to haul away to the dumps.    As far as the financing of road repair and city cleanup is  concerned, according to Tolstoshein, Maritime Kray Governor  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko has promised to assist Vladivostok in this  effort.    Konstantin Tolstoshein expressed certain considerations of  principle at the conference with respect to the future structure  of the city's government. "It is not we who must work for the  structure. The structure must work to benefit the people of  Vladivostok," he stated. Tolstoshein is an "advocate of a city  with functionally capable rayons, rayons with a high level of  independence." In this regard, there will be a restoration in  the rayon administrations of departments for enterprise  registration, departments for registration and distribution of  housing, and other subdivisions. A definitively new structure  of city government will apparently be approved by the end of  next week.    In this regard, the new administration is compelled to  engage  in another kind of cleanup. Efforts are presently underway in  the mayor's office to repeal certain decrees of the previous  administration not conducive to the effective operation of city  structures. Numerous legal proceedings initiated against  various authorities on behalf of the mayor's office are being  revoked.    At the same time, the new head of city administration,  Konstantin Tolstoshein, has refused to repeal free travel on  public transportation in Vladivostok.</p>

[passage omitted]    Here is the reaction of government spokesman Nicolas  Sarkozy.  He was the guest of the RTL program Le Monde:    [Begin Sarkozy recording] What can one say? We can only bow  before the pain felt by the families and tell you that Algeria  is now one of the main concerns of the prime minister. If we  had the time to talk about this longer, the situation in the  whole Mediterranean region is extremely worrying. We have a  special relationship with Algeria, we are close to Algeria  geographically and historically. It is definitely one of the  major concerns of the government at the moment. [end recording]    [Amar] Paris has advised all French nationals residing in  Algeria to leave the country. It must be pointed out that the  list of foreigners who are the victims of Islamic attacks is  getting longer: 34 foreign nationals have been killed since  September 1993, including 10 French nationals.

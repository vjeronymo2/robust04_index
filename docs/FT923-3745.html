			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Northwest, KLM move a step closer to integration NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US airline, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the European carrier which owns a minority stake in Northwest, yesterday filed a request for anti-trust immunity with the US Department of Transportation - a move which could herald the integration of their operations. The airlines said they wanted to open discussions on matters such as common scheduling and planning, revenue-sharing and integration of sales forces. The aim, said Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, was to develop a 'seamless' service for customers using the carriers to travel from Europe to the US. Officials from the two airlines added that the carriers would persist with dual-branding 'for the time being', but conceded that a 'common brand' could be introduced. The formal filing of the anti-trust exemption request with the DoT and the related signing of a commercial co-operation and marketing pact by the carriers yesterday, follows last week's 'open skies' agreement between the Dutch and US governments. This agreement, the first of its kind, ends most restrictions on flights between the two countries and permits KLM to fly into any US city. It also includes a memorandum which says the US would give 'sympathetic consideration' to airlines from the two countries which wished to integrate their systems. KLM invested in Northwest in 1989, when the US carrier was subject to a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out, and currently holds a voting stake of about around 10 per cent.</p>

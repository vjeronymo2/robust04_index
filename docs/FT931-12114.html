			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions THE TREND of director selling, seen since the beginning of the year, has not diminished. As the FT-SE 100 index moves ahead, directors are taking profits. TT Group's relative performance over the short and medium term has been strong. Since the open offer at the beginning of the year at 167p, the industrial group's share price has risen 50 per cent. Sales by John Newman and Nicholas Shipp of 185,000 and 1m respectively still leave them with a sizeable proportion of equity. Three directors dealing at First Leisure raised more than Pounds 3.5m. Final results for the leisure and recreation group were announced the previous week and were slightly ahead of last year. The sales by Michael Payne and Joseph Bollom almost halved their existing holdings but Lord Delfont, the chairman, still retains a considerable number of shares. Kevin McDonald, the chairman and managing director of Polypipe, has sold 2m shares at 128p. He still holds more than 33m. Directors at Caverdale, the motor distributor, have been bucking the trend with sizeable purchases. The company is about to enter its closed period, when directors are not allowed to deal, making this their last buying opportunity for a while.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                  Sector     Shares     Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argyll Group               FdRe    128,375       499            2* Bemrose                    Pack     40,000       113            1 Berry, Birch &amp; Nobl        InsB    110,000       177            2 Body Shop Internatl        Stor      8,320        12            1 Cater Allen                OthF     30,870       125            2* Dewhirst                   Text    158,885        85            2 Diploma                    Elns     35,000       137            1 First Leisure               H&amp;L  1,100,000     3,575            3 Land Securities            Prop     10,000        44            1* Leeds Group                Text     27,000       143            1 LWT Holdings                Med      4,180        13            2 MacFarlane Clansman        Pack     10,000        26            1 Merrydown Wine             Brew     35,128       100            1 Microgen                   Pack    108,500       226            2* MMT Computing              Elns     10,000        12            1 Polypipe                   BdMa  2,000,000     2,560            1 Portmerion Potts           Misc      4,000        13            1 Salvesen (Christ'n)        BuSe    465,556     1,621            1* Shanks &amp; McEwan            Misc  1,000,000     2,230            1 St Ives                    Pack    198,000       630            1 Thames TV                   Med     20,000        36            1 Thorpe                     Elcs     22,000        23            1 TT Group                   EngG  1,016,000     2,508            2 Usborne                    FdMa     75,000        16            1 Warburg SG CnvDef          Merc    175,000       489            1 Warburg SG                 Merc    161,529       882            1 Watmoughs                   Med      1,800        10            1 Windsor                    InsB    500,000        75            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ACAL                       Elns     20,000        44            1 Blenheim Group              Med    150,000       822            1 Caverdale                  Motr  7,761,900       366            3 Consol Venture Tr          InTr     20,000        50            2 Dart                       BuSe     38,000        20            1 Five Oaks Invest           Prop    150,000        18            4 Henlys                     Motr     13,800        12            1 Molyneux                   Prop    200,000        46            2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

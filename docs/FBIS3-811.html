Speaking  to the media before the Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberly  this morning, Dr. Mangope said he still regarded himself as  president of Bophuthatswana, though operating from his residence.    He said the executive management of his political party, the  Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party, would meet later  today to discuss a possible election alliance with the  North-West Democratic Party. The Bophuthatswana Christian  Democratic Party has not registered as a political party, but  the North-West Democratic Party has.    The alliance meeting is to be attended by the leader of the  Freedom Front, General Constand Viljoen, the leader of the  Conservative Party, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and the leader of the  Inkatha Freedom Party, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</p>

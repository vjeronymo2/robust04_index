The traces of Chinese household administrative methods for  economic management under the planned economy model are notably  retained. To meet the needs of market economic development, it  is necessary to deepen reform in the taxation system in  accordance with the principle of unified tax law, fair  tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power  distribution.    First, it is possible to better uphold tax management in  accordance with the law and exercise authority in tax collection  only with a unified taxation law. A unified taxation law is not  only conducive to breaking down man-made boundaries separating  regions and to establishing fair exchanges of commodities among  enterprises in different regions for promoting the establishment  of a unified market, but also conducive to implementing state  guidance and regulation in market economic development. This is  to reflect and bring into play the role of the market mechanism  and to strengthen the unanimity of macroeconomic regulation and  control.    Second, it is possible to ensure fair competition among  enterprises only with a fair tax-sharing system. The precise  reason for the efficiency of market economy is competition.  Enterprises are independent producers and merchandisers of  commodities, and a vital condition for their survival and  development also lies in competition. However, competition must  be fair. Whether or not a fair tax-sharing system can be  implemented bears decisive significance to ensuring fair  competition. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the  principle of fair tax-sharing for all different types of  enterprises for promoting fair competition.    Third, it is possible to optimize the taxation system only  with a simplified taxation system. In the current taxation  system, there is an excessive number of interim tax categories;  an exclusion of a small number of essential tax categories; a  loose taxation system structure; and an irrational distribution  of tax categories, thus affecting the overall efficiency of the  taxation system. The purpose of simplifying the taxation system  is to further rationalize the system structure to make it more  efficient.    Fourth, it is possible to better handle the distribution  between the central authorities and localities only with the  rational distribution of powers. Our country is a vast  territory and economic development in different regions is  rather unbalanced. Therefore, it is essential to suitably change  the situation of the past where the powers in taxation matters  were overconcentrated in the hands of the central authorities,  when it actually could not handle -- or efficiently handle --  tax matters. Under the prerequisite of unifying the taxation  law, tax categories that concern the implementation of state  policy on macroeconomic control and regulation should come under  the control of the central authorities. Tax collection powers  that concern the regulation of industrial production structure  should be undertaken by the central authorities. The authority  for formulating procedures for tax collection and management  favorable to local governments' regulation of local economy and  income, and even the power to enact a few local tax laws, should  all be given to localities.    There is an inherent unity in unified taxation law, fair  tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power  distribution. The core function is to suit the changes in  national income distribution, standardize the distribution  methods, and regulate distribution so as to form a rational  distribution mechanism for promoting a healthy development for  the socialist market economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by reporter Gianoni Mosquera in Brasilia </F> -- live]    [Excerpt] [Mosquera] Helicopter maneuvers continue here  over Tres Poderes Square and the Ministries Esplanade. The  government is displaying its power to deter any possible  reaction by the Federal Police strikers. Four more helicopters  are approaching the square; we can hear the noise they are  making. They were overflying the National Congress esplanade  and the northern area of the city, and are now heading for the  Ministries Esplanade. The military sector and the government  are carrying out these displays. These are Army Puma  helicopters.    [Station announcer] This is not common, is it, Gianoni?    [Mosquera] No, normally they are only used in parades and  military celebrations. Apparently the government is deploying  all these forces to show that it will not accept any sort of  challenge from those who are staging the strike. The government  is determined to have absolute control in case anything happens.    As I reported a few minutes ago, troops have been deployed  here to replace those who had been stationed near Tres Poderes  Square.    [Announcer] Can you see any movement of federal policemen or  landless farmers, or will demonstrations occur later?    [Mosquera] Only a few tourists, and some members of the  military police, can be seen. Civilian police and Federal  Police members can no longer be seen. No demonstrators can be  seen here, near Tres Poderes Square.    [Announcer] What are reactions inside Congress? Despite  having been on the streets, have you had the chance to hear  comments from the congressmen?    [Mosquera] Well, most congressmen are wondering whether the  government isn't exaggerating in this case.    [Announcer] We were listening to an interview inside  Congress  when the noise of helicopters could suddenly be heard. It  attracted the attention of all who were in the building.    [Mosquera] Exactly, all the journalists ran outside to see  what was taking place in the square behind Congress where the  national flag is located, with Planalto Palace at its left and  the Federal Supreme Court to the right.    [Announcer] Is Ricardo Fiuza's case still being analyzed  inside Congress? A few minutes ago we could see on the internal  television circuit that someone was defending Fiuza.    [Mosquera] Yes. We are now nearing the Green Hall, and can  see that Deputy Fiuza is now addressing the plenary session.  [passage omitted]</p>

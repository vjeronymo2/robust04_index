			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China is to invest  another 1.84 billion yuan in two major water-conservancy  projects in the eastern part of the country, an increase of 50  percent over 1993.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng informed a national working  conference on the harnessing of the Huaihe River and Taihu Lake  of this today, adding that the funds will be jointly raised by  the central and local governments.    Premier Li Peng stressed earlier today that all the money  intended for the two projects must be guaranteed and local  people's enthusiasm in joining in the construction be spurred,  according to Chen.    With a total population of 143 million and some 13 million  ha  of arable land, the Huaihe River valley and areas around Taihu  Lake are major grain, cotton and vegetable oil producing  regions. They generate one eighth of China's total agricultural  and industrial output value.    However, the regions are also prone to natural disasters.  Experts say that serious flooding hits the areas every three to  four years. In 1991, when the region was hit by the worst  flooding for years, economic losses amounted to 48 billion  yuan-worth.    So far, 12 out of the 18 key water-conservancy projects in  the Huaihe River valley have been started, with a total  investment of 2.24 billion yuan. Seven out of ten similar key  projects in the Taihu Lake area are under construction with  investment totalling 1.3 billion yuan.    Chen said that the projects in the Taihu Lake area are to be  completed by 1995, and the projects in the Huaihe River valley  are to be completed by the year 2000.    In addition, the state councilor told the meeting that local  governments in the areas concerned must coordinate with one  another in the construction of the projects.</p>

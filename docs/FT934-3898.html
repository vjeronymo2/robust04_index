			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Sour milk and apple pie The question to ask about Gatt is not whether it will add a nice round sum in billions to world output, but what it will do for breast-feeding. The European Union has demonstrated that it can safeguard mothers' milk. Will newborns be able to rely on the protection of the Multilateral Trade Organisation due to be set up to enforce Gatt rules if/when the Uruguay Round of trade talks ends in triumph next week? Maybe not. Let me explain. You may recall the worldwide criticism of Nestle, the Swiss-based food company, for its sales of infant formula in developing countries. The argument ran thus: all mothers lose their own milk very quickly when their offspring are put on the bottle. They are then obliged to buy baby milk. If the producers of bottle-food give it away to new mothers they capture the market. When this happens in poverty-stricken families in, say, Africa the half-starved parents face what is to them a huge bill. They eke out the baby food mix they must buy. It is often over-diluted, probably with unclean water. Many babies die, either of malnutrition or infection. To save Nestle the trouble of faxing in a hot protest I gave them a call. Mr Peter Blackburn, the UK chairman and managing director, says that the company meets World Health Organisation standards on sales and packaging, and that it is working with other manufacturers, governments, the WHO and the United Nations Children's fund to phase out free supplies to maternity wards in developing countries. He can count 127 countries in which there are either phase-out agreements now signed or where there was no free or subsidised marketing in the first place. Mr Blackburn is trying to talk the Church of England and university students out of their boycott of Nestle's instant coffee. Fortunately at my house we mostly use grounds and a filter, so the difficult decision of whether or not to buy Nescafe has rarely been faced. Researching for this article, I found a jar of Gold Blend in our kitchen cupboard. I suspect that Nestle, having been given a huge fright in the 1970s, has spent the past decade in an earnest effort to shake this problem off. It is being helped by regulation, not free trade. Thanks to the European Union the message 'breast milk is best' will appear on all baby milk labels in Britain after June 1994. This will not affect Nestle UK, which does not market the stuff here. The new regulations, available in draft form last week, disallow idealistic pictures of smiling babies on the packet. The deciding vote came in the European Parliament in April 1992. Oxfam is pleased. So am I. Now picture the scene when the new, improved Gatt comes to rule our lives. So far as can be divined at this stage, the plan is to arrange global food standards through a United Nations body, the Codex Alimentarius commission. It will probably supersede the EU mechanism in Europe, although even now, in the final weeks of the negotiations, such details are uncertain. The Codex is run jointly by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. It is a large, slow-moving body whose procedures may be susceptible to influence by large, fast-moving international companies. Do not mistake me, I have not seen any evidence to the effect that the Codex is the tool of rampant, anarchic capitalists, or, for that matter, wide-eyed anti-growth greens. What we do have is an analysis of the commission's 19th session, which ran from 1989 to 1991*. Its authors list the representatives who attended committee meetings in those years. Their tables indicate that while 445 non-governmental participants on national delegations represented industry, only 8 represented public interest groups. The top 15 international food companies sent 85 delegates, 38 of them from Nestle, 18 from Coca Cola, and others from Philip Morris (Kraft), Unilever, Pepsico and the like. You could interpret such figures any way you choose. The company representatives may seek decent standards, in the hope that their particular industry will thus retain customers, while regulation will keep the playing field level. Against that, you might wonder whether the pressure on standards is likely to be downwards, in the short-sighted interest of immediate profits. Sensible companies will take the first view, spurred on by fear of being found out. The others will go for greed and take us to perdition with them. The above brief exposition should convince you that the negotiations that follow the conclusion of the Uruguay Round could be more important for the well-being of the world's people than the round itself. We live in a world in which free trade between liberal economies is assumed to be the optimum recipe for human happiness. It may be - but only if the boundaries of regulation, and public accountability, are properly drawn. Public accountability? On some interpretations the proposed MTO, son of Gatt, could make the Brussels Commission seem reticent, not to say feeble. At least the Commission's acts are eventually unmasked. They are debated in the European Parliament. They are supervised by member governments, acting in councils of ministers. Who knows what the MTO will be able to do? Will it be the old Gatt writ large? As to democratic oversight - a motion on the order paper designating a few hours debate on international trade is guaranteed to empty the British House of Commons. It is different in France. The French minister of foreign affairs, Mr Alain Juppe, told Les Echos the other day that the core issue in the Gatt negotiation is the 'world trade organisation. The day after an agreement is reached . . . we would like to see rules in place, applicable to all, embracing new concerns, especially in the social, ecological and monetary spheres . . .' Anglo-Saxons may expostulate that this is typical of French statism, but such new rules will certainly be proposed in subsequent Gatt negotiations. The environment, which may get only a token mention in the preamble to the MTO charter, will surely be the subject of a new round of talks. Quite right too. A Gatt deal next week may be apple pie, as conventional wisdom has it, but it is not yet motherhood. *Cracking the Codex By Natalie Avery, Martin Drake and Tim Lang.

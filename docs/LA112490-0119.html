			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS PREP QUARTERBACK ELIGIBLE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD TEAM  </P> <P> South Grand Prairie High senior quarterback Bill Shafer, a victim of Texas' "no  pass, no play" regulations, was allowed to play one last game Friday, and he  made it count.  </P> <P> Under Texas University Interscholastic League rules, Shafer and five other  starters were technically eligible only until the hour of the final school bell  Friday (3:10 p.m., CST), after failing at least one course during the last  six-week grading period.  </P> <P> Thus the noon kickoff at Texas Stadium, the first of a scheduled prep playoff  tripleheader, allowed Shafer to start against Arlington High.  </P> <P> Shafer led his team to a 20-15 victory, completing 12 of 27 passes for 215  yards and one touchdown before the game ended at about 2:55 p.m., allowing  Shafer 15 minutes to shower and change. Had the game lasted beyond the 3:10  time limit, he would have been required to take off his uniform and gear and  climb into the stands.  </P></p>

Briefing the visitors on China's foreign policy, Qiao told  the visitors that China supports all endeavors conducive to the  maintenance of world peace and is ready to expand contacts with  as many countries as possible.    Qiao described Sino-Danish ties as "good" and reiterated  that  China wants to have still better relations with Denmark on the  principles of seeking common ground while reserving differences,  mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality and mutual benefit.    Qiao also briefed the visitors on the reform and opening up  in China, particularly the development in Tibet Autonomous  Region.    Peter Duetoft, leader of the visiting group and chairman of  the foreign policies committee of the Danish parliament, told  Qiao that the purpose of their visit is to learn about China's  economic development, which is of significance to Denmark.    Denmark wants to see more exchanges between the two  parliaments and stronger economic ties between the two countries  because China is a vast market, he said.    Earlier today, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian  Qichen met the visitors and explained China's position on some  international issues including China's view on the role of the  United Nations.    Qian and the Danish parliamentarians agreed that the two  sides will make joint efforts for the development of Sino-Danish  political and economic ties, according to a Chinese official.</p>

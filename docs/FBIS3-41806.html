It is difficult to forecast the extent of influenza  epidemics, but a leading researcher said early indicators  pointed to a high level of cases.    Last year was a mild winter for `flu, but an estimated 3,000  to 4,000 people still died. In the winter of 1989/90, considered  to be an epidemic year, between 19,000 and 25,000 died.    Dr. Douglas Fleming, director of the Birmingham research  unit  of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which monitors  flu cases at GP surgeries throughout the country, said that in  the past overall cases of respiratory illness, rather than just  flu, had proved an accurate indicator of trends.    So far this year such cases were running at 50 per 1,000 of  the population, compared with half this number for the same time  last year.    "Forecasting is very difficult, but certainly at the moment  respiratory infections are running at quite a high level. A  number of strains of influenza have already been isolated.    "The message is that flu is about. It is desirable for  people  at high risk to get themselves vaccinated."    Speaking at a meeting in London organised by the Association  for Influenza Monitoring and Surveillance, which is funded by  vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fleming said it was a misconception  that flu was a trivial illness, and every year, apart from  deaths, it put an enormous strain on hospital beds as elderly  people living alone had to be brought in for treatment.    Professor John Oxford, head of virology at the Royal London  Hospital, said the current vaccine could provide around 70  percent protection against the three strains of influenza  circulating this year. Even where people were not fully  protected, they were likely to suffer fewer complications.    He said protection would take place within five days of  people receiving the vaccine, so although it was worthwhile  getting vaccinated early, it was still not too late once an  epidemic had started.    Department of Health advice is that the elderly and those  with long-term conditions such as chest complaints, heart  disease or diabetes should be vaccinated, as should residents of  nursing homes, old people's homes and other long-stay  facilities, where rapid spread is likely.

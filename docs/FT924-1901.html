			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Higher industry costs fuel inflation fears A SHARP RISE in the price of raw materials used by UK industry last month has fuelled fears that inflationary pressures are building in the economy. Producer input prices rose a seasonally adjusted 2.4 per cent in November compared with October, the biggest monthly rise since October 1976. Compared with November last year, input prices rose 4.1 per cent. The increase in the price of imported goods was much higher than expected by the City and may explain why Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has been reluctant to ease bank base rates below 7 per cent, in spite of demands for lower rates from members of the panel of independent economists named last week to advise the Treasury. A survey of the retail sector from the Confederation of British Industry also showed that the rising cost of imported goods has yet to affect shop prices. In its last distributive trades survey before Christmas, the CBI said retail sales volumes fell in November from October, although big retailers showed a stronger performance. Other Central Statistical Office figures yesterday showed stronger than expected output growth by manufacturers in October. Production rose by 0.3 per cent on September, buoyed by stronger growth in the chemicals and electrical engineering sectors. In the three months to October, manufacturing output fell by 0.2 per cent on previous three months, although energy production rose 3 per cent during the same period. The Treasury said manufacturing output was holding at levels 'well above the trough', and added that lower unit labour costs would ease some of the upward pressure on producer prices due to the fall in the exchange rate. The CSO figures showed that prices of raw materials and fuel rose at their highest annual rate in November since December 1989. Until September, prices had fallen almost every month this year. Producer output prices, which measure the prices of goods leaving the factory gate, rose 3.3 per cent in the year to November, unchanged from October, suggesting manufacturers have absorbed higher prices for raw materials. Excluding volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the index rose by 2.4 per cent compared with the same month a year ago, the lowest annual rate of increase since April 1969. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary, said the figures contrasted with the more optimistic tone taken recently by the government. 'They show just how far from recovery this country is, and just how far removed from reality this cabinet has become,' he said.

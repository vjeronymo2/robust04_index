			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Charity quits Rwandan camps Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international medical charity, has evacuated its staff from Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire where lawless Hutu militia have imposed a reign of terror. MSF said soldiers and militia linked to the ousted Rwandan government had taken control of the camps around Bukavu, home to some 250,000 refugees. MSF medical staff have witnessed the intimidation, arrest and assassination of refugees wishing to return to Rwanda. Charity workers who have tried to intervene to save lives have themselves received death threats. Hutu militia carry weapons inside the camps and are drafting young Hutu men into forced military training. They have also taken control of the distribution of food aid. 'The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that it has become ethically impossible for MSF to continue aiding and abetting the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide,' Ms Samantha Bolton, an MSF spokeswoman, said yesterday in Nairobi.</p>

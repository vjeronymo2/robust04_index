			<p>BFN     [Text] Saturday in the village of Berdadzor in  Nagorno-Karabakh's Shusha region, the peacemaking mission of the  CIS Inter-Parliamentary assembly and representatives of  Nagorno-Karabakh authorities discussed the possibility of the  participation of this self-proclaimed republic in the meeting  between the heads of the Armenian and Azerbaijani parliaments  devoted to the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Interfax  received this information from well informed sources in Yerevan,  the Armenian capital. The negotiations between the delegations  in Berdadzor which is situated at equal distances from Armenia  and Nagorno-Karabakh were held behind the closed doors and there  was no official information about the meeting.    The negotiations between the parliament speakers of two  conflicting republics are scheduled for early May in Bishkek,  the Kyrgyz capital.    Our Interfax correspondent who accompanies the mission of  the  Inter-Parliamentary Assembly reports that during the meeting in  Berdadzor the parties spoke in favor of the participation of the  Nagorno-Karabakh delegation in these talks.    Some time earlier Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev spoke  against participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in the  negotiations. In his opinion, representatives of the  parliaments of the Commonwealth's member-countries must  participate in the talks.    On Thursday the peacemaking mission of the CIS Inter-  Parliamentary Assembly headed by the chairman of the Kyrgyz  parliament Meditkan Sherimkulov held negotiations in Baku and  Yerevan.    The delegation of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is  expected to return to Moscow in the evening of April 2.</p>

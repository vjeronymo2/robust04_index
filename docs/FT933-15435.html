			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Europe becomes flashpoint for increase in armed conflicts IN the new world order, Europe, a region with virtually no military conflicts during the Cold War, has become its main arena. In contrast a number of protracted conflicts in Africa are ending and in Central and South America they are declining in number. According to the report, 'Armed Conflict at the End of the Cold War, 1989-92', by the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute, the number of global armed conflicts - particularly minor ones - increased in 1992, while the number of major conflicts remained virtually unchanged. During the four-year period ending in 1992, a total of 82 armed conflicts in 60 locations involving at least 64 governments were identified in the report. The most marked shift in the location of armed conflicts is that Europe has again become a major arena. An escalation of conflicts outside Europe has not occured. The number of armed conflicts in Central and South America has decreased, creating fragile but still less violent conditions. In Africa, solutions have been found, notably in Western Sahara - but not without setbacks, as in Angola. The report warns that the pattern of 1992 - the only clearly post-Cold War year - augurs badly for the future with a sharp rise in minor armed conflicts. The report defines armed conflicts as contested incompatibilities which concern government and/or territory where the use of armed force by two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths during one year. It says that during the four-year period, over one-third of all United Nations member governments were directly involved in at least one armed conflict. Of the 82 armed conflicts, 35 were recorded as wars, resulting in at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a single year. The report estimates more than 70,000 battle-related deaths occurred in 1992 alone while for the fouryears the number of deaths is likley to run to six digits. Last year the number of minor armed conflicts showed a clear increase as the number of intermediate armed conflicts - the more protracted ones - slowly decreased. During the period the number of wars increased slightly. The number of major armed conflicts remained virtually unchanged. The report says the increase in low-intensity conflicts in 1992 may signal future protracted conflicts. Some, including those in Georgia and Moldova, are likley to intensify. 'Nevertheless the number of wars has been kept at a lower level - suggesting that the international community has at least some capacity to contain conflicts. The number of protracted conflicts testifies, however, to the inability to find lasting solutions to well-known conflicts.' The report notes a clear increase of armed conflicts in Europe. In 1989 there were two conflicts, one new and very brief (Romania) and on very old and protracted (Ireland). 'Since then new conflicts have been added continuously.'

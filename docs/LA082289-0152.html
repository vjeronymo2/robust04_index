			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GANG MEMBER GETS 27 YEARS TO LIFE  </P> <P> A Lake View Terrace gang member who shot a man to death at a Sylmar "sweet 16"  party last year was sentenced today to 27 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen sentenced John Tanner, 23,  after denying a defense motion for a new trial.  </P> <P> Tanner and Jeffrey Evans, 24, also of Lake View Terrace, were convicted last  month of murdering John Shaw, 23, as Shaw stood on the front lawn of the house  where the party was being held. A third defendant, Dennis Elliot, 24, of  Pacoima, was acquitted of the murder.  </P> <P> During the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said Tanner, Evans and Elliot  approached Shaw as he stood with other guests in front of the home in the 14900  block of Aztec Street. Evans asked party-goers if they were gang members. Shaw  replied that he was not, and Tanner interpreted that as a slight and shot Shaw  in the back, Nison said.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Coen sentenced Evans to 31 years to life in prison for the  Shaw murder and for his role in a drive-by shooting earlier that night.  </P></p>

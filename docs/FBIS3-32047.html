Here the results are that  the yes vote won over the no vote; that is what matters. What  is worrisome, not just for the government but for the entire  country, is the high abstention rate. We must strengthen the  political parties system through a purge and a reorganization.  We must think about this situation because it means that  somehow the system may be exhausted or that many Guatemalans may  feel that it is.    However, we must also take into consideration the fact that  the consultation was an unprecedented electoral event marked by  a number of very special situations. No local authorities were  elected. Voters usually pay more attention when they are  electing a mayor, deputy, president, or vice president. Added  to this are the vicissitudes that preceded today's electoral  event as well as the terrorist incidents the day before the  consultation. Abstention exists in Guatemala and anywhere there  is an electoral event, but in this case it was rather justified.    Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the abstention rate  was too high. We should all be concerned about this because, in  my opinion, it is either a sign of exhaustion in the democratic  system or of the Guatemalan people's desperation because they  have yet to see any positive results since 1986, when the  democratic process in Guatemala began with a number of problems  and attempts to disrupt institutional order, and the actual  disruption of that institutional order on 25 May.    So we should be concerned. Every leader, every person who  represents some level of power should take action so in five  months the congressional elections will not see such a high rate  of abstention, much less the general elections to be held within  the year. It would be even more serious if that were to happen  in a general election.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] The people's clamor began with the 25 May events.  We managed to meet some of their demands by purging the  executive branch and appointing a new president, vice president,  and ministers. We are still working on the purge. Much remains  to be done. We are still making changes and we are about to  finish the process. However, the Guatemalan people are not  satisfied with that and they are demanding that the president  purge the two other branches of state. We have been discussing  this for almost eight months.    The president of the Republic has implemented legal,  democratic mechanisms, being the eminently democratic president  that he is. During the initial phase he asked the branches of  state to conduct a self-purge and demanded the resignations of  deputies and justices, but those resignations were not  forthcoming. In view of this initial failure, the president  introduced the second phase by calling for a popular  consultation. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal determined that it  would be held on 28 November. The months went by and, of  course, the people encountered other problems and concerns.  Although they continued to make demands, they became justifiably  desperate.    The Constitutionality Court interrupted and suspended the  popular consultation in a decision with which I did not at all  agree but which I had to uphold because ours is a de jure  system. In response to the crisis that was already emerging,  the Court reached an agreement that has been criticized but  which, in the opinion of the president of the Republic,  constituted an effort by the state to prevent an even greater  crisis. We reached an agreement which, in the end, led to the  same goals: a purge, reorganization, and the departure of the  deputies, albeit not as quickly as the people wanted, but their  departure nevertheless, which was decided today by the  Guatemalan people.    Meanwhile, the time that passed -- and this is my opinion,  because a much more thorough examination must be conducted --  led to the people's disillusionment and to the lack of  enthusiasm that existed at the outset. In response to the  conclusions, the misinformation, and the lack of information,  the people had to cope with a very confusing consultation. This  can happen anywhere, and in this case it happened in a country  where there is no deeply rooted democratic or civic culture. On  the contrary, we are just now establishing such a culture, and I  think that is why we have seen this change. That is why we have  seen such a high percentage of abstention. However, that does  not mean that the people who did not vote did not want the  deputies to go. You can rest assured that their intentions are  the same, but the circumstances surrounding the consultation,  the formal part of it, may have prevented a massive turnout for  the elections. That is my opinion.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [De Leon] That will be revealed when the measures are  adopted. If I reveal them now, they will not make an impact.    In other words, within 60 days the reforms will be part of  the Constitution, and within 120 days there will be a call to  elect the new Congress.    [Reporter] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] president  said that 120 days was the minimum term, not that the call had  to be made within the 120 days.    [De Leon] It is the minimum, but according to what has been  discussed and according to what must be done, it means that once  the constitutional reforms go into effective, there is no reason  not to issue the summons. Elections for Congress will come 120  days later. There should be no reason for the TSE not to obey  the summons the Constitution must make during a minimum term of  120 days. What is not allowed is to issue a summons prior to  120 days. We can assume it will be after 120 or 121 days; in  other words, another four months.    [Reporter] What would your position be toward possible  delays  by members of Congress or other organizations that might set  back this timeframe?    [De Leon] This will not take place at a political party  level  or at an institutional level. There is an agenda, a commitment,  an agreement that includes electoral and political party  reforms, which must begin to be drafted next week. The same  holds true for the (?in-house) rules. There could be several  individual deputies who may try and stall things. My position  has nothing to do with justice tribunals. Instead, it will be  dealt with by the appropriate authorities. In view of the way  the vote took place -- this I say as a lawyer, not as president  -- I do not think there is room for any sort of legal challenge.  However, any deputy could do so.    [Reporter] Would you say we will have a new Congress this  year?    [De Leon] Definitely. A new Congress must be installed this  year. Otherwise it would be another blow to the Guatemalan  people, which I would say is dangerous -- more dangerous than  what we just spoke about. The Guatemalan people have been very  patient, but there are limits. You can't play around with the  people. The people should feel satisfied from today that they  have achieved their objectives and their petitions have been  resolved or will be resolved in a matter of months. There  cannot be any more playing around with the people.    [Reporter] Some deputies plan to and have even issued  communiques saying that they plan to lodge appeals of  unconstitutionality, especially regarding the article that deals  with cutting their mandate. Do you think that is possible? Do  you think this could set everything back?    [De Leon] I sincerely do not think so. There is no legal  basis for this, and there have already been legal studies of the  issue. Politically speaking, if some legal entity dared to issue  a ruling, I don't know what would happen in Guatemala. Only  time will tell what will happen if someone wants to take this  risk. I do not think there is a legal entity that would dare.  Anyway, it has no legal basis.    [Reporter] How will you work with Congress from now until  the  end of their term?    [De Leon] Considering all that has taken place since I  became president, I think there has to be an interrelationship  of tasks between the three government branches. There has to be  an interrelationship because the state's goals are the same.  There is only one state, therefore everyone must have the  necessary awareness and maturity to do their jobs until the end  of their term. They have a legislative agenda. I think they  are aware of this and will try to recover their lost prestige,  improve their image a bit, and carry out their legislative work.  In my case, it means achieving goals and fulfilling the  government plan with the available funds and with the  decisionmaking authority that I must have.    [Reporter] What about the relationship?    [De Leon] The relationship must be an interrelationship. It  might be nothing more, but it cannot be anything less.    [Reporter] Some of them [not further identified], including  a  political leader who is involved in one of these organizations  involved in the reform process, spoke about a governability  pact. Would you enter any sort of governability pact with these  people?    [De Leon] I think the governability pact should involve all  sectors of Guatemalan society. In this sense, of course, it is  the duty of the president, who, according to the Constitution,  represents national unity.    Now is the moment to reach agreements -- agreements between  the various sectors that make up Guatemalan society, but most  especially a great national agreement. We are working precisely  to attain these great agreements that allow a governability  pact, which is essential to a transition government such as this  one. It is essential in order to survive until the next  administration which will have long-term plans or at least  medium-term plans and which could have a much more favorable  environment than the one I had to deal with when I became  president.    [Reporter] Much criticism was leveled on the talks between  the Legislative and Executive Branches, which resulted precisely  in the constitutional reforms. Aren't you afraid that speaking  at this moment of a governability pact could be seen as a new  pact with these people?    [De Leon] That is why I mentioned a great national  agreement.  When I speak of a great national agreement I refer mostly to the  first stage, which should be the country's productive sector --  capital and labor, entrepreneurs and workers -- and start there.  When I speak of entrepreneurs and workers, I also refer to the  public sector: help restructure the public sector and hold  dialogues to attain efficiency in the public sector, attain  reduction, even attain salary increases, but not through a  larger payroll, rather by restructuring the public sector. In  the case of the private sector: reach agreements between  entrepreneurs and workers that will give the government time to  take up the measures it needs to take. Afterward, the months  will pass and with a new Congress and a restructured state  within certain government organizations, then we can possibly  involve the political sector to avoid precisely what worries you.    Mind you, before this takes place I believe there should be  an understanding, I repeat the term once again, an interrelation  of tasks between both branches of government that will allow  Congress to develop a legislative agenda and carry out its work.</p>

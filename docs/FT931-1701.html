			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Recovery at Clinton Cards A SHARP recovery was mounted by Clinton Cards, the retailer of greetings cards and associated products, in the year to January 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.31m, compared with a loss of Pounds 163,000. Mr Don Lewin, chairman, drew attention to the 'significant change' in accounting policy with regard to the treatment of reverse premiums received from landlords, a change which had been incorporated in the current results. Until 1992, reverse premiums were credited to the profit and loss account; however, for the year under review, reverse premiums totalling Pounds 327,000 (Pounds 120,000) had been capitalised and would be written off over a period of five years. Group turnover rose to Pounds 80m (Pounds 70.5m) and underlying sales showed an increase of 8.2 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 9.76p (0.96p losses) and the total dividend is increased by 13 per cent to 4.25p (3.75p) with a proposed final of 2.75p.</p>

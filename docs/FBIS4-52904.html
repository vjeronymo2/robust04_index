			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea's Gambling With Nuclear Fuel Rods"] </F>   [Text] North Korea has reportedly begun to change fuel  rods at nuclear reactors without the presence of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team. This  act pours cold water on an atmosphere in which a new phase of  dialogue finally became possible as North Korea agreed to  follow-up inspections, including additional inspections of its  radiochemical laboratory, which has been an issue for a long  time.    North Korea probably has the hidden aim to baffle its  counterparts, the IAEA and the United States, by even more  complicating the nuclear issue to have a favorable negotiating  position. I am greatly concerned about North Korea's act  because it is an extremely dangerous gamble that may cause a  crisis.    The international community, including the United States,  repeatedly warned North Korea that if North Korea proceeded with  changing the fuel rods on its own, they would suspend dialogue  with North Korea and apply sanctions through the UN Security  Council. Accordingly, if North Korea's notification to the IAEA  that it began changing the fuel rods means a full-pledged  change, sanctions against North Korea will become inevitable and  the situation on the Korean peninsula will become more unstable.    When North Korea agreed to the additional inspections of the  radiochemical laboratory and it appeared likely that the IAEA  inspection team would enter North Korea on 17 May to start its  inspection activities, we expected a small breakthrough in  resolving the nuclear issue.    Our expectation was based on the view that North Korea would  postpone changing the fuel rods to seek a solution to the  nuclear problem at the third round of talks with the United  States.    The contents of North Korea's message to the IAEA leaves  room  for negotiations. The message says that North Korea will allow  the preservation of fuel rods for samples if North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks result in a package solution to the nuclear  problem. Also, the position of the IAEA and the United States is  that they will prepare countermeasures after receiving the  results of additional and follow-up inspections, which will be  conducted as planned despite North Korea's notification.    The IAEA inspection team plans to carry out additional  inspections of the radiochemical laboratory in addition to basic  activities -- such as replacing batteries and film in the  monitoring camera installed at the experimental reactor, whose  fuel rods are supposed to be changed this time, and confirming  the seals of the reactor. U.S. policy is that after receiving  the results of these inspections, it will decide whether to hold  the third round of talks with North Korea.    North Korea's attempt to change the fuel rods under this  situation is not a wise decision although it might be a strategy  to lead negotiations in a direction favorable to North Korea.  Changing the fuel rods without IAEA taking samples will only  increase the international community's suspicion that North  Korea is trying to hide its extraction of nuclear materials. In  addition, it will make dialogue with the United States, which  North Korea desires, impossible and will possibly result in  sanctions against North Korea through the UN Security Council.    The international community will hardly put up with North  Korea's dangerous gamble any longer. North Korea is urged to  find a way to negotiations while there is the possibility of  dialogue.</p>

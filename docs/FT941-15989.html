			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Titaghur turns to New York in listing quest Titaghur, the long-established jute manufacturer which lost its London listing in 1990, has turned to New York-based Nasdaq, where it hopes to be listed in the spring. The company, which runs jute mills in India, incurred lower losses of Pounds 4.2m in the year ended March 1993, against Pounds 4.8m, taking its accumulated deficit to a little more than Pounds 61m. Mr Reg Brealey, the chairman who was acquitted of charges of insider dealing in 1991, said in his statement to shareholders that most of the trading loss could be attributed to the last six months of trading and was 'due to a shortage of raw materials and a massive increase in their cost over the harvest purchase price'. A Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) bond linked with the listing was currently under negotiation in New York, he said. The money would be used, among other things, to pay for storage facilities at Greenock and Glasgow to supply customers in the UK and Europe and to pay off Pounds 2m of capital loans. The shares, worth Pounds 16.88 at their peak in 1989, were trading in London on a matched bargain basis at 24p yesterday. The company is expecting 'significant improvements' in its trading position. It has installed new management in the mills and reduced its labour force to 18,000 by not replacing 2,000 workers who had reached retirement age. It has agreed with the unions a deal to reduce the number of workers per tonne of jute from nearly 50 to 40, which could lead to the loss of a further 2,200 jobs. The annual meeting takes place in London on January 31. See Observer</p>

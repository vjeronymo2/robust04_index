			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSES DIVIDE TO CONQUER HIGH RENTS;  </P> <P> MOVE: AS THE FLOW TO GLENDALE'S HIGH-RISE DISTRICT CONTINUES, "BACK-SHOP"  WORKERS ARE BEING SPLIT OFF INTO CHEAPER QUARTERS ELSEWHERE.  </P> <P> Even as office space continues to multiply on North Brand Boulevard and Central  Avenue, major Glendale employers already are looking for ways to move their  huddled masses to less expensive quarters.  </P> <P> The exodus mirrors an emerging phenomenon in which more prestigious companies  are moving to Glendale's high-rise corridor as its reputation becomes more  upscale.  </P> <P> Fidelity Federal Bank, which has its headquarters at 600 N. Brand, set the lead  18 months ago. Almost half of the bank's 800 employees -- the "back-shop  workers" who handle the computer data processing and administrative services of  the operation -- moved to a handsome but simple building in an industrial  section just outside of town, away from the public eye and the heavy transit  corridors.  </P> <P> That has left more room in the bank's downtown headquarters to corporate  executives whose power is often evidenced by the amount of space they command.  </P> <P> Other major employers may follow suit.  </P> <P> City officials and development experts predict that as land values and the cost  of office space rises in the downtown area, the mushrooming populace of back  office workers will gradually be replaced by front office executives.  </P> <P> "It's just barely happening, but it will get stronger," said the city's  redevelopment consultant, Frank L. Fuller of ELS Design Group, at a recent  meeting with the City Council.  </P> <P> He cited the Carnation Co., which will move its 40-year-old headquarters from  the mid-Wilshire district to 800 N. Brand Blvd. this year, as an example.  "We're going to see more headquarters-type people moving to Glendale," Fuller  said.  </P> <P> Instead of the typical office space of 250 square feet per employee, companies  will start allocating 500 to 600 square feet of space for their higher-ranked  executives. The prestige of a Brand Boulevard address warrants the increased  cost, Fuller and other experts agree.  </P> <P> Rental rates in the downtown area have jumped to about $25 per square foot, up  from about $18 a square foot just five years ago, said Tony Maniscalchi, vice  president of The Prudential Stevenson Real Estate, a specialist in commercial  and industrial properties. In contrast, office space for back-shop workers can  be obtained in industrialized zones for 30% to 35% less, he said.  </P> <P> Charles Braden, executive vice president of Fidelity Federal, said the decision  to move back-office operations to an industrial zone was made almost three  years ago to consolidate operations that were scattered at six smaller  locations around Glendale.  </P> <P> The bank bought a former manufacturing plant adjacent to the Golden State  Freeway, conveniently located at the Edenhurst Avenue on- and off-ramps to the  Colorado Street freeway extension. The remodeled two-story complex -- with its  sprawling grounds, rolling lawns, picnic areas and even a basketball court --  is a welcome haven for workers away from the bustle of downtown, Braden said.  </P> <P> In addition to saving costs, Braden said, the operation in the high-security  building is more efficient by having employees clustered on only two floors,  rather than spread out over several floors of a high rise. "Paper flow works  better across rather than up and down in elevators," Braden said.  </P> <P> Fidelity is not alone. Security Pacific National Bank, which employes about  1,800 workers at its technical services center at 611 N. Brand, "has no plans  to relocate," said Deborah K. Lewis, senior vice president of corporate  communications. However, a portion of the employees in the credit card  processing unit in Glendale will be moved early this year to Arizona, she said.  </P> <P> The subtle changes in the use of office space could have a dramatic effect on  the future of Glendale's redevelopment zone, city officials and their advisers  say. For instance, employing fewer workers in higher-profile jobs in the  downtown area could reduce the amount of parking spaces needed in high-rise  office buildings and, consequently, the amount of traffic on the most heavily  traveled corridors, said Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment director.  </P> <P> While the city in the past has required developers to provide sufficient  parking space to accommodate a maximum number of employees, officials now are  considering limiting the amount of parking permitted in new buildings.  </P> <P> The policy could trigger greater use of buildings for executive offices or  force employers to provide employee parking elsewhere, coupled with shuttle  service to and from work, just as the Glendale Galleria transports workers, who  must park at the Los Angeles Zoo during the busy holiday shopping season.  </P> <P> The shift toward more executives in downtown buildings is accompanied by the  city's effort to lure more upscale tenants to downtown. Twentieth Century  Insurance, for instance, leases a full floor in the 550 N. Brand building where  it operates a regional claims adjustment office. The site was chosen because  "it is convenient and easily accessible to a large concentration of customers,"  said Ric Hill, vice president of corporate relations.  </P> <P> The Universal City law firm of Knapp, Petersen &amp; Clarke this year will move  its cadre of 75 attorneys, backed by a 125-member support staff, to the 500 N.  Brand building. Law firms typically demand greater floor space -- in this case,  58,000 square feet -- than other office users, according to the Glendale  Development Council, a public-private group promoting the downtown area.  </P> <P> Richard L. Botti of Keyser Marston Associates, the city's real estate and  development consultant, recently told officials that North Brand "is more  attractive today than it was five years and 10 years ago" to high-end tenants  who are now moving to town because "they have seen that the value and character  along Brand Boulevard is going to be maintained."  </P></p>

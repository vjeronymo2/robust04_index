			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK construction The last thing the nervous housing market needs is a rise in interest rates, so this week's unexpectedly good July inflation figures provided a little reassurance. There was scant cheer elsewhere. The 10 per cent drop in building societies' net new commitments compared with the previous month suggests the housing recovery has not merely stalled but is stuck in a ditch. Given that the economic background could scarcely be better it is hard to see what would dig it out, barring that illusive improvement in consumer confidence. Housebuilders are being squeezed at both ends. Materials price rises are sticking. Meanwhile, stagnant new house prices will soon start to make life hard for those builders who stocked up their land banks in the expectation that prices would start to rise. Having bid up the leading construction groups' shares last year on the basis of the housing recovery, investors are now focusing on their commercial and infrastructure sides. It is not a pretty picture. Although volumes are up, margins are thin with low interest rates reducing the cash-flow benefit of advance payments. BICC warned this week it could see little respite with any growth dependent on the long hoped-for flood of private sector infrastructure projects. The construction sector has underperformed the market by 20 per cent since its February peak. Given the downbeat comments which are likely to accompany the forthcoming reporting season it is hard to see it climbing out of the hole in a hurry.</p>

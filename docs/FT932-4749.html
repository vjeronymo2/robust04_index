			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley faces Pounds 1m legal claim THE government was yesterday faced with a Pounds 1m damages claim in the latest stage of a legal tussle over restrictive practices in British medical accreditation. Dr Anthony Goldstein, a London rheumatologist, issued a High Court writ against Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, claiming damages for loss of earnings over the past 11 years. He claims that he has suffered financially because of government failure to implement 1975 EC medical directives properly. Dr Goldstein has been active in a campaign against the UK government's approach to the directives, which were designed to establish mutual recognition of medical qualifications within the EC. Earlier this year he argued successfully in the High Court that UK criteria for awarding specialist medical accreditation breached the EC regulations, but failed to win damages. Although Dr Goldstein holds a European specialists' certificate - intended to achieve the mutual recognition of qualifications - he argues that the UK medical authorities have failed to give it full effect. 'This is essentially a Pounds 1m damages claim following a deliberate breach of EC law by Britain since 1976,' he said yesterday. In January a working party chaired by Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, acknowledged that Britain's system of specialist accreditation, run by the medical royal colleges, had operated in tandem with the EC scheme.</p>

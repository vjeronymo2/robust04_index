			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Frank E. Lippold: "Taiwan Hoping for German </F> Activity"]    [Text] Berlin/Taipei -- In view of Germany's restrictive  arms export law, Taiwan has given up hope of a business deal in  the field of maritime arms technology that would be lucrative  for both sides. Taiwan will now build the needed warships  itself. On Monday [28 March], the second of eight frigates  carrying missiles of the Hsiung Geng-II type was put into  service.    Nevertheless, Taiwan wants to improve bilateral relations,  especially trade relations -- in spite of the Federal  Government's pro-Beijing policy. They feel encouraged in this  view by the fact that with the current German ambassador to Sri  Lanka and Bangladesh, Claus Franke, a diplomat will become the  new head of the German trade mission in Taipei. Posting the  62-year-old does not, however, mean that -- as has been reported  in Taiwan -- this office "has for the first time been given to  an official representative of the Foreign Ministry." NEUE ZEIT  has been told by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn that Franke will  be given leave to take on his future work for the Federation of  German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], which runs the  Taipei office.    But even without upgrading the German representation, April  might take a special place in the history of German-Taiwanese  relations. First, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt wants to  visit the republic before going to mainland China, and second, a  partnership agreement is to be signed by the districts of  Greifswald (Mecklenburg) and Nantou (Central Taiwan) in the  second week of April.  <H5>  Closer Cooperation Between Local Authorities </H5>   The agreement, which is to be signed by Councillors Herbert  Kautz and Yuang-Lang Lin, is the second such agreement between  districts in the Republic of China and the new laender. In the  summer of 1993, Annaberg (Saxony) and Kaohsiung agreed on  cooperation. The visit to Halle in mid-April of Po-Rung Lin,  the mayor of Taichung, might bring about another agreement.  Several important representatives of industry are expected to  accompany the head of the third largest community in Taiwan.</p>

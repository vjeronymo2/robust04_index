Nevertheless, even if these facilities generated all their TC soils after today's rulemaking, the impact on LDR treatment capacity would be minimal because these facilities were expected to generate only 5,300 tons of TC soils. Therefore, only 5,300 tons of TC soils generated by surface impoundment closures might require off-site treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also reviewed the TC data base and public information on specific facilities to assess the TC soil generation rate from routine and sporadic activities that might require off-site disposal. For this analysis, the Agency assumed that routine activities and the quantity of soil generated should be considered constant over time when analyzing the generator population as a whole. However, for sporadic activities (e.g. surface impoundment closures), which by their nature occur infrequently, the year in which they occur is critically important in determining the required capacity for soil when the rule becomes effective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the TC Survey, some TC wastes were only characterized as a mixture of soil and debris. For the lower bound estimate (70,000 tons), the Agency assumed a 50&hyph;50 ratio of soil and debris in mixtures characterized as soil and debris. Using this assumption, EPA estimates that approximately 70,000 tons of TC soils generated by routine and sporadic activities will require additional treatment annually. In addition, in this lower bound estimate, the Agency assumed that all facilities were able to manage the TC soils generated from surface impoundment closures prior to the effective date of today's rule. Therefore, for the lower bound estimate, no TC soils from surface impoundment closures are expected to require additional treatment capacity. Based on these assumptions, the Agency calculates that the lower bound estimate is 70,000 tons of TC soils per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the upper bound estimate, the Agency assigned the entire quantity of mixtures of soil and debris reported in the TC survey as TC soils. As a result, the TC soil generation rate for routine and sporadic activities increased by about 20,000 tons. The Agency conducted a similar review of facilities that submitted confidential business information (CBI) concerning TC soil generation rates. When assuming a 100 percent of mixtures were TC soils, these facilities were estimated to generate an additional 53,000 tons of TC soils for a total of 143,000 tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To verify the accuracy of the upper bound estimate, the Agency contacted individual facilities to determine actual TC soil generation rates. Based on these contacts, the TC data base overestimated TC soil generation from routine and sporadic activities. Many facilities stated that actual generation rates were lower or that the estimate included one time wastes from surface impoundment closures that already occurred. Therefore, when the Agency revised the upper bound estimates, TC soil generation rates for routine and sporadic activities at all facilities (non-CBI and CBI facilities) were approximately 114,000 tons. After adding the 5,300 tons of TC soils generated by surface impoundment closures, the estimated upper bound quantity of TC soil requiring additional treatment is approximately 120,000 tons per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to reduced generation of TC soils from surface impoundment closures in 1994 and 1995 and overestimations of TC soil generation rates from routine and sporadic activities, the Agency estimates that between 70,000 and 120,000 tons per year of TC soils will require off-site treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the proposed rulemaking, the Agency was uncertain concerning the quantities of TC soil generated from manufactured gas plants (MGP). Most of the soil generated at these plants is expected to be contaminated with benzene. EPA requested updated information on the generation and management of these wastes and on whether there will be sufficient commercial treatment services to treat these wastes on-site. No comments were received that specified quantities of soil generated or discussed commercial capacity for contaminated soils. While EPA acknowledges that generation of TC-contaminated soil from MGP will occur, the Agency expects that most of this quantity will be managed on-site and will not require off-site or commercial treatment capacity. Therefore, EPA has concluded that TC-contaminated soil from MGPs will not significantly affect the required treatment capacity for soil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, several commenters to the ANPRM indicated that EPA may have underestimated the annual quantities of hazardous soil generated. Some commenters provided site specific data on the quantities of soil generated during remedial actions. The Agency incorporated these data in its analysis of the required capacity for hazardous soil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, EPA requested comments on the use of innovative technologies for hazardous soil. Specifically, EPA requested information on constraints to the use of these technologies both on- and off-site, including physical or chemical characteristics of the wastes, and logistical constraints such as permitting and scheduling. One commenter noted that to treat soil on-site requires permitting and approval by local, state, and federal agencies, which may be a problem for some innovative technologies. Another said that the chemical concentration to which a soil can be biotreated is influenced by the particular chemical, the soil type, the age of the contaminated media, and the bioremediation process. EPA has taken these comments into account in estimating the available capacity provided by innovative technologies for the treatment of hazardous soil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Russia-Estonia agreement on troops pullout The presidents of Russia and Estonia yesterday signed an agreement under which the remaining 2,000 Russian troops in Estonia will leave by August 31. A brief statement to the official news agency Tass said that 'the presidents of Russia and Estonia signed an agreement today that the rights of the Russian military pensioners would be respected equally to the rights of Estonian citizens. They also signed an agreement in accordance with which Russian troops are withdrawn from Estonia before August 31'. President Boris Yeltsin, emerging after six hours of talks with his Estonian opposite number, Mr Lennart Meri, commented that the negotiations were 'pretty hard'. The formula appears to mean that the Estonian side will pay pensions and offer the rights of citizenship to those among 10,000 Russian officers who have reached retirement age, but not to those among them in their thirties and forties whom the Estonians believe are present or former secret policemen who have been actively engaged in espionage and other anti-state activities.</p>

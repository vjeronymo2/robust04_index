Bulgaria withdraws its reservations on  Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the  Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces, on Article 10  of the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the  Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, on  Articles 10, 12 and 85 on the Convention Relative to the  Treatment of Prisoners of War, and on Articles 11 and 45 of the  Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in  Time of War.    By a special act parliament ratified the Treaty for Friendly  Relations and Cooperation Between Bulgaria and Belarus signed in  October 1993 in Sofia. The treaty outlines the basic trends in  cooperation in trade and payments, education, science, culture  and transport.    By a special act parliament ratified the "Open Skies" Treaty  signed in March 1992 in Helsinki. The treaty regulates  reconnaissance flights by unarmed aircraft over the signatories,  outlining a complex system of quotas and agreed technology.    Parliament ratified Bulgaria's credit agreement with Japan's  Export-Import Bank signed last June in Tokyo. The agreement is  for U.S.$100 million. The loan is extended in the form of  co-financing the World Bank's structural adjustment loan. "The  loan is granted at a time when this country is actually isolated  in the international credit market and will have a positive  effect on the stabilization of Bulgaria's economy and its  successful adjustment to market principles," the prime minister  wrote in his request to parliament for the ratification of the  agreement.    Parliament also ratified the financial agreement between  Bulgaria and the European Investment Bank (the Bulgarian  Airspace Development and Control Project) signed in Luxembourg  last July. The agreement is for ECU 30 million and will help  upgrade Bulgaria's system of air navigation services.    Parliament passed on second reading parts of the road  traffic  law.    The registration of a fifth parliamentary group --  "Nezavisimost" ("Independence"), was announced today. It  comprises deputies who left the ethnic Turks' Movement for  Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the anti-communist Union of  Democratic Forces and the coalition of the formerly communist  Socialists. Making this announcement, National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that the "tendency towards a  multiplication of parliamentary groups does not contribute to  political stability." "The new formations are established far  from the electors and create certain difficulties in  parliament's work," Mr. Yordanov said.    At the beginning of today's sitting Socialist MP Yanaki  Stoilov announced that the parliamentary faction of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is ready to discuss the closing  down of the Legislative Committee in order to unblock the  legislative process. Mr. Stoilov demanded changes in the  Parliamentary Rules of Procedure which would no longer make it  possible for the Legislative Committee to stop bills. According  to Mr. Stoilov many important bills are being held up in the  Legislative Committee.    According to Mr. Nino Stavrov MP of the BSP, at a session of  the Parliamentary National Security Committee earlier today,  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said that Bulgaria's stand  on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is neutrality. "This  country is for a peaceful solution of the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia," Mr. Daskalov said, according to Mr. Stavrov. The  committee heard today Colonel Stefan Dimitrov nominated as chief  of the National Security Service.    DPS MP's had talks today with Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov. The DPS asked for the allocation of more funds to  the construction to country roads.</p>

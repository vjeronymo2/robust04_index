			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE WRESTLING TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SIMS, MOLLKOY, PASTORELLO, COOPER WIN TITLES TO LEAD COUNTY SHOWING  </P> <P> This was for the state wrestling championship, wasn't it? It was hard to tell  the way Woodbridge High School's Heath Sims ripped through the competition --  if you want to call it that.  </P> <P> Sims (55-1), who won the 132-pound championship last year, was one of a record  four Orange County wrestlers -- which included Katella's Chris Mollkoy (154  pounds) and Joe Pastorello (175) and Canyon's Zach Cooper (191) -- to win a  state title Saturday during the CIF state wrestling tournament at the  University of the Pacific.  </P> <P> Sims pinned Monte Vista's Dustin Harless just 1:05 into the 138-pound final. En  route to the title, Sims pinned one opponent and beat the other three by a  combined score of 42-8. He won his semifinal match, against San Jose's Chung  Le, 19-4.  </P> <P> Does the phrase "no sweat" ring a bell?  </P> <P> "I was wrestling so well," Sims said. "I felt great the whole tournament. My  confidence was real high."  </P> <P> Sims was so dominant that, though he was the school's only state qualifier,  Woodbridge finished 13th in the team standings with 30.5 points.  </P> <P> Just as impressive was Katella's team of Mollkoy and Pastorello, who placed  their school in a tie for third with Clovis with 51.5 points.  </P> <P> Clovis West, which had five wrestlers in the tournament, won the team title  with 57 points points. El Monte's Arroyo finished second with 52.5 points.  </P> <P> Mollkoy (43-2), after falling behind, 2-0, early in the 154-pound final against  Yosemite's Caleb Roope, took command to win, 7-5.  </P> <P> "You know, I really didn't think I wrestled that well," Mollkoy said. "But I  won, and this is what I've been aiming for since the first day of practice."  </P> <P> Pastorello had a much more difficult time in his final against Westlake's Bill  Hunter. Pastorello performed an escape early in the second period, and made the  1-0 score stand up for the title.  </P> <P> It was the third time these two had wrestled this season, Pastorello had taken  the first two -- at the 4-A finals and Masters meet -- 8-1 and 5-2.  </P> <P> "He (Hunter) learned some new tricks," Pastorello said. "He's really improved."  </P> <P> In what might have been the finals' most exciting match, Cooper defeated  Clovis' Renee Carlos, 7-6, in overtime on a reversal in the last 5 seconds.  </P> <P> "This is incredible," said Cooper, who finished his season 45-0.  </P> <P> Canyon finished sixth with 45 points.  </P> <P> "He's the toughest guy I've wrestled this year," Cooper said. "He's got to be  so bummed right now."  </P> <P> Canyon's Ravi Ramsamooj lost his semifinal match to Covina's Tony Trujillo,  3-0, the same score of their Masters final last week. Trujillo went on to win  the 112-pound championship.  </P> <P> Ramsamooj beat El Camino Real's Greg McMurray, 11-5 in the third-place  semifinal, but lost to El Camino's Michael Grubbs in the third-place match,  9-2.  </P> <P> Savanna's Tony Okada lost to Overfelt's Javier Gonzales in the semifinals, and  lost again in the third-place semifinals, 2-0, against Poway's Dale Hanover.  Okada, a sophomore, placed fifth when his fifth-place opponent, Bullard's  DeWayne Zinkin, defaulted because of injury.  </P> <P> Okada's teammate, Mike Verbeck, lost his semifinal match to Arroyo's Elfrin  Gonzales, 7-2 and lost the third-place semifinal, 5-0, to North Bakersfield's  Joe Cemo. Verbeck took fifth place when his opponent, Rio Mesa's Rob Cook,  defaulted.  </P></p>

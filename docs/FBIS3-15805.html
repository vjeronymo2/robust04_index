			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Asked by INTERFAX on Wednesday [9 March], whether he  will receive ex U.S. President Nixon, now in Moscow, Russia's  President Yeltsin toughly declared: "No". He added: "Neither  the government nor Filatov (the presidential administration  chief -- IF) will receive him."    "After the meetings that Nixon has had here, this is  impossible, and I am glad that U.S. President Clinton shares  this view. One should not behave as he pleases in Russia.  Russia is a Great country," said Yeltsin.    During his current stay in Moscow, Nixon met with a number  of  officials, among them Russia's former president Alexander  Rutskoy, just released from Lefortovo jail, the Communist Party  leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, the cabinet member and leader of the  Russian Unity and Concord Party's faction in Duma Sergey  Shakhray, and the leader of another parliamentary faction  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy.    At the same time, Yeltsin stressed that we will do all we  can so that what has been gained through Russo-American  cooperation should not be lost. This is a very useful plus, and  our goal is that at a meeting of the chiefs of the two countries  foreign policy departments in Vladivostok (to be held on March  14 - IF), new opportunities will be explored to promote this  cooperation."    On the Ames scandal in U.S., Yeltsin said: "Well, it is the  intelligence service's business. This is a natural state of  relations between any countries, but this cannot be crucial to  Russo-American relations."    Yeltsin answered an INTERFAX reporter's question at a  wreath-laying ceremony near Gagarin's burial site by the Kremlin  wall. The ceremony was held to mark the sixtith birthday of the  world's first cosmonaut.</p>

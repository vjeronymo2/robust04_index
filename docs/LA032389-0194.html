			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> $4.55 MINIMUM WAGE BILL SENT TO U.S. SENATE FOR OK  </P> <P> The House passed legislation today to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.55  after rejecting President Bush's more modest offer of an increase to $4.25,  sending the partisan battle to the Senate for another round next month.  </P> <P> The vote was 248 to 171.  </P> <P> "It isn't enough but it certainly is better than nothing," House Speaker Jim  Wright said of the legislation during a floor speech in favor of the Democrats'  bill.  </P> <P> Passage came after a 240-179 vote to amend the legislation to set the final  level of the minimum wage at $4.55 an hour and add a provision allowing  employers to pay new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum wage for two  months.  </P> <P> Earlier, Bush's proposal, offered by Republicans as a substitute for the  Democrats' bill, was defeated 218 to 198, with more than 40 Democrats joining  the GOP effort.  </P> <P> "I see no defensible argument to say that is adequate," Rep. Augustus F.  Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) said of Bush's offer of an hourly minimum wage of $4.25  by 1992.  </P> <P> Hawkins was the sponsor of the Democratic bill, which originally called for the  minimum wage to rise to $4.65 an hour by 1992. But he supported the amendment  rolling back the final target by a dime while at the same time moving the  effective dates of the increases forward, each by three months.  </P> <P> Under the amendment, the first increase -- from $3.35 an hour now to $3.85 --  would take effect Oct. 1.  </P></p>

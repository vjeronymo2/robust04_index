			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dyson static at Pounds 340,000 ON SHARPLY lower sales J&amp;J Dyson's pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 were little changed at Pounds 340,600, against Pounds 347,300 last time. The company makes refractory products and trailers. It also sells motor vehicles and acts as a builders merchant. Dyson said that despite the decline in sales to Pounds 21m (Pounds 25.6m) profits had been protected by the company's strategy of pursuing niche opportunities in its main markets. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p on earnings per share of 1.65p (1.68p).</p>

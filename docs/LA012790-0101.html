			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE MAN WHO SHOWED ELWAY THE WAY;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: AFTER LAUNCHING A LEGEND AT GRANADA HILLS, VISTA'S JACK NEUMEIER  CHANGED THE HIGH SCHOOL GAME IN THE NORTH COUNTY.  </P> <P> It was a time when John Elway occasionally went to the no-huddle offense in the  first quarter and rarely ran with the football, content to leave the scrambling  to the defensive backs.  </P> <P> These were the late 1970s, and Elway was establishing himself as the premier  high school quarterback in the country at Granada Hills. More significant,  perhaps, Elway was becoming adept at winning football -- as taught by Jack  Neumeier.  </P> <P> Neumeier, who coached at Granada Hills from 1960-1978 and in San Diego County  from 1979-88 (at Fallbrook, Escondido and Torrey Pines), devised for the 1970  season at Granada Hills a high-tech passing scheme that produced instant  results and a City Section title. His concept of spreading the defense from  sideline to sideline was basic, but its application was more difficult. What  Neumeier needed was a strong-armed quarterback who believed in his passing  philosophy.  </P> <P> John Elway believed.  </P> <P> Elway understood the wisdom of operating the shotgun on first down when the  defense wasn't prepared to stop the pass. And he understood the reasoning  behind sending two receivers to each sideline on goal-line situations so the  concentration of defenders attempting to stop the run was reduced.  </P> <P> Elway not only believed, he achieved. He passed for 5,701 yards and 49  touchdowns in his three-year career, which ended suddenly with a knee injury  midway through his senior season in 1978. Playing in only six games his final  season, Elway threw for 1,837 yards and 19 touchdowns, completing 129 of 198  passes.  </P> <P> "I guarantee it, he could have thrown for over 4,000 yards if he hadn't got  hurt," said Neumeier, now 71 and living in Vista. "I knew we were going to  break the national record. . . . I never thought I'd lose John, because I  protected John."  </P> <P> Elway, then 6-feet-2, 170 pounds, was hurt while scrambling. Oddly, he showed  few signs in high school of his later running ability for Stanford and the  Denver Broncos, who will meet the San Francisco 49ers in Sunday's Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "When he played for me," Neumeier said, "he wasn't allowed to (run downfield).  I told him, 'If you take off, you got to get out of bounds. It's amazing he  hasn't got killed (in the National Football League)."  </P> <P> Neumeier's short passing game, in which Elway dropped back only one or two  steps before firing, also kept Elway away from the pass rush. This was one of  the keys in Granada Hills' 24-14 regular-season victory over Banning in Elway's  senior year. Elway completed 12 of 17 passes for 169 yards and one touchdown.  </P> <P> "Granada Hills had the best passing attack we ever faced," said Chris  Ferragamo, who coached Los Angeles Banning at the time and is now a Long Beach  City College assistant. "Elway would look to the left on a slant pass and then  throw to the right on a slant, and it was unheard of.  </P> <P> "Jack Neumeier was one of the innovators in the City. He was using four wide  receivers and a single back, and that was the thing of the future."  </P> <P> Neumeier turned to the passing game and abandoned his ball-control,  run-oriented offense after his team finished 6-2 in 1969 but failed to qualify  for the playoffs.  </P> <P> Explaining his passing philosophy, Neumeier said: "Basically, my offense  spreads the defense across the field. A lot of teams spread the defense the  depth of the field, like the Raiders, but my idea is to spread them sideline to  sideline so you never get two defensive backs to cover one receiver.  </P> <P> "And when you catch the defense in a one-on-one, the receiver would go to an  open spot and should get there before the defender because he knows where he's  going."  </P> <P> Neumeier's offense, which became known as "Happy Jack's Flying Circus,"  continued to fly even after Elway's injury in 1978. Using 5-foot-9, 150-pound  Walter Seymour as Elway's replacement, Neumeier maintained his pass-happy  philosophy, and Granada Hills won four of its last five games.  </P> <P> After recovering, Elway got one final chance to operate under Neumeier's  system. Playing in the 1979 Shrine All-Star Game at the Rose Bowl, Elway  completed 23 of 37 passes for 363 yards and four touchdowns in three quarters  as his North team overwhelmed the South, 35-15.  </P> <P> Elway's biggest season came in his junior year when he passed for 3,039 yards  and the team advanced to the semifinals.  </P> <P> Jack Elway, former coach at Stanford and John's father, said "probably John's  greatest break came from going to Granada Hills and being tutored by Jack  Neumeier. John was his real protege. He was planning on retiring when John was  a sophomore but he coached two more years until John graduated, and we're  thankful for that."  </P> <P> After moving to Fallbrook following the 1978-79 school year, Neumeier wound up  serving as an offensive assistant for the trio of San Diego County schools,  whose coaches solicited his assistance. Neumeier coached his third 3,000-yard  passer in 1986 when Fallbrook's Scott Barrick threw for 3,503 yards in leading  his school to the section 3-A title. Barrick spent two years (one as a  red-shirt) at San Diego State before moving to Palomar College, where he passed  for 3,624 yards last year. He has committed to Stephen F. Austin for next  season.  </P> <P> Neumeier coached at Fallbrook for six years in the '80s under Tom Pack.  </P> <P> "One of the main changes that took place in the 1980s in North County," Pack  said, "was throwing the football."  </P> <P> Neumeier coached his last season in 1988 for Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> "I think I got more recognition here than in L.A.," said Neumeier, laughing.  "They weren't used to that stuff here. I think they got mad at me for bringing  it here."  </P> <P> Neumeier gives the Super Bowl edge to San Francisco because of its  short-passing game.  </P> <P> "I've never seen John throw a quick pass," said Neumeier, "and that's a  disadvantage to John because they can put a rush on him."  </P> <P> But things are going much better for Elway at this stage of his NFL career than  Neumeier thought they might be.  </P> <P> "At the beginning, I was really discouraged," Neumeier said. "But they've  changed. They weren't going to the shotgun much then. All they were doing was  throwing deep and getting a lot of interceptions."  </P> <P> But Neumeier now has no complaints.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid at the end of his career, they'll say, 'There's one of the greatest  athletes with the greatest potential,' and they'll look at his numbers and say  he didn't have the highest passing efficiency," Neumeier said. "But I'm sure  he's going to be a Hall of Famer because they'll look at how many games he led  the team to wins, and that's the important thing."  </P></p>

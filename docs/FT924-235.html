			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / AMR agrees share stake deal with Canadian Airlines AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, yesterday announced plans to invest CDollars 246m (USDollars 192m) into a restructured Canadian Airlines, in exchange for a 33 per cent economic interest in the loss-making carrier and a 25 per cent voting stake. The share stake deal comes as part of a broader agreement between AMR and PWA, Canadian's parent company, under which Canadian has agreed to sign a 20-year services contract with AMR. This requires the Canadian airline to buy a range of airline administrative services from American. The services contract is designed to cut Canadian's costs, but would probably eliminate around 1,200-1,300 jobs. AMR says the agreement should produce revenues of Dollars 2bn over the two decades, with the first full year generating Dollars 115m. Canadian, which lost CDollars 105.6m after tax in the first nine months of 1992, will also tie up its frequent flier programme with American's, so that Canadian passengers can earn credits for flights with American (and vice versa). Canadian's international routes, mainly to Europe and Asia, will remain under its direct control. AMR said that this was 'the most comprehensive package' of services it had ever sold to another carrier. Among the administrative functions which the Canadian carrier will buy from AMR are accounting, data-processing and communications operations. The deal is a key step in Canadian's restructuring. AMR will receive convertible preferred stock, providing it with the 25 per cent voting stake in Canadian. PWA will retain 75 per cent. The US carrier will be entitled to designate two of the eight members of Canadian's board of directors. However, AMR said it would not control any of Canadian's 'major strategic business decisions'. The deal requires both US and Canadian government approval. A tie-up between the two carriers has been complicated by the requirement that Canadian extract itself from the Gemini electronic reservation system, in order to join American's Sabre system. Its attempted withdrawal has prompted litigation. The two airlines estimate that the deal will be finalised by autumn 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Reports that President  Fidel Castro has been hospitalized after suffering an attack or  a heart attack were reported frequently in several American  capitals on Wednesday, prompting an official denial from Havana  and a cautious nonconfirmation in Washington.    Robert L. Fretz, the official responsible for Cuban affairs  in the U.S. State Department, said that his office had also  heard the rumors but did not have official reports from Havana  on Castro's health, "nor any indication there was a change in  the situation in Cuba." "The regime seems to continue in firm  control of the police and the security forces," Fretz added,  saying that the United States "continues to monitor the  situation closely."    Gladys Gonzalez Noy, a Cuban dissident living in Havana,  told  the National Cuban-American Foundation (CANF), the largest  anti-Castroist organization, by telephone on Wednesday that  Castro was hospitalized last week after suffering a heart attack  following an attempt on his life. Acccording to Gonzalez Noy,  Castro was hospitalized at the Surgical Medical Research Center  (CIMEQ) in Havana last week but was transferred to another place  on Tuesday, according to a recording of a conversation supplied  to AFP and other media sources at CANF headquarters in Miami  (Florida).    Gonzalez Noy, president of the Pro-Free Art Association,  said  Castro was caught in the middle of a shooting, a rumor that  circulated last week. Although he was not injured, according to  her, the incident affected him greatly. "First, before the  heart attack, Castro suffered a respiratory arrest as a result  of the whole situation," she affirmed.    Gonzalez Noy asserted that state security has just forbidden  her to leave her house and that there is an unusual police  presence in Cuba.    Other well-placed sources in Washington said, however, that  regarding Havana there were only reports of an increase in the  security presence around the CIMEQ hospital, one of the most  prestigious in the capital.    In Havana, a Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official  questioned by AFP said on Wednesday that Castro is "in perfect  health" and conducted as usual an "official activity" on Tuesday  evening.    In fact, the situation seemed normal on Wednesday in the  Cuban capital, according to an AFP reporter.    Most officials at the Cuban Foreign Ministry have been busy  with preparations for the conference that, from Friday to next  Sunday, will gather representatives of the Cuban Government with  some 200 members of the Cuban exile community.</p>

In the coming period, Hungary's main tasks are to preserve  the changes in foreign policy orientation that have taken place  in the past years and, within this, to reintegrate into Europe,  according to parliamentary deputy Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the  National Committee and the Foreign Affairs Cabinet of the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Szajer presented his  party's foreign policy program as part of a series of lectures  organized by the Foreign Affairs Association. At the first  forum held in the conference room of the Political and Legal  Sciences Faculty of the Lorand Eotvos University of Sciences,  parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, member of the  Management Body of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and  the party's foreign affairs spokesman was the other lecturer.    Szajer explained that the Fidesz's foreign policy concept  rests on three inseparable principles, namely joining the  European Union [EU], establishing regional security, and  satisfying national minority policy. Out of these, preference  has to be given to the process of European integration, and  Hungary's domestic stability and solid constitutional system are  the main preconditions for this. As a second condition, the  Fidesz attributes special importance to establishing lasting  conflict-free relations with the neighboring countries.    In the Fidesz's view, preparing the country for EU  membership  is the task of the country's future leadership. The preparation  includes, among other things, grass-roots development that will  result in organizational compatibility, new economic  legislation, and legal harmonization. Szajer pointed out that  the supervision of European affairs must be in one hand in  Hungary; therefore, the Foreign Ministry should take over the  leading role within a moderately decentralized structure. A  realistic time for joining the EU must be set out and the  program must be designed accordingly.    Talking about the other two pillars of the Fidesz's foreign  policy concept, namely the national minority and regional  policy, Szajer said: It is vitally important to form a delicate  balance between the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond  the borders and establishing good-neighborly relations. He  emphasized the importance of legitimate national minority  organizations -- the authentic representatives of the given  areas -- and maintaining relations with them. On the issue of  the borders, the Fidesz is firmly convinced that changing the  borders cannot be a solution to any problems.    The essence of the party's regional policy is that it firmly  supports all cooperation in the Central Eastern European area,  including joint action by the Visegrad countries in the interest  of integration into Europe.    Szajer's report was preceded by Szent-Ivanyi's summary.  Szent-Ivanyi again expounded that the SZDSZ had drawn up a  strategic program that has realistic and achievable foreign  policy goals.</p>

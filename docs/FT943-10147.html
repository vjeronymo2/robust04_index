			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Markets: Seedy side of pharmaceuticals - Bottom Line Life is hard for farmers east of the Elbe. Winters in the former communist bloc are grim, customers are penniless and the seeds are rotten. The first two problems are not new in eastern Europe. But the last is the result of fighting, civil unrest and a deteriorating transport infrastructure. Perishable seeds are left lying on the docks, marooned in railway sidings or languishing in warehouses. At least if the seeds are of low quality, farmers can refuse to pay for them. It may save the farmer from going bust, but it upsets export credit banks in the west, which are obliged to pay exporters, and the seed manufacturers themselves which lose sales. One such manufacturer, Zeneca, revealed in its six month figures precisely how economic problems in Russia, Ukraine and Balkans can hurt. Export credit guarantees are suddenly hard to come by and Zeneca's European seed sales have fallen by 13 per cent compared with 1993. It is more than a matter of lower profits. The company has been selling seeds in eastern Europe for just three years. Now it plans to reduce its sales effort. It has set aside Pounds 100m to cover the costs of cutting 500 jobs, some of which are in the seeds operations. Blaming problems with seed sales for job cuts might sound eccentric for a company that most investors regard as a pharmaceuticals business. In fact, Zeneca shareholders who thought they had a stake in the drugs business must be grateful this week that they were mistaken. The shares have risen 15 per in the past five days to 811 1/2 p, not because of the success of high tech drugs, but because of the performance of the company's agricultural businesses. Even with falling seed sales in Europe, trading profits rose 46 per cent to Pounds 123m, compared with the first half of 1993. This is a remarkable turnaround. For most of the 1990s, every agricultural company has had a rough time as a result of the European Community Common Agricultural Policy which cut the amount of land under cultivation. Zeneca says that the CAP recession has now bottomed out. Recession in north and south America also hurt, but these areas are now beginning to see economic recovery. Sales of new Surpass, a herbicide, grew by 23 per cent in the US. Share price sentiment was also helped by a hostile Dollars 8.5bn bid in the US on Tuesday for drug company American Cyanamid by rival American Home Products. That figure represented a 50 per cent premium to the Cyanamid share price. But what provoked the City to re-evaluate Zeneca was the fact that Cyanamid has a highly profitable agricultural division: if one huge US corporation is prepared to pay over the odds for Cyanamid's drugs and agriculture operations, then another might get interested in Zeneca. Compared with the excitement in agricultural products, Zeneca's drugs division gave a modest performance. Sales rose 6 per cent to Pounds 976m and profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 320m. The company was afflicted by the familiar set of ailments suffered across the drugs industry: sales of products that have lost their patent protection fell, with sales of heart drug Tenormin dropping 24 per cent in the US. These were offset by good results from cancer and gynaecology drugs Zoladex and Diprivan, where sales rose by 33 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. Zestril a heart treatment that has taken over from Tenormin as the company's biggest seller, improved 15 per cent to Pounds 238m. The company's overall performance in the first half of 1994 is a far cry from what was envisaged when it demerged from chemicals company ICI two years ago. Then it was assumed that the buoyant drugs division was being held back by the staid and cyclical chemicals and agricultural operations. Anyone who sold shares in chemicals company ICI and bought Zeneca when the latter achieved a stock market quotation in May 1993 would have spent most of this year regretting the decision. ICI shares have climbed a more-than- respectable 35 per cent or so since. Only with this week's events did Zeneca shares reach that level.</p>

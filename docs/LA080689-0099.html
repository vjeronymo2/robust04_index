			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Murray Yaeger, who operates a B&amp;B in Kennebunkport, Me. (the summer home of  President Bush), complains that business is poor due to publicity surrounding  the President. Yaeger says: "A great many other inns and businesses are  suffering because vacationers believe the town is crowded with tourists and  it's just the opposite. On a recent holiday weekend we filled only one room out  of seven for the entire three-day period. This is not a unique situation. As I  drove around Kennebunkport I saw vacancy signs everywhere -- large and small  inns. It was, in fact, the most quiet weekend any of us can ever remember. With  all the media talk about crowds and lack of available rooms, we are trying  desperately to get the message out that we have rooms in our town this summer."  </P> <P> If you're headed for New England, contact Yaeger c/o Arundel Meadows Inn, P.O.

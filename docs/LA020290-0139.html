			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL DISCHARGES COST TIMES $30,000  </P> <P> State water quality officials have leveled a $30,000 fine against the Los  Angeles Times for discharging water contaminated with chemicals into storm  drains in three separate incidents at its Orange County plant since November,  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We feel very strongly there was negligence, not so much with management but  with L.A. Times personnel, and the L.A. Times is responsible for its  employees," said Bruce Paine, an engineering associate for the state Regional  Water Quality Control Board.  </P> <P> At the same time, Paine added, it was found that none of the illegal discharges  caused major damage to water quality or the storm drain system.  </P> <P> Paine said the amount of the fine is in a "middle-of-the-road" range, compared  to those generally issued about six or eight times a year to Orange County  businesses accused of violating the law.  </P> <P> Ernie Vitucci, general manager of The Times Orange County Edition, said he  received word of the fine in a telephone conversation with a state water  quality inspector. The newspaper, however, has yet to receive formal  notification.  </P> <P> "After three spills in a fairly limited amount of time, a fine seems  appropriate," Vitucci said. Times officials said they probably will not contest  the fine at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 13 before the Water Quality Control  Board.  </P> <P> The most recent incident came last week when more than 500 gallons of chilled  water containing a non-hazardous solution of corrosion inhibitor -- used to  cool the plant's main computers -- was discharged into storm drains at the  plant. Workers drained the water to make way for construction in an apparently  mistaken belief that the solution could be dumped in the storm drain. Under  state law, however, nothing but rainwater can be directed into a storm drain.  </P> <P> In recent months, The Times has been undergoing a major renovation of its Costa  Mesa facility.  </P> <P> In investigating the incident, Orange County and state inspectors learned of a  similar incident last Nov. 27 when chilled, contaminated water also spilled  into the storm drains at the plant, on Sunflower Avenue just east of Harbor  Boulevard.  </P> <P> In the third incident, water containing a relatively small amount of developing  fluid, used to make newspaper printing plates, drained into the storm channels  for 35 days before being discovered by Times officials in December. The spill  occurred because a pipe was improperly connected to the storm drain instead of  a sewer drain, officials said.  </P> <P> Vitucci said drainage of the chilled water planned for Monday will be closely  monitored.  </P> <P> In 1988, the newspaper was fined $5,000 for an incident in which contaminated  water spilled into the storm drains.  </P></p>

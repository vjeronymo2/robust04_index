			<p>920110 FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keeping DIY on an even plane PROVING yet again that the simplest ideas are the most effective, a French company has combined a spirit level with a line winder to produce a tool which could benefit even the most clumsy do-it-yourself addict. The Filabulle, marketed by Rauh, of Paris, allows one person to check surfaces of up to 50 yards. A hook at the end of the line winder - a length of string which unwinds like a tape measure - fastens the line to the surface to be checked. The line is then unwound and the small spirit level slides along the cord. If the surface is not horizontal, the correct plane can be found by raising or lowering the line winder. Rauh: France, 1 47 09 36 72.</p>

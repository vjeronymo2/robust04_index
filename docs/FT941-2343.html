			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Vladivostok poll cancelled A power struggle in Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok took a new twist yesterday with the postponement of provincial elections scheduled for Sunday. Itar-Tass news agency said Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of Primorye region, ordered the polls postponed to October 23. Mr Nazdratenko, appointed by President Boris Yeltsin, is in dispute with Vladivostok's elected officials. Corruption charges have been filed against the mayor, Mr Viktor Cherepkov, and last Thursday the governor sent police to evict him from his offices. Mr Nazdratenko said that he had postponed the elections because there was no money for them and because of the need 'to find funds for the social needs' of the poor.</p>

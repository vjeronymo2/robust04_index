			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 68TH BOWL SEASON LOOMS LARGE  </P> <P> With 63 concerts this year, growth has become a way of life at Hollywood Bowl,  the summer home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  </P> <P> In 1971, when Philharmonic General Director Ernest Fleischmann had his third  summer there, he supervised 35 events that attracted a total attendance of  250,000 -- attendance of 2,000 or less was not uncommon in the 18,000-capacity  amphitheater.  </P> <P> In the record-breaking summer last year, he oversaw 58 concerts, given before a  total audience of 761,199.  </P> <P> This year's season, running July 3 to Sept. 16, will be the 68th musical summer  at the Bowl. Highlights of this 11-week season include guest appearances by the  Montreal Symphony, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the Boston Pops Esplanade  Orchestra; a five-concert jazz series; appearances by conductors Yuri  Temirkanov, L.A. Philharmonic Music Director Andre Previn, Edo de Waart, Neeme  Jarvi, Henry Mancini, John Williams and David Zinman, among others, and  numerous pianists, violinists, singers and instrumental soloists.  </P> <P> The growth of activity at the outdoor amphitheater, Fleischmann told The Times  in a phone interview Tuesday, "helps reduce" the stress of the L.A.  Philharmonic Assn.'s financial situation. In a budget in excess of $26 million,  the Bowl operation accounts for 40% of that budget, while bringing in "60% of  our revenues."  </P> <P> Those revenues include, Fleischmann said, large contributions from the 1989  corporate sponsors and donors: American Airlines (sponsoring six concerts); E.  Nakamichi Foundation (activities of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute);  JVC (JVC Jazz at the Bowl concert); W.M. Keck Foundation (Open House at  Hollywood Bowl); KFAC-FM (two concerts); Southern California Nissan Dealers),  and Warnaco Inc. (uniforms for Bowl ushers and service personnel, contributed  by Chaps by Ralph Lauren).  </P> <P> None of these contributions pay totally for any single event, Fleischmann  specified. "In total, these are contributions in the hundreds of thousands, not  in the millions," he said.  </P> <P> Fleischmann, who shares responsibility for the operation of the Bowl with  outgoing Philharmonic General Manager Robert Harth, also commented that the  price of success in these two decades is sometimes a negative: "As a physical  facility, the Bowl is beginning to deteriorate.  </P> <P> "Over the next five to 10 years, it will take a tremendous amount of dollars  and refurbishing just to maintain the integrity of the place."  </P> <P> In the area of outdoor entertaining, Michael Auten, the owner of Fiddler  Enterprises, which operates the Hollywood Bowl Patio Restaurant and all Bowl  food concessions, said food service has increased to the point where "we are  serving more meals now in a typical busy weekend -- 15,000 to 18,000 meals  total on Friday and Saturday -- than the previous food management used to serve  all summer long."  </P> <P> The season announcement at a glance:  </P> <P> July 3-4: The Disney Symphonic Spectacular with Fireworks.  </P> <P> July 5: A Virtuoso Duo: Jean-Pierre Rampal, Alexandre Lagoya.  </P> <P> July 7, 8: A Marvelous Evening of Mozart.  </P> <P> July 10: Chamber Music Under the Stars.  </P> <P> July 11: Gala Opening Concert: Yuri Temirkanov and Vladimir Feltsman.  </P> <P> July 12: "Ella!" with Ella Fitzgerald.  </P> <P> July 13: Brahms' First Piano Concerto and Petrouchka, Too.  </P> <P> July 14-15: Vive Le Bowl-Fireworks for (La Belle) France.  </P> <P> July 16: Mozart's Double (Concerto for Two Pianos).  </P> <P> July 17: Chamber Music Under the Stars.  </P> <P> July 18: Russian Fantastique (Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Berlioz).  </P> <P> July 20: "Alexander Nevsky" on Film.  </P> <P> July 21-22: "Anything Goes": A Cole Porter Celebration.  </P> <P> July 24: Chamber Music Under the Stars III.  </P> <P> July 25: A Wondrous Sound: L.A.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sony first-half profits drop 53% SONY, the big Japanese consumer electronics group, suffered a 53 per cent decline in pre-tax profits in the six months ended September in the face of weak markets in Japan and Europe and a sharp appreciation of the yen. The company's poor business performance in the half year is a clear indication of the extent to which consumers in two of its major markets have been holding back on purchases of electronic products in the face of the uncertain economic outlook. Sony saw a sharp downturn in sales of audio-visual products, particularly camcorders and video equipment for professional use, which could not be offset by a rise in sales of electronic devices and information equipment. Among its markets, Japan and Europe were depressed but the US and south-east Asia were relatively buoyant, Sony said. Some 65 per cent of Sony's turnover arises outside Japan and as a result the group made heavy weather of the yen's strong rise this year. Sales overall declined by 11 per cent to Y852.6bn (Dollars 7.97bn), compared with Y959.2bn in the same period last year. The yen's strength was also reflected in a sharp 83 per cent fall in operating profits to Y2bn from Y11.7bn previously. Sony said that the yen's rise had the effect of wiping out about Y74bn in sales. However, non-operating income helped lift profits to Y17.13bn at the pre-tax level, which was down 53 per cent from Y36.63bn. Sony also had an extraordinary gain of Y1.08bn from the sale of part of its holding in a telecommunications company. The group is not looking for any quick recovery in the trading environment given the weak economic situation in Japan and Europe and currency fluctuations. It is forecasting a 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the full year to Y32bn on sales down by 6 per cent to Y1,760bn. The company plans to accelerate overseas production. It's capital spending for the year will fall by 12 per cent to Y220bn. On a consolidated basis, first half 1993-94 sales were Y938.4bn, down 9 per cent. On the same basis, pre-tax profits were Y18.0bn, up 41 per cent from Y12.8bn as a result of gains on foreign currency hedging. Sony's US business was particularly buoyant and on a local currency basis, sales of electronic consumer goods were up by 17 per cent, record sales rose by 30 per cent and sales of films by 22 per cent.</p>

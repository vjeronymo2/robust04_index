			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Bottle-throwing demonstrators clashed with police at a rally of the right-wing  Republican Party in central West Germany. A police spokesman said 17 people,  including two police officers, were injured and seven demonstrators were  arrested during the fighting in Grossostheim. About 1,400 people attended the  demonstration, which was organized by an anti-rightist group that accuses the  Republicans of being neo-fascist. The Republican Party, campaigning to stop a  growing influx of political asylum-seekers into West Germany, won an unexpected  7.5% of the vote in January's elections for the West Berlin city parliament.  </P></p>

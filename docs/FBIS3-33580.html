			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Monica Baltodano] </F>   [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] must  undergo transformations that will enable it to adapt its  structure and workings to the new conditions under which it is  called upon to operate. One move in this direction is  represented by the bylaws that were approved at the 1991  Congress (which are radically different from the ones under  which we operated throughout the 1980's) and the adjustments  that we must make without delay for this special session.    Yet the key question is not what structure we will create  for  ourselves but rather: Should the FSLN continue to be a  revolutionary party or should we organize ourselves in keeping  with the commonplace objectives and styles of power-hungry  parties? We will find the answer mainly in the "Principles and  Program of the FSLN," which will also be revised by the time of  the May Congress, and the changes in the bylaws will be  consistent with them.    If the FSLN reaffirms that it is a party whose focus is the  Nation as a whole but that wages its battle mainly to further  the interests of the have-nots, a party that seeks power to  continue making changes that will democratize society not only  politically but in an economic and social sense as well, then  the bylaws must be consistent with this tenet.    The bylaws of domestic and foreign rightist parties are very  similar. They are vote- and power-hungry parties that are  designed to reach their operating peak during election  campaigns, when the main goal is to parcel out seats and posts.  As far as these parties are concerned, politics boils down to  taking office, enjoying power, and promoting a few policies of  social justice.    Revolutionary parties, in contrast, are designed to function  at all times, because they must support the struggles and  grievances of the people at all times. They have very clear  missions between elections, whether they are in power or the  opposition. In keeping with their principles, revolutionary  parties base their strength on developing the awareness of the  people, on which they must work all the time. They forge broad  political alliances but do not thereby corrupt the struggles and  objectives of the party in light of its allies.    If most Sandinists want the FSLN to remain a revolutionary  party and, in particular, a true government option, it will have  to adopt structures and workings that are consistent with its  devotion to democracy and revolution.  <H5>  Intensifying Democratization </H5>   Consequently, I feel that we must steadfastly intensify the  democratization begun in 1990. The name that the FSLN's  executive leadership body ought to adopt is not a matter of  principle (until now it has been called the National  Directorate), although many comrades in the rank and file  contend that there ought to be a radical change in personnel,  while others feel that the historic name ought to be preserved.  Nonetheless, regardless of the name, it is imperative that the  leadership, like the Sandinist Assembly, be elected directly by  the Congress.    The subordination of the executive body to the Sandinist  Assembly is not merely an issue related to the bylaws. This  structuralist approach is too simplistic. What we have here is a  political problem that requires political answers.    I feel that we need an effective and, therefore, not very  large executive leadership body that can coordinate efforts  through the regional network and that has close ties to the  social organizations.    I would like to see the creation of a body that coordinates  departmental chiefs but that has well-defined functions and  decisionmaking power on a number of issues affecting party life.    One of the most important and decisive issues is the rank  and  file bodies. I think that we must try to bring as many  Sandinists as possible into the new organizations and to  broaden, without factionalism, the political involvement of a  wide range of sectors in all spheres of activity that Sandinism  can create and support. We must recognize, however, that there  are different levels of commitment in the FSLN, and therefore  categories must be maintained, with the different demands  clearly spelled out.    The suggestion about organizing the FSLN in an altogether  liberal manner is typical of the vote-getting approach. If we  want a party that brings together people who are ready to push a  revolutionary agenda, then it must have discipline and teamwork.  A revolutionary party cannot be organized as if it were a club  without membership requirements, because even religious or  humanitarian organizations have demands, discipline, and  hierarchical categories, not to mention the capitalist business  system, part of whose success is based on its organizational and  hierarchical capacity. In a word, the oppressive system that we  are combating is organized and cannot be defeated with a liberal  approach.    Under these new conditions, leaders (the Sandinist Assembly,  the executive leadership body, regional posts) must be elected  individually, directly, and secretly from among candidates who  offer political proposals, not just personal appeal. A code of  ethics to govern procedures must be established.    A quota for women has been a long-standing grievance of the  women's movement, and the party should establish one without  delay. This will insure that women, of whom we see fewer and  fewer in leadership posts and as public candidates, have a  minimum of representation at all levels.</p>

[sentence as received]    Observers here believed that through the visit of Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong, the relations between Myanmar and  Singapore especially in the fields of economic cooperation,  investment and trade are now entering a new stage this year.    At the invitation of Myanmar Prime Minister and Chairman of  the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Than Shwe,  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong paid a three-day visit to  Myanmar from March 28 to 30.    The prime minister was accompanied by over 30 government  officials and over 20 businessmen.    At a press conference on Wednesday [30 March] just before he  concluded his visit to Myanmar, the prime minister said the  purpose of his visit to Myanmar is to assess the economic  opportunities for Singapore, to get the opportunity to know  first hand political developments in the country and to find out  how Singapore could encourage its investors to work in Myanmar.    At the banquet hosted by Than Shwe on Monday, the Singapore  prime minister said that Myanmar is potentially an attractive  location for foreign investments. Singapore businessmen have  placed Myanmar high on their priority list for their  regionalization venture, he added.    The Singaporean leader told his Myanmar counterpart that his  country is willing to help Myanmar open up its economy, make its  society progress and succeed like its neighboring countries of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).    Urging the international community to engage in constructive  dialogue with Myanmar, Goh said, "The ASEAN policy of  constructive engagement is a better way to engage the Myanmar  leadership in dialogue."    In the economic cooperation, the two sides on Monday signed  a  memorandum of understanding for the construction of three  hotels, a 400-room hotel, a 700-room hotel and a 300-room hotel,  with a total investment of 200 million U.S. dollars by Singapore  companies.    The two sides signed memorandum of understanding for  economic  cooperation.    Meanwhile, the Development Bank of Singapore opened its  Yangon representative office here on Tuesday, which is part of  its bid to operate a wide range of banking in Myanmar.    Singapore is the No. 1 investing country in Myanmar and the  second largest trading partner with the country. Up to now,  nearly 20 Singapore companies came to the country with a total  contract investment value of over 300 million U.S. dollars,  especially in hotels and tourism industry, and trade between the  two countries was over 400 million U.S. dollars in the previous  year.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Puma move back in the black The cost-cutting programme at Germany's Puma sportswear group yielded fruit in the first half when pre-tax income rose to DM17m (Dollars 10.8m), compared with last year's loss of DM54.4m. Sales were up only DM2m at DM240m. Further improvements were expected in the second half, the company said yesterday in an interim report. Inventories and workforce totals tumbled while orders increased and the proportion of just-in-time deliveries rose to 90 per cent from 45 per cent in the first half of last year. Interest charges also fell DM1.7m to DM4m, the report added. Total costs fell 30 per cent. Puma attributed a rise in orders on hand at the end of the reporting period  -up 4.5 per cent at DM137m - mainly to retailers' enthusiasm for new sports shoe ranges. Meanwhile, stocks were reduced to DM74m from DM112m, and the workforce was slashed from 1,110 to 736. The company, controlled by the Swedish sports and leisure products group, AB Aritmos, since early 1991, has staged a remarkable recovery following the appointment of Mr Jochen Reitz as chief executive in April 1993. Shortly after his appointment he said Puma would not return to profit until 1995. However, heavy expenditure on restructuring appears to have paid off. The last German factory making football boots was closed last year, and now most products come from east Asia. Distribution costs have been saved by merging the brand's marketing with divisions from other parts of the Aritmos group which make tennis equipment. The sale of closed factories has also yielded undisclosed gains. Restructuring costs accounted for DM60.5m of Puma's 1993 deficit of DM69m.</p>

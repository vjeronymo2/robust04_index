			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Observer: Campaign charmer A set of threadbare underwear may seem an unlikely candidate for inclusion among the harbingers of Bill Clinton's success, but at least one of his helpers would claim that it brought luck to the new regime. He is Louisiana-born James Carville, who became political director of Clinton's campaign after engineering the first crack in George Bush's presumed political impregnability, exactly a year ago. The breakthrough came in Pennsylvania when little-known college professor Harris Wofford upset Dick Thornburgh, the US attorney general, in a Senate race. Chronically superstitious, 48-year-old Carville backed Wofford not only with his political skills but by wearing the same underclothes throughout the final stage of the contest. Perhaps it was the strain of washing them every night that accounts for the more modest magic he used in Clinton's support. He merely got out of bed on the same side every morning this last week. Another of his unorthodox claims to fame is his romance with Mary Matalin, the acerbic political director of the Bush team. But behind his idiosyncrasies lies undoubted professionalism, including an instinct for strategy. While Clinton was otherwise surrounded by smart people with a programme for every problem, Carville's constant advice was to relate to the concerns of ordinary people, to listen without necessarily answering back, and never to stray from the fundamental campaign theme: the state of the economy. So what's in store for him now - a place in the new administration on the model of Hamilton Jordan who, having guided Jimmy Carter to the presidency, became White House chief of staff. 'I wouldn't live in a country whose government would hire me,' Carville jokes. 'I've had two experiences with the government, one was the Marine Corps and the other is April 15 (when tax returns must be filed), and I don't need a third.' We'll see.</p>

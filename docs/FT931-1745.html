			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Settling down to small talk - Xerox has undergone sweeping organisational changes in its internal makeup Xerox is at it again. The US document processing company, which became a by-word in the 1980s for its adoption of cutting-edge management theories, has been undergoing another big upheaval. A year ago Paul Allaire, its chairman, unveiled a radical redesign of the company's management structure, or what he calls its 'organisational architecture', in an attempt to solve one of the central problems facing large companies everywhere: how to retain the entrepreneurial flair and flexibility of a small business. 'We are trying to get the benefits of a small company of quickness in time to market, decision-making and the elimination of bureaucratic activities,' he says, 'without losing any of the advantages of a big organisation.' Xerox is hardly alone. US giants ranging from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to General Electric have gone through wrenching organisational upheavals over the past few years in pursuit of this 1990s Holy Grail. And International Business Machines also unveiled a scheme similar to Xerox's last year. But Xerox offers some distinctive lessons, partly because of the revolution it went through in the 1980s and partly because of the way it has approached its make-over, seeking to change not just the outward architecture of the company but its internal culture too. Xerox invented the plain paper copier in 1959 and became one of the fastest growing companies in the US. But then a combination of complacency, anti-trust problems and executive infighting allowed Japanese rivals to make large inroads in its market share. But the company fought back in the 1980s under the then chairman, David Kearns, and became one the few US businesses to win back market share from the Japanese. This was due in large measure to its embrace of total quality management, which involves a business committing itself to the highest quality in everything it does and making customer satisfaction its number one goal. But while total quality management can dramatically improve the performance of a business, it is no guarantee of continued success. Allaire, a 26-year veteran of Xerox who took over as chief executive in 1990, decided that the company needed a complete redesign of its structure. However, he emphasises that his shake-up is not a break with the Kearns era, but builds on the company's past quality achievements: 'If David had still been here, we would probably have to do the same kinds of changes,' he says. The re-design also owes much to Xerox's long-standing practice of benchmarking, or comparing its organisation and performance with those of other well-managed businesses. Before implementing its reforms it took a close look at AT&amp;T, Corning and Alcoa, which had previously introduced 'act small' restructurings. Xerox was advised by David Nadler, a prominent management consultant, who helped steer the company through its total quality transformation in 1980s and who also acts as an adviser to AT&amp;T and Corning. Its shake-up stems in large part from sweeping change in the office equipment business, where digital technology, which allows images to be captured electronically, is replacing traditional light-lens technology. This means that the stand-alone copier is becoming part of the much larger information technology business - a device which can form part of an electronic information network and can incorporate a variety of additional functions, including fax, full-colour printing and the scanning of documents to put them in digital form. That, in turn, is likely to bring new competitors into the industry from the computer field and force out some of the less efficient traditional copier manufacturers. Allaire insists that for Xerox this is much more an opportunity than a threat. But it means the company needs to be more responsive to changing customer needs and keep on the leading edge of technology, and he believes its old structure was ill-equipped for this. The document processing business, with some Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.8bn) in annual sales, was organised as a classic monolithic company, divided into departments such as sales and manufacturing and with a large central staff. But this, he says, means that, 'people get too accustomed to sitting on their hands and waiting for a decision to come down from above'. Under the new system, Xerox consists of nine separate stand-alone businesses, each organised around particular products and markets and each with total responsibility for their profit and loss account. Allaire likes to describe this as turning the traditional, vertically organised business on its side: at one end, there is an integrated research and development arm, which feeds ideas into the nine businesses. These in turn supply products to a unified customer operations division, which sells, installs and services equipment and is organised by geographic region. The sales force was not divided up among the nine businesses because Xerox felt it important to keep a single face to the customer, and did not want to run the risk of salespeople from different operations competing with each other. Wayland Hicks, executive president, operations, insists this arrangement has not diluted the financial accountability of the nine operations. 'We have broken up the financial system so the business heads have a clear idea of what their sales costs are, and they work very closely with the operating people.' The new system also ties Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc) more closely into the business. During the past 20 years, the Parc has made some of the most important inventions in information technology, including the personal computer and laser printer, but Xerox repeatedly failed to capitalise commercially on its ideas, allowing rival companies to do so. Sceptics still wonder whether the company will speed up its notorious tardiness in bringing products to market. But Hicks says there is some early evidence that the new structure is helping. For example, two variants of one of its machines were recently brought to market in a time 'unheard of under the previous organisation,' thanks to 'a management team that saw a market-place need and was able to make and implement decisions in a way which involved a lot fewer people and fewer levels of the organisation'. However, Allaire points out that changing the formal structure of an organisation is the easiest part of architectural change. Two other vital elements are harder to engineer: getting people with the right skills in the right place and changing the organisation's 'software', its informal network of relationships and culture. Xerox discovered it had a dearth of general managers a few rungs down the corporate hierarchy - just at the point where these were now critical to success. Previously people at this level tended to be specialists, lacking all-round management skills. As for culture, Allaire was anxious for the new businesses to keep in mind the needs of the group as a whole, since much of Xerox's strength comes from its combined technological and global marketing abilities. One important way of doing so was to change the pay system. The bonuses of middle managers are now based on an arithmetic calculation which multiplies the achievements of their part of the business with that of the group, rather than just adding the components together. Multiplication makes the group's performance far more critical to the size of the individual's bonus. A year into the new world, Allaire says he's 'pleased with progress. We're on track, though if you talk to a number of people they'd say it's tougher to do than they thought.' The company has also just announced plans to sell off its poorly performing financial services businesses, which were acquired in the early 1980s to shore up the copier business. It is too early to say how much of a lift all these initiatives will give to the company's financial performance, although Wall Street is reasonably impressed by the shape of the business. Its product range is strong relative to its rivals, and its 1992 results showed a 12 per cent increase in document processing income, despite the weak global economy. There is, however, no room for complacency. Xerox, says Allaire, will 'have to change more in the next five years than we have in the past 10. We cannot sit back on our laurels'.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Hurd tries to calm Gibraltar The British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday moved to reassure Gibraltar over its status as a UK colony ahead of talks with his Spanish counterpart, Mr Javier Solana. Mr Hurd said the UK remained committed to the Gibraltarian constitution which states there can be no change in the colony's status without the consent of the local people. Spain said last week it planned to resurrect suggestions for a leaseback of Gibraltar, or a sharing of sovereignty, when the annual bilateral meeting on the future of the British colony takes place in London today. However, Gibraltar's chief minister, Mr Joe Bossano, yesterday separately raised the stakes for the talks by accusing both London and Madrid of destabilising his administration.</p>

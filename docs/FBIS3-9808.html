The  Ministry believes even a 4- to 5-percent growth possible in  1994, but the experts of the Economic Research Inc. [GKI] only  expect 2 to 3 percent at the most.    In 1993, industrial output exceeded the 1992 level by 4  percent, the Central Statistical Office's report says. Within  this, the output of manufacturing industry increased by 3.3  percent, mining by 1 percent, while 2.2 percent less was  produced in electric energy, gas, heating, and water supplies  than a year before. Within manufacturing, the output of  metallurgy and metal processing increased by 14 percent and the  10.3 percent increase in engineering industry was also  significant. Within this, the output of office machines and  computers increased by more than two and a half fold and the  production of public vehicles increased by about one-third.    At the same time, sales did not keep pace with the increased  production, they exceeded the 1992 level by 2.9 percent. This  mostly came from the growth of domestic sales because exports  only increased by 0.2 percent compared to the year before. The  exports of textiles, and leather and fur products were  exceptions where, mainly as a result of work performed under  commission agreements, exports increased by 11.9 percent. The  chemical industry also achieved a relatively large export growth  with 6.1 percent. At the same time, engineering industry mainly  produced for the domestic market. For example, public vehicle  production increased its sales by some 87 percent and the sales  of light sources and lighting equipment increased one and a half  times.    As we learned it from various sources, the Industry Ministry  expects the continuation of the favorable tendencies of 1993,  perhaps as much as a 4 to 5 percent growth. The experts of the  Economic Research Inc. predict a somewhat lower growth, namely 2  to 3 percent. They said that this is based on the presumption  that those industrial branches that started to grow in 1993 will  continue to develop in 1994. On one hand, they are predicting a  6 to 7 percent growth of national invesetments, which means a  good market for the enterprises interested in this area. On the  other hand, the apparent upswing in Western Europe increases the  export possibilities. It is a different matter that the 5 to 6  percent export growth forecast by the government is considered  to be excessive by economic researchers. The export  possibilities are hampered by the decrease of work performed  under commission agreements because the low Ukrainian, Slovak,  Romanian, and Polish wages are now strong competitors of the low  Hungarian wages. However, forint devaluations can improve the  export positions. The GKI expects a 17 percent devaluation  throughout the year, some of which has already been implemented.  Further devaluations might give an impetus to exports after the  elections, however, according to their forecast, all in all,  this will only be enough to keep exports on the 1993 level.  Therefore, although at different levels in the various branches  of industry, industrial output will also continue to grow in  1994.</p>

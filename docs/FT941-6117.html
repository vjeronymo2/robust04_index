			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: 'We cannot continue like this' - Cost of the rulebook Increasingly, Europe is becoming aware of the costs of high environmental standards. The question is whether it can afford them. At Porto Marghera, in the Venetian lagoon, Mr Lucio Pisani is the director of Italy's largest petrochemical plant, owned by the state company Enichem. The plant has already been forced to cut back its operations because of losses caused by foreign competition, and now the environmental pressures are mounting, not least because of the proximity of one of Europe's most beautiful cities. There have even been demands that the Enichem plant be split up or removed, which has enraged local businesses and alarmed the workforce, already battered by thousands of lost jobs. 'The problems of the lagoon are not chemicals,' Mr Pisani says. 'The water we put back in the lagoon is better than that which we take out.' Since 1991, his company has spent L125bn (Dollars 74m) on clean-ups, a huge sum which Mr Pisani uses to justify the company's continued operation there. 'To those who suggest fragmentation of the site, I say we have the critical mass. That's the reason we can afford all these environmental improvements.' In this he is backed by his workers. 'Environmental costs don't add to others. They improve the efficiency and quality of the process,' says Livio Marini of the leftwing CGIL labour union. This view gets an echo in Sweden where Mr Sven Niberg of the Swedish Labour Organisation sees environmental pressures in positive terms. 'They have created jobs, for example in the engineering industry which has increased production of clean equipment,' he says. But generally, industrialists worry about the cost and competitiveness implications of the environment. Europe's petrol retailing industry is doing battle with the Brussels Commission over a plan to oblige garages to recover vapours which escape from the pump when people fill their vehicles. The Commission wants stations to install devices which suck in the vapours and return them to the storage tank - a small but nonetheless costly move. 'Any analysis of the costs and benefits of this proposal produces very disappointing results,' says Mr Aurelio Ayala-Thomas, head of the Spanish petrol retailing industry's trade group. 'It entails a lot of investment for a tiny return in environmental terms. These emissions account for only 2 per cent of total emissions of volatile hydrocarbons.' Like many EU businessmen, Mr Ayala-Thomas is urging a more balanced approach. He thinks dealing with industrial waste is a more pressing priority. One man who has experienced the bitter costs of environmental clean-ups in an extreme form is Mr Dietmar Hayn. He is mayor of Molbis, a little community in the heart of the brown coal mining region south of Leipzig. Molbis was once dubbed the 'filthiest village in Europe' because of the neighbouring Espenhain lignite liquification plant which was run flat out by the East Germans. The plant has now been closed down, and Molbis is being restored. But employment has fallen from 6,000 to only 1,000. Mr Hayn is hoping to attract in new industries - including factories which make environmental control equipment. In Leipzig, Mr Arnold Vaatz, the Saxony environment minister, talks of 'jobs versus the environment'. Coal miners in his region recently demonstrated to persuade a Potsdam power station to burn lignite rather than natural gas, despite the environmental consequences. But though Mr Vaatz wants to clean up Saxony, he is acutely aware of the price. Hourly production costs in his former Communist-run territory are already 10 times higher than in neighbouring Poland and 100 times higher than in Russia. Yet he still has to conform to EU water standards, for example, which he estimates will cost DM43bn for a population of only 4.6m. Up in Finland, the heavily export-oriented forestry and paper industry is finding that the environment can entail two quite different types of cost. One is the bill for cleaning up its factory operations. The other is for adapting its manufacturing processes to produce products which meet the environmental standards of its foreign customers. For example, Finnish paper companies now try to make paper which uses less bleach and contains more recycled paper. Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade minister, confesses to deep scepticism about Europe's future - in large part because of the costs it is loading upon itself. 'In the Far East, they are now producing products at prices which are equal just to our raw materials. We can't continue like this.' Even though Finland's jobless rate is already 20 per cent he warns: 'There is more unemployment on the way.' Mr Salolainen does not believe that the answer lies in compromising on environmental standards because he thinks they are less to blame than unrealistically high wages. But he does believe that Europe should hasten to reach international agreement on standards so that they do not get whittled down by competition among countries keen to reduce their costs.</p>

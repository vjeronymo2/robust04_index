			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: LYNCH MOB  </P> <P> An iconoclastic director like David Lynch -- of "Eraserhead," and "Blue Velvet"  fame -- working in network TV? Come on!  </P> <P> But sources tell us that Lynch will start a pilot movie for a mystery-thriller  series, "Northwest Passage," in Seattle, come March, for ABC. Kyle MacLachlin  stars as an FBI agent investigating the murder of a high school homecoming  queen. Also cast: Isabella Rossellini and Harry Dean Stanton.  </P> <P> The movie was written by Lynch and Mark Forest and is set in a small Peyton  Place-type community populated by unusual characters -- such as a deputy  sheriff who breaks into tears whenever he's faced with an emotional situation.  </P> <P> According to a source close to the production, "Melodrama is too tame a word to  describe the emotional tone. Every aspect of story and style have been  heightened."  </P> <P> David Latt produces with Propaganda Films. Leonard Klady  </P></p>

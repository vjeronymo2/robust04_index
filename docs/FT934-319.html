			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Wellcome Trust steers clear of rapid share sale Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, will retain its near 40 per cent in the Wellcome pharmaceutical group for the time being. The news could lift one of the clouds which has overhung the drug company's shares. When the Trust cut its stake in Wellcome in July 1992, from 73.6 to 40 per cent through a sale of 270m shares at 800p each, it undertook not to sell any more until January 1 1994. It has permission to reduce its holding to 25 per cent. Mr Roger Gibbs, Trust chairman, is careful not to put a time on when it might sell more. He points out that when Wellcome was floated in 1986 the Trust undertook not to sell more shares for two years, but did not dispose of any for six years. The timing of the sale, which was criticised when it took place, has turned out to be inspired. The Wellcome share price rose initially, but has since fallen sharply - along with other drug companies - following the election of the Clinton administration in the US and consequent concerns about cuts in healthcare spending. Wellcome's share price has dropped from the 800p at which the Trust sold to 651p, while the equity market has risen by more than 1000 points. The FT-SE index, at 2348.0 on the day of the sale, has climbed to 3412.3. The Trust's sale - which raised a net Pounds 2.18bn making it the largest non-privatisation secondary offer in the UK - and the reinvestment of the money, mainly in other UK equities, has enabled its portfolio to grow. Had it not sold the shares, its portfolio would now be worth around Pounds 4.5bn rather than its present valuation of Pounds 5.7bn. Before the sale, the Trust's stake in Wellcome accounted for nearly all its investments, providing 95 per cent of its income. But at the time Wellcome shares had a low yield and the Trust was keen to boost its income to provide more funds for research. Now its holding in Wellcome makes up just under 40 per cent of the portfolio and the income has risen from Pounds 91m in 1991 to an expected Pounds 215m in 1994. Mr Gibbs says that the proceeds from the sale were largely reinvested before sterling's exit from the ERM in September 1992. That event led to the fall in interest rates which boosted the stock market. He says that in 1993 the portfolio has done slightly better than the average measured by the WM performance tables. A drag on the portfolio was the decision to put Pounds 500m into an index fund. Mr Gibbs defends the move saying that as a charity, the Trust had to demonstrate prudence in its investments. Eight fund managers were appointed to manage the money from January 1993 for an initial three years. So far Mr Gibbs is happy with their performance, although the Trust's charitable status will oblige it to re-examine the managers at the end of the three-year term before re-appointing them. One of the choices of managers, Newton Investment Management, was seen at the time as surprising. It has a reputation as an aggressive investor in equities and is thought to have done well with the Trust's money. The Trust's portfolio is now 64 per cent invested in UK equities, 22 per cent in international shares, 2 per cent in property, 3 per cent in index-linked and 9 per cent in other gilt-edged stocks and cash.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (10): Pressure on state bodies - A look at recent changes in commercial law September saw a significant change in commercial law in Turkey. For the first time, state institutions and enterprises can have their assets seized or subjected to attachment, meaning that judgments against them may now be more easily enforced. Turkish industrialists argue that, with Turkey's state sector accounting for 33 per cent of manufacturing output, this change will force state institutions to improve their performance. Mr Asli Basgoz, senior partner in the Istanbul office of White &amp; Case, a leading international law firm, welcomes this step forward, as well as the way that, increasingly, legislation such as that governing the capital markets is prepared with the help of those who will be affected. Foreign businessmen say that this was often not the case in the past. They also warn that legislation, even if subject to frequent change, has often lagged behind the needs of the market place. Those entering new areas such as franchising have had to rely on the way that the principle of freedom of contract is clearly established in Turkish contractual law. But when specific legislation is required, this often takes time to be introduced, as is currently the case where financial derivatives are concerned. Turkish law is codified like continental European law, with commercial and family law based on the Swiss system, administrative law on the French system, and criminal law on Mussolini's criminal code. The basic legal structure is clear, with far more areas codified that in, say, Britain, where common law applies. Foreign investors are subject to specific protection under a 1954 law. The basic legal structures are all in place and on the whole have worn well, despite the underlying shifts in the economy and the impact of inflation. 'The precedents established in the decisions made in the 37 years since the commercial code was introduced have played an important role in keeping the code fresh,' according to Mr Mehmet Okur, partner on Okur &amp; Okur, a Turkish law practice active with foreign companies. However, Yased, the foreign investors' association, emphasises the foreign business community's concern at the lack of protection for intellectual property. There is no patent protection for pharmaceuticals, and attempts to introduce a new patent law have been dragging on for over a decade. Protection of trade marks is slightly improving, but service marks such as a hotel logo may not be protected. Where copyright is concerned, there has been progress in combating film and audio piracy, but not over books. That said, there are grounds for expecting change. Turkey is under pressure from the European Union, which argues that the customs union due from the end of 1995 requires Turkey to match European practices. Further, as a signatory to the Marakkesh accord of the Uruguay Round of Gatt, once Turkey enters customs union with the EU, it is obliged to observe the Gatt provisions on intellectual property within one year of their entry into force. It is also under pressure from the US, which has put Turkey on its 'priority watch list'. Other areas of concern include: The fact that you must deliver possession of most movable assets in order to complete the pledge, which impedes the development of leasing and secured transactions. The lack of a registration system for pledges and liens over movable assets. Limitations of granting mortgages denominated in foreign exchange (which constitute an important protection for lenders in today's inflationary environment). The limited opportunities for cross-examining witnesses in court - the system is run by judges, rather than adversarial. However, except over matters of inheritance, Turks are generally less litigious than people in the US or even Europe. 'Turks believe there are risks in life and business, and do not rush to blame others,' comments Mr Basgoz. Here, an important factor is the limited comfort many people expect from the legal process. As in many countries, procedures are costly and protracted, with hearings usually held at three-month intervals, and addressing, step by step, the issues involved, as Coca-Cola recently found to its cost when it sought to cancel a bottling agreement. Turkey has acceded to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. However, delays often occur in cross-border cases, particularly when proceedings are required against a high-profile Turkish national. The administrators of the UK company, Polly Peck, have found particular problems in exercising the rights given to them by British courts to act on behalf of the company's shareholders. Lawyers acting for the fugitive Asil Nadir have argued that such rights would not have been given under Turkish bankruptcy law.</p>

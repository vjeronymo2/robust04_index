			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Development of Crest Sir, Your report, 'Bank says it should run share settlement system' (February 15), suggests that the Bank of England wants to own and control the Crest system for the first few years of operation. The discussion document issued by the Crest project team on Tuesday makes it clear that the Bank wants ownership of Crest to be in the private sector, and that the private sector owners would themselves appoint an operator to run the system on their behalf from the outset. The Bank would be ready to build the system, but only provided there were satisfactory commitments from future owners to finance this process and to take on full responsibility for the operation of Crest once building was completed. The Bank of England will be looking to future owners to sign heads of agreement before May 3, and the new ownership structure would be implemented at an early stage during the building of Crest.

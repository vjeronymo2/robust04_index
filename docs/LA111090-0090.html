			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUENA SECURES PLAYOFF BERTH, 19-10  </P> <P> A relentless rushing attack led Buena High to a 19-10 victory over Santa  Barbara on Friday night in a Channel League game at Santa Barbara. The victory  gives Buena (5-5, 5-2) a second-place finish and a berth in the Division II  playoffs for the third consecutive season under Coach Rick Scott.  </P> <P> Running back Erik Eads led the Buena ground game with 139 yards in 18 carries  and fullback Chuck Mullaney added 63 yards in 15 carries and scored two  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Buena put together an impressive 11-play, 80-yard drive, with Mullaney's  one-yard dive propelling the Bulldogs to a 12-10 halftime lead. The Bulldogs  ate up 8 minutes 34 seconds of the clock on the opening drive of the third  quarter. Mullaney's four-yard touchdown run capped a 15-play, 63-yard drive to  put Buena on top, 19-10.  </P> <P> Buena scored on its first possession, quarterback Mike Dexter throwing a  seven-yard touchdown pass to fullback Matt Kemsley.  </P> <P> Senior wide receiver Simon Banks gave Santa Barbara (5-4-1, 3-3-1) a  short-lived 10-6 lead in the second quarter on his streaking 36-yard touchdown  catch from quarterback Dustin Spencer.  </P> <P> Buena running back George Keiaho, who needs only 28 yards rushing to become the  first freshman in Southern Section history to rush for 1,000 yards, suffered a  strained knee earlier in the week and did not play.

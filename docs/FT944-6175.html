			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Framework will be equivalent to unit trusts' - Open-ended investment The chancellor proposes in his Budget to make rules for the taxation of open-ended investment companies and their shareholders, equivalent to those already applying to authorised unit trusts and their unit holders. They will also remove tax impediments to conversion of an authorised unit trust into an open-ended investment company. Regulations setting out the detailed rules will be introduced once the necessary company-law and regulatory provision for these new vehicles is in place - on present plans by mid 1995. Open-ended investment companies (OEICs) cannot currently be formed under UK company law. They are, however, commonly used elsewhere in the European Union as a vehicle for collective investment. Treasury ministers agreed in principle in June 1992 to allow the establishment of OEICs in the UK. A decision was announced in June 1993 to proceed by means of secondary legislation under the European Communities Act (ECA) 1972 and the Treasury published a consultation document on a proposed structure in December 1993. The Treasury intends to publish a further consultation document shortly, including draft ECA regulations. The Securities and Investments Board will also consult about draft product regulations early next year. Under the chancellor's proposal, OEICs and their shareholders will be taxed on essentially the same lines as currently apply to authorised unit trusts and their unitholders: OEICs will be exempt from tax on capital gains realised for the benefit of their investors Their income will be subject to corporation tax at a special rate - generally 20 per cent but 25 per cent where OEICs are invested primarily in interest-bearing assets Shareholders will be taxable each year on the full net income earned for them, whether distributed or accumulated by the OEIC. This income will be treated, at the OEIC's option, as a dividend; a foreign income dividend; a dividend paired with a foreign income dividend; or a payment taxable as interest OEICs will be eligible to distribute income to non-resident shareholders (or accumulate it) without deduction of UK tax if the OEIC invests in appropriate assets and its shareholders comply with the formalities OEICs will be eligible to be held through a Personal Equity Plan on the same terms as apply to authorised unit trusts. An existing authorised unit trust will be permitted to convert into an OEIC if it chooses (subject to rules which the Securities and Investment Board will lay down in due course). The chancellor proposes legislation to eliminate any significant tax charges arising from such a conversion which would tend to distort this choice. Regulations will also deal with stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax consequences. It is also intended that the VAT treatment of OEICs should parallel that of authorised unit trusts.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN STEALS SHOW AT FUND-RAISER FOR WILSON'S CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> There is nothing quite like a Republican dinner starring Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Call it Hollywood Squares.  </P> <P> Up on the dais Wednesday night at the Century Plaza were rows of faces you'd  expect to see on that game show or on the covers of magazines in the  supermarket.  </P> <P> The event -- which kicked off a two-month period of campaigning for the 1990  governor's race by Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson -- was Reagan's first  political fund-raiser since he left the White House early this year.  </P> <P> And though he is no longer President, Reagan is clearly still the star for  California Republicans.  </P> <P> But he had others with him on the dais. Such as the two guys with big shoulders  and lethal hands: Sylvester Stallone and Chuck Norris. And Moses: Charlton  Heston in a full beard. The truck drivers' favorite: Claude Akins. Not to  mention Scott Baio, Bruce Boxleitner and Julie Newmar.  </P> <P> Down in the well of the ballroom, more than 700 well-dressed folks ate and  watched the famous people eat -- as though they really were watching Hollywood  Squares.  </P> <P> Mostly the audience stared at Reagan, whose gray hair was the main subject of  conversation.  </P> <P> "The Prez looks like a Supreme Court justice all of a sudden -- very  distinguished," said Joyce Valdez, who goes back 25 years with Reagan in  politics.  </P> <P> Valdez, considered by many to be the national Republican Party's best  fund-raiser, put Wednesday's event together to round up $700,000 for Wilson's  campaign.  </P> <P> But though the event was for Wilson, the senator was virtually a non-presence.  </P> <P> Not only was he hard to spot among all the star power, when he spoke he did not  take the opportunity to outline what he would like to do if elected to the  highest office in the state.  </P> <P> Instead, Wilson briefly introduced Reagan and credited his presidency with  bringing about the tumultuous changes in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Reagan in turn heaped on Wilson the kind of praise that the senator has never  heard from the former President.  </P> <P> Not all that long ago, Wilson was shut out of the Reagan circle because he  backed former President Gerald R. Ford against Reagan in the 1976 GOP primary.  </P> <P> But on Wednesday night, Wilson was formally handed the torch of the California  Republican Party by the man who put that party in the vanguard of the country's  conservative movement.  </P> <P> "As California heads into the 1990s and prepares for the 21st Century," Reagan  said, "we need someone at our helm who believes that our California must be  beautiful, safe and prosperous. And since I've known Pete Wilson, he's been  that man."  </P> <P> Reagan reminded the GOP faithful that when he was elected California governor  in 1966, "a kid state assemblyman named Pete Wilson" also went to serve in  Sacramento for the first time.  </P> <P> Reagan has now accepted Wilson to the extent that on Wednesday night he even  used a speech written by the senator's spokesman, Otto Bos.  </P> <P> Those familiar with Bos' brand of humor were tipped off right after Reagan  began speaking.  </P> <P> "Pete's not one for raising taxes," Reagan said, "unlike the Democrats, who  look at your paychecks the way Colonel Sanders looks at chickens."  </P> <P> Bos later confirmed it had been his speech in the hands of the Great  Communicator -- "I'm on a cloud!" Bos swooned.  </P> <P> For Wilson, Wednesday night's dinner not only marked the passing of the sword  in the California GOP (Gov. George Deukmejian was absent so Reagan got to do it  by himself). The event was also the beginning of what Wilson's advisers hope  will be an active two months in the gubernatorial campaign now that the U.S.  Senate is in recess.  </P> <P> Because of his Senate duties, Wilson has been trying to campaign from 3,000  miles away, a handicap not faced by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and  former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who are battling for the  Democratic nomination.  </P> <P> But things began looking up for Wilson right before the Reagan dinner.  </P> <P> His quest for the governorship was endorsed earlier in the day by the National  Latino Peace Officers Assn., a group that has backed Van de Kamp twice for  attorney general and that last year supported Democratic presidential nominee  Michael Dukakis.  </P> <P> And on Sunday, Wilson will begin laying out his "agenda for the '90s" in a  major address in San Jose.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as the Reagan dinner showed, the campaign dollars keep rolling in  for Wilson. By the end of the year he will have more than $5 million in pocket  on his way to what some political insiders predict will be a $20-million war  chest.  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banco Santander loan probe widens MR EMILIO Botin, the president of Banco Santander, has been subpoenaed to appear tomorrow before a Madrid judge conducting a preliminary investigation into possible tax fraud. The inquiry involves loans worth around Dollars 1bn made by the bank between 1987 and 1989. A Canary Island court earlier this week released two Banco Santander officials on bail of Dollars 1m as the investigation spread nationwide. The tax authorities have been trying for three years to find out who a series of off-balance-sheet loans were made to. The authorities want to know whether these borrowers were using the loans to launder undisclosed income. The issue revolves around what in Spain are called cesiones de credito, or assignments of credit. They were widely used by Spanish banks in the late 1980s after the Bank of Spain, in an effort to slow credit growth, sharply raised its coefficients - obligatory, interest-free deposits banks make with the central bank to cover deposits and loans. The banks found a loophole which allowed them to sell parts of their loan portfolios to third parties - mainly large corporate borrowers - and thus take normal credits off their balance sheets. This meant they would escape having to make deposits with the central bank and of having to deduct withholding taxes. While the investigations do not imply that Banco Santander would have to make any extra tax contingencies in its accounts, the affair is clearly embarrassing. Banco Santander owns 10 per cent of the Royal Bank of Scotland which, in turn, has a 2 per cent stake in the Spanish bank. The assignments were made subject to central bank ratios in the summer of 1989. Santander officials said yesterday it had stopped making assignments after the loophole was closed. Analysts in Madrid think it unlikely the authorities will do anything to threaten Santander's standing in the banking sector. Mr Antoni Zabalza, head of the revenue service, said 'there is no question about the bank's viability' when he announced details of the investigation this year. The tax authority has been trying to identify the third party buyers and find out whether they were declaring the loans, and whether Santander knew what was happening to the money. The revenue service says it has investigated 40,000 loans, worth Dollars 4bn, made by Santander between 1987 and 1989. It says it cannot identify 3,000 of the third party borrowers, and that a number of them may have been fictitious. American Express and Banco Santander are to issue co-branded charge cards and gold cards for personal and corporate customers, writes David Barchard. Both will continue to offer their own existing card products in Spain. This is American Express's fourth alliance of this kind under a policy of seeking strong local banks as partners in different countries. It already has agreements with Lloyds Bank in the UK, Sumitomo in Japan, and Banamex in Mexico to issue co-branded cards.</p>

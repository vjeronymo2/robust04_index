			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE: THE CLUB SCENE;  </P> <P> A MIGHTY PENN;  </P> <P> MICHAEL PENN PROVES HIS REFRESHING COMBINATION OF STYLE AND SUBSTANCE IS 'NO  MYTH.'  </P> <P> Along with Lenny Kravitz, Michael Penn (no relation to Sir William Penn but  definitely a brother of Sean) produced one of the most ingratiating and  innovative debut discs of 1989 with his "March." A singer/songwriter/guitarist,  Penn is a heartbeat away from nirvana in alchemy, a gold record. He'll be  playing selections from the album, plus a few new ones plus some covers when he  plays the Ventura Theatre Sunday. Missing "The Simpsons," "Married With  Children" and "In Living Color" is indeed serious business, but that's why Mom  bought you that VCR.  </P> <P> The Ventura gig will be the next to last for the performer, who has been on the  road since February. "I'm going to take a couple of months off, do some  writing, maybe go to the beach. Then, in a couple of months my keyboard player,  Patrick Warren, and myself will do an acoustic tour. Right now, there's five  members in the band. We've been all over on the tour -- Texas, New York, New  England, Colorado, Seattle, all over. In fact, our very first gig on this tour  was in Santa Barbara at The Carnaval Club back in February."  </P> <P> Unlike most people who put off the inevitable "So what do you want to be?"  question indefinitely, Penn knew he wanted to be a musician when he was young.  "I just got into music very heavily as a kid and I pretty much knew I wanted to  be a musician. I liked The Band, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Costello, The Clash,  Tom Waits and thousands of others."  </P> <P> Penn was in a lot of different bands in junior high and high school -- he went  to Santa Monica High School. His first professional band was The Doll Congress.  "We made an attempt to not sound like any other band in L.A., and I think we  succeeded at that. We put out on independent label EP, but the band broke up in  1987."  </P> <P> Maybe J. Geils was right -- maybe love does stink. One thing's certain, though,  bad love can make for good songs. In rock 'n' roll, there's been a million of  them. And Penn, as a writer, is considerably more clever than most when it  comes to lamenting love lousy. From "Brave New World," a sample line:  </P> <P>  "Baby's busy hiding in the bassinet  </P> <P>  wonderin' if the third world war started yet.  </P> <P>  I told her I was pulling up and heading west  </P> <P>  she said she would have come but she was overdressed.  </P> <P>  So I sent her a postcard of a Midwest bank.  </P> <P>  She wrote me she showed it to her new friend Frank ..."  </P> <P>  Other songs deal with saying goodby, saying hello, saying nothing, saying too  much and being "Invisible" to the waitress of your dreams. Maybe Penn does need  some time on the beach.  </P> <P> "People should come to see us because we'll be giving away free money."  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Gallery chief says sorry to Getty Mr Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, yesterday apologised publicly for upsetting Mr John Paul Getty II after the billionaire philanthropist threatened to withdraw his Pounds 1m pledge to help keep Canova's 'The Three Graces' sculpture in the UK. Mr Clifford apologised to Mr Getty 'for any distress I caused him' in claiming that the philanthropist's relationship with his late father may have been a factor in the offer to stop the statue being sold to the Getty Museum in California. He hoped his mistake would 'not damage the cause of the appeal'. In a letter leaked to The Times and published yesterday, Mr Getty said he was 'astonished' at Mr Clifford's claim last week which was 'untrue and very embarrassing' to himself and the Getty Museum. The appeal aims to raise Pounds 7.6m to match the offer from the Getty Museum. Observer, Page 13</p>

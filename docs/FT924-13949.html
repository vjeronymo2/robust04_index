			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Cairo earthquake kills at least 370 THE most powerful earthquake in Egypt's history hit Cairo yesterday, killing at least 370 people and injuring about 3,400 in the heavily-populated capital and surrounding areas. Among the dead and injured were children crushed in stampedes when people tried to rush from shaking buildings into the streets. Security sources, which gave the casualty figures, said there were reports of 80 collapsed or damaged buildings across the city, which has a population of 12m. The one-minute quake, which measured between 5.5 and 6.0 on the Richter scale and was felt 425km away in Jerusalem, struck soon after 3pm local time. Mr Safwat Sherif, Egypt's information minister, said the dead included children crushed in stampedes at schools. President Hosni Mubarak had cut short a visit to China to return to Cairo, he said. Last night Saudi Arabia, which has a large resident community of Egyptian workers, said it was sending Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) to Egypt in aid for the victims. The official Saudi News Agency said King Fahd had also ordered a medical team to be made available. After the quake Egyptian radio and television urged drivers to stay off the capital's normally traffic-clogged streets to allow ambulances and fire engines clear passage. Relatives besieged a hospital in the northern slum district of Shubra el-Khaimah, where doctors said they had registered 34 deaths. Riot police cordoned off the hospital. The US Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the earthquake's centre had been 30km south-west of Cairo.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex's first lady makes an energetic beginning - An action-packed opening month for the exchange's newly-elected chairman FRESH ON the job as chairman of the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), Ms Donna Redel, elected to the office on March 24, has put her formidable energy behind two priorities that have become nearly a mantra for all exchange executives: raising trading volume and lowering costs. And in her initial steps toward those goals, Ms Redel has shown the drive and boldness that helped make her the first woman ever to chair a commodities exchange. She has approached European exchanges directly to ask for closer co-operation on products and has pressed for quick action on a merger of Comex with the US Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. A merger would cut costs for the overlapping memberships of the two exchanges. Earlier this month, on a lightning trip to London, Ms Redel asked for the advice and guidance of the London Metal Exchange on the possibility of redesigning the Comex's languishing aluminium contract, which has not traded since 1990. With precious metals in the slow lane of trading, she is seeking to create a stronger base metals division to pump up volume. In this regard, she underlines how important it is 'for Comex to explore reviving an aluminium contract in a different format'. Moreover, she believes that discussions with the LME are needed 'to improve the overall trading environment (for metals) on a global basis'. While in London, she also visited the International Petroleum Exchange, where she held talks on co-ordinating the launches of the two exchange's sour crude (Dubai) petroleum products. Comex's proposed Dubai futures contract is expected to be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, by late April. But Ms Redel says that the new futures - and the IPE contracts - are likely to stay on the shelf until the sour crude market matures sufficiently to guarantee some success. Ms Redel is also working with another European exchange, the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, on Comex's first venture into equity-based financial futures. She hopes that Comex's proposed stock index futures based on the Eurotop 100, which trades in Amsterdam, will come later this month. The American Stock Exchange, which has options on the Eurotop 100 ready to roll, will wait for Comex's Eurotop futures to be approved so that the launches can be co-ordinated, says Mr Ivers Riley, chief of derivatives trading at the Amex. This will provide better arbitrage opportunities for users between the cash market options and the futures. In an effort to assure the success of the new financial futures, Ms Redel intends to reach beyond co-operation with Amsterdam and the Amex into the market-user community to ask for guidance on how best to market the new product. She says she will call upon individuals from pension funds and international portfolio management - the large institutional investors who use the futures markets - to serve as an advisory group on the Eurotop 100 futures. The linking of Comex's most liquid contracts with those of other international exchanges is another scheme receiving Ms Redel's attention. While she declines to give details of her proposal - which may be ready next month - she says the purpose is to extend trading hours. Meanwhile, the new chairman is stepping up efforts to arrange the merger with the CSCE. A merger committee has prepared a proposal for consideration by both exchanges' boards of directors at their next meetings. These will be held by May 13 and, if the light is green, a merger scheme will be put to the memberships of both exchanges. Ms Redel hopes that the approval process, at the board and membership levels, will be completed by the end of the year at the latest. A merger would reduce costs for members, clearing firms and the exchanges by eliminating duplication in the back offices and in administration. With respect to the joint construction of a new building with the CSCE, the Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange - the New York Mercantile Exchange has decided to go it alone on a new site - Ms Redel has said that she will evaluate the project on a 'cost-benefit analysis'. It is expected, however, that Comex will proceed with its previous decision to move to a new site. Ms Redel made her first pilgrimage to Washington last week to plead with the CFTC for higher limits on investors' speculative positions. She describes raising position limits as 'close to my top priority'. On this issue, she is joining a chorus of futures industry voices who argue that US exchanges are increasingly losing business to overseas and unregulated markets because of low, regulatory position limits on trading. With the advent of institutional trading and large commodity funds, the industry has changed, but the rules have not, said Ms Redel. She intended to request that gold and silver contract limits be raised from their current level of 6,000 lots to 15,000 lots (of 100 troy ounces for gold and 5,000 troy ounces for silver). Asked recently if she had any particular perspective as a woman in the male-dominated world of futures trading, Ms Redel - daughter of a former Comex chairman and executive vice president of the family firm, Redel Trading - shot back: 'My perspective is a business one'. She is, however, one of the few women to reach executive heights in the macho rough and tumble of the commodities markets. She has taken leave of the responsibilities at her own firm to work as the first full-time Comex chairman, drawing a salary of Dollars 125,000 a year. But her capacity for work has not been dented; she is also studying law at night to add a fresh qualification to the MBA she already holds. In a direct competitive challenge to the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Commodity Exchange has announced plans to introduce platinum and palladium futures, which currently trade on Nymex. Comex announced that its board of directors last week appointed a task force to review the markets and recommend specifications for the proposed contracts. 'Incorporating platinum and palladium contracts into our existing product line will be highly beneficial for the industry, while representing a natural fit for us,' said Mr David Halperin, president of Comex, which already lists gold, silver and copper. Mr Halperin said that prior to his board's decision last week Comex and Nymex had discussed several proposals which would shift trading of the two contracts to Comex under a revenue sharing agreement. But none of the proposals proved acceptable, he said in a statement released yesterday. Nymex reacted angrily to the announcement saying, 'We question the commitment to this industry by an institution which for apparent political motivation would attempt to remove liquidity from existing markets by offering a product with no substantial difference'. The two exchanges have ended up at each other throats after years of talks about a merger foundered last year.</p>

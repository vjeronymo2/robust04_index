			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan's next coalition  government will not create a new cabinet post in charge of  coordinating economic affairs, a senior Trade Ministry official  said Friday (922 April].    The new cabinet expected to be inaugurated Monday under  Tsutomu Hata, currently foreign minister in the government of  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will drop a plan to  have an overall economics minister, said the official at the  International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), who declined  to be identified.    The creation of the post was suggested as a way to  facilitate  formulation of stimulus and other economic packages and help  resolve Japan's trade difficulties with the United States.</p>

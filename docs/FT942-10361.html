			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Magazine group agrees print deal St Ives, the printing group, said yesterday that it had agreed an unusual long-term contract with IPC Magazines, part of the Reed Elsevier publishing group. Under the terms of the contract, one of three new web-offset presses which will be installed in a new St Ives print plant in Wales will be allocated exclusively to IPC. The agreement is thought to be the first of its kind between a printer and a publisher for many years. The three presses are part of a Pounds 30m investment which St Ives is making in a new facility at Ystrad Mynach, four miles from the existing plant at Caerphilly, south Wales, which it replaces. The press dedicated to IPC is expected to print between 10 and 12 of the publisher's monthly consumer magazine titles. IPC, which views the deal as 'an important strategic partnership', believes it will reduce costs and help improve its competitiveness. The new plant is expected to begin production in April next year and be fully operational by the autumn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- Wei Jianxing, a senior  leader of the Chinese Communist Party, said today that the  current anti-corruption campaign will concentrate on major  economic offences involving leading officials at and above the  county magistrate level.    Addressing a national telephonic conference, Wei, secretary  of the party Central Discipline Inspection Commission, also  emphasized the need to halt all kinds of malpractices and  corruption adversely affecting the progress of reforms, economic  growth and stability.    According to the commission, 15,216 party and government  officials were disciplined for economic offences during the  first quarter of 1994.    These officials included 450 at county magistrate level, 35  at the prefectural commissioner's level and three at provincial  or ministerial level.    Of the 15,216 officials, 1,416 were handed over to judicial  departments for prosecution on criminal charges.    Wei Jianxing, a member of the Political Bureau of the party  Central Committee, said that the current anti-corruption  campaign should focus on major cases involving economic  offences, such as embezzlement, bribery, financial frauds and  violation of financial discipline.    "Leading departments of the party and government, judicial  departments, administrative law-enforcement departments and  economic administrative departments remain the main targets," he  said.    As part of the anti-corruption campaign, he said, it was  imperative to halt the malpractices of collecting illicit fees,  making government-funded sight-seeing tours overseas and making  improper personal material gains by abusing one's power.</p>

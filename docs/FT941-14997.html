			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Row over colliery association merger The executive of the 5,000-strong British Association of Colliery Management is trying to sack Mr John Meads, the general secretary, in a row over the proposed merger with the 30,000-strong Engineers' and Managers' Association. In spite of overwhelming support for the merger in a vote of BACM members, the majority of the executive has decided to oppose its formal registration. Mr Meads supports the merger. The dissidents, led by Mr Doug Bulmer, BACM president, say the union will be submerged in the merger. They won an ex parte injunction to block formal registration of the merger.</p>

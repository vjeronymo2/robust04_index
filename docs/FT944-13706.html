			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slips to fresh lows against D-Mark and yen Pessimism about the outlook for the US dollar yesterday pushed it to fresh lows against both the D-Mark and the yen, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar touched a post-World War 2 low of Y96.35 against the yen, and a two year low of DM1.4845 against the D-Mark, before recovering to finish in London at Y96.86 and DM1.492. There was no sign of concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar, though numerous rumours swept the market. Sentiment towards the US currency remains resolutely negative. Traders described the afternoon rally as a technical correction, driven by covering of short positions, rather than anything more fundamental. Sterling continued its good run, touching a high for the year of Dollars 1.6405 against the dollar. The trade weighted index closed at 80.7 from 80.4, the highest level since early June. The pound is now 3 per cent higher than during its recent lows attained last August. In Europe the Swedish krona continued its advance, rising to SKr4.728 from SKr4.748 against the D-Mark. Trade in the dollar was driven more by technical factors, and rumours, than in response to any comments or new bits of information. Mr Malcolm Barr, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the extent to which the market had moved on rumours about central bank intervention showed how jittery it was. 'Sentiment towards the dollar remains pretty unanimously negative,' he said. The background to this pessimism is the fear that the Fed is not being sufficiently vigilant in combatting inflation; and concern that there is little prospect of the US narrowing its trade deficit with Japan. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in London, put matters in a slightly different light. He said currencies were moved not by a complex of factors, but by some simple relationship, 'currently in force'. The dollar, he said, was 'here because of the weight of outbound portfolio flows and in particular the sale of dollars by domestic investors.' Mr Persaud said the dollar would turn 'only when the US investor is comfortable holding US assets and the US bonds - the largest Dollars denominated market.' A 'minimum condition' for this would be for US real yields (currently 4.25-4.75 per cent) to rise above German real yields (above 5 per cent). Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, sought to bolster the dollar yesterday, saying that the US favoured a strong dollar. He also said that the Fed and the Administration shared the same growth and inflation view. Analysts were sceptical about the likely success of his intervention. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said there were three things the US could do to help the dollar: raise interest rates, intervene, or talk. So far they were only doing the latter, and then without great conviction. Mr Alan Blinder, vice-chairman of the Fed, also said that he did not believe the Fed was 'behind the curve ' in fighting inflation. 'I think we are very close to riding the curve, so to speak,' said Mr Blinder. One ray of hope for dollar bulls was the speed with which it bounced back. Mr Gunner said this was an indication 'that perhaps the market was getting quite short.' On the other hand, volumes were modest and there was little sign of follow-through buying. Mr Gunner said that with the benchmark treasury bond yield having broken through 8 per cent, it was possible it would sink quite quickly as far as 8.25 per cent. On recent evidence the dollar would follow, perhaps to the DM1.45 level. The pound gained support from the stronger than expected CBI industrial survey, which rekindled talk of another rise in interest rates by the year end. This was reflected in double-digit losses in most short sterling contracts. The December contract closed at 93.43, from 93.50, effectively discounting another 50 basis point rise in interest rates by the end of the year. Mr Gunner said with markets focusing on inflation, sterling continued also to benefit from last month's pre-emptive rise in interest rates. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 660m of late assistance to the market after earlier providing Pounds 273m of liquidity at established rates. Overnight money traded between 4 7/8 per cent and 7 per cent. In the cash market, three month LIBOR firmed slightly to 6 per cent from 5 15/16 per cent.</p>

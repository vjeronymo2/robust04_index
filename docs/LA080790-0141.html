Last weekend, there were 13 bicycles  reported stolen, one of which was valued at about $750, he said.  </P> <P> Police suspect that the crimes are the work of an organized group specializing  in bicycle thefts, and are warning residents to lock their garages, lock  bicycles and remove bicycle wheels even when bicycles are parked in garages.  </P> <P> Although summer often brings more bicycle thefts, this year's increase has been  unusually dramatic, Gonis said. Police have made some arrests but have been  unable to reverse the trend, he said.  </P></p>

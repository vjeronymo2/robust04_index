			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brewin Dolphin to float with Pounds 31m tag Brewin Dolphin, one of the UK's largest private client stockbrokers, will be valued at Pounds 30.9m when it joins the stock market next month. Mr John Hall, managing director, said the placing price of 150p had been cut by 10 per cent over the past couple of weeks reflecting the fall in share prices and the difficult new issues market. The placing price represents nine times earnings in the year to December 10, before exceptional costs, while the notional yield is 4.8 per cent. Shares in the closest comparable quoted company, BWD Securities, trade on an historic multiple of 10.5 with a yield of 4.3 per cent. The placing will raise Pounds 5.7m net for the company, most of which will be used to repay borrowings outstanding from the management buy-out in 1992 and the acquisition of Bell Lawrie last year. The flotation comprises a placing of 7.28m shares by Charterhouse of which some 2m are being placed with Brewin Dolphin's own private clients. Employees are retaining over 85 per cent of their existing shareholdings and will own 58.9 per cent of the enlarged equity. Dealings start on June 9.</p>

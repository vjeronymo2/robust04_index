			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CLEMSON'S ALLEN LEAVES SCHOOL  </P> <P> Tailback Terry Allen has withdrawn from school, but Clemson's second-leading  all-time rusher has not decided whether he will play his senior year or turn  pro, a university spokeswoman said today.  </P> <P> If he opts to leave, Allen would be the third junior to forgo his senior season  for a chance at the National Football League.  </P> <P> Alabama linebacker Keith McCants, one of the best players in the country, and  Arkansas fullback Barry Foster have both announced they will turn pro.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Allen can still go to summer school and be eligible to  play for the Tigers this fall.  </P> <P> Annabelle Vaughan, assistant sports information director, said that Allen had  been thinking about withdrawing since December and that the resignation of  Coach Danny Ford last week and the hiring of Ken Hatfield this week as the  school's new head football coach did not prompt the decision.  </P></p>

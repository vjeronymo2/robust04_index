			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (9): Sickened by violence - The problem of terrorism ON September 12, the first anniversary of his capture, a video recording of the imprisoned founder-leader of the Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) was shown to the nation by a smilingly confident Mr Alberto Fujimori. 'This is a defeated and demoralised man,' the Peruvian president claimed, as the recording revealed Abimael Guzman pacing the patio of his high-security cell, pensively smoking a cigarette. Mr Guzman remains in solitary confinement; representatives of the International Red Cross and 'occasional intelligence officials' are his only visitors. He appears to be surviving the rigours of prison life, but he can have little real notion of what has happened, since last September, to the organisation which revered him as 'Presidente Gonzalo'. His surprise arrest in a Lima suburban house last year provoked a domino effect. Computer records, documents and information extracted during interrogation led Dincote, Peru's counter-subversive police, to the hide-outs of many more key leaders. It is hard to over-estimate the importance, or the timeliness, of the Guzman capture. It occurred at the height of a Sendero offensive against Lima when, for the first time ever, civilians in the capital came under attack. Mr Carlos Bolona, then the economy and finance minister, not a man given to exaggeration, says: 'another major car-bomb in Lima and the military would have intervened, arguing that the country was ungovernable.' President Fujimori claims that 95 per cent of Sendero's 'political bureau' and 'central committee' is now either dead or behind bars. Mr Raul Gonzales, an expert on Sendero, recently concluded that the movement 'is no longer capable of taking power or of destabilising the government or the political system of Peru.' Thirteen years of guerrilla warfare and state response - from Sendero's emergence to burn ballot-boxes in May 1980, up to the present day - have cost at least 26,000 Peruvian lives. Mr Enrique Bernales, the former senator who has the most reliable historical statistics on violence in Peru, estimates the total cost in material damage at between Dollars 22bn and Dollars 23bn - about the same as Peru's external debt. Now Mr Bernales' statistics confirm that attacks and killings have declined. In January 1993, for the first time in 10 years, more Peruvians died from common violence (in road accidents, domestic disputes and so on) than from political violence. Mr Fujimori claims that dismantling Sendero is a result of his 'new' counter-subversive strategy which 'emphasises intelligence work and the participation of the people'. He attributes intelligence successes to his close adviser, the shadowy Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, and the current head of the joint chiefs of staff, General Nicolas Hermoza. But, without his institutional coup of last year, on April 5, Mr Fujimori says that recent advances would have been impossible. His seizure of quasi-dictatorial powers allowed him to decree sharply increased penalties for convicted terrorists (terrorism became classified as 'treason'), and to send suspects for trial by secret military tribunals, before masked judges. Peru's pre-coup justice system was 'a mockery and a farce,' says Mr Fujimori. Many terrorists were freed for lack of evidence or released after serving minimal prison terms. He claims that more people were sentenced for crimes of terrorism under the new laws in 11 months than in 10 years under the previous legislation. Another important element in the Fujimori counter-subversive offensive has been the arming, nationwide, of ronderos, or civil defence militias. This has undoubtedly proved a popular measure among defenceless peasants whose communities were under threat from Sendero guerrillas - although there are already disturbing indications in some areas (such as the jungle Apurimac valley) that ronderos are using their new-found power against the state which armed them, and forming alliances with drugs traffickers. Psychological tactics have also played an important role. A television advertising campaign advised guerrilla sympathisers to 'repent, die or spend your life in jail', as a prison door clanged shut. Almost every night alleged terrorists, already wearing their famous striped prison suits (reportedly designed by Mr Fujimori himself) are paraded across the small screen. Peruvians, sickened by the long years of violence, generally approve the Fujimori government's tough line with suspected terrorists. International community concern focuses on two main issues: the new counter-terrorism laws and continuing reports of human rights violations. Amnesty International has objected to the now widespread system of trial behind closed doors. It warns that, if the death penalty for convicted terrorists is approved along with the new constitution, 'prisoners could be executed . . . following conviction in military trials that fall short of international standards.' New legislation also facilitates 'unacknowledged detention' - according to Amnesty 'an underlying cause of the high level of 'disappearance', extrajudicial execution and torture in the emergency zones.' Peru has had, for several years, the unenviable distinction of being top of the world's league table for disappearances. This year the figures are down  -to 55 in the first eight months of the year, according to Mr Francisco Soberon of Aprodeh, a Lima-based human rights organisation. Aprodeh counts a total of 556 'disappeared' in the first three years of the Fujimori administration. Despite fewer disappearances, Mr Soberon believes that 'there is a correlation between that and the rise in the number of detentions.' According to General Hermoza, more than 4,000 suspected terrorists have been detained since last year's coup. Some are undoubtedly innocent. Perhaps a third of all detainees have to be freed for lack of evidence, says Mr Soberon. 'The military are under heavy pressure to show they are effective, so are often over-zealous in detaining people.' Government authorities, meanwhile, have shown themselves flat-footed in responding to particularly shocking human rights cases. The current investigation of human remains in a series of shallow graves near Lima (the charred bones may be those of some of the nine students and a teacher who 'disappeared' from the La Cantuta university last July) has been painfully slow. Offers of help from international forensic experts were rejected. Can Peruvians - and potential foreign investors - be satisfied that 'pacification' is finally on the cards, as new hoardings on the road from the airport to the centre of town announce? Most observers agree that Peru's second guerrilla movement, pro-Cuban MRTA, is as good as finished. 'The remnants are unco-ordinated bands and act almost like common criminals,' says Mr Bernales. 'There's nothing to indicate that it is a political organisation any more.' With founder-leader Mr Victor Polay and his senior lieutenants all serving life prison sentences, many MRTA militants have taken advantage of the 'laws of repentance' and have laid down arms. The same, however, cannot be said for hard-line Sendero Luminoso. Although Mr Bernales' statistics indicate the movement has lost a third of its operational capacity, 'the organisation, though weakened, remains,' he says. In some areas, such as the coca-growing Huallaga valley and the north-central department of Ancash, it seems to be almost intact. While the 'quality' of Sendero attacks has fallen, according to Mr Bernales, he questions President Fujimori's claims about the efficacy of the intelligence service. 'Attacks are not generally failing because they are detected but because the perpetrators are inexperienced,' he says. The army has still not adapted its traditional strategies to allow it to respond to guerrilla harassment. Mr Bernales warns that society should not let slip its guard - 'Sendero is too dangerous for that,' he says. 'It's not yet the moment to shout victory.'</p>

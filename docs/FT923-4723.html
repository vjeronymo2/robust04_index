			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Jourdan losses rise to Pounds 874,000 Pre-tax losses at Thomas Jourdan amounted to Pounds 874,000 in the first half of 1992, against Pounds 595,000. The latest figure was struck after exceptional reorganisation charges of Pounds 290,000. The group makes and markets consumer goods, including trouser presses, fireplaces, furniture and cosmetic accessories. Further steps were taken to reorganise, which meant more redundancies and costs; for the year overall, reorganisation costs were expected to be less than the Pounds 539,000 of 1991. Turnover for the half year fell to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 11.2m). However, due to the seasonal nature of the business a significantly larger part of turnover and profit is earned in the second half. Losses per share came to 3.75p (2.21p). The interim dividend is again 0.5p.</p>

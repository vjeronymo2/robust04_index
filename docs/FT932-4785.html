			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / DTI probes pub rent rises on Inntrepreneur leases THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is investigating complaints about the pub-leasing scheme operated by Inntrepreneur, the joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Courage. Many licensees have protested that increased rents charged under the 20-year Inntrepreneur leases are forcing them out of business. The department confirmed yesterday that details of the complaints - taken up by MPs and ministers - were being examined. It promised 'substantive' replies to all the points raised as soon as possible. The move was welcomed yesterday by Mrs Tricia Boyes, organiser of the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees, which was set up to fight the rent increases being imposed in the conversion of old tenancy agreements. Licensees began their campaign against the terms of the leases by picketing GrandMet's annual meeting in February, and later took their protests to the Commons agriculture committee. GrandMet began to introduce the long-term leases into its pub estate in 1988, and has since been extending them into Inntrepreneur's 6,800 pubs. More than 70 per cent of landlords have signed new agreements, according to the company, but the failure rate of the joint venture pubs has been about 9 per cent a year. GrandMet announced a change of policy last month, indicating that some hard-pressed tenants would now be offered three-year leases. Inntrepreneur's bankers, it said, had dropped their original requirement that 90 per cent of the estate should be converted to 20-year leases by next March. GrandMet and Courage shared operating losses of Pounds 12m on joint venture in the six months to March, and each will probably have to inject another Pounds 65m by October to comply with banking covenants. The two companies each paid Pounds 32m into Inntrepreneur last year as well as sharing operating losses of Pounds 28m.</p>

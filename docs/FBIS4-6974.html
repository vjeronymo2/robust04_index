			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei  Kono said early Tuesday [26 April] the coalition's core party  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] has shown its true character.    "The departure of the Social Democratic Party from the  coalition is a matter of course," said Kono, president of the  Liberal Democratic Party. "I have repeatedly pointed out that  Shinseito-led management of political affairs is high-handed.  Shinseito revealed its true character after the election of its  party head (Tsutomu Hata)," Kono said.    Asked if the LDP will pursue any links with the SDP, Kono  replied it is too early to talk about that.</p>

[Al-Musa] The ministers will discuss many issues concerning  not only the Damascus Declaration signatory countries but also  the entire Arab nation and this region. [passage omitted]    [Abu-al-Majd] Naturally, Kuwait will focus on one specific  issue: The security in the Gulf in light of the Iraqi threats  and the prisoners issue. Of course, you will stress specific  issues at this meeting.    [Al-Musa] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad has stated that all member  states of the Damascus Declaration have condemned the Iraqi  invasion and contributed to the liberation of Kuwait. There is  nothing new to be discussed on this matter because we believe  that the Damascus Declaration member states stood united against  the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. [passage omitted]    [Abu-al-Majd] Regarding the development of areas that will  come under Palestinian self-rule, is Kuwait willing to  contribute to this development?    [Al-Musa] If you mean the self-rule areas, we have announced  that Kuwait has contributed $25 million that will be spent  through international organizations and economic institutions to  develop the self-rule area and the occupied territories in  general.    [Abu-al-Majd] What is your stance on the Arab boycott of  Israel? It is being said that some Arab countries intend to end  this boycott should a new situation arise. What is Kuwait's  stance on this issue?    [Al-Musa] We in Kuwait are committed to the boycott as long  as all the Arab countries are. There will be no separate or  unilateral stance departing from the consensus of our Arab  brothers. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Underwriters oppose Lloyd's arbitration plan A PROPOSAL by Lloyd's of London to resolve future disputes between agencies and Names - the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - outside the courts is meeting opposition from within the market. The Lloyd's council - the market's governing body - passed an enabling by-law earlier this week paving the way for the introduction of a mandatory arbitration process. Lloyd's agreed last year to establish an arbitration scheme for big disputes. But urgency was given to the proposals, which could form part of a scheme to help the market's worst-hit Names, when Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, confirmed on Thursday that the council is investigating a possible plan which would help Names who suffered most from losses in 1989 and 1990. Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, has said that moves to help the market's 'walking wounded' would need to be accompanied by measures to stem litigation between Names and their agents. More than 2,000 of the market's 22,400 Names are involved in legal actions. However, a number of leading underwriters - who insure businesses against legal awards for negligence - are opposed to the plan. Mr Alec Sharp, a leading errors-and-omissions underwriter with syndicate 839, managed by Castle Underwriting, says that if the scheme goes ahead agents would be unable to obtain errors-and-omissions insurance and could be exposed to financial problems. Lloyd's was 'isolating managing agents from the normal insurance protections available to financial institutions. If you have a syndicate that makes a mess of something the entire agency is going to be on the line,' said Mr Sharp. 'The costs of arbitration had in the past exceeded those spent in the courts.' Lloyd's was responding to problems too late, he added. 'It is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.' Mr Sharp also ruled out any possibility of errors-and-omissions underwriters contributing to a fund which would compensate those Names who forgo their right to seek compensation through the law. 'For anybody to get think that E&amp;O underwriters will get their chequebook out for the benefit of the market is very very naive,' Mr Sharp added. 'Our reinsurers would not pay up and our Names would sue. It's a vicious circle.' Underwriters and agents are also unhappy about other elements of the efforts to help Names. Some members' agents believe that most Names will refuse to agree to pay an extra levy to finance the losses of other Names. Other agents believe that the council should be doing more to alleviate cashflow problems. 'Lloyd's is burying its head in the sand. We need some mechanism to put up working capital,' said the chief executive of one agency, who believes liquidity problems will be aggravated when the scale of 1989 losses - currently estimated at Pounds 1.35bn - are revealed.</p>

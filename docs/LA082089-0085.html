			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OUTFALL FALLOUT  </P> <P> I wish to respond to your piece, "Scripps Sewage Tack Differs in Own Back  Yard," (Aug. 11.)  </P> <P> Reputable scientists have never stated that there is no influence of outfalls  on the local flora and fauna. Most natural communities are very sensitive to  increases or decreases in food production and the organic loading in sewage  effluent represents a huge increase in food to the surrounding area with  well-described local changes.  </P> <P> The question is, is this important? In the context of the overall state of the  ocean, the answer is no. In the context of recreational and commercial use of  the coastal ocean near shore, the answer is again, no, if outfalls have been  properly sited offshore at depth as the one at Point Loma is. In the context of  trying to maintain an underwater reserve, the answer may well be, yes, which is  why Scripps questioned the location of an outfall north of the underwater  reserve, and north of Scripps pier where the intake for seawater used for  research and aquarium purposes is withdrawn. Given a knowledge of the local  coastal ocean, there could be times when because of circulation features some  portion of the waste stream could impinge on either the water supply or on the  underwater reserve, and could cause changes.  </P> <P> The underwater reserve was set aside in an effort to protect an indigenous  biota, one that has been under assault from recreational and commercial fishing  and diving. Additionally, the Scripps pier has served as an important location  for monitoring physical, biological and chemical properties of the ocean over  the past several decades, and any kind of potential artificial change to the  signal should be avoided. These conservation and research issues are different  from questions about impacts of the outfall on recreational or commercial  interests.  </P> <P> Having Scripps speak out against a northern outfall is not contradictory to the  idea of maintaining an underwater "wilderness" area. And having Scripps  scientists speak out as citizens against secondary treatment as expensive and  not worth the effort does speak not to the goal of maintaining an underwater  reserve but is answering a question about the impacts of coastal outfalls on  the general health of the coastal ocean.  </P></p>

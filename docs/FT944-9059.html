			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Trafalgar backed for Samsung contract Trafalgar House has been named by Samsung of South Korea as the chosen developer for its Pounds 600m plan to expand production of electronic consumer goods in north-east England. The decision to build a manufacturing complex at Wynyard, Cleveland, was announced by Samsung - the world's 14th-biggest industrial group - last month. The complex, which will produce consumer goods including microwave ovens and computer monitors for the European market, is expected to provide 3,000 permanent jobs by the end of the decade and will create substantial employment during the construction phase. It will be the biggest single European investment by a Korean company. Preliminary design work has been started by Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shipping and hotels group. A construction contract has still to be signed but Trafalgar is in a strong position as favoured developer. Mr Chan Bae, Samsung Electronic's UK managing director, said yesterday: 'We are looking forward to working closely with Trafalgar House over the next few years.' The complex - the Samsung Industrial Park - will eventually comprise five manufacturing plants as well as training and administrative centres. The first phase includes the construction of microwave oven and computer monitor plants on the 200-acre site close to Samsung's existing Pounds 20m colour television factory. A second phase, providing facilities to manufacture facsimile machines, colour display tubes and personal computers, is planned to start in 1997. The company plans to move its European headquarters from Frankfurt to London. The UK government offered Samsung Pounds 58m in regional grants and loans to secure the project. With indirect aid, the support is equivalent to 20 per cent of Samsung's investment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays) in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10272, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the order. The revised CGP is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary burdens on HAs. While the program is revised, the primary change is only in the way that HUD processes and reviews HA modernization activities, and not the modernization activities. Since participation by HAs is discretionary, this rule lacks the direct and substantial effects on HAs required for a policy with federalism implications under the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. The rule does not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or general well-being, since its effect is limited to revising program procedures for HAs applying for discretionary grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was listed as item 1680 in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda published on April 25, 1994, at 59 FR 20424/20468, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Anti-Lobbying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 26, 1990, the Department published an interim rule (24 CFR part 87) advising recipients and subrecipients of Federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans of a prohibition mandated by Congress. Section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121, approved October 23, 1989) generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The interim rule generally prohibits the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. In addition, the recipient must also file a disclosure if it has made or has agreed to make any payment with nonappropriated funds that would be prohibited, if paid with appropriated funds. IHAs established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The certification and disclosure requirements apply to all grants in excess of $100,000. All potential grantees are required to submit the certification, and to make the required disclosure if the grant amount exceeds $100,000. Potential grantees should refer to 24 CFR part 87 for the language for the certification and disclosure. The law provides substantial monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Catalog of Domestic Assistance numbers for the programs affected by this proposed rule are 14.146, 14.147, 14.850, 14.851, 14.852, and 15.141.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR Part 905  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aged, Energy conservation, Grant programs_housing and community development, Grant programs_Indians, Indians, Individuals with disabilities, Lead poisoning, Loan programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_Indians, Low and moderate income housing, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24 CFR Part 968  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant programs_housing and community development, Indians, Loan programs_housing and community development, Public housing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Department amends 24 CFR parts 905 and 968 as set forth below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

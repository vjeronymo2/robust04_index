			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IBM to shed 400 jobs at two sites INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, is rationalising its manufacturing activities in the UK with the loss of 400 jobs over three years at its plants in the south of England and in Scotland. IBM manufactures magnetic disc files, the memory systems used in large mainframe computers, at Havant in Hampshire, and personal computers at its Greenock plant near Glasgow. The company said it remained committed to a policy of full employment and there would be no redundancies. The rationalisation measures are designed to eliminate duplication in services to the two plants. They will involve creating a single structure for planning, finance, information processing and site services under Mr John Holmes, director of manufacturing for IBM UK. IBM plants worldwide compete against each other to manufacture particular computer systems. The performance of plants making comparable equipment in the US, Europe and Asia is closely monitored. The company said yesterday that the chief aim of the rationalisation was to improve the cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of the UK manufacturing operations with the intention of winning more manufacturing 'missions' for the UK plants. That did not imply that Havant and Greenock were less efficient than their counterparts in the US or Japan. Over the past three years, IBM has moved thousands of employees worldwide from administrative positions into line jobs. Many other workers have been encouraged to leave through voluntary redundancy schemes as part of a restructuring operation designed to match overheads to a market that has slowed from growth rates of more than 20 per cent to 10 per cent or less.</p>

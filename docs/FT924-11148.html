			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (8): Long-term potential should soon become clearer - Stock Exchange WHEN visiting the Colombo Stock Exchange floor it is advisable to take ear-plugs. Respectably dressed traders compete with each other to secure deals by bawling prices at high decibels. Mr Ravi Peiris, the general manager of the exchange, smiles wryly and says: 'The people sent here by brokers tend to have loud voices'. Despite a history stretching back almost 100 years, it is only recently that the stock exchange has come to life. A share market was inaugurated in Colombo in 1896 when companies wishing to finance tea plantations raised funds by offering shares to the public. The market, however, was characterised by inactivity and was almost destroyed by the nationalisation policy adopted by the 1970-1977 government of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike. Even after the election of the United National Party government in 1977, with its espousal of liberal economic policies, the then-titled Colombo Securities Exchange struggled for survival. Mr Peiris admits 'awareness was so low, people thought we were providing personal security services'. Since 1990, the government has progressively dismantled a tax structure which had been a disincentive to equity investments. In the past two years a 15 per cent withholding tax on dividends, a 100 per cent tax on the transfer of shares and all capital gains taxes have been removed. The response has been a surge in daily turnover from just SLRs1.5m in 1989 to SLRs25m this year. Market capitalisation has also jumped from about SLRs18bn in 1989 to more than SLRs80bn last year, although a slide in share values in the past 10 months has seen it decline to about SLRs75bn. The growth of the market has coincided with a move to computerise the workings of the exchange, starting from the back office. Whereas the open 'out-cry' system of making deals is used on the trading floor, all clearing and settlement is fully automated. The system - which cost just Dollars 135,000 and became operational in September 1991 - gives Colombo the technological edge over most emerging markets which still rely on physical transfer of scrips to complete deals. In the relative peace of his office - the trading floor rumbles in the background - Mr Peiris watches the real-time deals on his computer console. The information is simultaneously transmitted to the 11 licensed brokers and to 'retail shops' operated by two leading brokers, where the general public is invited to punt on the market. However, while Colombo can feel satisfied with the progress made so far, it still ranks among the smallest of the emerging markets. Only 60 of the 186 listed companies are actively traded and trading volume is so low as to make it difficult for large investors to move in and out of positions rapidly. There are also signs that domestic enthusiasm is waning and companies have found it increasingly difficult to raise capital through the market. While SLRs2bn in new issues was raised in the first seven months of the year and rights issues totalling SLRs1.2bn were also launched, underwriters have had to step in with several offers not fully subscribed. The creation of four unit trusts this year also hurt the equity market. While the trusts can invest in equities, brokers say all but a fraction of their funds have gone into time-deposits and low-risk treasury bills. The trusts, which carry generous tax incentives for investors, attracted SLRs2bn which might otherwise have been placed in equities. Since last December the Colombo index has fallen by one-fifth in what brokers politely call 'a correction'. But as Mr Anura Wickremasinghe, director of brokers Forbes and Walker says: 'I'm surprised the market didn't collapse. It only dropped 20 per cent. In that context, it's a very strong market.' The longer-term potential of the market should soon become clearer with the imminent arrival of five foreign brokers - Jardine Fleming, Smith New Court, Sasoons, Development Bank of Singapore and Crosby Securities  - to compete with the 11 local brokers. Mr Ajit Gunewardene, managing director of CKN Fund Management, believes foreign brokers will 'add value to the market in terms of research. The market needs a new infusion of expertise to expand further'. Leading local brokers hope to maintain a sufficient market share through their network of domestic clients and accept that, without the attention of foreign investors, the market will stagnate. 'We bring a lot of potential buying power for Sri Lankan equities,' explains Mr Timothy Beardson, chairman of Crosby Securities (Hong Kong), although he adds that 'International institutions are likely to hold back for a year or two' before committing funds to Colombo. In June the government agreed to allow foreign investors to own 100 per cent of most listed companies and about 25 regional funds run by international financial institutions have started investing in the market. The government's privatisation programme should help improve the market's liquidity with its policy of broadening the base of share ownership. The government has divested 21 companies to date (excluding the plantation and transport sectors) and a further 40 are slated for privatisation by next June. Colombo has also avoided the regulatory scandals suffered by other emerging markets such as Bombay and Jakarta, with strict rules on disclosure. Brokers are confident they can allay investor's concern over the continuing separatist war in the north and east of the country, so long as national economic growth can be maintained. Mr Wickremasinghe believes investor familiarity is the key to a market's success. He points to the willingness of US investors to deal in the Manila stock market, which enjoys daily turnover of about Dollars 7.5m, despite the Philippines' volatile political record. Brokers also point to China's stock exchanges which have boomed despite uncertainty over the future direction of the communist government, and to Thailand where political turmoil has led to record trading on the Bangkok bourse.</p>

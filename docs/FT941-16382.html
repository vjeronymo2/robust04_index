			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Caracas returns to price control Venezuela has imposed strict price controls on a 'market basket' of basic items amid mounting public discontent over recent price rises fuelled by the introduction of a value added tax. The Caracas government's decision, unveiled on Sunday night, freezes prices of 11 food items and about 100 medicines. It represents a sharp policy change for Venezuela, which began to eliminate price controls on goods and services in 1989. Previously the country had a long history of price controls and other forms of govern-ment intervention in the economy. The price control decree is due to expire on March 1, but businessmen fear a new government scheduled to take office on February 2 will be tempted to prolong it. Mr Jorge Redmond, president of the Venezuelan Industrial Council, which represents manufacturers, called the government decision 'lamentable' and 'irresponsible,' and said it showed that Venezuelans still felt they had to run to the government to solve their problems. The administration of President Ramon Jose Velasquez ordered a two-stage introduction of VAT, starting last October, with the second stage introduced on January 1. Retail prices rose sharply in October and again earlier this month, causing widespread public discontent in a country which has suffered from more than two years of political and social instability. Sharp increases in petrol prices and transport fares in early 1989 sparked three days of rioting and looting that left about 300 dead. Some officials are worried that recent price rises could generate fresh riots. The VAT was designed to provide the government with a more diversified income base and avoid fiscal deficits which have fuelled inflation. Big increases in retail prices since October were caused by a combination of price gouging by some businessmen and a lack of government information on the new tax and how it should be applied.</p>

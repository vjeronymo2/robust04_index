Israel accepted the  President's invitation, but it is still not clear whether the  Palestinians also accepted. The prime minister made these  remarks to 70 ambassadors posted in Israel whom he summoned to  his office in Tel Aviv in order to brief them about the Hebron  incidents and the political situation.    The prime minister called on the Palestinians to act like  Israel and to totally separate between the Hebron incident and  the continuation of the political process. Our correspondent  Sheli Yehimovich reports the prime minister reiterated that as  an Israeli, a Jew, and a human being, he is ashamed that an  Israeli Jew perpetrated this massacre. He emphasized, however,  that there is no proof that it was part of an organized action.</p>

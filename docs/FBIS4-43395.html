			<p>BFN     [Text] The police discovered weapons and ammunition on  board a yacht in Ibiza. This weaponry could have been destined  for use by the Northern Ireland terrorist group, IRA. RNE in  the Balearic Islands reports:    [Unidentified correspondent] Customs officers and the Civil  Guard intercepted a consignment of weapons on a yacht moored at  the Marina de Botafoc leisure harbor in Ibiza. Four people were  arrested during the operation: a Briton, an Irishman, a  Canadian, and a New Zealand woman. Among the materiel seized  were assault rifles and machine-guns, bullet-proof vests, and  10,000 cartridges. The police have not revealed where this  materiel came from nor where the yacht was headed. The yacht  had been moored at Ibiza's leisure harbor for some days.  Initial investigations point to a possible link between the  four arrested and the IRA terrorist organization.</p>

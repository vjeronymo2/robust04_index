			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: POST-MODERN CIVIC CENTER IS SOUL OF A CITY  </P> <P> Purple Post-Modern columns, topped by symbolic metal mesh pediments, frame the  courtyard entries to South Pasadena's city hall, police station and council  chamber. The latter, with its raftered wooden ceiling and subdued chapel-like  gray and cream walls, seems crafted to cool the passions at town meetings.  </P> <P> The chamber's soothing colors are especially appropriate, given South  Pasadena's history. For 25 years, residents have fought the freeway and other  encroachments into their 3.44-square-mile territory, sandwiched between  affluent Pasadena and giant Los Angeles. And like most development issues in  this small city of 25,000, the civic center proposal stirred vigorous debate.  </P> <P> In fact, soon after the 1983 announcement that South Pasadena's run-down city  hall would be replaced, residents and politicians began arguing about the  proposed civic center's location. Two sites were favored. Mayor Ted Shaw  supported an El Centro Avenue location, opposite the city's rebuilt 1930s  public library; another faction advocated rebuilding and expanding the existing  1950s city hall in the historic Mission Street district.  </P> <P> In 1984, the voters decided on Mission Street and, four years later, the  $3-million civic center was completed, encompassing a renovated city hall and  new council chamber, police station and fire hall.  </P> <P> The handsome Post-Modern complex derives its style from the traditional Spanish  and Mission revival architecture of the city's historic Mission Street core.  Scale is modest, a homage to the city's enduring small-town character, and  buildings, both civic and commercial, are low-rise, low-key and friendly.  </P> <P> "It would have been easier to design a building that made a personal statement,  but we wanted to create a civic architecture of quality that symbolized the  low-key soul of the city," said architect Stefanos Polyzoides, a former South  Pasadena resident who designed the center with partner Peter de Bretteville.  "To make this happen we had to be subtle and discreet. We had to do an  expressive design that fits in with its neighbors."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Midwestern Tone  </P> <P> The shady streets surrounding the civic center recall another era, when  Midwesterners flocked to the area to settle amid the orange groves. The modest  bungalows they built in a hand-me-down Craftsman style still set the tone, and  two churches dominate the center, reminders of the Fundamentalist faith of the  city's founding fathers.  </P> <P> In Polyzoides's view, South Pasadena still remains "the displaced Iowa town  established by its Midwestern founders. Any attempt to make a heroic,  overscaled architecture would (have been) totally out of the question," he  said.  </P> <P> The center has many civic virtues, among them the fact it fits neatly into the  surroundings by aligning main frontages on Mission and Mound streets with the  facades of the existing buildings. Two courtyards -- one public, the other  internal -- link the various civic departments. A trio of portals on Mission  lead to the public courtyard.  </P> <P> "Our aim was to overlay the historic architectural style of the city with a  contemporary gloss to create a continuity between then and now," de Bretteville  said. "We wanted to lay out the civic center as if it were an old Spanish  mission, like a complex of low, interlinked, red-tile-roofed buildings."  </P> <P> The police station, located behind a bullet-proof window that seals off the  interior from public access, is airy and unintimidating. Lit by clerestory  windows, a double-height corridor floods the inner offices with sun and  separates the holding cells and booking areas from the detectives' rooms. The  corridor also opens onto an internal courtyard, linking the police station with  the fire hall on Mound Street.  </P> <P> "This building is a hundred times pleasanter to work in than the old police  house," said Lt. Richard Kowaltchuk, a senior member of the 30-member South  Pasadena Police Department. "We're really happy to be here."  </P> <P> When on duty, members of the fire department live above the garage, and in an  emergency, slide down stainless steel poles located on balconies at each end of  the fire hall. At the rear, a tile-capped four-story training tower resembles  the bell tower of a small Spanish pueblo.  </P> <P> City Manager John Bernardi applauds the civic center design as "very  functional, with good spaces and a nice style. People here aren't easy to  please," he said. "They care a lot about their city, so it's quite an accolade  when most comments I've heard about the new building are favorable, and even  proud."  </P></p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (32): Poles begin to see the lights - Advertising is changing the appearance of Warsaw On the train travelling from west to east Berlin, it was once easy to spot the frontier just by watching where the bright lights ended and the sombre gloom began. In the past five years free market economics have begun to blur the difference as the appearance of eastern European cities changes with outdoor advertising covering the still shabby exteriors of most buildings. In Warsaw, few have done as much to change the way the city looks as Catherine Sienkiewicz, the owner of Adpol, a company which owns 200 western-style illuminated bus stops carrying advertising. Standing on the eighth floor of the Universal building above one of the city's busiest points, Ms Sienkiewicz, an attractive blonde, says she went into business once communism collapsed in 1989. Ms Sienkiewicz's first steps, like those of many Poles now in private business, was in imports of electronics goods. 'We ran a bonded warehouse,' she says. Now, from her office she can see a crowd of people waiting for buses and trams at her red-painted plexiglass and steel bus shelters. The idea came to her and her erstwhile partner Mr Andrzej Litwinek, an Anglo-Pole and refugee from Merrill Lynch in 1991, and the original six shelters came from the United Kingdom. Now they are manufactured in Poland and their cost makes up the lion's share of the company's total 30bn zloty investment to date. Adpol still quotes its prices in pounds sterling as a reminder of the early days. Funded through bank loans the company made a small profit last year, its second full year of operation with turnover worth 10bn zlotys in 1992 growing steadily. 'Our turnover in the first two months of 1994 has already reached 5bn zlotys,' says Ms Sienkiewicz who has received several offers from foreign companies ready to buy into her firm. She refused, she says, because 'this is my future'. Adpol is now planning to expand into other cities such as Gdansk on the Baltic coast. Five per cent of Adpol's turnover goes to the Warsaw city authorities under a 15-year agreement. The bus company, which is still owned by the city, saves on the arrangement because it does not have to clean the shelters each night. That is organised by Adpol. Ms Sienkiewicz says the advertising market is growing year by year, with more foreign companies coming in to the country and local ones increasingly appreciating the merits of trumpeting the merits of its product. One fifth of the advertisements on the bus stops come from Polish-owned companies, the latest being a Warsaw-based fat producer which has decided to take on Unilever with its own Nova margarine brand. But most of the business comes from the multinationals such as Philip Morris and Master Foods as dog food and tobacco vie for the attention of bus travellers and motorists stuck in increasingly common Warsaw traffic jams.</p>

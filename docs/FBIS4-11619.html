			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Two of the largest political forces in Congress have  supported jurist Ivan Dario Badell for the post of prosecutor  general of the Republic. The designation was made shortly after  1700, when it was confirmed that 137 legislators from Democratic  Action and Social Christian Party expressed their support for  Dr. Badell, who defeated Dr. Gonzalo Rodriguez Corro to become  prosecutor general.    Rodriguez Corro, a former Supreme Court president, received  109 votes from the legislative wings of National Convergence,  Movement Toward Socialism, and Radical Cause Party.</p>

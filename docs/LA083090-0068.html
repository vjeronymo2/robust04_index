			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 MISSING WOMEN FOUND; DISAPPEARANCE WAS FAKED  </P> <P> Three missing Rialto women whose bloodstained car was found abandoned in North  Hollywood last week turned up safe in Utah Wednesday night and admitted that  they faked their disappearance to get sympathy from their families, Los Angeles  police said.  </P> <P> "It was all a hoax," Lt. John Zorn said.  </P> <P> Police had suspected foul play in the disappearance of Suzanne Ballinger, 38,  her 17-year-old daughter, Sherry Richards, and Richards' friend, Laura Fleming,  18. They vanished last Thursday after leaving the Van Nuys print shop where  Ballinger worked.  </P> <P> Ballinger's car was found Sunday in North Hollywood with "small amounts of  blood" on the seat, said police, who launched a search for the women.  </P> <P> But Ballinger's husband called police Wednesday night to say that all three  were safe in Ogden, Utah.  </P> <P> "We subsequently made a call to a crisis counseling center in Ogden, Utah, and  established that the women were safe, and had not been victims, and had  perpetrated a hoax to generate sympathy for unspecified personal problems,"  Zorn said.  </P> <P> The three admitted that the blood found in the car was Fleming's -- the result  of a self-inflicted wound -- and that they had scattered the contents of their  purses, Zorn said.  </P> <P> Police believe they left Los Angeles by bus Friday for Ogden, said Zorn.  </P> <P> The three will not face charges, Zorn said.  </P> <P> Ballinger was last seen about 11 p.m. last Thursday when she left her job as a  typesetter, accompanied by her daughter and Fleming.  </P> <P> According to a co-worker, Ballinger had complained of a headache. Rather than  face the two-hour drive home to San Bernardino County, Ballinger told the  co-worker she planned to check into a motel, as she sometimes did when she  worked late.  </P> <P> The three women never arrived at the motel. Ballinger's white 1987 Ford  Thunderbird was found Sunday in the parking lot of an apartment complex about  four miles from her office. The keys were still in the car, as were their  purses, police said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Nieson Himmel contributed to this story.  </P></p>

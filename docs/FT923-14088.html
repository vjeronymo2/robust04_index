			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Non-trading companies cast shadow over standards WHEN A small US business began a legal action against a British company earlier this year, it stumbled across a problem that raises far-reaching questions about the accounting and legal regulations for non-trading and dormant companies in the UK. Pentagen Technologies International, a software company operating from New York, which wanted to register as a non-resident UK company five years ago, appears to have found itself in the bizarre situation of entering into a contract with a company which does not trade. According to a writ for Dollars 32m in damages filed by Pentagen in the New York state supreme court in April this year, Pentagen asked Jordan and Sons  -which is part of Jordan Group, the Bristol-based corporate information and services group - to act as its company secretary in August 1987. Under UK company law, the company secretary performs a wide range of functions, including taking responsibility for maintaining share and other official registers and filing annual returns and accounts with Companies' House. Jordans sent an application form in the name of Express Company Secretaries to provide registered office and company secretarial services. Pentagen completed the form, paid a fee, and returned the documents. The writ alleges that these services were never performed and seeks compensation for the consequences. 'What followed was your worst nightmare,' says Mr Joel Robinson, a lawyer representing Pentagen. The company continued to develop over the next three years, and was on the point of negotiating a contract worth up to Dollars 11m with the US army to provide it with voice recognition and language translation software. But in early 1990, he says, an internal audit by Pentagen picked up the fact that the company was no longer registered in the UK. After failing to meet the statutory requirements, it had been struck off the company register and dissolved in 1990. On hearing of the difficulties, its bankers shied away and the US army backed out from the software deal. Mr Robinson was hired to consider possible legal action, and requested the accounts of Express Company Secretaries as part of his background research. To his horror, he discovered that the company had not traded during any of the last five years and in 1988 had become 'dormant', which means it does not have to appoint auditors or file a profit and loss account. 'It was the furthest thing from my mind when I did the search,' he says. The details of the Pentagen case are less important than the general point it seems to raise about UK company law and accounting standards. Thousands of other customers are entering into similar contracts with UK companies which are shown in their accounts to be non-trading. The process seems to be completely legal, but, in the words of one accountant, appears to be a 'modest subterfuge'. It certainly seems to make a mockery of the accounting. Mr Michael Whitwell, chief executive of Jordan Group and a director of Express, refuses to comment on the Pentagen case because of the US legal action. But he says: 'It is easy to read too much into it. This is a normal and sensible way to provide a company secretary. Others do the same thing. It is not in any way abnormal. It is an entirely genuine arrangement which works very effectively.' The situation is far from unique to Jordans. For example, London Law Agency, a rival company registration service, says that it also offers company secretarial services through a non-trading company, called London Law Secretarial. Mr Ray Hinton, technical partner with Arthur Andersen, says: 'I grant you it's misleading.' But he says many companies have non-trading subsidiaries. These are often businesses which have been bought and which have a brand-name the new owner wants to maintain, perhaps because customers want to think they are still trading with the original company. 'They want to retain the goodwill, but don't want the effort of audited accounts,' he says. Mr Whitwell says that Jordans uses non-trading secretarial companies for all of its customers. The reason, he argues, is simply 'administrative efficiency' so that mail received on behalf of companies it represents is not confused with correspondence intended for Jordans itself. Mr John Franks, a partner with solicitors Chethams and a member of the Law Society's company law committee, stresses there is nothing illegal about the practice, as long as the ultimate owner (or 'principal') of the subsidiary (the 'agent') is disclosed. If anything goes wrong, he suggests, it is still possible to sue the principal, even if the contract was drawn up with the agent. This relationship would appear to be clearly shown in the case of Express, which lists two Jordans directors as its directors, and is ultimately owned by the West of England Trust, the parent company of Jordan Group. West of England is also listed in the latest filings as the company secretary for Express. None the less, it does seem rather strange. On the one hand, a non-trading company that operates with no employees, no accounts and no transactions passing through its books. On the other, one that is named in a contract as the entity which will be providing a range of services for a fee, and which individuals need to be paid to perform. Should its books not at least show a fee for acting as a nominee for another company? It hardly seems to comply with the requirement that the accounts should show a true and fair view. There again, in the case of a dormant company, there is no need for an auditor to scrutinise the accounts either. This is what perplexes Mr Robinson. Pentagen entered into a contract with Express, yet Express does not trade even though it pledges to provide a wide range of services. Aside from the requirements set down for a company secretary by law, Pentagen's contract explicitly listed a series of responsibilities to be carried out by Express, including filing documents, supplying minutes for the annual general meeting, and forwarding mail in its role as the registered office of the company. 'People are not getting what they bargained for,' he says. 'If the subsidiaries are soliciting business and offering to provide secretarial services, they must be trading. Otherwise it's like an egg shell with no yolk or white. There's a real ethical question. When you pay for the service, you are not told the company is non-trading.' Mr Franks is blunter. 'To be a non-trading company when you are acting as an agent seems to me to be wrong. If the name is being used, there ought to be accounts which explain the position. But it's part of the mystery of chartered accountancy. It seems to me the existing accounting practices are not sound. They enable things to disappear behind a smokescreen.' The Accounting Standards Board says it has no current plans to consider the status of non-trading companies. As Mr Franks says: 'It's one of the greyer areas of accounting. But we've got so many of those.'</p>

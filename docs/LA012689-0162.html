			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Fontana stonemason Vincent Ronald Monacco said he plans to buy some Italian  suits, travel to the French Riviera and buy a new BMW -- but he isn't sure  whether he will continue laying bricks. Monacco, 39, won $5.8 million Saturday,  sharing the $40.7-million Lotto jackpot pool with six others. Each will collect  $232,000 a year, after taxes, for 20 years. Monacco said he will continue to  live in Fontana, where he was born. "Fontana is my home," he said.  </P></p>

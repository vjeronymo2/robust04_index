			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Arts: Frontal attack on Hamlet - Cinema 'Who's there?' 'Nay, answer me: stand and unfold yourself.' 'Long live the King.' 'Mel Gibson?' 'He.' 'You come most carefully upon your hour . . .' Career moves need perfect timing. Hamlet himself, a postponement-prone prince, learned this too late: it was his greatest tragedy and it gave birth to William Shakespeare's greatest tragedy. For his film version Franco Zeffirelli has made a casting decision so insane that it partakes of genius. Australian action-man Mel Gibson plays Hamlet. From the actor who brought you Mad Max and Lethal Weapon comes the tale of a mad Dane caught between action and rumination. As the film's trailer intones it, 'A man must choose: to love or hate, to live or die, to be or not to be . . .' But Hamlet the movie is so much better than one feared, including Mr Gibson, that I am thinking of belatedly joining the Zeffirelli fan club. The audience's first giggle, at a long-shot of Dover Castle (playing Elsinore) in which tiny cars are visible trundling down to the docks, may well be their last. Cultivating a russet beard and rugged English accent, Gibson suggests a pent-up young achiever surrounded by corrupt and wassailing elders. The prankish volatility that stamped his Lethal Weapon hero serves the star now for Hamlet's verbal fencing with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Shafts of vindictive wit and wildness light up his scenes with the Ghost (Paul Scofield) and Gertrude (Glenn Close). And in the duel scene Zeffirelli has him playing the fool until the venom strikes. Indeed the only places where Gibson stumbles are the soliloquies. With no sparring partner to spark him, this reactive actor is suddenly unmanned. The speeches are delivered in an anxious sing-song, with a decreasing sense of inner meaning or feeling. But even this proves non-fatal. Zeffirelli has cut the text to the bone and then reviewed it to see if he can cut to the marrow. Half Shakespeare's words are thrown away, and those that remain are delivered with whirlwind directness. (Only Scofield's burnished-toned Ghost is allowed to savour the verse). But this style of frontal attack suits Glenn Close's furious, agonised Queen, her face a mediaeval death-mask come to life. It suits Helena Bonham-Carter's brusque, rebellious Ophelia, and it galvanises players like Alan Bates (Claudius) and Ian Holm (Polonius), who look as if they would like more time but rather improve without it. Bardophiles will rail at the roughshod ride they get over English literature's greatest verse drama. And Zeffirelliphobes will point to the absence of any challenging modern slants or insights. This is simply the Swan of Avon sliced up, served piping-hot and garnished with lovely costumes and castles. But the film works on its self-appointed, simple level. And Gibson's success sets an eye-opening precedent. (What next? Schwarzenegger's Coriolanus?) Sergei Bodrov's Freedom is Paradise takes its title from a tattoo popular among residents of the Soviet Union's still crowded gulag. The illustrated man is a 13 year old boy, Sasha (Volodya Kozyrev), incarcerated in a reform school so dismal that the obligatory beatings are performed with rote, enervated weariness. Sasha tries to escape at every possible opportunity, his intended paradise is not simply freedom, but reunion with the father he hardly knows. After learning that he also resides at one of the gulag's prisons, the stubborn Sasha sets off on a harrowing journey across the Soviet Union, using wit, luck and the occasional kindness of strangers to track his father down. Bodrov casts this passage through Gorbachev's Russia in a bleakness so pervasive that the small acts of mercy bestowed on Sasha - a few US dollars from a kindly soldier, an apple from a peasant, a hungry kiss from a little rich girl - shine forth like bountiful windfalls. Sasha's tormentors are so sluggish in their abuse, so distracted by their sorry lives, that the frail, tenacious boy is able to slip through their grasps time and again. It is a desolate portrayal of contemporary Russia. Bodrov takes his time in rendering this portrait, employing a touch that is at times painfully slow. The cumulative effect is a strong one, however, enabling the exquisite melancholy of the film's final moments, when Sasha meets his father (Alexander Bureyev), a hollow, broken man rotting in solitary confinement. At first hesitant, father finally warms to son, advising Sasha to disown him to avoid trouble. Sasha's response is simple - 'Who would give up a father?' It is an answer as heartbreakingly honest as the film itself. A less convincing rite of passage stands at the centre of Ken Loach's Riff-Raff. Stevie (Robert Carlyle), a proud, sensitive, unemployed Glaswegian, follows Norman Tebbit's advice by getting on his bike and travelling to London, where he finds work on a construction site. The bosses are venal but his co-workers, especially the Liverpudlian trio of Larry, Mo and Shem, have hearts of gold. Stevie also meets Susan (Emer McCourt), a fragile, would-be singer who moves into Stevie's squat. They have a sometimes sweet, sometimes stormy relationship that inexplicably ends when Stevie travels to Glasgow to attend his mother's funeral, leaving a confused and lonely Susan to seek solace in smack. Things at the building site also go awry, with long neglected safety standards eventually reaping the inevitable harvest of death. Despite some fine comic moments, Riff-Raff is never very convincing. Loach and writer Bill Jesse career between genial, well-observed comedy and hackneyed social tragedy so often and so joltingly that the overall effect is confused. The scenes on the building site provide a genuinely engaging and occasionally hilarious portrait of a group of men trying to make ends meet in tough times. The filmmakers cannot seem to let well enough alone, however, investing their story with tendentious social significance and suspect melodrama every time it threatens to achieve its true voice. Given this pervasive overreaching, it comes as little surprise that the film's finale, with its predictable accident and obligatory conflagration, is simply too much to believe. The credibility of War Party suffers an early test when we are asked to believe that the elders of a racially eruptive Montana town would choose to celebrate a holiday by staging a mock battle between Indians and the US Cavalry, in which the Indians are portrayed by proud young men from the local reservation while bigoted rednecks play the cavalry. Not surprisingly, the pageant ends in bloodshed, with the Indians forced to tomahawk one of the whites after he unsportingly decides to use real bullets on them. Anyone who swallows this bit of tenuous plotting surely must choke on the moment several scenes later when the young Indian's leader, Sonny Crowkiller (Billy Wirth), shoots down a pursuing airplane with an ancestral arrow. This preposterous film, the first in what promises to be a spate of corrective celluloid treatments of Native Americans following Dances With Wolves, may possess the best of intentions, yet ham-fisted direction by the usually steady Franc Roddam, an absurd script and generally wooden acting mean that its makers only manage to replace old stereotypes with new, casting whites as the savage and benighted aggressors, while Indians are the untainted, civilised heroes. It may be less racially offensive than your basic Western, but it's certainly no more credible.</p>

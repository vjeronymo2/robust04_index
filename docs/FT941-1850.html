			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Citicorp sees continued growth in earnings Citicorp expects 'significantly' improved earnings in 1994 and 1995, according to chairman Mr John Reed, Reuter reports from New York. The top US bank earned a record Dollars 2.2bn in 1993. Mr Reed said the improved earnings for the next two years would be driven by revenue growth, especially in the developing world, cost-savings, and a continued improvement in credit quality. He said the 1994-1995 budget called for lower trading results. Mr Reed also expects 'fairly significant' credit improvement during the two years. Total expenses will stay relatively flat, he said. Mr Reed stressed that Citicorp had a renewed emphasis on risk management and controls. 'We have been humbled by our historic experience and we would just as soon be on a more cautious and conservative stance going forward,' he said. He said Citicorp had no plans to participate in the ongoing consolidation of the US banking industry. Instead of US acquisitions, Citicorp would focus its investments on the faster-growing developing world.</p>

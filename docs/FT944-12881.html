			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / PM urges Brittan to stay in EU job: Commissioner considers resignation after losing battle for eastern Europe portfolio Mr John Major, the prime minister, made a direct appeal at the weekend to Sir Leon Brittan to stay on as the senior UK commissioner in Brussels after Sir Leon narrowly lost a battle to retain responsibility for eastern Europe in his portfolio. Sir Leon will decide in the next few days whether to resign his post, close associates said yesterday. He is said to be crestfallen, and is considering all options, including a return to British politics. His aim would be to press the case for a more pro-European policy in Britain, associates said. But pressure is mounting on Sir Leon to stay in his job, which still includes responsibility for multilateral trade negotiations and relations with the leading Asian economies and the world's industrialised nations. Amid irritation at 10 Downing Street and private acknowledgement that the British government's influence in Brussels had been diminished, Mr Major told Sir Leon he was 'disappointed' by how the portfolios had been shared out by Mr Jacques Santer, incoming Commission president. Mr Major added in a telephone conversation with Sir Leon that his responsibility for trade relations with the developed world was 'crucially important'. The conversation came as British ministers echoed the implicit annoyance at Mr Santer's decision. The early admission of former communist countries to the Union is a central plank of Mr Major's overall strategy towards the development of the EU. Tory Euro-sceptics warned that the choice of Mr Hans Van den Broek of the Netherlands to oversee enlargement to the east heightened the risk of a confrontation between London and Brussels at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. There was also a suspicion among Tory MPs that Mr Santer, whose candidacy for the presidency was supported by Britain after Mr Major had vetoed the choice of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, had been under pressure to prove his 'independence' from London. But Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, accused Sir Leon of 'behaving like a spoilt child' after he hinted he might resign. 'Sir Leon Brittan is clearly motivated by personal greed and ambition,' she said. There was speculation last night that Mr Santer might try to mollify Sir Leon by naming him as one of the Commission's two vice-presidents. Arguments over the division of responsibilities in the new European Commission, the Brussels executive body, dominated Saturday's talks in Luxembourg chaired by Mr Santer. Commission members were evenly split over whether Sir Leon or Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, should have responsibility for central and eastern Europe. Sir Leon won support from Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour party leader who is a newly-appointed commissioner, and Scandinavian commissioners who argued that Sir Leon was best qualified to prepare the next round of EU enlargement. But neither of the two German commissioners supported Sir Leon, apparently because of the Bonn government's desire to improve relations with the Netherlands after Chancellor Helmut Kohl blocked Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, in his bid for Commission president earlier this year.

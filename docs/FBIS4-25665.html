			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- China on Tuesday declined  to comment on North Korea's announced threat to quit the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), saying it had yet to  receive official confirmation of a walkout. "We have taken note  of the relevant report, but have not got official information,"  a foreign ministry spokesman said. "We will follow closely the  development of the situation."    North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday  that  Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog  organisation, three days after the IAEA adopted sanctions  against it. China, the closest major ally to the isolated  Stalinist state, abstained in the vote and reiterated that it  would not join moves to approve economic sanctions at UN level.  It insists on dialogue with Pyongyang as a means of resolving  the 13-month-long crisis.    Meanwhile, KCNA, monitored in Tokyo, said a North Korean  military delegation returned home Monday after visiting China.  The delegation was headed by Choe Kwang, a member of the  Politburo and chief of staff of the North Korean armed forces.  The dispatch gave prominence to Chinese pledges of continuing  support and loyalty to North Korea. It quoted General Liu  Huaqing, a member of the standing committee of the Chinese  communist party's Politburo and deputy chairman of the central  military commission, as saying "friendly relations between the  two countries ... have reached a higher phase and been  consolidated today." "The people of China treasure Sino-Korean  friendship and will pass it on from generation to generation,"  he was quoted by KCNA as saying.</p>

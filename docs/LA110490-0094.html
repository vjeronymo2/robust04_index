			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURROGATE CASE DRAWS FIRE FROM THOSE SICK AT HEART, SICK OF SUITS  </P> <P> When Anna Johnson went to court to obtain parental rights to the baby she was  carrying for the Calverts, she burned her bridges to any type of relationship  with the child.  </P> <P> If Ms. Johnson had spent more time "nurturing" a relationship with the Calverts  rather than slapping them in the face with a lawsuit, the Calverts may have  come to feel a closeness to Anna and would have welcomed her as a special  person in their child's life.  </P> <P> DIANE STRAW, El Toro  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, March 24 (MTI) -- The insinuation heard  recently on Hungarian Television that the Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) would take over the media if it came to power after  May"s parliamentary elections, is utterly ridiculous, MSZP  cultural executive Gabor Kis Gellert said at the party"s press  conference on Thursday.    He said his party would appoint new heads to Hungarian Radio  and Television, and would remedy legal offences like the recent  dismissal of 129 Hungarian Radio staff.    Gellert said television news programmes hardly ever carry  reports about the MSZP. According to their survey, from March  16 to 22, Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] politicians appeared  on 30 occasions, not counting parliamentary coverage.    In this same period, one single report was carried about the  MSZP, and that was about the jogging accident of MP Laszlo  Bekesi, the Socialist's economic expert.</p>

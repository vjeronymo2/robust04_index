			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The biggest battle in Williamsport, Pa., at the Little League World Series  pitted a dozen groundskeepers against the rain and mud.  </P> <P> The dirty dozen slogged through the mud, rebuilding part of the Lamade Stadium  infield, covering and then uncovering the infield with a tarp three times. But  they couldn't beat the elements, forcing postponement of the East-South  quarterfinal game.  </P> <P> That means the championship game of the World Series won't be played as  scheduled on Saturday and has been moved to Sunday.  </P></p>

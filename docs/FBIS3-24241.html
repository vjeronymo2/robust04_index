			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rais Tuzmukhamedov and Vladimir Pustogarov, </F> doctors of legal sciences, under rubric "Opinion": "Victory,  Divided Equally: Treaty Between the Russian Federation and the  Republic of Tatarstan as an Act of International Law"]    [Text] The date of 15 February 1994 became a landmark in  the history of relations between Moscow and Kazan, since, for  the first time since Russia seized the Kazan khanate in the  middle of the sixteenth century, a treaty was concluded between  the new RF [Russian Federation] and the new RT [Republic of  Tatarstan], a treaty that was based, as is stated in its  preamble, on "the generally recognized right of nations to  self-determination, on principles of the completely equal and  voluntary expression of free will."    This treaty is a compromise, just as any agreement is,  whether it be in everyday life, at the domestic state level, or  in international relations. But it is a compromise that  preserves the sovereignty of both sides. They have divided, in a  sovereign manner, the powers in a new unification. Inasmuch as,  according to Minister Sergey Shakhray, one of the chief  representatives of the Russian side, as quoted in a ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA interview, "the methodology of the Federative Treaty  formed the basis of the document," we shall refer to that act  and compare what was put in whose jurisdiction by that act.    A number of areas of behavior, including some extremely  important ones, that were ascribed in the Federative Treaty to  the sphere of the joint jurisdiction of the Center and the  subjects of the Federation have now been firmly established as  being within the exclusive, that is, sovereign, jurisdiction of  Tatarstan. They include, for example, "questions of the  possession, use, and disposal of the land, mineral wealth, the  water, timber, and other natural resources, as well as the state  enterprises, organizations, and other movable and immovable  property situated on the territory of the Republic of  Tatarstan." We might note, incidentally, an extremely important  principle that has been established: the topic being discussed  is the "exclusive property owned by the people of Tatarstan,"  rather than "by the state" (read: the state bureaucracy), as is  frequently written in RF acts.    According to the Treaty, Tatarstan itself has the right to  resolve questions of the bar and notary practices, and to carry  out the legal regulation of administrative, family, and housing  relations, and relations in the area of environmental protection  and use of natural resources. Tatarstan itself establishes the  system of the republic's state agencies, and the procedure for  organizing them and for carrying out their activities. Like any  other sovereign state, Tatarstan itself resolves questions of  republic citizenship. The republic itself forms its budget,  establishes and collects taxes, and independently carries out  foreign-economic activity; resolves questions of conversion at  enterprises that are part of the republic's state property;  creates the National Bank; concludes agreements with foreign  states; participates in international organizations; etc. These  and other exclusive powers and sovereign rights correspond to  the Tatarstan Constitution, which has firmly established the  state sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan.    It is fundamentally important that the documents that are  recognized as the legal basis of the treaty are the  constitutions of both states. Legally this means not only the  paramount importance and the priority of the norms and  principles of the two constitutions and of each of them, but  also the fact that, when interpreting the treaty, each side  primarily proceeds from its own Constitution and coordinates its  point of view with the Constitution of the other participant in  the Treaty.    For those who, in 1991, adopted the Declaration of the State  Sovereignty of Tatarstan, who, in March 1992, in a referendum  voted for the republic's sovereignty, and who subsequently, on  the basis of that referendum, developed and adopted, in November  1992, the Constitution of the sovereign state of Tatarstan,  something that must be of substantial importance is the fact  that the treaty, as is stated in its preamble, is the  "completely equal unification of two states," and that this  unification occurred on the basis of the constitutions both of  Russia and Tatarstan, as well as the principles enumerated in  the treaty itself. The treaty is an agreement between sovereign  states and the subjects of international law. This is not stated  in the text. But that essence of the act is self-evident,  primarily on the basis of the sense of the name and text of the  agreement. It is called: "Treaty Between the Russian Federation  and the Republic of Tatarstan." That means an agreement between  two sovereign states (Article 1 in both constitutions). This is  also mentioned in the preamble, where it is directly stated that  the Republic of Tatarstan unites with the Russian Federation "as  a state."    Furthermore, the treaty was signed at the highest level --  by  chiefs of state. The sovereignty of the contracting parties as  entities in international law is also attested to by the subject  of the agreement. It pertains to the delimitation of the  authoritative powers, that is, the powers that are inherent in  state sovereignty, since sovereignty is a category of authority.    The fact that the treaty is an act in international law,  that  is, an agreement between two subjects of international law, also  evolves completely obviously from the fact the contracting  parties indicated as their legal basis their own constitutions  --each of them unambiguously established the quality of a  sovereign state that is based on the sovereignty of the  multiethnic people of those countries (Articles 1 and 3 of the  RF Constitution; preamble and Articles 1, 2, and 61 of the RT  Constitution).    Sergey Shakhray, RF minister of nationalities and regional  policy, stated in the interview that was previously mentioned  that "this treaty is not subject to ratification, in order not  to create the illusion of being a document in international  law." But ratification is a completely unmandatory attribute of  the nature of the treaty as a document in international law.  This depends upon how the contracting parties come to an  understanding. Another matter is that the treaty distributes the  sovereign powers within the framework of the unification of the  two contracting parties that is created by them.    Sergey Shakhray said, "From the point of view of  international law and state law, this (the signing of the treaty  and Tatarstan's consent to participate in elections to the  Federal Assembly) means the recognition of the federal electoral  law and sovereignty of Russia." If the minister, by his use of  the word "recognition," means not the assertion of the existence  of Russia's sovereignty, but the subordination of Tatarstan to  the sovereignty of the RF, then the very preamble of the treaty  begins with words to the effect that the contracting parties are  guided not only by the RF Constitution, but also equally by the  RT Constitution, and that they are proceeding from the  "generally recognized right of nations to self-determination, on  principles of the completely equal and voluntary expression of  free will", etc. Incidentally, the nation of Tatarstan also  expressed its self-determination unambiguously not only in March  1992, but also during the April 1993 referendum and during the  referendum on the new RF Constitution.    Gavriil Popov and Fedor Burlatskiy, in a Dialogue broadcast  on 19 February, did justice to the political wisdom of President  Mintimer Shaymiyev and the endurance of President Boris Yeltsin,  who justly divided the victory (it is only in such an instance  that it is indeed a victory) equally between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan.    Finally, we would like to direct attention to the fact that  the Treaty text contains four references to agreements between  the contracting parties. As is well known, there are more than  ten of them. It must be assumed that these agreements will also  become accessible to the public. That would help to make a  better evaluation of the historical nature of the role and  limits of the importance of a treaty that is so important for  Russia and Tatarstan.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Sunday trading LAST WEEK'S announcement that the government will bring forward proposals to reform the Sunday trading laws is welcome, if long overdue. Every week, millions of consumers vote with their feet for the convenience of Sunday trading. Many of the stores which oblige them flout the law to do so, while the the government blames confusion over a possible clash between the Shops Act and the Treaty of Rome for inaction. Now the government says that it will frame new legislation, with measures to protect the rights of shopworkers who do not wish to work on Sundays. The latter will do much to ease opposition from those who feared that shopworkers would be dragooned into Sunday working against their desire or principles. However, there is still no clarity over the form of the new legislation. A menu of options will be put before parliament to find a consensus on this thorny issue. That menu will not include complete deregulation of shopping hours, the attempt at which in 1986 led to defeat in the Commons. It would be undesirable, however, if partial deregulation led to new and equally unworkable restrictions on Sunday trading which were also widely flouted. And the leisurely timetable envisaged means that the new legislation is unlikely to be in place much before 1994. Not only will that leave millions of Sunday shoppers and thousands of stores which serve them in legal limbo. It will also allow the alliance of sabbatarians and shopworkers' unions to mobilise their undoubtedly effective campaigning skills. Swift legislation with copper-bottomed protection for those who do not wish to work on Sundays would be the preferable approach.</p>

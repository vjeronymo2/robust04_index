			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ascot restructuring conditions satisfied Ascot Holdings, the renamed Control Securities, has satisfied all the conditions of its Pounds 292m financial restructuring, which included Pounds 148m of bank debt and Pounds 90m of Swiss franc bonds. The proposals have therefore become effective. The group aims to publish its accounts for the year to March 31 by July 30. Dealings in the shares, suspended since April last year, are expected to resume the day after the accounts are published. Mr Sydney Robin, who has chaired the group since Mr Nazmu Virani stepped down in April last year, and steered it through the refinancing, has become a non-executive deputy chairman. Mr Howard Dyer has joined the board as chairman and chief executive.</p>

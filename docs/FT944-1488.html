			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Technology: A good deal for the unions Unison, Britain's biggest trade union, has developed a software system that will help union negotiators deal with decentralised bargaining across the public services. By using a mixture of electronic communications and databases, negotiators can now receive support and data wherever they are working. The union spent Pounds 300,000 this year on developing a software package, Local Negotiator, which it is offering to its 2,500 branches. It includes a claim calculator for use in preparations for bargaining and during negotiations. By entering some basic figures, negotiators can see what the effect of a pay claim or offer will be on members or on the employer's pay bill. A welfare rights package enables negotiators to calculate the effect of pay increases for members claiming benefit. Alan Jinkinson, general secretary, said: 'Negotiators in the field, activists or staff can prepare claims, assess management offers and send information back to head office within seconds. We are leading the trade union movement in these developments, and are ahead of public service management in many areas.' A bargaining support project depends on the exchange of current information, which branches can join by subscribing to Poptel, a non-commercial telecommunications system. Members can also access and contribute to union bulletin boards. Unison estimates that about half its branches already have a personal computer. Some 140 branches are testing the software, of which 30 are fully on line. In common with all other UK unions, Unison has undertaken a campaign to sign up its 1.3m members to pay their union subscriptions by employer's check-off from their salaries, and has so far signed up 92 per cent. Jinkinson said: 'Once all the sign-up information from the regions is entered on to our central computerised membership system, we shall be able to make substantial savings on direct mailing costs and target our membership in terms of particular surveys, one-off initiatives and longer-running campaigns.'</p>

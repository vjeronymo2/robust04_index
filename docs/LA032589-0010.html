			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE AND POLL ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I applaud your newspaper for the in-depth article on Randall Terry and the  Operation Rescue movement.  </P> <P> The fact that Terry's group carries pictures of "a bloody fetus in four pieces"  is as the article says "gruesome," but is, nonetheless, reality. When a fetus  is aborted, there is blood involved. And when a dilation and curettage abortion  takes place, the fetus is cut into several pieces.  </P> <P> The problem that I have with the pro-choice supporters' argument is that they  make "choice" the ultimate issue. Let's face facts. No one has absolute freedom  of choice sanctioned by the law. One can choose to rob a bank, but it is not  lawful. Others can choose to kill their 1-year-old child, but it is not legal.  Why then should a woman have the legal right to take the life of her unborn  child?  </P> <P> There are limits on our choices. We all live with that reality every day. When  our freedom violates the safety of another individual, the law steps in. I  don't believe that abortion is a religious issue. It is a matter of respect for  human life.  </P> <P> Maybe there does need to be some (as Terry puts it) "moral sanity" brought back  to this country. Certainly, 1.5 million lives taken each year in abortion is a  harsh reality. There must be a better way.  </P> <P> LORETTA S. HORN  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Mexico trade deficit up sharply Mexico's trade deficit deteriorated sharply to Dollars 1.53bn in February, an increase of 24 per cent over the same period last year. The unexpectedly high deficit may put additional pressure on the peso, which is already trading at the limit against the dollar allowed by the central bank. The February deficit was pushed up by a 19 per cent increase in imports, which reached Dollars 6.02bn in February. Exports rose to Dollars 4.49bn, a 17 per cent increase. Manufacturing exports jumped by 26 per cent. The government sought to blame the growth in imports on buoyant exports in its latest explanation of why the trade deficit is a healthy phenomenon. The government said some 40 per cent of the imports in February will be used to make goods that that will soon be exported.</p>

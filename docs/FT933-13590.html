			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / EC debates Croatia sanctions: Pressure grows for trade curbs to deter aggression by Zagreb EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will today consider trade sanctions against Croatia to deter further Croatian and Serb aggression in Bosnia. The move comes after weekend talks in Geneva aimed at persuading Bosnia's Moslems to accept a UN-EC brokered plan to turn Bosnia into a confederation of three republics. Lord Owen, the EC mediator, will report to EC ministers on the chances of winning an agreement. He is also expected to repeat fears of a humanitarian disaster in Bosnia this winter, unless a peace settlement is reached and more money raised for emergency aid. Pressure for sanctions against Croatia has grown within the Community amid evidence of collusion between Serbia and Croatia in carving up Bosnia and blocking UN relief convoys trying to reach besieged Moslems. The UK is ready to raise the threat of sanctions against Croatia. However, Germany, perhaps the Zagreb regime's closest EC ally, has reservations. Sanctions against Croatia would involve the withdrawal of existing trade privileges rather than the wide-ranging UN embargo against Serbia which ministers insist must be tightened. One idea is for Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, to visit Zagreb along with the EC 'troika' of past, present and future EC presidencies to present a sanctions ultimatum to Croatia. Today's foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels will also discuss new EC rules to allow foreign EC nationals to vote in next year's European Parliament elections in the country where they are resident, providing they are registered in time. Ministers will also discuss the final form of the six new rules for disbursement of Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107.1bn) of structural funds to poorer EC regions over the next six years. This is expected to go through without difficulty, but member states are still arguing over their final share of the funds - a matter to be resolved in bilateral negotiations with the European Commission. Other subjects for discussion include efforts to tighten up on the export of 'dual use' technology; the new French initiative known as the Balladur plan to protect minorities and foster stability in eastern Europe; the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, as well as stalled negotiations among the 12 to strengthen EC trade weapons; and the Commission's favourable, if conditional, welcome of the applications of Malta and Cyprus to join the EC.</p>

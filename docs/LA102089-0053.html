			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> OAKLAND LOOKS BEYOND CRISIS TO START MAPPING WAY OUT OF TRANSIT MESS  </P> <P> The city of Oakland is not yet able to sweep aside the debris left by Tuesday's  earthquake, pick up the pieces and get on with life. So, much of the city's  attention is still riveted on the tragic crumple of concrete and steel of the  Cypress section of the Nimitz Freeway, where untold quake victims are still  buried.  </P> <P> But while much of the city and the world focused on the Nimitz tragedy,  officials of public and private transportation agencies were meeting Thursday  to devise ways to keep Oakland humming as the transportation hub of the Bay  Area.  </P> <P> The Nimitz, or Interstate 880, and the damaged San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge  play a role in the city's economy. They are the major routes for moving goods  in all directions from the Port of Oakland, warehouses and other manufacturing  plants that provide a significant number of jobs in the city.  </P> <P> For the time being, transportation concerns have found alternate routes around  the collapsed portion of the freeway, according to Mel Wax, public affairs  director for the port.  </P> <P> Trucks headed for San Francisco have been rerouted north to Richmond, where  they cross the bay and head south across the Golden Gate Bridge to San  Francisco, he said. Traffic headed for the South Bay from Oakland is crossing  the San Mateo Bridge, he said. At a meeting called by the Metropolitan  Transportation Commission, barge companies agreed to haul trucks across the bay  until the damaged portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is repaired.  </P> <P> But while everyone has improvised for the time being, some business people are  worried about life without the Nimitz link once business gets back to normal  and the city streets are clogged with traffic.  </P> <P> Along the shoreline and at port facilities just west of the Nimitz are dozens  of warehouses, light and heavy manufacturing plants and transportation  specialty companies that rely on the freeway.  </P> <P> Typical of these companies is Jorgensen Steel, which serves as a service and  distribution center for steel mills and their customers around the country.  Jorgensen has been a West Oakland staple since the mid-1930s. Some of its 71  employees were among the first on the scene Tuesday to help rescue survivors of  the freeway collapse.  </P> <P> Like much of the rest of the city, Jorgensen's attention has remained on the  Nimitz tragedy, but on Thursday its managers began to assess the changes that  the disastrous quake will bring to the business.  </P> <P> The company stopped shipping after the quake, but it expects to begin sending  out trucks today, according to general manager Lawrence Paparelli. Once its  trucks are back on the road, they will use city streets to get around the  collapsed freeway. However, Paparelli foresees great turmoil for Oakland's  traffic once the army of commuters and shippers return to normal schedules.  "The 880 has always been a main artery," he said.  </P> <P> Already, the Oakland Convention Centers have had two cancellations because  event sponsors were concerned about access to the centers. The centers have  always attracted a certain amount of business because of the easy access to San  Francisco's cultural, dining and night spots provided by the Bay Bridge and Bay  Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains.  </P> <P> Charles Patterson, general manager of the centers, was reviewing the calendar  Thursday for other potential trouble spots. "We're concerned (about the  potential loss of business). The problem may get bigger. I'm hoping BART is the  answer," Patterson said.  </P> <P> It is unclear what the financial impact of the loss of the bridge and the  collapse of the freeway will be. Mayor Lionel Wilson on Thursday put the losses  to the city at $1.3 billion, exclusive of the loss involving the Nimitz  Freeway.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Oakland boosters were rallying Thursday to convince the world that  the quake and its disastrous results would not stall Oakland's redevelopment,  which, when disaster struck, appeared to be finally on track after decades of  fits and starts.  </P> <P> "I've been in the city seven years. For a long time, I watched one of the great  cities growing very slowly," said Henry Feldman, vice president of the  Claremont Hotel in the hills above downtown Oakland.  </P> <P> "Because of location, great ports, great infrastructure and strong facilities,  the city has unlimited potential. As San Francisco becomes more and more a  difficult place to do business, Oakland can't help but succeed," he said.  </P> <P> In recent years, the city has attracted significant office development to its  downtown, in part because of the high land prices and development restrictions  in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "Oakland in every sense is in a terrific position," said Glenn Isaacson,  executive vice president of Bramalea Pacific, which is developing City Center,  a 16-block collection of office buildings and small retail shops. Thus far, the  development is home to Clorox Corp., International Business Machines, Wells  Fargo and American President Lines.  </P> <P> Another major project is Jack London's Waterfront, a $110-million office and  retail project being developed on the waterfront by the port in a joint venture  with private concerns.  </P> <P> Oakland's major problem is its image, said Perry C. Page, the Rouse Co.'s vice  president for redevelopment on the West Coast.  </P> <P> Rouse, which is developing a major shopping center in downtown Oakland,  initially passed on the city, he said. But watching Oakland since 1981, the  company realized that there is "tremendous growth there -- a lot more than  meets the eye," he said. The city actually has great demographics -- that is,  lots of high-income people -- for retailing, he said. Such facts convinced  major department stores to anchor the mall. Nordstrom, Macy's, J.C. Penney and  Emporium Capwell have agreed to join.  </P></p>

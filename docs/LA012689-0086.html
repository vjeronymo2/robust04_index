			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECONSIDER SALE OF PASADENA YMCA  </P> <P> I am writing to you as an outraged member of the Pasadena YMCA. I cannot  believe that the members were not allowed to be included in the decision to  sell the building. Consideration for the members was obviously not a factor in  the board's decision to sell the building.  </P> <P> I, along with many other members, do not have an alternative fitness center  that is within a reasonable distance and price. I work out primarily on my  lunch hour, so I cannot drive to other YMCAs in other cities within my time  constraints.  </P> <P> It is my opinion that the board should represent the wishes of its members and  be accountable to them. I truly feel that the present board is not reflecting  the best interest of its membership and should be replaced, and the decision to  sell abandoned so that other alternatives and arrangements can be made.  </P> <P> STEVEN F.

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'IMPERIAL BELLS' TO RING IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> The ancient music and dance of the Chinese Imperial Court will be re-created at  the Orange County Performing Arts Center today and Sunday in a 10-act show  called "The Imperial Bells of China." Sixty-five of the 200 members of the  Hubei Song and Dance Ensemble, the official performance troupe in the central  China province of Hubei, will wind up a two-month tour of the United States  with the two shows here.  </P> <P> (Shows in Los Angeles and Oxnard were to follow the Orange County performances,  but they have been canceled. A press spokesman blamed the cancellations on poor  advance ticket sales and said that the student-led demonstrations in Beijing  for increased freedom were not a factor.)  </P> <P> "Imperial Bells of China" was inspired by the discovery of more than 10,000  artifacts, including 120 ancient instruments, during an archeological dig in  Hubei province in 1978. A tomb of a Chinese nobleman, Marquis Yi, was found  "and in the chamber, 64 bells were discovered, along with drums, string harps,  and chimes," said Richard Lukens, president of Los Angeles-based China Business  Management, which is producing the touring show.  </P> <P> The bronze bells are thought to be the oldest fixed-pitched instruments ever  found.  </P> <P> Weighing as much as 600 pounds and as tall as 5 feet, the bells are on display  in a museum in the Wuhan area of China and regarded by the Chinese as one of  the wonders of the world, Lukens said. "The troupe felt it was their duty to  re-create this ancient music."  </P> <P> But this was no easy task. The ensemble began researching and developing the  show eight years ago and it took three years to complete the groundwork. In  addition, each musician designed and constructed his own instrument, modeled  after the original.  </P> <P> The end result is a re-creation of "the cultural, political and social life of  the Chinese people 2,400 years ago," Lukens said.  </P> <P> The entire show is in Chinese except for recorded commentaries by actor Gregory  Peck, who provides descriptions of each scene and translations of the ancient  poetic lyrics.  </P> <P> Peck is a longtime supporter of cultural exchange between the East and West.  His interest in the show was sparked during a trip to China a year and a half  ago, when he saw a documentary in Shanghai about the bells.  </P> <P> "I was fascinated and completely taken," Peck said. "It was a new vision into  Chinese song. I offered to provide an English translation of the film and  submit it to the Academy (of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) in the  documentary category. But the show was even better," he said.  </P> <P> "It's just a glimpse into the artistry and creativity of the Chinese, drawing  on ancient culture, poetry, and folk tales."  </P> <P> Lukens, former international director of Live Aid, became interested in  continuing his involvement with cross-cultural exchange events while working on  Live Aid in Beijing. While there, he met his future wife and co-producer of the  show, Erin Wang-Lukens, the daughter of a Chinese official.  </P> <P> "I wanted to produce some sort of Chinese show in the United States, and the  Minister of Culture showed me some of the shows available. I thought this  troupe was special."  </P> <P> With the help of Wang's family connections with the Ministry of Culture and the  Chinese government, Lukens brought "Imperial Bells of China" to the United  States, continuing his commitment to help bring countries together through the  arts, he said.  </P> <P> Lui Youcai, one of two leaders of the ensemble, is thrilled with the American  audience's response to the show.  </P> <P> "They love it, but we have much to learn about America outside of performing  here," Lui said.  </P> <P> The music director of the troupe, Peng Xian Cheng, welcomed the opportunity to  tour the United States: "It's on the other side of the earth. We are used to  the crowds of China, and America is a great big land.  </P> <P> "This type of cultural exchange is important," he said, adding he hopes to  introduce the show all over the world. "This kind of tour shows friendship  between the countries."  </P></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bank of New Zealand in the red THE FORMER state-owned Bank of New Zealand, which was bought by the National Australia Bank last year, yesterday announced a tax-paid profit of NZDollars 199.6m (USDollars 109.6m) for the 18 months to September 30. However, an abnormal item of NZDollars 277.2m, relating to adjusting the BNZ's accounting standards to match those of its new parent, led to a loss of NZDollars 90.7m after abnormals and minority interests. Operating costs were unusually high in the past six months as the National Australia Bank's own branch network in New Zealand merged with the BNZ. Total balance sheet assets at September 30 were NZDollars 18.9bn, a reduction from NZDollars 20.7bn at March 31. Before merging with the BNZ, the National Australia Bank NZ Ltd had recorded a 53 per cent lift in operating profit after tax and extraordinary items to NZDollars 18.9m in the 12 months to September 30.</p>

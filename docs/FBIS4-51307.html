			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, May 25 (XINHUA) -- India and China, the  two largest Asian nations, have a great potential of trade worth  over 25 billion U.S. dollars annually, PRESS TRUST OF INDIA was  quoting a recent report of the Centre for Global Trade  Development today.    The centre, an independent research and information U.S.  based group monitoring all 220 countries and regions of the  world, said both China and India have entered into an  irreversible process of absolute economic progress bringing a  greater quality of life for its citizens.    It said both India and China have great potential in  exploring the economic exchanges together.    So far bilateral trade between the two countries is still  low, diplomats in the Chinese Embassy said. Their bilateral  trade in 1993 amounted to 670 million U.S. dollars in India's  favour.    The report said India's present export growing speed of an  average 20 percent will enable it to reach over 90 billion  dollars in next six years and the imports are poised to grow at  an equal speed.    It said the Chinese exports, at the present growth rate,  will  cross 200 billion U.S. dollar mark in six years, adding that  when combined with Hong Kong's, the exports will be well over  425 billion dollars.    The bilateral trade will not only create huge and  unprecedented opportunities for both countries' businesses and  investors, but also bring about a greater economic and  geo-political stability in the region, the report said.</p>

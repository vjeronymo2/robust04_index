			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / PM urged to clarify Jubilee Line plan CANARY WHARF'S administrators yesterday wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging him to clarify government policy on the planned extension to the Jubilee Line and the relocation of civil servants to the financially troubled east London property development. The administrators - three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm - reiterated that Canary Wharf's banks are keen to make a financial contribution to the Pounds 1.6bn costs of building the Underground extension. They want Mr Major to arbitrate in a dispute between government departments about whether civil servants should move to Canary Wharf and whether the line should be built. On Monday evening, the administrators were told by Lord Wakeham - leader of the House of Lords, who is in charge of a special government Docklands committee - that more than 2,000 Department of Environment officials are unlikely to move to Canary Wharf, confounding earlier expectations. However, Lord Wakeham left open the possibility that officials from other departments would move to Docklands. 'We have written to the prime minister to ensure that our message gets across to interested parties,' the administrators said. 'It is not a panic measure.' Canary Wharf's bankers fear that the government will abandon the Jubilee Line project - which would have a detrimental effect on the value of the development. The banks' existing offer of Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee Line costs is conditional on civil servants being moved to Canary Wharf.</p>

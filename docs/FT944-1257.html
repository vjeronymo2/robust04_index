			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Turkish tangle The failure of the European Union to finalise its planned customs union with Turkey this week was predictable. On the one hand, there is widespread concern in western Europe at the present human rights situation in the country. On the other, Greek opposition in principle to virtually all gestures of partnership towards Turkey from the EU remains apparently implacable. The first concern is justified. The second is counter-productive, both for the EU and for Greece. The relationship between Turkey and western Europe is of vital strategic importance and, at the same time, extremely sensitive. The country sits at the centre of a complex of three extraordinarily volatile areas: the Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Its stability and its commitment to democracy are essential to prevent the upheavals in those areas from spreading and contaminating the entire region. Turkey's membership of Nato and its association treaty with the EU have consistently proved helpful guarantees of that stability. Turkey wants very much to be considered a European state, and not an outsider. Yet its application for full membership of the EU has hitherto been rebuffed, both on economic grounds and because of its poor record on human rights, above all in dealing with its Kurdish minority. On the other hand, its association treaty, signed way back in 1963, commits both sides to introducing a customs union by January 1 1996. The trouble is that the human rights situation in Turkey has not noticeably improved. The imprisonment of eight Kurdish members of parliament has underlined the continuing problem, even if the threat of executing them for treason has now been lifted. The European Parliament, and the EU member states, are right to demand that the Turkish government and army should respect the rule of law in their fight against terrorism. Simply blocking the customs union is not going to help those in Turkey who want to promote democracy and the rule of law. It will more probably strengthen the hands of the hard liners. A combination of carrot and stick is needed. But Greek intransigence results in a policy which is all stick. It is not at all clear that Greece will lift its blockage by the next meeting with Turkey, fixed for March. It has now been blocking proposed financial co-operation for the past seven years. It means that Greece has made itself the scapegoat for keeping Turkey out in the cold. It is a policy which is counter-productive for all concerned.</p>

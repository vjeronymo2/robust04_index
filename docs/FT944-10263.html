			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Art for eats' sake Marcel Duchamp would turn in his grave; he once sent shivers down the spine of the art world by putting on an exhibition which included a lavatory. Tame stuff by comparison with the latest offering from Chinese artist Huang Yon Ping at Paris's Georges Pompidou centre. On Tuesday he assembled a group of spiders, scorpions, snakes and toads in an exhibition wittily entitled Hors Limites, l'art et la vie, 1952-1994 - Beyond Limits, art and life. They were to eat one another, making a statement on humankind's dog-eat-dog world. Unfortunately, police closed the exhibition yesterday using laws forbidding cruelty to animals.</p>

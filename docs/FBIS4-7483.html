			<p>BFN     [Text] An analysis of the activity carried out in 1993 by  the Intelligence Protection Service-Military Unit [UM] 0215 of  the Interior Ministry took place today in the presence of  Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte and Deputy Petre Roman,  presidents of the Commissions for Defense, Public Order, and  National Security of the Romanian Parliament. On behalf of the  ministry's leadership, the meeting was attended by Interior  Minister Doru Ioan Taracila and Lieutenant General George Ioan  Danescu, secretary of state and first deputy interior minister.    The report presented by Unit Commander Major General Dan  Gheorghe and speeches made by subordinate cadres emphasized that  the concerns and efforts of the unit were directed toward  ensuring the intelligence protection of the cadres, units, and  missions of the Interior Ministry and preventing and uncovering  violations -- particularly in the spheres of economy, organized  crime, and violent acts -- as well as other deeds affecting law  and order and national security. The speakers pointed out that,  in actions taken to fulfill its tasks and missions, the unit did  not exceed its prerogatives and did not infringe upon citizens'  basic rights and freedoms.    In his speech, Senator Radu Alexandru Timofte first said  that  the activity of the unit is being carried out legally and that,  contrary to some ill-intentioned allegations, the Intelligence  Protection Service of the Interior Ministry has well-defined  duties that do not overlap those of other intelligence  structures of the state. In another point, the speaker  criticized the damaging and even inadmissible behavior of  certain employees of the unit, who, for dubious reasons, are  passing on secret data and information to the press, something  that harms both the efficiency of the unit and its actual image.    In his turn, Deputy Petre Roman expressed the conviction  that  the allegations that UM 0215 was involved in political  activities are not true. Actually, he said, the unit is  carrying out its activity within the limits of legal provisions.    The presidents of the two commissions expressed the backing,  understanding, and support of their commissions in solving the  problems faced by this unit, including legislative and  logistical assistance.    In conclusion, Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila praised  the seriousness of the inquiry he attended and the  professionalism of the members of the Intelligence Protection  Service. He emphasized that the activity of the aforementioned  unit, as well as that of the entire ministry, will continue to  be carried out in accordance with the law, as in the past -- a  communique released by the press service of the Ministry of  Interior reads.</p>

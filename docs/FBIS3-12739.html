The purpose of the meeting was to make technical  arrangements  for the committee's work prior to its first public meetings next  week.    Attorney Shomo'el Kassar has made an appeal to the Higher  Court of Justice asking it to issue an order to prevent the  official committee from beginning investigations into the  criminal incident that took place at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron.    The appeal said investigating this case is wholly rejected,  since, to date, no committee of inquiry has been formed to  investigate several bloody incidents against Jewish citizens.    Our legal affairs correspondent Moshe Matlih said Attorney  Kassar attributes the formation of the committee to political  reasons.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Row grows on council job rights CONTROVERSY over the legal status of employees' rights, which is casting a shadow on the government's competitive tendering policy, intensified yesterday, Andrew Adonis writes. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities recommended council to ignore advice on the issue from the Department of the Environment. The dispute is over application to the public sector of the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, which give UK employees rights under an EC directive to keep their terms and conditions if their business changes hands. The government insists that the regulations do not 'as a general rule' apply when a council or government service is contracted out to the private sector.</p>

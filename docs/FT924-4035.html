			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Johnson Controls to open Staffordshire plant JOHNSON Controls, the US automotive components supplier, is to open an Pounds 8m plant at Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, to supply seats to the Toyota car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, Kevin Done writes. Johnson Controls, the world's largest independent supplier of vehicle seats, has been rapidly expanding in Europe in the past five years. The Burton plant, which will create about 80 jobs, will supply Toyota on a just-in-time basis with final assembly of the seats taking place at Burton. The US components maker supplies metal seat parts to Ford and Rover in the UK from its components plants at Telford, Shropshire, and at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. It also has a 49 per cent stake in Ikeda Hoover, which supplies seats to the Nissan car plant at Sunderland. Johnson Controls said one production line would operate initially at the Burton plant, but there was space for a second to keep pace with growing production at the Toyota plant, which opens officially on December 16. Johnson achieved an operating profit of Dollars 265.5m (Pounds 174.6m) on a turnover worldwide of Dollars 5.156bn in the 12 months to the end of September.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said yesterday  that as soon as his work in the current government is completed,  he will join the political opposition of his country to monitor,  together with the group led by Ruben Dario Carles, the  Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD].    Mulino said that he, as a private citizen, supported the  political option Carles represented during these elections,  because he believes it was the best, and he said he respects the  people's decision and accepts defeat.    Mulino said: "I am one of Carles' friends. We accept  defeat, but we will continue our struggle and political  militancy to monitor the PRD."    Mulino formed part of the civic groups that struggled  against  militarism without being part of any party, although now he  announced "he will become a member of one very soon," but he did  not specify of which party.    Mulino said he will conclude his work at the Foreign  Ministry  on 1 September, when he will then become a part of his country's  opposition.    Mulino praised President Guillermo Endara, saying he made  possible free and honest elections that will go down in history  as an example for future generations.</p>

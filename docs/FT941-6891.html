			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Algerian pact with IMF soon Algerian leaders are expected to sign a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the next few weeks after the visit to Algiers last week by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF director-general. After signing the letter, the government, led by Mr Redha Malek, is expected to seek a rescheduling of Algeria's debt to sovereign creditors through the Paris Club. The stage would then be set for France to seek from its European Union partners a loan to help support Algeria's balance of payments worth around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) Two factors have forced the Algerians to reschedule official debt, something they had long sought to avoid. The more immediate is the sharp decline last year in the price of hydrocarbons, which will reduce the country's foreign income by a fifth this year to about Dollars 8bn. Just as important is the domestic decision, two years ago, to reverse the bold economic reforms launched in 1989. The IMF and the country's international creditors had given their imprimatur in June 1991. Stalling on essential reforms and the weakening price of oil, which accounts for the bulk of the country's foreign receipts, will in the absence of any agreement with its international creditors push the cost of servicing Algeria's foreign debt to Dollars 9bn in 1994, which is more than its foreign income. Once Algeria reaches agreement with the IMF on a broad package of reforms, it can expect a one-year stand-by credit of Dollars 500m and an oil compensating facility of Dollars 300m. A Paris Club rescheduling of the principal repayments, due in 1994, of Algeria's Dollars 13.5bn bilateral debt with OECD governments would release an estimated Dollars 3.75bn. There is also a growing consensus among Algeria's leading state creditors in the west for avoiding a cut in the volume of export credits such as often occurs after Paris Club reschedulings. Algeria was able last year to draw on Dollars 3bn of export credits from OECD countries. Japan, which has until recently made public its hostility to rescheduling, now seems more willing to accept this approach over Algeria. The Algerian security forces killed Jaffar El Afghani, head of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA), the most radical islamic group in Algeria, and eight of his followers in the Algiers suburb of Bouzareah on Saturday night. The 'holy war on Christians, Jews and non-believers', launched a year ago by the GIA, has cost the lives of dozens of Algerians and 30 foreigners. The two paramount leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, have been moved meanwhile to the comfortable hunting lodge of Chateau Holden at Douera near Algiers from the prison at Tizou Ouzou.</p>

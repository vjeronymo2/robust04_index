			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed in thin trading US Treasuries were mixed yesterday afternoon in a quiet session influenced by a wavering dollar and some favourable economic data. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 lower at 99 23/32 , with the yield edging up to 7.496 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 , to yield 6.183 per cent. Bonds opened on a solid footing as traders welcomed news from the Commerce Department that July personal income had appreciated 0.5 per cent from the previous month, while personal spending edged 0.2 per cent ahead. Both figures were in line with expectations. By offering further evidence of moderate economic growth and low inflationary pressures, the data helped buttress the growing conviction in the market that the Federal Reserve would delay its next move to tighter money until November. The dollar, which was firmer against other leading currencies, provided additional support for bonds in the early session. As a result, the long end of the maturity range took a modest step forward, building on Friday's moderate gains. However, the improvement proved to be short-lived as the 30-year issue soon receded into negative territory. The retreat was partly explained by the thin trading conditions. Many traders were on holiday while others were holding off on fresh commitments until the release of August employment data at the end of the week. The report should confirm whether the market's confidence in the economy has been justified. But the US currency also contributed to the downward drift. The long bond closely traced the dollar as it reversed direction at mid-morning and sagged to about Y100 by late afternoon. European government bonds pushed further ahead yesterday following Friday's strong rally, but trading volumes were small with London markets closed for the UK summer bank holiday. The early firmer tone to US Treasuries benefited European markets, but analysts said that further gains in Europe would be limited by concerns about fresh supply. Yesterday saw auctions of Dutch and Swedish government debt and the launch of four-year paper for the German Treasury. Further auctions in Germany, France and Italy are scheduled for later this week. 'After Friday's rally there is a better tone to the market,' said Mr Carl Haeling, head of Deutsche Bank's futures and options group in Frankfurt. 'But attention this week is on the huge supply across the whole of Europe, which is a particular worry for the German market and could mean a reversal of some of last week's gains.' In Germany, the five-year German government bond futures contract on DTB, the Frankfurt futures exchange, continued to significantly outperform the rest of the market. 'This is the story of the moment,' said Mr Haeling. 'It has the makings of a fairly serious short squeeze over the next couple of days.' French government bonds moved higher in line with Germany and the US. Market attention is turning to Thursday's monthly government bond auction. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said at the weekend that the Treasury would launch its previously announced OAT sales to small investors in October. The scheme aims to raise about FFr10bn a year. 'This is a clear change in the policy of the government and is an important step in updating the French market to international standards to attract foreign investors,' said Mr Christophe Servan, bond analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in Paris. 'After the bond crisis in the first half of this year, everybody could see that retail investors feel more comfortable with holding bonds directly rather than through intermediaries, such as investment funds,' he said.</p>

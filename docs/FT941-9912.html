			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Marathon bond takes the spotlight The Eurobond sector came back to life yesterday, absorbing some 20 new issues denominated mainly in US dollars and sterling. The highlight of the day, however, was the widely expected Greek drachma bond, dubbed Marathon bond by the lead managers, for the European Investment Bank. The Dr10bn of 17 1/2 per cent five-year bonds - the first drachma-denominated foreign bonds - met overwhelming retail demand and closed at 104.5 bid, well above their par issue price. The lead manager reported strong demand from European retail investors and offshore US investment funds. 'In this low-yield environment, if someone offers you a 17 1/2 per cent coupon, you take the money and run - hence the name,' quipped a London syndicate official. The issue was lead managed by Midland Bank Athens and the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank. In the Eurosterling sector, the financing subsidiaries of two leading German banks took advantage of a swap window in the five-year sector. Dresdner Finance issued Pounds 200m of 6 per cent bonds due December 1999, with a maturity slightly exceeding that of the 6 per cent gilt due August 1999 over which they were priced at 20 basis points above. According to one of the lead managers, the issue got a strong initial response, especially from continental European investors seeking exposure to sterling after its recent slide. But placement slowed as the gilt market grew choppy and Commerzbank launched a rival five-year issue, the official said. BZW and UBS arranged the Dresdner deal. Commerzbank Overseas Finance issued Pounds 150m of 6 1/4 per cent bonds due December 1999 via Natwest Capital Markets and Commerzbank, priced to yield 27 basis points over the 6 per cent gilt due August 1999. After the issues were freed to trade, the yield spread on the Dresdner deal widened to around 24 basis points on the bid price and to about 32 basis points on the Commerzbank issue. But according to one of the lead managers, 'this type of deal can take weeks to place, and we'll probably start seeing the spreads tighten in over time'. Welsh Water Utilities Finance got a more positive response for its two sterling deals, Pounds 100m of 7 5/8 per cent partly-paid 20-year bonds priced at 77 basis points over gilts and Pounds 100m of 7 1/8 per cent 10-year bonds yielding 48 basis points over gilts at the re-offer price. According to an official at lead manager Baring Brothers, the deal saw strong investor demand, especially from UK accounts. 'This is the first core water company issue in two years, and coming after a wave of mainly financial issues this utility issue was very well received,' he said. Other dealers reported solid demand for the paper, citing the borrower's rarity value and the deal's fair pricing. In the dollar sector, Swiss Bank Corporation lead-managed three deals totalling Dollars 1.1bn. General Electric Capital Corporation issued Dollars 400m of 5 1/2 per cent five-year bonds and Dollars 400m of 5 per cent three-year bonds via SBC and Toyota Motor Credit Corporation issued Dollars 300m of three-year notes, paying a coupon of 5 per cent. While the GECC five-year bond was said to have met fair demand, the two three-year deals were dogged by the recent glut of supply in that maturity, traders said. The yield spread over US Treasuries on all three issues widened slightly after they were freed to trade, traders said. Thompson-Brandt BV, the large French electronics company, issued FFr1.5bn of 10-year 6 3/8 per cent bonds via CCF and J. P. Morgan. Priced at 62 basis points over the 5 1/2 per cent OAT, the paper found good demand from French and other continental European investors, a lead manager said. Lonrho, the international conglomerate, is rumoured to be planning a Pounds 100m convertible bond issue in the next two weeks, with CS First Boston or Nomura tipped as possible lead managers.</p>

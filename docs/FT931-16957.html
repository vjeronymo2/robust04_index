			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: 20 things you didn't know ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 20 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.  Infamous newspaper hoaxer Rocky Ryan (catchphrase 'Look, trust     me') claims to have pulled the wool over the eyes of every national     newspaper in Britain except the FT. 2.  In 1991 the FT reported the sensational discovery of the earliest     surviving text of sayings ascribed to Jesus. Source of the story     was the previously unknown Egyptologist Batson D. Sealing. 3.  The mystery of how the FT's Lex column got its name died with     Hargreaves Parkinson, the man who started it. But some believe it     comes from the Latin De minimus non curat lex ('The law is not     concerned with trifles). 4.  The FT normally gets 80 per cent of its revenues from advertising,     with only 20 per cent coming from the 60p cover price. 5.  The price of a full-page advertisment in the FT ranges from pounds     28,224 to pounds 32,500, depending on position. For full colour, the     range is pounds 35,500 to pounds 41,000 6.  Famous people who have worked for the FT include Lord (once, plain     Nigel) Lawson, a former Chancellor, who was a Lex columnist and     features editor; and Lord (once, plain Norman) Tebbit, a former Tory     party chairman. He worked in the prices room, as did pop star turned     actor Gary Kemp. 7.  One former FT chairman, Horatio Bottomley, was imprisoned for fraud     in 1922. A visitor who found him stitching mail-bags in the prison     workshop exclaimed: 'Sewing, Bottomley?' 'No, reaping,' he replied. 8.  The FT moved its editorial offices to a new building on the south     side of Southwark Bridge in 1989 after selling Bracken House, its     old home in the City, for pounds 143 million at the height of the     property boom. 9.  The FT's new printing plant at East India Dock in London's     Docklands, winner of a string of architectural awards, also prints     the Observer and the European edition of Nihon Keizei Shimbun - the     latter in Japanese. 10. The FT is printed in four other countries as well as Britain. The     other places are Frankfurt in Germany, Roubaix in France, New     Jersey in the US and Tokyo, Japan. 11. The FT now sells in 150 countries, and its rapidly-rising overseas     circulation accounts for 40 per cent of the total. 12. Because of the international time difference, FT subscribers in     Tokyo get their papers at 9am local time while it is still midnight     the night before in Britain. 13. Contrary to popular misconception, there are no links between the     FT and the Times, nor have there ever been - though the two held     merger talks in 1966, when the troubled Times was looking for a     suitor. 14. Once-a-week readers dipping into the FT at weekends make the     Saturday paper immensley popular; it outsells the Monday-Friday     edition by about 15 per cent. 15. The FT share price indices, a valuable promotional tool for the     newspaper, date back to 1935 when the first of them was created     to monitor the rate of recovery from the slump of the early 1930s. 16. The FT has more foreign correspondents than almost any newspaper in     the world, with 35 full-time staff correspondents, nine more     correspondents working mainly for the FT and about 80 other     stringers. 17. The FT was named Newspaper of the Year last year. Readers agreed,     saying it made excellent cat litter. Homes and Gardens magazine     recommended using it as gift wrap. 18. Of respondents to a recent UK readership questionnaire in the FT:     89 per cent were male, the average age was 45 and the average     salary pounds 68,000 a year. 19. The white parts of colour pictures in the FT are an optical     illusion. What readers really see is the absence of any other     colour - in other words, the pinkness of the paper underneath. 20. The FT's pink paper used to be cheaper than ordinary newsprint     because it cost less to dye poor-quality paper than it did to     bleach it. Now, the pink paper costs more - but old traditions die     hard.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

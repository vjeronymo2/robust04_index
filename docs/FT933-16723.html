			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Foreign investors prefer Britain THE UK continues to account for about a third of inward investment into European Community countries although the number of projects involved has fallen for the second year running. Government figures published yesterday show overseas investors sanctioned 303 new capital expenditure projects last year, creating or safeguarding more than 56,000 jobs - 5,000 more than in the previous year. The biggest inward investor into the UK last year was the US, with 126 projects involving new investment, expansion or acquisition. Germany was second, followed by Japan and Switzerland. The Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, said it could not place a value on 1992 inward investment because some companies had not disclosed details. New capital investment in the previous year was estimated at Pounds 1.3bn. The peak year for inward investment into the UK was 1990, when 350 projects were started, with the total falling to 332 in 1991. It is thought, however, that the UK is still taking about one third of EC inward investment. Announcing details, Baroness Denton, small firms minister, said the UK was maintaining its position as the preferred investment location in Europe for companies based outside the EC. Many of them were making an increasingly important contribution to UK exporting efforts. She said that in spite of rising competition in the EC to attract inward investors Britain remained the 'number one choice' for US and Japanese investors. The minister said that the UK had 'stolen a march' on France and Germany, which had initially discouraged foreign investment. US and Japanese companies are making about 40 per cent of all EC-based investment in the UK, with the electronics and automotive sectors among the most active. Regional selective assistance of Pounds 103m was made available to inward-investing companies in 1992. The bureau calculates that although overseas companies investing in the UK still represent only 1 per cent of UK business, they account for 16 per cent of UK manufacturing jobs, 22 per cent of net output and 27 per cent of net capital expenditure. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday announced an Pounds 8.25m regional selective assistance grant to Europa Magnetic Corporation of Taiwan, which is to locate its European headquarters at Cramlington in Northumberland. The floppy disk assembly operation, to serve European and US markets, will create 550 jobs.</p>

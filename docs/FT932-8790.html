			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Bosnia's moment of truth: Europe The row which boiled over last week between the US and Europe over the war in Bosnia seems to have subsided. But the reasons for the row have not been resolved, and the recent torrent of transatlantic abuse and recrimination may be a foretaste of much worse to come. The reason for the row is that the war is reaching the moment of truth. The row was over a twin-track plan which the US thought would help stop the fighting - air strikes against the Serbs, and arms for the Moslems. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, toured Europe to sell the plan, but the Europeans turned it down flat. The anger of some of the anti-European remarks coming out of Washington when Mr Christopher got home seemed way over the top. Senator Joseph Biden's denunciation of the Europeans for 'indifference, timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy' was not just gratuitously insulting; it came from a country which until now has done its best to stay out of the mess. Mr Biden's intemperate outburst probably concealed a deeper meaning. It was a revealing give-away, not just of the intensity of political feeling building up over the conflict, but even more of a premonition that it is driving the world community inexorably towards a grave crisis. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic know that the conflict is coming to a head. When it does, they will have to answer the most basic question, which they have so far evaded: are they prepared to stop the Serbs and impose a settlement, by force if necessary? International leaders would prefer not to have to answer this question. They have believed, correctly, that the best kind of peace comes through negotiation; and they have wanted, if at all possible, to stay out of a murderous war in the Yugoslav mountains. As a result they have followed a cautious policy: diplomatic pressure for a negotiation, on the Vance-Owen plan; and international sanctions to force the parties to negotiate. Officially, they continue to hope that these weak pressures will induce the Bosnians to make peace. European governments have an extra reason for caution. From the beginning, President George Bush made clear he would have nothing to do with Yugoslavia. The US sent large numbers of troops to Somalia, with spectacular success; but Yugoslavia was Europe's problem, and Europe's failure. Bill Clinton campaigned against Mr Bush for a stronger line on Bosnia. Four months into his presidency, he is still telling us that he is going to have a stronger policy on Bosnia; but he still does not have one. The plan for bombing the Serbs and arming the Moslems has now apparently been put on hold. This might have briefly satisfied Mr Clinton's need to be seen to be 'doing something', without endangering US soldiers. But it could not have improved the chances of peace, and might have made them much worse. The UN could not possibly endorse a policy of intervening militarily on the side of the Moslems; that would end all UN peace-keeping for a generation. In any case, such a policy would be vetoed by Russia. If the US intervened militarily on the side of the Moslems, there would be two immediate consequences. First, all international peace-keeping and most humanitarian operations would immediately stop. Second, others would probably intervene on the side of the Serbs. As a result, the war would reach new peaks of ethnic cleansing and territorial aggression. A bombing policy would, in any case, quickly have to be halted, in the face of international revulsion at its unintended but inevitable results. During week one of such an assault, Clinton's hero-rating would soar as the American electorate admired spectacular TV footage of air strikes. In week two, his rating would collapse, in the face of gruesome TV footage of dead and dying civilians. Such a policy makes sense only if you are sure that the Serbs would abandon their war aims during week one. Finally, the US plan is ambivalent about its true strategic objectives. Does it hope to bomb the Serbs into submitting to the Vance-Owen plan? Or does it just want a more equal war, so that the Moslems could fight for more territory? There is a big difference between the two. If the Americans just want a fight to the finish, they have no reason to put any troops in on the ground. In that case they should openly dissociate themselves from the Vance-Owen plan, and stop sneering at the Europeans. If, on the contrary, they hope to implement the Vance-Owen plan, they must be prepared to send troops; but sending troops means fighting Serbs, because that is the only way to make them give up 30 per cent of the territory of Bosnia. In the end we are forced back to the fundamental question: is the international community ready to stop the Serbs, and impose a settlement, by force if necessary? The steps taken so far by Europe and the UN are intended to put off that question for as long as possible. First we had sanctions; then we had a no-fly zone; now we have safe havens, in theory; soon we may have an internationally monitored blockade on the Serbian-Bosnian frontier. But now we have virtually exhausted the repertoire of peaceful pressure to drag the combatants to a negotiated solution, because the gap between the principles of the Vance-Owen plan and the facts on the ground is turning into an unbridgeable abyss. At best we have a few more weeks for procrastination and hope. Then we shall have to answer the big question. And that will be the signal for a serious transatlantic row.</p>

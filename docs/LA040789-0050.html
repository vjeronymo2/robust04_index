			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTER SENDS OIL -- AND PLASTIC -- TO EXXON  </P> <P> Naturalist and author Jack Rudloe on Thursday started a protest campaign  against the oil spill in Alaska, urging Exxon customers to send the company  credit cards sealed in oil.  </P> <P> Rudloe said he hopes that angry Exxon customers will inundate the company with  the oil-coated symbols of lost profits.  </P> <P> "I'm utterly disgusted with the irresponsible attitude Exxon has taken and what  they have done to the Gulf of Alaska, which is probably one of the richest  wildlife areas in the world," Rudloe said.  </P> <P> The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil in  Prince William Sound after striking a reef on March 24.  </P> <P> Rudloe started his crusade with a handful of Exxon cards contributed by friends  and employees at his Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory. He said he will prepare  and send cards from anyone who brings them by his office and hopes that other  people will prepare similar packages in their own homes.  </P> <P> He said he puts each card in a 3-by-5-inch heavy-duty plastic bag. He adds  about 2 ounces of motor oil, heat-seals the bag and sends it to Exxon.  </P></p>

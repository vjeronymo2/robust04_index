			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Drink: What to take to your igloo - Jancis Robinson's Christmas tips for tipplers SINCE LAST year's annual report on the state of the mass wine market, a tidal wave of cheap South African varietals has washed over the shelves of our supermarkets and off-licence chains. They are all Pounds 2.99, white (only 15 per cent of Cape wine is red) and competently made. Colombar(d), the armagnac grape that brought us Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne, is usually the liveliest of the range, perhaps because of its high natural acidity. We have also been swamped by own-labels from the rest of the winemaking southern hemisphere - most using some combination of the words Creek, Gully and Brook, often with a bird's or Aboriginal name, and an awful lot from Penfolds, the Australian company now involved with Santa Rita of Chile. Chilean wine is getting better; Montes makes dependably sophisticated reds. Australia continues to dominate the wine glasses of the middle classes and the main development this year has been the rash of delicious whites, mostly at either Pounds 2.99 or Pounds 3.99, made covertly from Riesling but presented so as to disguise the fact. So the grape that is arguably the world's greatest has to put on an overcoat marked dry white Semillon before it is allowed to saunter into the crowd. I am putting my money into white burgundy bottles, used increasingly to make non-Chardonnays look more Chardonnaylike. Not content with filching the still wine market, the Australians have been making significant inroads with their inexpensive fizz. Yalumba, Angas, Seppelt and Green Point all have their devotees. Elsewhere, Eastern Europe is a treasure trove of bargains, and Iberia keeps surprising us at the bottom end, with the likes of red Leziria from the Alentejo and La Mancha white. There are some horribly over-oakchipped blends about. The real bargains of this Christmas are the better quality sherries, often sold in half bottles, all at absurdly low prices for such historic wines. Here is the first half of my alphabetical end-of-term report on the major supermarkets and chains, with dry whites followed by reds, sweet whites, fizz and fortified wines with star ratings for effort. Asda* A great deal of effort has been expended by the buying team here, but not always to brilliant effect. Danie de Wet Rhine Riesling 1991, Pounds 3.99. Well-balanced South African attempt at an Auslese, although if the Germans can't sell them . . . Asda Leon 1986, Pounds 2.99. Good concentration of colour, fruit and American oak. Lively Spanish red. Tokaji Aszu 1981 3 puttonyos, Pounds 6.99, 50cl. Very special sweet wine, fiery and exciting tawny with a sabre slice of acidity. Knocks spots off all these modern varietals Hungary now sends us. Augustus Barnett** There is now evidence of real enthusiasm among the buyers for the Bass retail chain. An especially good choice in the Pounds 2.99 to Pounds 3.99 range. Cortese del Piemonte 1991, Pounds 2.99. Much smarter package and flavour (pears) in this dry white Italian than the price suggests. Vina Alaiz Blanco 1991, Pounds 2.99. Fruity dry white from Navarre. Viognier 1991 Pere Anselme, Pounds 4.49. One of the better Languedoc answers to Condrieu. Full-bodied yet crisp. Gewurztraminer Spatlese Friedelsheimer Kreuz 1991, Pounds 4.99. Very trendy off dry German, complete with splodgy label. Their enterprise in finding this, and his red Cabernet, deserves the reward of sales. Castillo de Montoro 1990, Pounds 2.89. Good oaky Spanish red, infinitely more concentration and fruit than the ubiquitous and pallid Don Darias. Ch La Montade Bergerac 1990, Pounds 3.79. Well-balanced, utterly respectable claret, even if made slightly outside the usual area. Ch Troncin-Capdevila 1990, Pounds 3.49. Elegant red. More evidence of the usefulness of Cabardes. Ch Ormieres Minervois 1990, Pounds 3.49. Lovely expression of Minervois suavity from top property Ch Fabas. La Cetto Petite Sirah 1988, Pounds 3.99. Powerful, full-blooded, long, well balanced, and Mexican. Another example of the wine world's elastic frontiers. Majestic*** Some good and interesting new Italians at this warehouse chain and some exclusive offerings. Mauzac 1990 Delmas, Pounds 3.99. A high proportion of the Chardonnay grown in the Blanquette de Limoux area is made into still wine. Here is a well-made, still version of the main Blanquette grape which is admirably ripe yet given bite by its its characteristic appleskin finish. Domaine Foulatiere 1991 Coteaux du Languedoc, Pounds 3.59. Excellent depth in this minimally-labelled Syrah-rich southern French red. Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Colli del Moro 1990, Pounds 4.99. Distinctly superior barrique-aged Montepulciano. Drink now. Ch Meaume 1989, Pounds 4.99. Englishman's claret and one of the best vintages to date. Useful superior house red for the Christmas season. San Crispino Sangiovese di Romagna 1988, Pounds 5.99. Distinctly superior, concentrated Sangiovese that has picked up some dried grape flavour from the previous lodger in the French oak barrels in which it spent a couple of years. Montes Alpha 1988, Pounds 7.99. Chilean answer to classed-growth bordeaux - which managed to wrest a silver medal in the Bordeaux lion's den at Vinexpo last year. Decant and amaze. Reserve du General 1989, Pounds 12.95. Ch Palmer's second wine from a forward vintage. Great manners. Ch de Rolland 1990 Barsac, Pounds 7.69 a half. Serious sauternes from an ultra-ripe vintage. To be drunk now or in five years. Shadow Creek 1983, Pounds 5.99. A parcel of well-aged California fizz, an offcut from Domaine Chandon which has gained admirably toasty character from its, presumably, unforeseen, bottle age. A seriously good buy, but a one off. Gateway* Good for very cheap bottles. Leziria, Pounds 1.99. Gateway has the best price (a promotional one) on this juicy Portuguese red. Chevalier Blanc de Blancs, Pounds 1.99. Creditably fruity dry white made from Spanish La Mancha fruit and bottled on a line more used to the local Rose d'Anjou. The EC at work. Marks &amp; Spencer** Range is more conservative than ever nowadays, although there are some bright spots, notably on white burgundies. Cocoparra Sauvignon Blanc 1992, Pounds 3.49. From Australia's irrigated interior, a fresh, lively white from which every ounce of Sauvignon flavour has been extracted. Jeunes Vignes, Pounds 4.49. A paler shade of Chablis. Light but very true. Macon Villages, 1991. Pounds 4.99. Perfectly respectable, lively southern white burgundy from Antonin Rodet. Chablis 1990, Pounds 6.99. M&amp;S has been dealing with the Chablisienne co-op for so long that it gets some of the best vats. Ch Le Mounan 1990, Pounds 3.99. Even the M &amp; S wine buyer is startled by how good this claret tastes at the moment. Concentrated and lively. Rasteau 1990 Cote-du-Rhone Villages. Pounds 4.99. Absolutely fabulous, this offering from the dynamic Chapoutier brothers. I would happily pay Pounds 2 more a bottle for such traditionally made, low yield concentration. It should ideally be drunk from 1994 but is already enjoyable if you appreciate sincerity. Bourgogne Epineuil 1989, Pounds 5.49. Light, true red burgundy from the far northern vineyards around Chablis. Good with white meat. Moscatel de Valencia 1991, Pounds 3.79. Much lighter and crisper than the cheaper, Sainsbury's version. Still good value. M &amp; S Champagne, Pounds 9.99 One of the better cheap champagnes around. Oddbins**** The wine lover's favourite chain has refurbished its old Farringdon Street branch in London EC1 as a 'fane wane' store, except that Oddbins' definition of fine wine is predictably unpredictable. Current extra-special bargain areas include crus classes 1990 red bordeaux available by the bottle, vintage port at laughable prices, specially bottled vintage malt whiskies and some giveaway young burgundies from Jaffelin, recently sold by Drouhin to Boisset. We won't see Corton Charlemagne at Pounds 19.99 again. Eden Ridge Dry White 1992, Pounds 3.99. Organic, lively Australian made mainly from Riesling, with some Sauvignon aroma and an interesting hotchpotch of old vine varieties. Buy now before the price rises. Cosme Palacio Blanco 1990, Pounds 4.69. Golden, oaky, full-bodied, traditionally styled white rioja with a French accent. Leasingham Domaine Clare Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 4.99. Lively, subtle, lots of unAustralian characteristics except that it is still a bargain. De Bortoli Yarra Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 6.99. Made by exuberant winemakers from restrained, cool climate fruit, An impressive combination. Haardter Herrenletten Riesling Spatlese 1990 Muller-Catoir, Pounds 7.99. More silly prices from one of Germany's geniuses. Both fruit and place explode from this particular bottle of medium dry white but no Muller-Catoir should disappoint and the Halbtrockens are great with food. The Monterey Vineyard Pinot Noir, Pounds 2.99. For bargain hunters rather than connoisseurs, this is California at eastern European prices. Earthy or dirty, depending on your taste, but that's Pinot for you. Baileys Shiraz 1990, Pounds 4.99. Same old toyshop label and still rich and concentrated, but softer and more Italianate (Dolcetto-like?) than of old. Good value. Le Paysan, Pounds 5.49. Nothing at all peasantlike about this alternative to mature cru bourgeois claret from the Cotes du Frontonnais near Toulouse which, Oddbins ambitiously claims on the label, 'is about as fashionable as flared trousers'. Vino da Tavola] Pounds 6.99. Very Supertuscan wine, very Steadman label, very Oddbins price. Wirra Wirra The Angelus 1990, Pounds 7.49. Ultra suave claret from South Australia. Jaffelin 1990 red and 1991 white burgundies. The Monthelie 1990 at Pounds 9.49 is probably the best buy. Ambitiously fruity red burgundy built for the long term. For drinking, preferably with something more powerful than a turkey, or keeping. The Chambolle-Musigny 1990, Pounds 13.99, oddly, is probably readier. And the white Chassagne-Montrachet, Vergers 1991, Pounds 11.99, would add glamour to any table this Christmas. 1990 bordeaux, red and sweet white. These bottles have to be ordered but should take no more than a week to reach your local branch. Take advantage of the fact that you can buy by the single bottle rather than committing yourself to a dozen bottles. Good buys include the alluring Beau-Site Pounds 6.99, silky La Tour de Mons Pounds 8.99, oaky Poujeaux Pounds 8.99, precocious Lafon-Rochet Pounds 9.49, plump Ormes de Pez Pounds 9.99, bargain Leoville-Barton Pounds 13.49, gorgeous Pichon-Baron Pounds 19.49 and hedonistic Conseillante at Pounds 29.99. These reds are designed to be kept but are still at the beguiling baby stage so could easily be served this Christmas. Ditto the delicious 1990 sauternes: Maynes des Carmes Pounds 5.99 a half and, well worth the extra, de Malle Pounds 7.99 a half. Vintage port Quinta do Noval 1982, Pounds 9.99. Graham 1983 Pounds 13.99, Warre 1980 Pounds 14.99. A clutch of bargain ports to drink. NEXT WEEK: Safeway, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up, Victoria Wine and Waitrose.</p>

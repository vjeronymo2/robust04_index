			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Tecs attack budget scheme A government initiative that aims to improve local regeneration schemes has been criticised by training and enterprise councils as a 'missed opportunity' for business and job creation. Employer-led Tecs are among several organisations, including local authorities, that will be encouraged to bid for the new Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) which will, from April, replace 20 separate economic regeneration programmes at present run by five government departments. Tecs, which administer government training programmes in England and Wales, have the additional responsibility of spearheading local economic development. A large part of their economic development budgets will be subsumed by the new SRB. Tecs fear that in spite of the different budgets being pulled together into the SRB, the focus of most of the programmes will remain that of alleviating deprivation, especially physical and social problems in inner cities. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of the Tec National Council, said yesterday: 'While we accept that improving the physical environment helps to facilitate growth, we are urging the government to change its draft SRB proposals to place much greater emphasis on increasing competitiveness, business growth and skills, and on the physical developments which will support this.' Strict guidance for SRB bids has been drafted by the government and this has caused some conflict with Tecs.</p>

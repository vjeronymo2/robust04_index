			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY URGED TO CHANGE PLANNING APPROACH  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday borrowed an idea from an earlier era when city  dwellers walked downstairs to the grocery store in their apartment building.  </P> <P> Espousing a concept finding increasing favor with urban planners, the mayor  proposed changing city law to allow development of so-called "mixed-use"  projects to provide housing, commercial and parking facilities under one roof.  </P> <P> Rather than having to drive several miles to the store, residents could walk to  shopping or work in neighborhoods where apartments and shops are side by side  or in the same building.  </P> <P> "I believe (that) if we can encourage developers to provide housing, commercial  use and parking facilities under one roof, we will improve the quality of our  air and further reduce traffic congestion on our city streets," Bradley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Zoning Laws  </P> <P> Zoning and planning laws now discourage such mixed-use buildings and  neighborhoods and promote the development of areas where residential and  commercial buildings are separated. Grocery stores are banned, for example, in  the typical Los Angeles residential subdivision.  </P> <P> Mixed-use neighborhoods, city officials said, could help control the growth of  traffic and air pollution while providing affordable housing close to  commercial centers where most people work.  </P> <P> The plan is one of many developed at the mayor's direction in recent weeks that  have been held up while Bradley waited for an end to a storm over his personal  finances. Now, in a change of strategy, the mayor is taking his proposals  public in an attempt to relieve concern that his office is paralyzed by the  continuing investigations into his conduct.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reversal in Policy  </P> <P> The proposal would be a reversal in policy for Los Angeles, where the motor  vehicle shaped sprawling development of housing subdivisions and shopping  centers. In the Los Angeles pattern, a car is needed for a trip to the market  or for a commute to work.  </P> <P> Bradley was joined in making the announcement by City Council members Michael  Woo, Marvin Braude and Hal Bernson. Council approval will be needed for some of  the changes.  </P> <P> The council members pledged to work with the mayor and various city departments  in eliminating existing restrictions to mixed-use developments and creating new  rules and procedures that will smooth the way for their approval.  </P></p>

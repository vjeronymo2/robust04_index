			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water doubles - Higher than average dividend increase of 16% surprises City Northumbrian Water Group yesterday took the lead in the industry's dividend bonanza with a record 16 per cent increase from 8.1p to 9.4p for the six months to September 30 - its first pay-out since the price review. Northumbrian, smallest of the privatised water and sewerage companies, also indicated that real dividend growth would be higher than expected over the next five years as it sought to wind down exceptionally high dividend cover. The announcement follows better than expected pay-outs from Thames and Anglian, which increased dividends by 11 and 10 per cent. Mr David Cranston, chief executive, said Northumbrian intended to bring its cover down from about 4 times to 2.5 by the end of the decade. This would happen within a pricing regime which was 'tough, but achievable', he said. He sought to fend off potential criticism by saying the increase represented on average about 15p per customer, or Pounds 400,000 in total. This compared with the Pounds 1m which Northumbrian expected to contribute this year to a new regional fund it had set up to encourage economic regeneration in the area. Analysts, however, described the action as maverick. The company had been expected to offer a higher than average increase, but 16 per cent was unprecedented, said one. Pre-tax profits for the first half more than doubled from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 46.1m on sales 5.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 155.7m (Pounds 144.7m). Earnings rose from 30.3p to 59.1p. The sharp profits increase was largely due to the absence of Pounds 8.9m in exceptional charges for the closure of a pipe maintenance business and a Pounds 2.2m loss on discontinued operations. At the operating level profits rose by 43 per cent from Pounds 41m to Pounds 55.5m, including Pounds 1.5m from acquisitions. In the regulated water and sewerage business, operating margins rose from 38 to 47 per cent. This was largely due to a 4 per cent reduction in operating costs. The non-regulated environmental services business increased losses to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 900,000). However, Northumbrian expected the business to return to profit in the second half. COMMENT rate for utilities put a dampener on water shares yesterday. Yet Northumbrian's bold move should reinforce the view that other water companies are likely to rethink dividend policies. The most obvious candidates for higher increases are Southern, Severn Trent and Welsh, although none of them is likely to come near Northumbrian's figure. Meanwhile, the company's immediate prospects are encouraging. It should beat efficiency targets, which have been set by the regulator, and is also expected to increase the final dividend by 16 per cent. However, a higher tax charge might mean a more modest increase next year. Forecasts are for about Pounds 83m this year, before exceptionals. With the shares rising 16p to 712p the prospective p/e of 6 and its dividend prospects make Northumbrian stand out, although the water sector labours under substantial political risk.</p>

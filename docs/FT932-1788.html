			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Repola returns to black with FM27m in first term REPOLA, Finland's largest industrial group, returned to the black in the first four months due to a strong result from its forestry operations. Profit after financial items amounted to FM27m (Dollars 4.8m), compared with a FM118m loss in the same 1992 period, even though the weaker markka pushed up financing costs by FM257m to FM853m. Operating profit climbed to FM880m, or 10.2 per cent of net sales of FM8.63bn, from FM478m, or 5.6 per cent of FM8.46bn in sales in 1992. Nearly all the growth came from the company's forestry unit, United Paper Mills, where operating profit climbed to FM804m from FM421m and sales increased to FM5.44bn from FM4.56bn. Sales by the group's engineering business fell 22 per cent to FM2.67bn from FM3.42bn, although operating profits rose to FM57m from FM48m. The group's third arm - plastic packagings - saw profits rise to FM6m from FM4m.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Sikulu This is a South African show, the successor to Ipi Tombi (music and direction again by Bertha Egnos), and it is unabashed showbiz. Everybody in it is very fit. They all sing and/or dance almost continuously and with limitless enthusiasm - or at least dance: the entire show is piped at full steam through loudspeakers, with added orchestral backing, and from time to time there is a suspicion that the well-honed chorus, never out of breath, may be pre-recorded too. There is the merest thread of a story. Ubhejane, a devoted son, departs from his native village in search of his father; he meets urban alienation in Johannesburg and Soweto, finds his father in a remote prison, and goes home. Spoken dialogue is minimal, although the flash taxi-man Dube Dube (played by Rosen Songelwa, with portable telephone) does some earnest narration of recent, painful history. Nothing else is allowed to disturb the athletic cheerfulness, except a soulful reunion-duet for father and son - a frank Western pop-ballad, affecting or excruciating according to taste - and a sullen sextet of Rebels who sing, implausibly, 'So naive, old and trusting / Like the shelves your mind needs dusting.' Music and dance alike run the gamut from 'traditional' native stuff to basic South African pop and lusty Broadway-style numbers, all of it rendered hyper-energetic and aimed straight at the audience. There is no pretence that we're eavesdropping on anything private; even the tribal battle-dances at the end are show numbers. The stage-Soweto is clean and bright, and nothing rougher happens than a failed handbag-snatch. The colourful costumes are uniform for each group, like elves or Cossacks or cygnets in a ballet, or an old-fashioned musical, and the simple sets and slick lighting are in nightclub-vein. The performers come from several tribes: Tswana, Sotho, Shangaan, Xhosa (which means that we get a women's trio in click-talk), Zulu and more. There is a manic miners' dance for men in gumboots at the disco-wedding which occupies a large part of the second act, dramatically quite irrelevant but fun. Some ethnic instruments are visible from time to time - including four large drums, furiously played and fiercely amplified - but the backing-track laces much of the music with pop Western brass and strings. This is not a compromise, for the whole pageant is uncompromisingly commercial. Good-hearted too, though; and often reasonably infectious, and sometimes exhilarating. As Ubhejane, Joe Motsamai looms with grave dignity and wields a fine, resonant bass, and Andy Chabeli sings not only his plaintive father but two other roles. The exuberant choreography is by Lynton Burns, wherever the dancers themselves have not supplied the steps from folk-memory. Nothing very political raises its head: the sole agent of repressive authority is an illiterate black prison guard, and in general the tone is not militant, but forgive-and-forget - and keep on dancing. Queen's Theatre, London W1, booking to July 25. Box office: (071) 494 5040</p>

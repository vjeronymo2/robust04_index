			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> GOLFERS SHRINK, STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> The long-held theory among golfers that their sport can cut even the biggest  player down to size has found scientific support.  </P> <P> According to a paper delivered at the first World Scientific Congress of Golf,  the average golfer shrinks one-hundredth of an inch during an 18-hole round, or  16-hundredths if he or she carries a full golf bag over the course.  </P> <P> That finding, by researchers at England's Liverpool Polytechnic College, is  among the more odd presentations at the four-day conference in this university  town where golf began centuries ago.  </P> <P> On Tuesday's opening day, the 300 delegates were told that golf just hasn't  kept up with performance advances of other sports in recent years.  </P> <P> They also were told not to worry about it.  </P></p>

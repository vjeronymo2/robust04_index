			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429) 23 March 1994 in Beijing: "Will There Be a Power  Vacuum After Deng Xiaoping's Death"]    [Text] How to maintain lasting order in China is a problem  Deng Xiaoping has been considering and trying to solve by  practice since he was reinstated for the third time. During his  tour of southern China in early 1992, he believed that the key  to prolonged political stability, in a sense, lies with men,  urging the central authorities to uphold the basic line of "one  centre, two basic points" for a long time to come. What counts  is that the CPC must organize a good political bureau,  especially a good political bureau standing committee, he  stressed, adding that so long as there is no problem with this  link, China will be as stable as Mount Taishan. This is why  since he established the third generation of the central  leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core after the 4 June  incident in 1989, and especially since he set up the  seven-member political bureau standing committee comprising  Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu  Huaqing, and Hu Jintao, Deng has repeatedly expressed his  appreciation for the CPC central leading body with Jiang at the  core.  <H3>  Former Politburo Standing Committee Members Sharply  Criticize "Central Leading Body With Jiang at the Core" </H3>   CPC elders including Chen Yun, who made a public appearance  in Shanghai on the eve of the last Spring Festival, and Yang  Shangkun, Bo Yibo, and Wan Li, who went to various regions on  inspection tours, praised the central leading body for its  strong leadership and good performance and told local leading  cadres at all levels to consciously safeguard the authority of  the central leading body. The CPC elders' moves show they are  eager to guarantee political stability after their deaths.    However, a Beijing source leaked word that central as well  as  local cadres are divided over this appraisal of the central  leading body's work performance. To have a better understanding  of the situation, the central authorities called many forums  from late February to early March this year, namely, before the  Second Session of the Eighth NPC, to solicit the opinions of CPC  elders and retired generals and cadres on Premier Li Peng's  "government work report (draft)" and the CPC Central Committee's  work performance.    As disclosed in a briefing distributed by the CPC Central  Committee General Office, participants in the forums had  identical views on some matters and differed on others. And  some offered sharp criticism. Song Ping, a former CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member, said:  "The problem at present, which has a direct bearing on the  destiny of the party and the country, is party building. If  this problem is not solved, building socialism with Chinese  characteristics will turn out to be empty talk and a lie." He  added: "If inflation cannot be brought under control, stability  will not last. If corruption cannot be eliminated, the party  will lose its prestige." Yao Yilin, also a former member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee, said:  "We should always give top priority to efficiency in economic  construction. We are now at the initial stage of building a  socialist market economy; it is not advisable to brag about its  role and correctness." Song Renqiong, a former vice chairman of  the Central Advisory Commission, noted the tendency of going  from one extreme to the other in the political and economic  fields and in party building.    However, former NPC chairman Wan Li, former defense minister  Qin Jiwei, and former CPC chairman Hua Guofeng praised the  incumbent central leading body for its ethical integrity,  decency, pragmatism, competence, vigor, and authority and hoped  that party members and non-party cadres would unanimously  support the central leading body.    In all fairness, the central leading body should find  sufficient consolation in the praise accorded by these three  representative figures.    In fact, the central leadership has also realized the  importance of fostering authority. It was for this purpose that  Li Peng unprecedentedly quoted Jiang Zemin on three occasions in  his 1994 government work report.  <H3>  Different Appraisals of the Central Leading Body Exist  Within the Party </H3>   A source said that although the third generation of central  leadership has done a large amount of work over the last few  years and earned much praise, some people within the party  believe it cannot be placed on a par with the first generation  of the central leadership with "Mao Zedong at the core" or the  second generation of with "Deng Xiaoping at the core." The  process of establishing the third generation of CPC central  leadership points to its inadequate natural endowment in three  respects. First, the leadership came to power in a hurry when  the CPC's prestige suffered a great deal because of the 4 June  incident in 1989, and before this most members of the leading  body had failed to gain experience in making policy decisions as  successors to the supreme CPC authority and lacked popular  support. Second, of the five years they have been in power, at  least three were spent on improving the economic environment and  rectifying economic order, namely, they did not make spectacular  achievements in economic reform and development for about three  years and bridging the rift between the CPC and the people.    And third, the leading body is a product of a compromise  between various forces within the CPC, and these differences  were ironed out by several political elders to "maintain unity."  When these elders pass away in turn, there will be a problem  with the balance of power.    However, some CPC theorists believe the central leading body  will be able to achieve a smooth transfer of power after Deng's  death. A commentary entitled: "Will China Avoid Confusion  After Deng Xiaoping's Death," recently carried by the restricted  publication CANKAO XIAOXI [REFERENCE NEWS], listed the reasons  as follows. First, the present successors are different from Hua  Guofeng, who came to power after Mao Zedong's death. As Hua had  no real power, there was a power vacuum, but there will be no  power vacuum in the future because the present central leading  body has real power. Second, the people wish to maintain  stability because they have constantly received benefits from  over a dozen years of reform and the opening up. Third, the  central leading body is now in a much better position to restore  the CPC's prestige due to the reorganization decided at the 14th  CPC National Congress, and it will not go astray politically  because it has Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance. And fourth, most countries in the  world, particularly the countries of the Asia-Pacific region,  hope China's economic development will stimulate economic  development in the Asia-Pacific region rather than being eager  to see China in chaos. In short, the present macro and micro  climates are different from what they were during the cultural  revolution and 1989, when the pro-democracy movement took place,  so the writer believes China will not be have chaos after Deng's  death.    People in Beijing political circles point out that the party  will see two internal factions holding different viewpoints for  a long time to come, adding that only future events will prove  which is correct. If the present "central leading body with  Jiang Zemin at the core" wants to ensure that there will not be  a power vacuum after Deng's death, they must do a more solid job  to gain popular support.  <H5>  Ding Guangen Becomes a Liaison Man Between Deng and Jiang </H5>   The source said that although Deng had handed the power to  make day-to-day policy decisions to the central leading body, he  is ready to give his advice on major policies upon request.  Apart from concerning himself with the operation of the central  leading body through his office and his children, Deng has  recently contacted the central leading body through Ding  Guangen, who is a member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau, secretary of the Central Secretariat, and head of the  CPC Propaganda Department. Since Guan, together with Wang  Hanbin (CPC Central Committee Political Bureau alternate member  and NPC vice chairman) and Wang Daming (Beijing CPPCC chairman),  often plays bridge with Deng, Jiang usually asks him to tell  Deng about Political Bureau meetings and Deng, in turn, also  gives feedback to Jiang through Guan, thus virtually making Guan  a liaison man. Because Mao Yuanxin acted as a liaison between  the Political Bureau and Mao Zedong in the past, people jokingly  call Guan a contemporary Mao Yuanxin. Reportedly, Jiang also  often asks Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC  Committee, to brief Chen Yun, who usually stays in Shanghai, on  Political Bureau meetings, and Chen also gives instructions to  the bureau through Wu. So Wu has also become a liaison man  between Chen and the Political Bureau.    People in Beijing political circles maintain that Jiang can  get more assistance from Deng with the help of the liaison man,  but this is quite detrimental to his efforts to foster his  independent authority. Therefore, to ensure stability after  Deng's death, it is better to remove the liaison man.</p>

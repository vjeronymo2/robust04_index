			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Recoveries are not on trust NAPIER v KERSHAW Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Dillon, Lord Justice Staughton and Lord Justice Nolan) July 9 1992 STOP LOSS insurers with a right of subrogation against an assured must normally claim at common law in debt or for monies had and received, and have no equitable remedy directly against recoveries held for the assured by his agent.  And where the loss is insured above a certain minimum and below a certain limit, excess to be borne by the assured, recoveries should be applied first in recouping any loss above the limit, then the layer insured, and finally excess below that layer. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing part and allowing part of an appeal by the defendant stop loss insurers from Mr Justice Saville's decision as to the order of appropriation out of settlement monies recovered by solicitors, Richards Butler, as agents for the plaintiff Lloyd's Names, Lord Napier and others. LORD JUSTICE Dillon said that 987 Lloyd's Names who belonged to the Outhwaite Syndicate had formed an association to claim against RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agencies Limited and members' agents at Lloyd's to recover losses attributable to allegedly negligent underwriting. Under a settlement in March 1992, Pounds 116m was paid by the Outhwaite defendants to Richards Butler on behalf of the names. Of that total, Pounds 80m was attributable to past paid and notified cash calls in respect of losses of the Outhwaite Syndicate. The balance was irrelevant to the appeal. The defendant stop loss insurers were joined as representatives of other Lloyd's Syndicates which wrote stop loss insurance policies for 1982 for individual names. Those Names who had not effected stop loss policies with the insurers had had their shares of the settlement monies released to them. On the appeal the first issue was whether the stop loss insurers could recover whatever they were entitled to recoup directly from the monies in the hands of Richards Butler, on the ground that they were held on constructive trust for the insurers to the extent of the amount they were entitled to recoup from each name. Richards Butler received the settlement monies as agents for the names in the ordinary course of their practice as solicitors. In Lee v Sankey LR 15 Eq 204,211 Bacon V-C said 'A mere agent of trustees is answerable only to his principal . . . in respect of trust monies coming into his hands.' Accordingly, the stop loss insurers did not claim that Richards Butler were constructive trustees. Their claim was that the names were constructive trustees of the recovery monies, and that the amounts due to the insurers were traceable in equity in the monies held by Richards Butler. It was common ground that in appropriate circumstances a remedy in equity by way of constructive or resulting trust or a remedy at common law, might arise out of different aspects of the same transaction. Equity and common law were not mutually exclusive. However, the doctrine of subrogation was a common law doctrine long before the fusion of law and equity. Also the intricacies and doctrines connected with trusts ought not to be introduced into commercial transactions, and an agent in a commercial case ought not to be turned into a trustee with all the troubles that attended that relation (see New Zealand and Australia Land 7 QBD 378, 382). Even so, in appropriate circumstances a constructive trust might be held to have arisen out of a common law relationship. In Lister v Stubbs 45 ChD 1 it was held that the relationship between a company and an employee who had corruptly received commission from a customer, was that of debtor and creditor, not one of trust, with the result that the company could not claim ownership of investments which the employee had bought with the commission. The company's proper course was to recover a money judgment. No doubt in an appropriate case even in an insurance context, recoveries which an insurer was entitled to claim by subrogation could have been held on constructive trust for the insurer. But it was not automatic that whenever the assured recovered monies in circumstances giving underwriters a right to recoupment, the recoveries would be held on a constructive trust for the underwriters insofar as they were traceable in equity among the assured's assets. Such a very broad approach would be inconsistent with the essentially common law origins of subrogation in insurance law. In the present case there was nothing in the circumstances to turn the stop loss insurers' subrogation claim against the names from a common law claim in debt or for monies had and received, into a claim under a trust. Mr Justice Saville rightly held that a constructive trust was not made out. The appeal was dismissed on the constructive trust point. The second question arose out of the provision in each stop loss policy for the insured to bear an excess. The insurers only insured losses above a certain minimum and up to a certain maximum. The Names claimed and the judge held that they were entitled to recoup the excess out of recoveries before anything was payable to the insurers by way of subrogation. Under the insurances the underwriters were to indemnify the assured 'for the amount by which the assured's . . . loss . . . exceeds the amount stated as excess in the schedule'. It was provided that the underwriters' liability should not exceed the amounts stated as 'limit' in the schedule. The case was argued on hypothetical figures. An excess of Pounds 25,000 and a limit of Pounds 125,000 were assumed, giving a layer of insurance of Pounds 100,000. The underwriting loss was Pounds 160,000. The top Pounds 35,000 (the difference between Pounds 160,000 and Pounds 125,000) might be uninsured, or might be covered by another layer of stop loss insurance with a different insurer. The case for the stop loss insurers was that if there was any recovery by the Name after they had paid him the Pounds 100,000, the recovery should be applied first in recouping the top Pounds 35,000 whether insured or not, and second, in recouping the Pounds 100,000 to the stop loss insurer. Recoupment of the Pounds 25,000 excess would only begin if the recovery exceeded Pounds 135,000. The case for the Names, which the judge accepted, was that it was fundamental to the law of subrogation that there could be no recoupment to an insurer until the assured had recovered the whole of his uninsured loss. Therefore, it was said if the top Pounds 35,000 was uninsured, any recovery would go in recoupment to the name of the Pounds 35,000 and the Pounds 25,000 excess, and only then towards recoupment of Pounds 100,000 to the stop loss insurers. The Names' contentions were inconsistent with the agreement that there was to be an excess which was to be borne by them. The application of recovery monies as contended for by the Names would have the effect of turning the stop loss insurers into insurers of the first Pounds 100,000 of the underwriting loss without any excess. The insurers' argument that recovery should be applied from the top down leaving the excess the last to be recouped, was preferable. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed on the excess question. Their Lordships gave concurring judgments. For the insurers: David Donaldson QC and Michael Swainston (Clyde &amp; Co) For the Names: Anthony Boswood QC and Stephen Moriarty (Richards Butler) In Depositors Protection Fund v Dalia, Financial Times July 16 1992, Lord Irvine of Lairg QC was leading counsel for Mrs Dalia.</p>

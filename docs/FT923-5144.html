			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders assess rapeseed damage WINNIPEG TRADERS were yesterday assessing the extent of the crop damage from early snow and frost in key Canadian producing areas that caused rapeseed futures to jump sharply at the city's commodity exchange on Monday. During the morning the November position eased to CDollars 304 (Pounds 128) a tonne from the CDollars 305.40 reached on Monday. That day had seen a rise of Dollars 9, almost reaching the daily limit on price movements, which extended the advance over the past month to about 7 per cent. Flax seed futures had jumped the full CDollars 10 limit on Monday. Other oil seeds prices were up more modestly. Mr Jim Hamilton, grains co-ordinator at James Richardson &amp; Sons, Winnipeg, said the extent of the damage to crops under snow and the potential for harvest could not be known for a week or so. Cool, damp weather is forecast to continue until at least September 10. 'The rapeseed crop is two weeks late because of the weather, but it will be several weeks before harvesting can begin,' said Mr Hamilton. 'Farmers could face problems in delivering against September contracts, but nothing is sure yet.' European Community July-September soyabean crushings may be 16 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year as crushers seek alternatives to this year's much-reduced rapeseed crop, according to the Oil World newsletter, reports Reuter from Hamburg. 'With rapeseed and products pricing themselves out of the market, consumers are shifting particularly to soyoil and meal,' the weekly publication says. It forecasts EC soyabean crushings at 3.35m tonnes in July-September from 2.88m tonnes last year and 2.81m in 1990. The accelerating demand for soya products in Europe has provided a fillip to crushing margins. Oil World calculates that gross soyabean crushing margins averaged DM28 (Pounds 10) a tonne in August up from DM26 in July and only DM12 in May. Last August the average was DM16 and two years ago it was minus DM6.</p>

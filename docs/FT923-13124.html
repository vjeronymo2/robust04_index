			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Lithuanian parliament ousts PM LITHUANIAN Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, accused by his opponents of bungling economic reform, was ousted by parliament yesterday in a vote of no-confidence, Reuter reports from Vilnius. Mr Vagnorius, a close ally of President Vytautas Landsbergis during the struggle for independence from Moscow, blamed his downfall on ex-communists whom he accused of trying to seize back power in Lithuania. Pressure for his dismissal came largely from the majority leftist faction in parliament, which accused him of failing to tackle acute economic problems. His fall spells trouble for Mr Landsbergis, already rebuffed in attempts to reform the system of government and create a strong executive presidency.</p>

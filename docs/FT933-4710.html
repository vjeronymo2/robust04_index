			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Zhu predicts 13% economic growth CHINA'S economy is likely to grow at 13 per cent again this year despite measures to prevent overheating, according to Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier and central bank governor, Reuter reports from Nusa Dua, Indonesia. Mr Zhu told a meeting of business executives in Bali by video-telephone link that the government believed it had been able to withstand and control changes in the macro-economy. He said growth in 1993 gross national product was likely to average 13 per cent, compared with close to 14 per cent for the first six months of the year and 13 per cent in all of 1992. According to some newspapers in Beijing, this year's growth target was 10 per cent. Mr Zhu said macro-economic controls and regulatory measures introduced in June to provide an environment for sustained high growth appeared to be working. The programme was designed to slow down a runaway economy that posted 25.1 per cent growth in industry and 61 per cent growth in fixed asset investment in the first half of the year. 'Early signs are that these measures are yielding positive results. We expect to see more good signs in the coming months,' Mr Zhu said. 'In the first half of this year there was an excessive increase in the scale of investment. This is so because we are in a transition and some of the defects of the old system have not been eliminated, while some aspects of the new order are not yet fully implemented.'</p>

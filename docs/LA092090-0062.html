			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: RECORDS KEEP TRACK OF SERVICE  </P> <P> Question: I have just purchased a new car. Can you suggest what sorts of  records I should keep? -- P.M.  </P> <P> Answer: Certain records will be helpful in maintaining the car, as well as  selling it in the future. Many owners of cars keep every scrap of paper from  their purchase and later service. You don't need to do all of that, but some  basic record-keeping is a good idea.  </P> <P> The most important concern is to keep a log that includes mileage and dates of  major service, including tuneups, oil changes, tire rotations, valve  adjustments, coolant replacement and other fluid changes. It is difficult to  keep all of this information in your memory and a slip could mean that vital  fluids are allowed to drop too low or become too dirty.  </P> <P> It is also a good idea to keep invoices or customer receipts of your major  service, in case a part or service fails while it is still under warranty. This  is especially important in the case of tires and other safety items.  </P> <P> A small file at home should suffice for the service records. And a notebook in  the glove compartment ought to be adequate for the maintenance log.  </P> <P> But if you are also a computer buff, there is now available a computer software  program that allows you to keep track of the service records for up to four  automobiles. It tracks such expenses as fuel, oil, maintenance and repairs  costs.  </P> <P> The software is produced by Oak Tree Systems of Palm Desert, which can be  reached at (619) 341-1559. Michael Jones, Oak Tree president, said the software  is best suited to a well-organized motorist who is willing to keep receipts,  record mileage and post maintenance expenses on the computer system.  </P> <P> Until now such software systems were available only for fleet operators and  were quite costly. The Oak Tree system sells for $49.95.  </P> <P> To use the system, a motorist creates a file for each of his or her cars and  then types in regular entries on gasoline purchases, oil changes, maintenance  and repairs. The central location could conceivably keep records more organized  than if separate logs were located in each car. The downside of the system is  that instead of simply entering the data into a notebook in the car, it must be  taken home and entered into the computer.  </P> <P> One side benefit of the system is that it seems to greatly impress the Internal  Revenue Service if the agency raises questions during an audit about taxpayer  deductions for auto expenses, Jones said.  </P> <P> Q: Does driving on hot pavement during the summer accelerate tire wear or is  very cold weather harder on tires?  </P> <P> A: All temperature extremes are hard on tires, but hot pavement will tend to  accentuate tire wear. The rubber softens as it gets hotter and tends to wear  out more quickly when it is soft. The only benefit is that the softer rubber  has somewhat better traction.  </P> <P> Q: I have a 1986 Cadillac Sedan De Ville with a 4.1 liter engine. Is the  transmission in that car one of GM's lemons? -- T.R.  </P> <P> A: The Cadillac Sedan De Ville has a Model 200 transmission that is about on a  par with the other GM transmissions, including the 125 and 400. The whole  series of transmissions was a consumer nightmare, but GM has been working in  the past two years to clean up its act. It may be too early to tell yet whether  the new generation of transmissions has improved. You have to assume, though,  that with all of the money GM is investing in new products and processes, it  will eventually improve.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASPIN GIVES BOOST TO HOUSE B-2 FOES, ASKS HALT IN PRODUCTION  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee today announced he will  oppose future production of the B-2 bomber, giving a major boost to House  efforts to kill the aircraft President Bush has sought.  </P> <P> "Production of the B-2 should be stopped and the production facility should be  mothballed. Research and development should be continued and completed," Rep.  Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said in a speech on the House floor.  </P> <P> Aspin cited the increasing fiscal constraints on the defense budget as the  basis for his decision. The chairman noted that five strategic programs -- the  B-2 bomber, the C-17 transport plane, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the A-12  attack plane and the light helicopter -- will cost more than $300 billion.  </P> <P> Specifically, the cost of a single B-2 bomber is estimated at nearly $860  million, a price tag that has caused sticker shock among members of Congress.  </P> <P> "The answer to the question of whether the B-2 will be as stealthy and  otherwise work as advertised is: The early results are good, but we just don't  know yet," Aspin said.  </P> <P> In the final analysis, the Armed Services Committee chairman said the program  turned up no "unique and compelling mission for the B-2."  </P> <P> In proposing a $307-billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct.  1, Bush called for $5.5 billion for five of the radar-evading aircraft and  related items.  </P> <P> Faced with a diminishing Soviet threat and a burgeoning federal deficit,  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in April revised the Administration's request to  two planes in fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> Cheney also cut the total number of planes to built from 132 to 75 at a total  cost of $63 billion.  </P> <P> Aspin's announcement is certain to help legislation sponsored by Reps. Ronald  V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), John G. Rowland (R-Conn.) and John R. Kasich (R-Ohio)  to stop production of the planes at the 15 currently in development.  </P> <P> In his speech, Aspin said he would incorporate the Dellums-Kasich-Rowland  amendment in his proposal to the committee.  </P> <P> Last year, the legislation failed in the House by a vote of 279 to 144, largely  because Aspin opposed the bill and joined forces with Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.)  on a compromise bill that scaled back the program.  </P> <P> The Aspin-Synar amendment was approved 257 to 160.  </P> <P> Although proponents of the House measure are optimistic they can kill the  program, support for the bat-winged aircraft in the Senate remains strong.  </P> <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving a $289-billion defense bill  earlier this month, approved the Administration's request for two planes in  fiscal 1991 and the panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) remains a strong  supporter of the aircraft.  </P> <P> Aspin's decision comes as his panel is scheduled to begin crafting their  version of the defense bill for fiscal 1991. The committee will draw up a  budget to a total of $283 billion, $24 billion less than Bush proposed.  </P></p>

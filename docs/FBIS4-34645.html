			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of editorial appearing in 21 June edition of GRANMA: </F> "The Only Option for Embassy Invaders: Unconditionally Leave the  Same Way You Entered;" read by Alfredo Forte from the  "National Radio News"]    [Text] A few more than 100 people have been guests of the  Belgian and German Embassies and the Chilean Consulate for many  days. They want to travel through those countries to reach  their final destination: the United States. Various U.S.  Administrations have used different methods to encourage  desertions during our people's long struggle and have proclaimed  with fanfare the need to exterminate the bad example Cuba has  set on this continent.    Encouragement for illegal escapes and forced entries into  diplomatic missions has increased recently, almost in geometric  proportion to the increasing solidarity Cuba has awakened in the  civilized world due to its unwavering position in the face of an  aggressive and clumsy policy. Seeking to propitiate the  occurrence of these irresponsible actions, visas are  systematically denied to those who want to emigrate; immigration  accords are not fulfilled; and, while legal obstacles increase,  the coasts are kept open to welcome, with ample media coverage,  those who manage to survive this odyssey.    Quite a few in Miami have established a lucrative business  by  trafficking in human beings. Our people are convinced that if  the goals were truly humanitarian, visas would simply be given  to everyone who requested one, illegal arrivals onto the  territory would be banned, and opportunities would be given to  those who want to live in the promised land. It, however, is a  promised land rather than a granted land, except with the risk  of one's life. Such is the case of those now occupying the  three diplomatic missions. Our intention is not to offend  anyone who wants to emigrate. While we respect the people's  right to live wherever they want, we will let no one swindle us  into granting nonexistent categories to people who simply  immigrate for personal reasons, family reasons, or economic  reasons or simply for adventure. That is going too far.    The Belgian hotel's guests include 34 people who have been  warned about markedly antisocial behavior and 25 others who have  been prosecuted for common crimes, including breaking and  entering -- an experience that undoubtedly facilitated the task  of breaking into the diplomatic missions. A total of 25  children -- including the world's youngest political refugee,  who is only a few months old -- were dragged into an adventure  that could only have one ending. Oblivious of the drama in which  their impulsive parents forced them to participate, they face  food problems and live in extremely close quarters. The most  critical thing is that once the alleged political refugees  illegally and disrespectfully entered the Belgian ambassador's  residence, they used the facilities to establish an alleged  organization, distribute propaganda, and display signs under the  Belgian mission's roof.    We must remember that diplomatic missions cannot be used as  centers for political activities against the host country  because this violates the functions for which they are  accredited. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted in a  responsible way by instructing its ambassador to notify his  guests about the nature of the illegal action they have  perpetrated because it violates that country's territory and  Cuban laws, and to ask them to abstain from carrying out  provocative acts in his garden.    We must note that our guards were calm. Their composure  prevented injuries even when their lives were in danger. A  total of 46 of the occupants have already abandoned the  facilities and are home. We must explain that whoever is guilty  of a crime before or during the action of violently entering an  embassy will have to answer for this. For example, the  criminals who stole a truck and damaged state property by  crashing through the German Embassy's gate will have to answer  to the authorities -- not because of the illegal entry, because  we have given guarantees both to Belgium and Germany on this  occasion as a gesture of goodwill toward their governments.  These guarantees, however, do not include immunity for other  crimes. To exonerate the criminals would encourage them to break  into diplomatic missions. Some of them are repeat offenders,  and this is simply inadmissible.    Cuba knows that most of the diplomatic corps accredited to  our country understand and coincide with our government's  position, and they cooperate in this concern. This is the time  to underscore our staunch principle: Absolutely no one who  enters a diplomatic mission by force will be authorized to leave  the country either now or later. This is a nonnegotiable  position, and we will not give in under any circumstances. It  would be easy for Cuba to expedite the way for those who opt to  enter the embassies. Who would pay the consequences? Who would  be left at the mercy of any intruder who violates the immunity  of his territory with the intention of emigrating? What would  be the position of the governments of these countries if  Haitians who are now repatriated en masse preferred to break  into their diplomatic missions? What if, instead of risking  their lives at a border bristling with rifles to hunt them down,  Mexican wetbacks opted to jump the walls at the European or  Latin American missions in Mexico City? Cuba has a  responsibility to protect diplomatic missions. It is dutybound  to protect the immunity and inviolability of their territories,  and it will strictly fulfill its duty.    The experience derived from over three decades of  withstanding blackmail, a blockade, and a direct and indirect  aggression have taught us that we cannot give an inch. You lose  every principle that you give up. That is the best guarantee  for those who represent their countries in Cuba. It is always  appropriate to ask: What is the purpose? Is it perhaps to  establish this option as a legitimate way to leave the country?  Inaugurate in Cuba a new style of getting documents to enter a  country, a style different from the one which exists in other  capitals? Artificially encourage a political situation for  reasons that are suspiciously similar to the ones the United  States is fruitlessly trying to create? Complicate things for  our country during the recently concluded fourth Ibero-American  summit in Cartagena de Indias?    We have yet to lose heart before powerful enemies. We have  resisted despite adversity. We are not a nation that can be  intimidated or put on the defendant's chair. It is time  something is understood once and for all: Cuba does not admit  pressure, regardless of where it comes from or who exerts the  pressure. We were taught courage, and we learned the lesson  well. We were taught unwavering principles, and we are good  students. We were taught that the enemy cannot be given a  single inch, and we are faithful disciples. Cuba is serene.  Nothing clouds the clear conscience of a nation that has  courageously faced difficult tests. Our Foreign Ministry has  amply explained our revolutionary government's position. It is  willing to fully cooperate with accredited diplomatic missions  to solve their conflict and even prevent future problems in a  sensible way.    The people who have sought asylum at the Belgian, German,  and  Chilean missions have only one option: To unconditionally leave  the same way they entered.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bayer plans worldwide generic drugs chain Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals company, is planning to set up a chain of businesses around the world to sell unbranded, generic drugs. Generics is one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceuticals business. Bayer is creating a joint venture with US generics specialist Schein. This is the first large deal with Schein since Bayer paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in March. Mr David Ebsworth, head of Bayer's worldwide business operations, said the joint venture would 'be the basis of a global generics business'. He said that the six months since the stake was taken had showed there was a need for 'dedicated manpower' to take Schein from its US base to other countries. Initially, 10 to 15 people would be employed by the joint venture including specialists in the launch and marketing of drugs and in finding new products. Schein already has a portfolio of more than 400 products, and is especially strong in central nervous system and heart drugs. Mr Ebsworth said the company would make a priority of finding new antibiotics to manufacture and sell. The acquisition of the Schein stake marked Bayer's entry into generics. The deal includes provision for the stake to be raised to 51 per cent 'over the medium term', said Mr Ebsworth. An increasing number of prescription drug companies is seeing generics as a business with potential for rapid growth. Many drugs patented in the 1970s are losing patent protection, opening up the market to companies such as Schein. At the same time, governments are encouraging more generics manufacturers in the hope that increased competition will hold back prices. Many other prescription drug companies have made a move into generics. Last month, BASF, Bayer's German rival, diversified its pharmaceuticals division Knoll into generics for the German market. The move was part of a strategy developed after Knoll had reported its first loss, and it is now looking for foreign partners. Last year, Hoechst, the third of the big three German chemicals companies, paid Dollars 546m for a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another US company, and in May this year, Bristol Myers Squibb bought 25 per cent of Azupharma, a German generics manufacturer.</p>

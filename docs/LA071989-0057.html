			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY OKS ACQUISITION OF HOSPITAL  </P> <P> The San Diego County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend $15 million  to purchase and renovate the now-closed Clairemont Community Hospital, a move  that is expected to alleviate the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatric  beds that will be created by the 1992 closing of a leased psychiatric hospital  in Loma Portal.  </P> <P> The hospital on Mt. Etna Drive, which will offer predominantly psychiatric  care, is scheduled to open in August, 1991. The county will spend $10.5 million  to acquire it from Americare Partners and $4.5 million more on renovations.  </P> <P> "Right now we've got 39 children and adolescent beds at Loma Portal, and, when  the new facility opens, that total will increase to 46," said William J.  Burfitt, county deputy director of health.  </P> <P> County supervisors approved the acquisition despite strong objections from some  neighbors. "We are adamantly opposed," Linda Maskovich told supervisors at a  public hearing Tuesday. "This is not a good use for this property."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighbors' Concerns  </P> <P> Supervisor Susan Golding told Maskovich and other homeowners at the hearing  that the county hopes to keep the hospital from becoming an eyesore or a  security risk. "I know that there are concerns on behalf of the neighbors,"  Golding said.  </P> <P> The renovated hospital, which will house 20 medical/surgical beds and 50  general medical beds, will be operated as a "closed facility" that treats only  patients admitted from other county-operated psychiatric facilities, Burfitt  said. County residents seeking emergency care, for example, will still be  served by the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest.  </P> <P> The UCSD Medical Center has provided surgical and general medical care for the  county since the mid-1960s, Burfitt said. County administrators believe the  newly renovated facility's medical and surgical departments will help cut the  county's health-care costs. They also expect San Diego's share of Medi-Cal  funding to increase by about $1.1 million annually because the county, which  holds only a psychiatric care license, will be granted a general hospital  license to operate the Clairemont hospital. State regulations prohibit Medi-Cal  payments for certain procedures unless they are done in a licensed general  hospital.  </P> <P> The renovated hospital would join the recently dedicated adult psychiatric care  facility on Rosecrans Street, which soon will replace the 60-bed County Mental  Health Hospital in Hillcrest.  </P></p>

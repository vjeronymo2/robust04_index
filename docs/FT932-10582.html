			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Local Government Elections: Horse trading set to become norm  -Higher-than-usual turnout as voters reject recovery claims ENGLISH local government moves into uncharted territory this morning. Twenty-eight counties have no overall control - more than ever before. This will have profound effects on the way individual counties run their affairs, and on relationships between central and local government. Formal pacts are unlikely to be the norm. Instead, the largest parties will put forward programmes, and look for support on an issue-by-issue basis. The two focal points for forging party alliances will be the appointment of committee chairmen, expected soon, and the setting of the budget. According to Mr Andrew Stunell, political officer for the Liberal Democrat Councillors, his party will expect to be recognised as the policymakers in the eight counties where it is now the largest party, as well as the three where it holds overall control. He said: 'There will be a number of Labour politicians who are having to come to terms with what it will be like when we have got a reformed constitution in this country. It's the norm in the rest of Europe and it's not all that difficult when you start.' Labour described speculation about 'Lab-Lib pacts' as 'basically legitimate', and described them as 'the inevitable result of these elections'. For example, in Norfolk, where the Conservatives have lost overall control for the first time since 1888 but remain the largest party, Labour will talk to the Liberal Democrats on issues where they have common cause - these include opposition to the closure of village schools, rural policies, and applications for EC aid. Conservatives will now be the third party on the Association of County Councils, a body they are accustomed to dominating. The government can expect concerted opposition from it. County councils are responsible for implementing the national curriculum in schools, so the news will be unwelcome for the government in its current difficulties over testing.</p>

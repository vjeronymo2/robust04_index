			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credit services help lift Dean Witter 52% DEAN Witter Discover posted a 52 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 171.6m yesterday following record contributions from its credit services and Wall Street securities businesses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The strong third quarter took profits for the first nine months of 1993 to Dollars 465.1m, already more than the Dollars 410.5m earned in all of last year. Mr Philip Purcell, chief executive, said the group continued to benefit from a positive business environment, especially 'low interest rates and the flow of assets into mutual funds'. The securities business reported record earnings of Dollars 692.4m, up 25 per cent on a year earlier. Brokerage commission revenues climbed 35 per cent to Dollars 226.3m, asset management and administration fees rose 27 per cent to Dollars 217.1m, and investment banking revenues grew 34 per cent to Dollars 90.2m. Principal trading revenues, however, fell 5 per cent to Dollars 97.6m, due to reduced activity in the fixed income markets. Operating expenses in the securities business rose 20 per cent to Dollars 573.7m. Dean Witter's credit services division, which includes its highly successful Discover credit card business, produced earnings of Dollars 101.5m, against Dollars 68.6m a year ago.</p>

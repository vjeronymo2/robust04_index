			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / People: 'No one is better than the British at sorting out chaos' - Perhaps, suggests Michael Thompson-Noel, it would be better if trains through Sir Alastair Morton's tunnel were to run late - just at first This ought to be a good week for Britain. But ought is a big word. Today, tickets go on sale for Britain's first national lottery since 1826: a world-class tombola (the first draw is on Saturday) which is likely to gush geysers of cash for various good causes and to spread happiness throughout the land. And today, by coincidence, the first fare-paying passengers are due to step aboard high-speed Eurostar trains for the start of services linking Britain to continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel. Two grand projects. Fun and cheer for all. A lottery which is expected to become one of the world's biggest, and a macro-engineering coup that will anchor Britain a little more securely to its European neighbours at a time when Europe's centre of gravity is drifting eastward. Yet in Britain there is only tepid celebration. Instead, a fit of mockery is waiting to burst forth if either of these great projects fluffs its debut. In theory, accidents or cock-ups are unlikely to afflict the lottery. Lotteries are easy to establish, simple to operate. You turn on the tap; out comes the money. But the Channel Tunnel represents state-of-the-art macro-construction at the tail-end of the 20th century  - complex, sophisticated and a devourer, to date, of mountains of investors' money. In Britain, the approach to today's start of commercial Eurostar services has been signalled by an escalation of chortling and whingeing  - scare stories about safety; further criticisms of the financial predicament of Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French private-sector company which designed, financed, built and will operate the tunnel; and gleeful accounts of 'embarrassing' breakdowns and faults. However, most of this will have been water off a duck's back to Sir Alastair Morton, 56, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and the man who has carried the weight of Eurotunnel controversies since 1987. He was born in Johannesburg, educated in South Africa and at Oxford University (law), and then joined De Beers, the diamond monopoly. After that his career included the World Bank, the British National Oil Corporation and financial group Guinness Peat. Morton has always been renowned for his toughness and 'frightening belligerence' - qualities no doubt essential when dealing with governments, banks, contractors and rail companies while breathing life into a project like the tunnel, but ones that do not reveal themselves across the lunch-table. He exudes forcefulness and confidence - not a man to interrupt  -though he can be curiously softly-spoken, so that you have to lean forward. I met him at Luigi's, an Italian restaurant he likes because he can walk there from his central London office. He was late. He apologised. I said it was not a problem; his secretary had rung the restaurant. He had been delayed, he explained, by the media. There had been a leak about something in Paris which was causing movement in the share price. 'I had to calm things down.' I asked him whether he had had his fill of journalists. He smiled through bared teeth. 'Yes,' he said, 'you could say I was pretty fed up with the press. Not that I take it personally. It's the tunnel, of course. It's big and it's assertive and it satisfies the need in Britain - in fact it's an English thing - to mock, a need to express contrariness. 'It has always been that way. England's national motto is: 'There'll be trouble if you do that'. The exception was North Sea oil, but that was because it involved American oilmen. The ability of Eurotunnel to make money has always been questioned, but only by the City of London. 'I have got used to the fact that adverse or negative news affecting Eurotunnel is seized upon, whereas what might prove to be good news - such as improved traffic forecasts - gets virtually no attention.' I asked Morton what was special about the Channel Tunnel that attracted this treatment. 'Well,' he said, 'first, it's a tunnel - not a bridge, which is glamorous, romantic and liberating. Second, it's a fixed link between England and the continent. Third, there's its size. The feeling is that it's a big project that will come to no good. It has a few fans in Britain: businessmen, for example, who can see five years ahead, and engineers. But the tunnel has to contend with a great deal of bias. 'In France it's different. The French like their big projects, their rockets, the Airbus, their motorways, their grande vitesse trains and nuclear power. The difference is this: in France, the man in the street believes that as a result of big projects his grandchildren will lead a better life.' Did he regret taking on the tunnel? 'No, I knew it would be large, complicated and organisational. I saw it as a major economic development that was very necessary. The great thing I didn't bargain for was a voyage through the English psyche.' I had read, I said, that history's grandest macro-engineering projects, such as the pyramids, had always depended on absolute political support at the very top. Was that true of the tunnel? Would history see Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterand as its heroes? 'For Mitterand,' said Morton, 'the tunnel was a means to an end: the resurrection of derelict northern France. Conversely, Mrs Thatcher said at the outset that the tunnel would be done by private enterprise or not at all  -and after that said nothing.' The Eurotunnel boss seems surprised - even now - at the frigidity of Britain's attitude towards the rest of Europe. 'There is no sense I can detect of people in Britain saying that because they have joined Europe economically they should be doing things like the tunnel to integrate themselves more fully. Britain backs into the future grumbling and grudgingly. On the other hand, the genius of Britain is the way it copes with adverse circumstances. 'The British are reactive, not creative, whereas the French plan. A French engineer will tell you that he cannot start work without a plan. But plans can fail. There is no one better than the British at sorting out the resultant chaos.' On that basis, perhaps the best thing for the Channel Tunnel and for the national lottery would be a few spectacular cock-ups, preferably this week. There would be dancing in the streets - and then a brilliant British rescue. For all anyone knows, that may even be the plan. (See Leader page)</p>

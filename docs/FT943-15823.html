			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Water bills may rise to meet extra Pounds 520m in clean-up costs British householders could face even higher water bills next year as a way of meeting additional environmental obligations handed to the water companies yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The government added another Pounds 522m to the bill water companies must pay for treating sewage and cleaning up rivers over the next five years. Mr Gummer told the industry regulator, Mr Ian Byatt, to take the additional funding into account when fixing price limits for domestic bills. The new money is equal to about Pounds 6 a year for each of Britain's 18m households, but bills will rise more in some areas than in others. Price formulas for Britain's 31 water companies are due to be announced on July 28. They will already take into account a Pounds 14bn-Pounds 15bn clean-up of waste water planned by the industry by 2000. Mr Gummer's decision to add another Pounds 500m in environmental spending to companies' obligations will inevitably lead to the charge that householders will end up footing the bill. Water companies have increased their charges to households by 67 per cent since privatisation in 1989. 'Consumers have been asked to pay a very large part of the burden of investment and general upkeep of the system since privatisation,' said an official at the National Consumers' Council. 'But there is no reason why the cost of this environmental spending should be passed on.' The consumers' council says the burden placed on householders is 'unfair'. Companies should turn to other sources of finance such as the equity market for investment capital. The council is to publish a report on water price increases on Monday. Companies hit hardest by the additional environmental spending will be North West Water, which will be required to pay Pounds 130m for cleaning up the Mersey basin, and Severn Trent Water, which will face an increase of Pounds 194m. The funds will be used to clean up sewage that is discharged into rivers in particularly sensitive areas. Mr Andrew Wheeler, a broker at NatWest Securities in London, said that the additional spending would not make much difference to overall bills: 'When you're looking at investment of Pounds 15bn, an extra Pounds 500m doesn't seem that much,' he said.</p>

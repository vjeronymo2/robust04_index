			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on speech by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at </F> ceremony marking the anniversary of Imam Khomeyni's death; on 3  June; place not given]    [Text] Last night, mourning ceremonies on the occasion of  the demise of the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran were  held with the participation of throngs of pilgrims, mourners,  and foreign guests at the pure mausoleum of Imam Khomeyni, may  God's peace be upon him.    At these ceremonies, self-flagellation by mourning groups  and  participants and chanting of lamentations were carried out.  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani addressed the gathering,  elaborating on the dimensions of the thinking, and the political  characteristics of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased with him.  He referred to his social impact in the renaissance of Islam.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani alluded to the jurisprudential,  spiritual, moral, ethical, and inspirational aspects of the  thinking of Imam Khomeyni--may his soul be sanctified--and  deemed his existence a divine bounty and stressed: The Imam's  inspiration was the quintessence of these qualities.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The Islamic Revolution  of Iran led by Imam Khomeyni--may God be pleased with him--in  the course of the history of Islam was unprecedented after the  esteemed Prophet of Islam, may God's peace and blessings be upon  him and his scion, in such a manner that it can be described as  a miracle.    He stressed: Imam Khomeyni, may God's blessings be upon him,  made an appropriate decision regarding the selection of the next  leader by playing the best role at this juncture in history. If  today we are able to ward off spewing venom, mischiefmongering,  discord, and the destructive activities of the enemy, it is  because we are treading the path of the revolution blazed by the  imam behind the leader of the revolution without the slightest  hesitation, and it is entirely due to the apt management of  Ayatollah Khamene'i.    President Hashemi-Rafsanjani continued: Five years ago, at  this same time, we were apprehensive about the future of the  revolution. However, our trepidation was eliminated by the  imam's guidance and with the allusions and clear indications by  the imam regarding the future; the situation became completely  obvious in this regard. He explained: The imam propounded the  issue of leadership in such a manner that it would be safe from  the treachery of the enemies who were constantly awaiting an  opportunity to settle scores and to capitalize on the vacuum in  the leadership. Therefore, he did not announce any individual  choice openly. However, we found our path in the light of the  imam's wishes and the Assembly of Experts--after these allusions  evolved into a definite form--was able to make a suitable  decision about the future leadership.    The president emphasized: During the course of the Islamic  Revolution, we have perceived divine succor and bounties and the  God of our imam did not stint in showering His kindness and  blessings on the Islamic ummah. Following the demise of the  imam, the multifaceted and comprehensive expediency and  management continued to resolve the problems of the revolution  in such a manner that it went on treading its path. The fear  that had weighed on the hearts of the ever-present-on-the-scene  ummah metamorphosed into confidence, trust, and self-reliance  and we continued on the imam's path.    In another part of his speech, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  expressed his gratitude to Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Seyyed  Ahmad Khomeyni, the esteemed remembrance of the imam, for his  services during the struggle period, and in the aftermath of the  revolution and he also thanked the household of the imam.    At the conclusion of his remarks, the president said that if  today we are able to continue down our path behind the rightful  successor of the imam -- who is the best person imaginable to  shoulder this responsibility, to reconstruct the country, and to  insist on the aspirations of the imam -- it is entirely due to  the guidance and foresight of our dear imam.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Innovative joint venture to invest in Lloyd's PLANS FOR an innovative form of corporate capital vehicle to invest in the Lloyd's of London insurance market were announced yesterday in a joint venture by Hambros, Murray Lawrence Members Agency and Hoare Govett. The venture will be a Pounds 50m investment company which will secure underwriting capacity at Lloyd's with bond investments, rather than the equities portfolios expected to be favoured by the investment trusts that have been announced so far. Details were also announced of Syndicate Capital Trust, a fund intended to raise up to Pounds 50m, being launched by Raphael Zorn Hemsley, the stockbroker, and Insurance Analysis Limited, a Lloyd's adviser. The moves are the latest indication of corporate interest since Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, announced plans to attract corporate capital to restore underwriting capacity following heavy losses sustained by some Names. The plan to admit limited liability corporate capital will be debated at an extraordinary meeting on October 20, and both vehicles which announced proposals yesterday intend to offer shares following that, if it is approved. Mr Stephen Drake, finance director of MLMA, said it had chosen to establish an investment company rather than a trust because it intended to hold most capital in gilts and money market instruments, which involved little risk. The joint venture, for which Hambros Investment Management will manage funds and Hoare Govett will act as broker, is expected to attract mainly institutional investment, but will seek retail investment through personal equity plans. The company expects to participate in a maximum of 25 syndicates, and will underwrite at Lloyd's through five wholly owned corporate members.</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollar may rise THE DOLLAR may rise on March economic data this week, while a number of other currencies come under pressure for a variety of reasons, writes Andrew Jack. A batch of new statistics is due to be released in the US, including consumer confidence, National Association of Purchasing Managers and employment figures. These should provide some indications of the level of economic activity during March, compared with the data for earlier months released last week. But Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser with Chemical Bank, is sceptical of the impact of the data. He said the likelihood of the long-awaited interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan as part of a package to stimulate the economy was strong, and would help boost the Yen. In Germany there may be continued uncertainty about the possibility of interest rate cuts, despite the harsh line taken by the Bundesbank in recent days. In Italy, the lire is likely to come under pressure in advance of the election on April 5, as concern grows about the state of the existing political coalition. In the UK, continued political uncertainty is likely to be fuelled with a series of new polls which continue to affect jittery markets. Mr Cocker stressed that the money markets and equities were more likely to be affected by the election than the exchange rate. Mr David Coleman, treasury adviser to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London, said: 'The market is getting fed up with opinion polls. Why take out a large position when you know it might be affected by big fluctuations? It is going to be nervous this week, and the nervousness will remain until the election.'</p>

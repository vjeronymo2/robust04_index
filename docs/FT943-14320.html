			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / BCCI creditors attack liquidator Two members of the creditors' committee to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday renewed their attack on the liquidators from accountants Touche Ross. In a newsletter due to be circulated to members today, Dr Adil Elias and Mr Tony Scott of the BCCI Depositors' Protection Association questioned whether the liquidators had acted 'in the most effective and cost-efficient way'. They said the liquidators' costs had 'always been too high'. They said they remained 'wholly unconvinced' that the new agreement negotiated between the liquidators and the government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder in the bank, was the best settlement that could be achieved. The newsletter accused Touche Ross of taking a 'high-handed approach' which had imposed strategies on the creditors - seeking only their ratification rather than their advice. The men were 'unhappy' and still negotiating with the liquidators over the requirement for confidentiality covering the creditors' committee meetings, which meant they could not pass information on to depositors. They question the assiduousness with which Touche Ross is pursuing its claim against the Bank of England, which was sued for alleged negligence in its role as supervisor to BCCI.</p>

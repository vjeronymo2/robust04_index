			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU SEARCHING FOR NEW NFL TENANT  </P> <P> A day after the Dallas Cowboys severed their ties with Cal Lutheran, university  President Jerry Miller said that other NFL teams were interested in moving  their training camps to the Thousand Oaks school and that the university  actively would seek another NFL tenant.  </P> <P> "There have been indications that there are other teams who are interested,"  Miller said, "but there hasn't been any direct contact yet."  </P> <P> Miller declined to name teams that had expressed interest in training at Cal  Lutheran.  </P> <P> The Cowboys, who held their preseason training camp at Cal Lutheran for the  past 27 summers, ended their relationship with the university Tuesday, citing  economic and geographical reasons.  </P> <P> Although the Cowboys' previous management had signed a contract with Cal  Lutheran through the summer of 1991, the university does not expect to take  legal action.  </P> <P> "We'll work together (with the Cowboys) on a settlement," Miller said. "I'm  confident that we can work something out that should keep us from getting  involved in any in-court litigations."  </P> <P> At a press conference in Irving, Tex., on Wednesday, Cowboy owner Jerry Jones  indicated that the team would pay for any financial loss suffered by Cal  Lutheran because of the relocation of camp to Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> CLU administrator Dennis Gillette did not have records of the school's profits  from the Cowboys' stay, but the Thousand Oaks Chamber of Commerce conducted a  study in 1983 that found that $250,000 flowed into the city annually as a  result of Dallas' six-week training camp.  </P> <P> "I guess that ($250,000 figure) could be increased by at least 10% to 15% now,"  Gillette said.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran football Coach Bob Shoup said that the Cowboys would be missed in  Thousand Oaks but not financially.  </P> <P> "There are a number of different organizations that would like to be here at  Cal Lutheran not related to sports," Shoup said. "I don't think we'll suffer  filling the dorms and filling summer activities.  </P> <P> "The dollars that the Cowboys pay to Cal Lutheran is certainly consistent with  what we'd charge any other group."  </P> <P> Simi Valley radio station KWNK will continue to carry Cowboy games, according  to General Manager Manny Cabranes.  </P></p>

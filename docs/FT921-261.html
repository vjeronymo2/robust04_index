			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sterling faces a spell of nerves - City Watch IS THIS the calm before the storm for the pound? According to Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, a hung parliament with lots of horse-trading will mean that 'sterling is going to come under quite a lot of pressure'. But earlier fears of a sterling crisis during the election campaign have certainly not been fulfilled, even though the opinion polls point to a close and uncertain outcome. In fact sterling has been rock solid, mostly between DM2.86 and DM2.87, for the first 2 1/2 weeks of the campaign. All three parties are committed to maintaining the pound at a central rate of DM2.95. True, the pound has been testing its floor against the Spanish peseta. But it has been only about 3 per cent below its DM central rate, against the permitted 6 per cent fluctuation. The European exchange rate mechanism has been doing its job. Traders evidently feel it is too risky to punt against sterling. But there is a price. While bank base rates have stayed at 10 1/2 per cent, three-month money is up to 10 3/4 per cent and six-month money costs almost 11 per cent. City experts fear a more serious bout of nerves after the poll. Mr Tim Congdon, of Lombard Street Research, is a well-known opponent of British ERM participation, using words like 'catastrophe' to describe the consequences should interest rates be raised. Nevertheless, there is a widespread feeling that a minority or majority Labour government would be expected to demonstrate its commitment to the ERM by hoisting interest rates at least temporarily: some say half a percentage point would be enough, others fear up to two points. Mr Michael Hughes, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, thinks that such an administration might need to pay attention to the Budget deficit as well as to interest rates. 'The Treasury, on a change of government, will encourage ministers to go into the 2 1/4 per cent band quite quickly,' he believes. But far from being a soft option this would be 'equivalent to the IMF in 1976' when big public-sector spending cuts were forced on the then Labour government. The possibility of sterling becoming a narrow band currency is a factor in limiting speculation against the pound. Mr Norman Lamont has only said that narrow bands will be adopted 'in due course'. One or two opportunities to do so - with sterling briefly above DM2.88 - have been passed up within the past six months, presumably because of pre-election nerves. But the pound cannot remain a wide-band currency indefinitely without losing credibility. A Tory win, most City experts agree, would take the heat off sterling for a while. But it seems rather unlikely at this stage that the Conservatives would have a working majority. This leaves traders to fret about the possibility of a devaluation by Labour, either immediately after looking at 'the books' on taking power, or somewhat later, after interest rate rises become unacceptable. There are also worries about semi-public debates about economic policy between coalition partners.</p>

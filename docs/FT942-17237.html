			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Management: An option on perks - A look at the increasing popularity of flexible remuneration schemes Ever since the 1981 UK Budget introduced the first of a series of progressively neutralising taxes on fringe benefits, the company 'perk' has gradually been losing its lustre. Now, however, a new way of dealing with benefits is charging on to the corporate scene demanding attention from personnel teams. It goes by different names in different countries. Americans refer to flexible benefits, Australians call it packaged compensation and in Britain it has been described as a cafeteria perk. Whatever the language, it refers to the optional bits that can be woven around a basic salary. A report entitled International Flexible Remuneration, published by William M Mercer Companies, the international firm of actuaries and consultants, says that employers around the world are waking up to what until recently has been an exclusively US practice. Some 60 per cent of US companies have adopted flexible remuneration in one way or another. Such benefits can be distinguished from what might be otherwise described as perks by their optional nature. They are substitutes for pay and therefore must be calculated within an overall compensation package. In the US where they have become common, mainly because of tax exemptions, they would typically comprise various forms of life and accident insurance, medical and dental care and care for children or elderly parents. Their attraction is in providing employees with a degree of choice over the direction of their pay. Even though there are no tax advantages in Britain, flexible benefits are beginning to attract interest from employers who believe they may be useful for the recruitment and retention of employees. Promoters argue that flexible remuneration arrangements are useful for multinational companies looking for ways to manage expatriate costs. Another argument is that companies can rid themselves of the perks-driven mentality of employees who come to expect certain entitlements as a right. The benefit for employees is that they can concentrate on channeling their pay into areas which they consider important with the employer providing some recognition and often administrative help with special needs. There is also a cost benefit according to Ginny Olds, head of Mercer's flexible benefits practice in the UK. She said: 'If people simply take a flat salary they cannot hope to reproduce the same benefits individually that can be obtained by their organisation which can get a group discount rate a lot cheaper than the individual could.' Originally in the US it took soaring health care costs for companies to take flexible remuneration seriously. Companies gave employees so-called pre-tax 'flex credits' which they could use to pay for health benefits. One of the first companies in the UK to introduce flexible benefits was the retailer BHS in 1990 when David Dworkin, the US-schooled department store specialist, was brought in as chief executive. Out of his US management baggage he plucked what were at the time comparatively unfamiliar ideas on flexible remuneration to give his top management more scope over the composition of their pay and benefits. What started with a scheme for 50 managers spread in April last year to all 400 managers who have company cars. An example of how it works at BHS can be seen from the way a typical package has been arranged for a manager earning Pounds 35,000. The cash value of his benefits is Pounds 8,115. With this he can choose between one and three times his salary level in life assurance cover, from four levels of private medical care and from four levels of annual holiday entitlement between 22 and 30 days. There is also free selection of a company car. In addition, there is the opportunity to buy long-term disability insurance, an optical cover plan which subsidises contact lens purchases and eye tests, and a dental care plan. Contractually he is entitled to the equivalent of 25 days' holiday, life assurance worth three times his salary, single cover health care and a Pounds 300 a month company car. If he wants more than that he can pay extra, deducted from his salary. If he wants less he can bump up his basic salary to the equivalent value, less the cost of holiday time. The only benefit the company insists that managers take is the minimum level of holiday. Sue Matthews, BHS's human resources manager, said the packages had proved popular. She said: 'It's a fairly progressive recruitment tool. To be honest, people love it.' At Scottish and Newcastle, the brewing company, a scheme was installed 18 months ago and tried initially among 70 or 80 employees with plans to extend it down through all 2,000 managers who have company cars. The scheme would allow an executive, earning say Pounds 50,000, to boost his salary to Pounds 60,000 a year by opting out of all benefits or to earn as little as Pounds 37,500 if he were to buy the optimum cover. The Scottish and Newcastle package covers 10 separate benefits, including the company product, allowing individuals to take wines and spirits as a flexible benefit. Both companies have steered clear of introducing flexible packages throughout their workforces, mainly because lower down the ladder there are fewer benefits, such as company cars, to play with. Mercury Communications, however, proposes to introduce flexible remuneration for its entire 10,000 UK workforce next January after it is tried on 400 employees starting this month. 'None of what we are doing involves expanding benefits. It is simply giving people more choice,' said Russ Watling, employee benefits manager. He said the company had decided that to tailor benefits to individual needs was the best way of spreading benefit costs. Retaining and recruiting staff was another positive aspect of the scheme. Some companies said they had consulted the Inland Revenue about the schemes but the Revenue itself said such schemes did not require overall approval. Tax would be paid on benefits in the normal way, it said. The Revenue appears reasonably ambivalent about the plans at present and has no plans to tax, say, the savings that can be achieved through a corporate rate as a benefit in kind. Matthews cautioned companies about getting too heavily involved in administration, particularly in the choice of company cars, but said her own company's scheme was capable of being administered by a single employee. Its use for negotiating between managements and unions remains largely unexplored, nor is it clear whether it will be a help or a hinderence to companies seeking to move towards harmonising pay and conditions among their workforce. Its popularity in the US, at least, means that the flexible benefit in remuneration can no longer be ignored.</p>

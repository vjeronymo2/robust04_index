			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dutch acquisition aids 27% advance at IWP IWP, the Irish industrial holding group, reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.7m) for the year to March 31, on turnover up 28 per cent to IPounds 121m. The result included a five month contribution from Levendaal Beheer, the Dutch toiletries and household products group which IWP acquired last October for IPounds 51.2m. Levendaal contributed IPounds 3.4m to the pre-tax line, which according to Mr Joe Moran, group chief executive, was ahead of expectations. Excluding the acquisition, the rest of the business suffered squeezed margins. Operating profits slipped 2.5 per cent to IPounds 12.7m on turnover up 9.5 per cent to IPounds 104m, although Mr Moran said that this was due exclusively to increased competition in the firelighters business, resulting from new entrants to the market. This was still making a good return on capital, however, and would not be disposed of, he said. The rest of the business - embracing personal care, household products and packaging - performed well, Mr Moran said. Gearing was 67 per cent (64 per cent) at the year end, but is expected to fall to 35 per cent by end-March 1995. Strategic priorities are on bedding in the Levendaal acquisition in the current year, before embarking on further substantial acquisitions, although Mr Moran said that modest bolt-on purchases in the UK and in Europe were under consideration for the core businesses. In the longer term, 'organic growth is limited' he said, and to achieve an ambition of doubling pre-tax profits over the next five years further acquisitions will be required which will financed out of cash flow and borrowings. Earnings per share were 34.5p (31.9p) and a final dividend of 4.75p is recommended, making a total of 8p (7.25p) for the year. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits in the region of IPounds 19m for the current year.</p>

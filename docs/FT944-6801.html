			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Privatisation lures cash to Russia Emerging markets funds have raised Dollars 300m (Pounds 182m) to take advantage of mass privatisation in Russia and its neighbours, marking a surge in interest by investors in the region. Placings by two new regional funds and one existing one have taken to more than Dollars 1.5bn the pool of financial investment earmarked for eastern Europe. Pictet, the Swiss private banking group, has attracted Dollars 56m for its First Russian Frontiers Trust, and gained the first London listing for a fund of its type. Trading in First Russian Frontiers, sponsored by stockbrokers Cazenove, begins tomorrow in London. On Wednesday the Barings group, which has raised Dollars 180m for its First NIS Regional Fund, expects those shares to be listed in Luxembourg. An established fund, Invesco's East Europe Development Fund, has expanded by tapping the markets for an extra Dollars 75m and trading in the new share issue began at the end of last week on the Irish Stock Exchange. The proliferation of east European regional funds is the most visible sign that investor interest has withstood the rise in international interest rates. General emerging market funds, hedge funds and even pension funds have contributed to a record flow of financial investment into Russia estimated at Dollars 500m a month. Gazprom, Russia's main gas producer, has hired Kleinwort Benson of the UK to sell a 9 per cent shareholding internationally. Such action by Russia's natural resource giants will draw in even more financial investment. Many of the earlier regional funds have weighted their holdings towards the more mature east European markets of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. But Russia's mass privatisation programme has produced a huge supply of equity at valuations that fund managers describe privately as 'laughably low'. The market capitalisation of the Russian oil sector values a barrel of proven reserves at 10-15 cents, compared with Dollars 7 in the US. The Pictet fund aims to invest 35 per cent in Russia and 25 per cent in the relatively unexplored Balkan duo of Romania and Bulgaria. The fund has scope to invest in more than 20 markets including locations such as Bosnia, Serbia and Azerbaijan. The Barings fund also targets Russia and the newly independent states of the old Soviet Union. 'It is very, very risky but the value is unparalleled in terms of what you see in other emerging markets,' said Ms Nancy Curtin, head of emerging European markets at Baring Asset Management. Invesco's East Europe Development Fund, which has the best recorded performance of any fund investor over one and three years, also plans to increase the Russian weighting in its portfolio.

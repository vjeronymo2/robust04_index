			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- A recent North Korean  defector said here on Monday that he chose to escape the North  because he couldn't stand worsening food conditions and tight  surveillance of him there.    Chong Ki-hae, age 52, told a press conference that food  rations in the North had consisted mainly of soy beans and corns  mixed with those grains reserved for livestock feeds until early  last year.    "Beginning last May, however, even these ceased to be  rationed. Our family had to live on potatoes alone in the past  six months," Chong said.    The defector, a repatriate from Japan, said he had earned  176  North Korean won a month as a work team head at the Unhung mine  machinery plant in Yanggang Province. He said that only about  60 percent of the wage had actually been paid, with which, he  said, it was extremely difficult to support his family. Because  of his being a repatriate, Chong said, he had been placed under  close surveillance by public security authorities for 30-odd  years since his repatriation from Japan in June 1960.    "Like me, all other repatriates had chosen to move to North  Korea at sugar-coated promises by North Korea," Chong said.  "They are leading miserable lives under the watchful eyes of the  security authorities."    The defector said he crossed the Tuman River into China on  Dec. 30 last year and stayed in Yanji for about 20 days before  reaching Pusan. He declined to say how he could come to South  Korea. Chong said his wife and five children are staying in  North Korea, adding that his father was born at Yongchon near  Taegu in South Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Interested Diet members of the ruling coalition  parties will start a new policy study group, "Study Group on  Japan's Security and Future Course [Nihon no Anzen Hosho to  Shinro wo Kangaeru Kai]," on 6 April. Yukihisa Yoshida,  Democratic Socialist Party member of the upper house, will be  the chairman of the group, and members will include Tatsuro  Matsumae, member of the Socialist Democratic Party of Japan  upper house; Hideaki Tamura, member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] upper house; and Natsuo Yamaguchi, memebr of Komeito  lower house. Moves, mostly initiated by Shinseito, to form study  groups across party boundaries on specific policy issues have  been quite active after a plan to form a "Policy Study Group" of  all ruling coalition parties to discuss overall policy failed to  take off. However, this will be the first time a policy group  on defense will be formed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>   [Text] Tianjin, 23 May (XINHUA) -- China attaches  importance to technological development, technological imports,  and technological transformation, and to the constant increase  in investments in those areas, and to markedly increasing the  percentage of domestic-made equipment, so they will play a  greater role in economic construction. Today, Xu Penghang,  State Economic Restructuring Commission vice minister, made the  above remarks.    Ten years ago, China set the strategic goal of manufacturing  major technological equipment at home, and in line with the  state long-term development plan, decided on 15 special research  projects centering on energy, transportation, raw material  sectors including complete technological equipment for large  open-cut coal mining, large-scale thermal power stations, an  ultra high tension power transmission and transformation  project, the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex's second stage  project, large chemical fertilizer plants, a 300,000-tonne  ethylene plant, the Daqin Railway, and desert oil drilling.  Because the state attaches importance to these projects, great  cooperation among relevant departments, provinces, and  municipalities; joint efforts by thousands of enterprises,  institutions, and by hundreds and thousands of scientific and  technological personnel; and through the integration of  technology and trade and through importing and assimilating  technologies, China has gradually mastered the key technologies  and built production bases for a number of major technological  equipment.    So far, 40 complete sets of major technological equipment  have been completed, commissioned, and applied in some 50 key  construction and technological transformation projects. For  instance, Beijing's electron-positron collider has been  operating smoothly and reliably over the last several years, has  been highly evaluated by international high-energy physics  circles, and has been made public to the outside world. A  complete set of single bucket-wheel excavator technology for  open-cut mining, capable of producing 10 million tonne output  annually, has been promoted at the Nanfeng Iron Mine and  Huolinhe Coal Mine and was exported to Pakistan, where it was  well received. Both the electron-positron collider and the  single-bucket wheel excavator technology won the State  Scientific and Technological Progress Prizes. Through  technological imports and joint ventures, large capacity  generators for thermal power stations, thirteen 300,000 kw  generators in all with over 90-percent domestic-parts, have been  completed, commissioned, and have begun transmitting power. In  addition, two 600,000 kw generating sets for thermal power  stations, with over 80-percent domestic-made parts, have been  commissioned at the Pingxu Power Station and have begun  transmitting power, thus ranking China among the world's leaders  in designing, manufacturing, installing, testing, and operating  large capacity generating sets for thermal power stations. In  the area of large metallurgical equipment, China is now capable  of designing and manufacturing international advanced level  large continuous slab casting machines. As for chemical  equipment, a capability of annually producing 240,000 tonnes of  phosphamidon, has been installed in areas including Nanjing. A  complete set of equipment, with over 80-percent domestic-parts,  capable of annually producing 200,000 tonnes of synthetic  ammonia, has been installed at Sichuan Chemical Plant and begun  operation.    It has been learned that the State Council recently decided  to disband the State Council's Leading Group for Major  Technological Equipment and transfer its functions to the State  Economic Restructuring Commission. The Commission will be  charged with managing major domestic-made equipment and with  formulating an annual plan for manufacturing domestic-made major  technological equipment. The purpose is to make use of the  Economic Management Department's comprehensive functions to  further promote enterprises' technological progress.</p>

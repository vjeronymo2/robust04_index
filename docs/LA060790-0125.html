			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELIEF IN GODDESS FAILS TO SPARE STORE  </P> <P> Offerings to the Hawaiian volcano goddess failed to save the Kalapana Store  &amp; Drive-Inn, which succumbed Wednesday to lava flowing from Kilauea  Volcano.  </P> <P> Owner Walter Yamaguchi, 82, had proclaimed that his store would be untouched by  the lava because of his special relationship with the volcano goddess Pele.  </P> <P> But, before dawn, a lava finger extending from the flow engulfed the building,  Civil Defense officials said.  </P> <P> "Well, what can you do?" Yamaguchi said. "Pele, she made me collect the  insurance. If no burn, I don't collect."  </P> <P> No other structures in the now-deserted community were hit Wednesday as lava  continued to pour from the Kupaianaha vent at a rate of 650,000 cubic meters a  day, officials said.  </P> <P> Lava flowed into the ocean near the site of the Puna Canoe Club.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGHS IN 70S END FIVE DAYS OF TORRID HEAT  </P> <P> Southern California's five-day heat siege came to an end Sunday, allowing  residents to again take up some of the things they had put off because of the  torrid weather.  </P> <P> Temperatures that had climbed into the 100s for four consecutive days last week  and hovered in the 90s on Saturday peaked with a Civic Center high of 77  Sunday. Highs on Monday were similarly expected to reach the mid-70s.  </P> <P> When Toni Forge awoke Sunday morning, she decided to choose an outfit she had  been unable to wear since a record-shattering heat wave started its reign of  terror in Southern California last week.  </P> <P> She wore a pair of long pants.  </P> <P> For Forge, 25, the end of the heat wave meant having the luxury of going around  in something other than shorts. "Last night was the first night I slept with a  blanket and today is the first day I looked forward to going outside," she said  as she strolled through Exposition Park.  </P> <P> But the lower temperatures did not deter Southern Californians from descending  on the oceanfront. About 500,000 people visited beaches stretching from Malibu  to Cabrillo, according to Los Angeles County lifeguards.  </P> <P> County lifeguard Bill Powers, supervisor of a beach area stretching from Marina  del Rey to Topanga Canyon, said he was glad to see the heat wave end. "When  you've got two lifeguards looking at upwards of 7,000 people, lost kids whose  parents you're trying to locate (and) accidents on the bike path behind you,  it's hard," he said. "Just having the breeze makes things a lot easier because  people are less tense."  </P> <P> Sunday had just enough warmth and cooling relief to satisfy lovers of both  extremes. It was still warm enough for Valerie and John Krugh, members of the  Alta Loma-based New Song Church, to be baptized in an outdoor hot tub in San  Dimas without the managers having to turn on the heat.  </P> <P> And it was cool enough to give the Foster's Freeze at the corner of 16th Street  and Pico Boulevard its first slow day in almost a week, and for beach-goers to  exchange their shorts and sandals for jeans, light jackets and bare feet.  </P> <P> Authorities said the heat took a lethal toll on the region before it receded.  Police said a 56-year-old transient, identified as Phillip Cannon, died of heat  exhaustion and dehydration in his car Friday in front of a Simi Valley  restaurant.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE BIG GAME;  </P> <P> MEETING RBV WILL TEST MORSE'S METTLE, MEMORY  </P> <P> John Shacklett knows that 18 players on his team have last year's 3-A San Diego  Section semifinal loss to Rancho Buena Vista etched into their memories.  </P> <P> A 56-36 score does not fade quickly.  </P> <P> "The kids want to go after them real bad simply because (RBV's) a good,  competitive team," said Shacklett, entering his 20th season Morse's coach.  "Sure, they remember last year, and I'd be foolish to say they didn't."  </P> <P> And if anyone else remembers -- and is aware of how good these teams are this  year -- they might be foolish to skip tonight's game at 7:30 at Mesa College.  Rancho Buena Vista is ranked No. 1 in the county, Morse No. 2.  </P> <P> Although Morse scored a 55-13 victory two weeks ago against Punahoe, Hawaii,  this weekend officially kicks off the San Diego high school season. There's no  better way to begin a year than by watching two teams that were 11-3 last  season charge headlong into each other.  </P> <P> They met under the same circumstances at the beginning of last season, and RBV  won, 35-20. After it was discovered RBV used an ineligible player -- a freshman  -- it became one of two Longhorn forfeits. And then there was the semifinal  game, which RBV won by 20 points.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see Rancho and Morse play every year," Shacklett said. "I think  it's good for high school football, and it could develop into a healthy  rivalry."  </P> <P> The components are there for this to become one of the county's great ones:  </P> <P>  -- A city team vs. a North County team. There's little doubt the City Eastern  and Palomar are the two best leagues in the county.  </P> <P>  -- Two coaches, Shacklett and Craig Bell, who have enormous respect for each  other and from their colleagues.  </P> <P>  -- Winning programs. RBV is entering its fourth year and has won back-to-back  section titles, the 2-A in 1988, the 3-A in 1989. Morse has been to the 3-A  finals the past three years and is vying for its second title in four years.  </P> <P>  -- Talent. Morse has quarterback Teddy Lawrence, who passed and rushed for  nearly 3,000 yards last year and had a hand in 19 touchdowns; his skill and 3.5  grade-point average make him one of the nation's top 100 recruits. RBV has  Markeith Ross. Only four players in section history have gained more than 2,000  yards rushing, and Ross was one of two in the same backfield last year.  </P> <P> "I'd be very surprised if these two teams aren't in the stadium this year  (playing for the championship)," Shacklett said.  </P></p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Bonds: EBRD makes its debut in Australian dollar sector THE EUROPEAN Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday launched its first Australian dollar bond issue, the first of a planned ADollars 750m borrowing programme. The ADollars 300m, 10-year issue was structured as a global issue. The registered bonds were sold in the Australian domestic market, but were also distributed in Europe, the US and Asian markets. The EBRD lends to promote economic development in eastern Europe and has no natural requirement for Australian dollars. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate Ecu and will be held on deposit or in liquid financial instruments until required for loans. The decision to borrow in the Australian market was partly driven by poor market conditions in Europe caused by concern over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Anders Ljungh, EBRD vice-president for finance, commented: 'Our natural habitat is the Ecu market and some of the higher-yielding currencies of Europe. However, conditions are such that we will have to look further afield.' The 9 per cent paper priced to yield was 12 basis points more than Australian government bonds. The pricing was initially seen as tight by some participants in the deal, but there was buying interest from a range of institutional investors. The bonds were structured to mirror the payment and redemption dates of the benchmark 10-year Australian government bond issue. Many institutions viewed the paper as a proxy for government debt. The EBRD is owned by European governments and carries a top triple-A credit rating. In addition, it is a less frequent borrower than other top-rated supranational borrowers such as the European Coal and Steel Community and the World Bank. Having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 100.174, the bonds were quoted at 100.18 bid, for a yield spread of 8 basis points over government paper. Elsewhere, Hydro Quebec priced its CDollars 1.2bn, 30-year global bond issue to yield 85 basis points more than Canadian government bonds, at the tighter end of the indicated range. Participants in the deal reported strong buying from European investors, although the long-dated maturity appealed more to North American institutions. Salomon Inc, the parent company of the US investment bank, raised its first public funding in the Euromarket since being implicated in malpractice in US Treasury bond auctions. The company raised Dollars 300m three-year funding from an issue of auction rate notes. The senior notes carry a margin of 55 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate, but this will be re-set through a regular auction process. The structure is similar to the long-date, subordinated variable rate notes issue by banks in 1990 and 1991, but contains additional investor protection. If an auction fails - if all investors try to sell their bonds at once, for example - the margin reverts to 200 basis points over Libor. If two auctions fail, investors can put the bonds back to the issuer. Under the VRN structure, the bonds continue to trade at the fall-back margin until an auction is successful. From the issuers perspective, the structure allows the cost of funding to fall through the life of the issue. Salomon is widely perceived as an improving credit. This week its credit rating was raised by one notch to A+ by IBCA, the credit rating agency. Nationwide Building Society has had its Aa3 credit rating confirmed by Moody's Investors Service, having been under review for three months.</p>

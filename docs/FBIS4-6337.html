			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Authorities  seized 12 firearms, including a machine gun and two grenade  launchers, from Vietnamese fishermen who encroached into  Malaysian waters since 1990. Fisheries Department Marine  Division Chief Abdul Hamid Shukor said among the weapons seized  were two AK-44 assault rifles, five AK-47s, four M-16s, one Uzi  sub-machine gun with 656 rounds of M-16 ammunition, 13 rounds on  40mm ammunition, 493 rounds of AK-47 ammunition and 35 grenades.    He said 339 fishermen and 32 boats were detained since 1990.    Abdul Hamid said two AK-44 assault rifles and a grenade  launcher was found hidden in a Vietnamese fishing boat last  month.    From now onwards all foreign fishing boats will be  thoroughly  checked, he said at a press conference here Tuesday.

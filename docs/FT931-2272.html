			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wrong advice on tenancy I HAVE BEEN told that one should not re-let property under an assured shorthold tenancy to an existing tenant as the right to repossess at the end of the lease will be lost. Is this true? This is incorrect. Section 20 (4) of the Housing Act 1988 provides that when the fixed term of an assured shorthold tenancy comes to an end, a new assured tenancy will remain an assured shorthold tenancy if it is granted to the same tenant. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Drive to make cuts in budget fizzles out A high-powered commission set up to reform entitlement spending and taxation fizzled out yesterday, unable to agree on a set of concrete proposals to bring the US government's finances into balance in the next century. The bipartisan commission, chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey and retiring Republican Senator Jack Danforth, agreed in August on an interim report painting a stark picture of spending on entitlements such as social security pensions or Medicare and Medicaid health programmes. They forecast that such spending would rise from 47 per cent of the budget in 1993 to eat up all government revenues by 2030. But Mr Kerrey and Mr Danforth were unable yesterday to win support for their proposals, which included an increase in the social security retirement age to 70, reduced subsidies for Medicare health benefits for the elderly, and means testing for benefit payments. Commission members shied away from voting for tough cuts in such politically sensitive programmes in what congressman Alex McMillan of North Carolina called 'the current rush to provide more free lunches which is now abroad in the land'. Senator Dale Bumpers, another commission member, said the political climate was not yet right: 'We all know that the problem is not unsolvable, it is just politically unpalatable to do it.' Economists and Federal Reserve officials had hoped that the Kerrey-Danforth commission might provide political cover for a Congress which has always been unwilling to touch entitlement spending such as social security, Medicare or veterans' benefits, which have large and politically vocal constituencies. Relatively modest changes to benefits and eligibility could, if launched now and phased in gradually, have curbed the growth of entitlement spending in the next century. In the wake of last month's sweeping Republican election victory, Congress is expected to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget within seven years.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: How old is your boardroom? - National age differences among executives The US tends to have the oldest company directors. Germany's are marginally more geriatric than the French, while Britain vies with Sweden for the youngest boardroom blood. These are the main findings of a survey* by Accord Group, an international executive search firm, aimed at identifying the age range of those running top companies in five of the leading western economies. 'If there was a surprise it was that the differences are not actually that great,' observes David Dumeresque, a partner in London-based Tyzack &amp; Partners which carried out the UK part of the research and which is a founder member of Accord. 'The idea was inspired by the fuss about Lord Weinstock's age over the summer which made us curious as to whether he is old in relation to directors of companies elsewhere.' Accord looked at the 100 UK constituents of the FT-SE 100 Index, with the top 50 scrutinised in France, Germany, Sweden and the US. Based on the most recent returns or report and accounts individual directors were placed into one of four categories: non-executives; senior executive directors (that is, executive chairman, chief executive, managing director); finance director; and 'other' (all other executive directors whatever their responsibility). The conclusions by country were as follows: UK. Senior executives tend to be in their 50s and early 60s with Lord Hanson (72) the most aged and Archie Norman of Asda (40) the most precocious. UK finance directors were among the youngest in the sample, with half being under 50, the oldest 61, and the youngest (BTR's Kathleen O'Donovan) a mere 36. Only about 10 per cent of UK executive directors remain in post after their 60th birthday, but the majority of non-executives are into their seventh decade. The oldest non-exec is Lord Forte (84), the youngest is 40-year-old Louise Patten (Ladbroke). US. While the average age of boards is relatively high, executive directors tend to resign earlier than in other countries. The majority of non-execs are over 64, though the oldest (75-year-old John E Tate of WalMart) is a stripling by international standards. The majority of American senior executives are over 60, though the oldest (T Marshall Hahn Jr of Georgia Pacific) is only 68, younger than in both France and the UK. US finance directors are also somewhat older than their opposite numbers in other countries with a mean age of 60. France. Most categories of directors are at about the mid-point on Accord's international scale. Although the oldest non-exec in France is 85 (Gabriel Mathey of Casino) the majority are in their 60s. France has the distinction of the oldest senior executive - 76-year-old Antoine Riboud of Danone. Germany. The country with the oldest non-exec (88) and oldest executive director (an 87-year-old at Holzmann) in the survey. Over half the non-execs were in excess of 64 and more than 25 per cent over 68. Senior executives tend to be in their early 60s, but they also retire early with only 10 per cent over 65. German finance directors were the oldest in the survey after the Americans. Sweden. Directors here are the youngest in every category, with half the non-execs aged less than 56 and 75 per cent under 62. Ninety per cent of senior executives are less than 59 with only a quarter more than 56. Fredrik Sandelin of Ratos is the youngest finance director in the survey at 32. As for lessons, Dumeresque is dubious. 'There is no right age,' he says. 'You can find someone completely past it and burnt out at 60, but there are plenty of strong, vibrant 75-year-olds.' On the other hand, he adds, 'it does help to be called Hanson' (a reference to the survey finding that the family also boasts the youngest UK executive director in 33-year-old Robert). *Not publicly available but details can be discussed on request.</p>

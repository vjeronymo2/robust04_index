			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Theories behind feel-bad factor ECONOMISTS offer varying theories to explain the growing despondence about unemployment disclosed today in the MORI poll for the Financial Times. Industrial, international and labour market analysts were asked to explain why more than half of the 855 people surveyed in July were anxious about losing their jobs over the next 12 months even though the official unemployment figure was on a downward trend. Mr John Philpott, a director of the Employment Policy Institute, an independent think tank, said: 'People see colleagues losing their jobs and feel the threat's still there.' He also pointed out that the 'little period of semi-euphoria' that greeted last month's good indicators had been replaced with gloom in the media about the recovery faltering. He said that surveys gauged confidence; and that confidence was affected by the 'gloss' placed on economic news by the press. At the heart of people's fears was the fact that their circumstances had not perceptibly changed since the government declared the recession officially at an end, he said. Real wages had not gone up. Mr Angus Armstrong, international economist at investment bank Morgan Grenfell, said that the gloom and uncertainty was partly caused by the political 'fiasco' in Britain and concern about the ERM. After the general election in April last year people expected a sharp turnaround in the UK economy, and had been disappointed. The latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry, meanwhile, had confirmed that after a couple of encouraging early summer months the 'steam had gone out of demand and activity'.</p>

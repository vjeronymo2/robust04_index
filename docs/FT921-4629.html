			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / The European Market: West hides behind Polish tariffs - Car makers show protective instincts POLISH manufacturers who have seen domestic markets eroded as a result of foreign competition never tire of appealing to the government for more protection. Lately though their case has been strengthened as they have watched western car makers exhibiting similar instincts in talks on investment deals in Poland. After all, it was GM Europe which asked Poland to introduce a 35 per cent import tariff on cars as a condition of establishing its joint venture with Warsaw's ailing FSO plant agreed two weeks ago. And Fiat, which is still negotiating the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in the FSM plant in southern Poland, where its new Cinquecento model is being produced, is not averse to taking advantage of the resulting tariff wall that came in at the start of the year. The EC reluctantly agreed to let the Poles raise the duty on cars from last year's 15 per cent to 35 per cent and included this in Poland's association agreement which aims to liberalise trade in industrial goods by the end of the century. At the same time Brussels insisted that the tariff be gradually reduced to zero over the next ten years. It also got a duty free import quota of 30,000 cars from EC producers out of the Poles, thus effectively excluding Japanese manufacturers. Under the initial agreement with the Poles, GM will assemble up to 35,000 Opel Astra models a year at FSO and will examine the possibility of producing a new model there to replace the outdated FSO Polonez. However, much of GM's Dollars 75m investment could well be financed through increased sales volumes in Poland under the duty free quota. Indeed earlier talks with GM before Christmas broke up without agreement when the outgoing Polish government decided that the revenues it would forego by giving GM the 40 per cent of the duty free import quota it wanted would be greater than the Dollars 75m GM was willing to put on the table. But the present centre-right government under Mr Jan Olszewski, which is keen to prove it wants western investment, decided to go ahead, trusting to GM's assurances that there would be more investment in FSO in coming years. In January Mr Adam Glapinski, the new foreign trade minister, decreed that one third of the quota should go to Fiat, a third to GM and the rest to Volkswagen, on condition that each invested at least Dollars 50m in production capacity in Poland. VW is negotiating a joint venture with FSR, a small pick-up plant near Poznan where it would assemble the Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up now being built in Hanover. The quota decision effectively soaked up the market for new imported cars. Although Poles imported about 300,000 used vehicles from abroad last year, the number of new models sold in the country through recognised dealer networks amounted to no more than 28,000. The decision also raised howls of protest from French manufacturers who had planned to boost their sales in Poland this year and had spent heavily on developing retail and service networks. The French government got Brussels to suspend the car trading clauses in the association agreement pending talks aimed at getting Mr Glapinski's decision changed. The talks will take place this month. Meanwhile Renault is pointing out that it is investing 'over Dollars 50m' in a retail network with a view to increasing sales in Poland from last year's 1,600 vehicles to an ambitious 15,000 cars this year. Citroen, whose offer to invest in FSO was deemed less attractive than GM's, is in a similar position. Mr Jacques Calvet, chief executive of the Peugeot group which includes Citroen, said the company was continuing to pursue a joint venture with FSO, despite the memorandum of understanding with GM. Peugeot was also negotiating a separate joint venture with FSC, a small van maker, for the possible assembly of the Peugeot 405 large family car in Lublin, he said. Mr Xavier Karcher, head of the Citroen division, said the company was negotiating with FSO with a view to assembling the Citroen BX in Warsaw as a replacement for the FSO Polonez in direct competition with the plan by General Motors to develop an Opel car to replace the old Polish car range. Mr Karcher insisted that Citroen could still win a deal with FSO for the more ambitious second stage of the modernisation of the FSO facilities.</p>

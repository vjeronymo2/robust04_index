			<p>BFN     [Text] As has been reported, at about 1030 on 15 April, at  Borshi Bay, Albanian coast guard forces detected and detained  the Greek ship Aios Vasilios while it was sailing about 2 miles  into Albanian territorial waters. An hour later a Greek warship  approached the fishing ship apprehended by our forces.    The Albanian torpedo-boat notified the Greek warship of  having entered Albanian waters and urged it to leave. The Greek  warship left only after one hour.    Concerning this provocation by the Greek side, the Embassy  of  the Republic of Albania in Athens sent a note, in the name of  the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania, to the Foreign  Ministry of Greece, asking the Greek Government to put an end to  such actions, which impair the relations between the two  countries and increase tension, by designating them as a  continuation of previous Greek provocative actions and of the  criminal event in Peshkepi in Gjirokaster village on 10 April  1994.    The provocation in our territorial waters does not help but  prevents the creation of the minimal necessary conditions and  runs counter to the proposal by the Greek side itself to hold a  meeting with the working groups of the Public Order Ministries  of the two countries, the Albanian note ends.</p>

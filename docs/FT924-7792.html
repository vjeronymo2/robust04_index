			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Strong US retail sales lift hopes US retail sales rose faster than expected last month, prompting hopes that domestic demand might at last spur the sluggish US economy into recovery, George Graham writes in Washington. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased by 0.9 per cent in October to reach a level 5.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Some of the increase appears to have been stimulated by sales of furniture and building materials in the wake of the hurricane that hit Florida and Louisiana, but economists noted solid gains in car and clothing sales. Consumer prices also rose faster than expected in October, climbing 0.4 per cent to yield a year on year inflation rate of 3.2 per cent - up from 3.0 per cent in September. Most economists, however, regarded the rise as a blip unlikely to signal any break in the general disinflationary trend seen not only in the US but around the world. The increase stemmed partly from a sharp rise in air fares, after months of price wars in the airline industry, but also from costlier housing and fuel costs. However, the housing market remains torpid. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes in the third quarter were 5 per cent lower than a year earlier.</p>

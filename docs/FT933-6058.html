			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Supply, demand and scientists and the dire implications for the country's competitiveness - have been a feature of the British Association annual meeting for at least three decades. A particular theme this year at Keele is that the UK is producing too few trained scientists and breeding a scient-ifically illiterate younger generation. The sharp decline in numbers taking science A-levels is causing alarm. So is the glaring contrast between empty places on university science courses and serious overloading in the arts and social sciences. And in the background is a sense of anticlimax following the science white paper three months ago; although it contained some good ideas, the government has not built on the opportunity it created to lead the case for British science. The debate about how to attract more bright young people to the subject  - and at the same time increase public understanding of science - contains so many strands, knitted together by so many people over such a long period, that it is sometimes hard to disentangle prejudice, anecdote and special pleading from soundly based argument. For example, if it were true as alleged that the British education system had systematically, over many years, produced fewer scientists than business and academia needs, there is no doubt that their price would rise. And yet evidence from the UK job market points to a higher graduate unemployment rate in science than in arts and yields abundant evidence of poor salaries in scientific research. Manifest shortages do exist, but only in well-defined areas, such as top quality pharmaceutical scientists for the drugs industry. Fundamental issue There does not seem to be too much point in increasing the supply of scientists, if there is no demand for them. But that, of course, raises the question of whether Britain is using as many scientists as it should. Apart from the fundamental issue of the relative size of its research and development effort, where Britain lags, there is the well-documented shortage of scientists in the upper reaches of management in British companies, as well as in the public sector. Research recently sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council suggests that companies perform better if they have senior managers with scientific backgrounds. Here the government is in a position to help - by making the civil service give a higher priority to science graduates when recruiting administrative trainees. This might also improve government's skill in handling the wide range of policy issues that touch on science and technology, from reprocessing nuclear waste to investing in new trains for British Rail. Primary focus On the supply side, action is certainly needed at all levels of the educational system, with perhaps a primary focus upon the 11 to 15 age range. Strong anecdotal evidence suggests that many older scientists working today were inspired originally by excellent science teaching in the early years of secondary school. Those teachers have retired and their successors are, on the whole, less inspiring; so the current generation of schoolchildren is being turned off science by dull lessons that seem both pointless and more difficult than other subjects. The government's bursary scheme for trainee science teachers is beginning to turn the tide here, but better financial incentives are still required to attract good scientists to teaching. Further up the educational ladder, science would benefit from a broadening of the A-level system, so that all candidates studied at least one arts and one science subject to the age of 18. It should be recognised that such a change would increase the teaching burden on universities; most science students would start off knowing less than someone today with maths, physics and chemistry at A-level. It might even be necessary to add an extra year to many three-year undergraduate courses. Change to the A-level system is something which the government has vigorously resisted for years. If it is serious about bringing science and scientists to greater prominence in education and business, it will have to change its mind.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ARMENPRESS correspondent Garriy Galustyan for TASS] </F>   [Text] Yerevan April 11 TASS -- The situation in  Nagorno-Karabakh has once again worsened. Starting this morning  Azeri Air Force planes have attempted attacks on civilian. [as  received] Classes in educational institutions in Stenpanakert  have been suspended. According to reports received by  ARMENPRESS from the Nagorno-Karabakh army defence headquarters,  fighting continues in the northern sector of the front and the  Mardakert area. Karabakh forces are reported to be repulsing  enemy attacks.    The Nagorno-Karabkah leadership holds the view that by  inflaming the situation in the Karabakh-Azeri confrontation  zone, Baku is once again using brute force and challenging the  international community, which is making efforts to find a  peaceful solution to the conflict. The Azeri Army is engaging in  large-scale offensives on the eve of forthcoming high-level  peace talks for which the Russian Foreign Ministry is making  preparations, and on the eve of the next regular meeting of the  conference on security and cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk  group on Nagorno-Karabakh, which is opening in Prague today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Giacomo Ferrari: "Ivrea's Third War"] </F>   [Text] On the top floor of the building in Via Jervis in  Ivrea, the historic headquarters of Olivetti, the top managers  have already called it a "genetic mutation" to stress its  revolutionary aspect and identify the new industrial period. It  is destined to characterize the company of the year 2000.    It is not the first time that this image has been used to  define what Olivetti has been doing. It was first used when  Olivetti moved from mechanics (typewriters and traditional  calculators, older people will remember the mythical Divisumma)  to electronics. It was used for the second time when Carlo De  Benedetti was making his greatest stand and the company made its  dynamic entry into computer science. And the third? "It has  just started," they explain at Ivrea. So much so that it has  not taken on a definitive form yet. But the road is open. And  it is the road of multimedia, that is the road to an ever closer  integration of computer science and telecommunications.    It is easy to talk. In reality it is a sort of 180-degree  turn, that involves the same company culture, but that is quite  difficult to explain. The Olivetti management has tried to do  so on various occasions. For example when they decided to  participate in the race to become the second administrator of  the Italian cellular telephone network, and more recently when  they launched the "Domus Life" line onto the Italian market.  This is a personal computer that can receive television  transmissions, read audio and video CD-ROM disks, and connect up  with other users to exchange video games. It can even reproduce  the background music for "karaoke," the musical entertainment of  the moment. Ivrea is concentrating a lot of effort on this  product. According to the French newspaper LE FIGARO, there  will be a market for about 1.3 million of these machines in  Europe in 1996 when families throughout Europe will own a total  of 19 million personal computers. Olivetti hopes to sell  200,000 over the next two years.    But this turn in the direction of the new business is not  excluding others. In fact Olivetti will continue to build and  sell its traditional products, although this will be done within  a different organizational framework. The sectors have been  merged and subdivided in a new way to facilitate the application  of the new strategies. The Olivetti group is divided into four  large areas: products (personal computers, printers, office  equipment, and accessories); systems (complete information  packages, for example the networks used by banks and the post  office administration); services (maintenance, engineering and  customer assistance also for products produced by competitors);  finally, telecommunications and multimedia systems, with the  Omnitel consortium for cellular telephones which is 51-percent  controlled by Olivetti and which also includes the companies  Bell Atlantic, Swedish Telecom, and Shearson Lehman for the  financial part.    Many things are brewing, and the company is not keeping  these  projects tucked away in a drawer. On the contrary the draft  agreement signed with the unions on Monday, 17 January, on cuts  in production, discussed them at length. At least 20 of the 38  pages making up the document, which was signed by the minister  of labor, are dedicated to prospects and industrial strategies.    Olivetti intends making a new start based on its refound  "social peace". This peace has come at the end of a long period  of cuts in the work force; the group had 60,000 employees  throughout the world in 1989 and less than 37,000 remain today.  But the streamlining, together with all the other interventions  (financial, industrial and organizational), has been  insufficient to put the accounts of the holding company back  into the black. This is understandable in the light of the  dramatic situation of a year ago. The losses registered on the  balance sheet for the 1992 financial year totaled more than 650  billion lire. The same company sources recognize that in  effect, if it had not been for the reserves and the other  extraordinary accounts that have been utilized, the losses would  have totaled more than 800 billion lire. Furthermore, for the  second consecutive year there has been a fall in revenues, with  consolidated sales confined to eight trillion lire.  These are serious difficulties that reflect the serious  situation the computer science sector is still experiencing  throughout the world. Carlo De Benedetti has returned to manage  Olivetti himself and has recently called Corrado Passera to his  side as managing director. Together they have planned out a  therapy for recovery that has these three goals: 1) to start to  grow again, 2) to reinforce the financial position, 3) to  balance the accounts. This is all to be achieved in the  relatively short period of not more than two years.    Half of this time has already passed and perhaps the  schedule  needs to be updated, particularly as far as the income statement  is concerned. In fact the partial balance is only positive as  far as the first two aspects are concerned. Revenues have  started to rise again, and a few days ago the first unofficial  figures showed that at the end of 1993 consolidated sales had  reached 8.6 trillion, an increase of 7.5 percent. According to  the men from Ivrea, market quotas have been regained in Europe,  particularly in personal computers (also thanks to the  enrichment of the range of products, passing from one to four  lines) and, most important of all, the volume of sales has  increased enough to compensate for the drop in prices. Then the  devaluation of the lira has certainly helped as far as revenues  expressed in foreign currency are concerned.    The second goal, the financial one, has also been achieved.  Not that the situation was particularly difficult a year ago.  The relationship between debts and assets could have been taken  as balanced. But it was necessary to put "hay in the barn,"  also in consideration of the burden that was to come from future  cuts in the work force. Therefore, overcoming the skepticism of  many of his collaborators, De Benedetti launched an increase in  capital of 900 billion lire. An operation that the stock  exchange easily digested and that allowed Olivetti to reinforce  itself on this front too.    The third goal remains, that of achieving a balance. Here  the news is not so good. Without doubt there will be an  improvement resulting from the initiatives that ended during the  year, such as the dismissal of nonstrategic activities (from  Teknecomp to the Triumph Adler buildings in Germany). However,  the losses for 1993 will still be high. Analysts estimate that  the losses will be between 400 and 500 billion lire. So it is  unlikely that the forecasts made two years ago will be met. The  1994 financial year is all that remains to find budgetary  equilibrium again and objectively this is not long enough.    In any case, they have not lost hope in Ivrea, and they are  working to get as close as possible to this result. What  instruments are they using? At Olivetti they explain: "We must  increase the supply and then we must arrive on the market more  quickly. The average life of a product is six months today.  Furthermore, all the efforts are aimed at widening the offer.  This year we will produce 40 new personal computers and 50 are  planned for next year." But multimedia is the real challenge.  "The marriage between computer science and telecommunications  is the real business of the future. This is what the life of a  group like ours depends on." This is the third revolution.  Will De Benedetti and his team be able to happily lead the way  to this haven?</p>

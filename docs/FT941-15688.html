			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Sterling sharply higher The pound yesterday remained the focus of market attention after stronger than expected UK employment data, and growing scepticism about the likelihood of an early British rate cut, pushed the British currency sharply higher against the D-Mark and dollar, writes Gillian Tett. After breaching the DM2.60 level early in the session, it moved by more than 1 1/2 pfennigs over the course of the day to reach its highest level since the ERM crisis in September 1992. It gained a cent on the day against the dollar, which was little changed by the US producer prices index released yesterday. The UK employment data, which showed that the jobless total fell a provisional, seasonally adjusted 46,800 in December to 2.77m, down to 9.8 per cent from 10 per cent in November, took the market by surprise. Market forecasts had been around 20,000. The data triggered a rapid rally in the British currency. After closing at DM2.5944 in London on Tuesday, it pushed through the DM2.60 barrier early in the morning and then briefly hovered near DM2.6130 before finally closing at DM2.6072. Sterling also rose against the dollar yesterday, although dealers said its movements were primarily a by-product of trading between sterling and the D-Mark. It briefly touched Dollars 1.5050, before slipping back to Dollars 1.5013, up from the previous day's finish of Dollars 1.4913. The pound's initial rise was dogged by some controversy, after it staged a small rally against the D-Mark about 10 minutes ahead of the release of the employment data. But though this sparked rumours that figures might have been leaked, traders pointed out that the move might simply have been the result of one particular bank taking a view. With the unemployment data now reinforcing the market's confidence in the UK economic recovery, sterling is expected to rise further against a weak D-Mark. 'There is a good chance of seeing it at the DM2.65 levels soon,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, who predicts it could reach DM2.63 levels shortly. The only factor that could undermine sterling now, he said, would be a serious UK political upheaval. But since the UK is one of the few European countries not to have an election planned this year, he thinks this poses less of a threat than elsewhere in Europe. Sterling's trade weighted index closed at 82.9 per cent of its 1985 value, its highest since September 1992. Some dealers believe that the UK government might intervene if the pound rises much above DM2.65 to protect exporters. But after Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, yesterday said that the government was comfortable with existing monetary policy and 'unlikely' to cut rates, expectations of an early rate reduction receded. 'Many people did not believe the upside was very large, but now there is some revision going on about how high sterling can go,' said Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets. Interest rate scepticism was reflected in sterling futures, where the March contract fell to 94.63, its lowest level this year, compared to 94.81 on New Year's Eve. 'The market now thinks we are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle. We have been in a negative yield curve (in the UK money market) for a long time, but the signs are we could be moving into a positive one,' commented one money market dealer. Anticipation of today's US consumer price index ensured that the dollar continued to attract attention. Yesterday's producer price index figures, which showed that the PPI fell 0.1 per cent in December, were broadly in line with the market forecast. As a result the dollar remained fairly steady against the D-Mark and yen, ending at Y112.4 from a previous Y112.5, and at DM1.7366 from Tuesday's DM1.7398 close. In New York trading it finished at Y112.27 and DM1.7338. Dealers said the dollar was likely to remain bound in a narrow range against the D-Mark unless the Bundesbank signalled that it would cut interest rates or today's US CPI figure was significantly different from market forecasts. However, the release of revised figures showing that average West German inflation grew by 4.2 per cent in 1993, up from 4 per cent, again underlined the inflationary factors that are underpinning the Bundesbank's cautious monetary stance. The Bundesbank yesterday allocated DM75.5bn of securities repurchase funds at this week's tender at a fixed rate of 6 per cent. Today's repo is the first of two set at a fixed rate of 6 per cent at the Bundesbank council meeting last week. German call money rates yesterday remained steady, with call money traded within a range of 6.05 to 6.15 per cent. Conditions on the UK money markets eased yesterday after the Bank of England removed Pounds 1.413bn of the Pounds 1.6bn forecast shortage. Overnight money rates fell to 5 1/4 per cent. The Italian lira remained in the spotlight as markets awaited the outcome of the no confidence debate in the Italian parliament. In spite of concerns that fresh political scandal could undermine the lira, it marginally strengthened to L974.7 against the D-Mark, from a previous day's close of L978.4.  -----------------------------------------             POUND IN NEW YORK  ----------------------------------------- Jan 12           Close      Prev. close  ----------------------------------------- Pound spot      1.5035        1.4900 1 mth           1.5000        1.4868 3 mth           1.4953        1.4818 1 yr            1.4821        1.4674  -----------------------------------------</p>

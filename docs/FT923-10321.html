			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Letter: Conclusions confirmed about performance-related pay Sir, Correspondence on performance-related pay sparked by your reporting (Management, July 20) of work on incentive payments which we carried out for the National Economic Development Office and Institute of Personnel Management confirms two of our key conclusions. First, it is increasingly important to separate bonus payments relating to the achievement of agreed objectives from bonuses (much less likely now) which relate to the buoyancy of particular markets. To do otherwise risks sending entirely the wrong signals to employees. Second, many managers assert that PRP works, but few can prove that it does because hardly any organisations have effective monitoring arrangements. The best employers test to see that pay systems are having the desired effect. What we are seeing now is a growing questioning of PRP, in many cases because systems were installed without sufficient consideration. Those who are having problems should find out why their system does not work before they abandon it. The pay system may be wrong but it could just be the management system in which it sits. Too many expectations should not be placed on to payment schemes.

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Data General to axe 1,000 jobs as expected recovery withers DATA GENERAL, which last year showed signs of a recovery, yesterday said it may record an operating loss for the second quarter. In addition, the US minicomputer-maker announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs,  -almost one-eighth of its workforce - and would take a second-quarter charge of about Dollars 46m. The anticipated losses represent a setback in Data General's financial turnround. The company returned to profitability in fiscal 1991 after four years of heavy losses during which operations were severely cut and the company developed a new 'open systems' product line. Data General said that while revenues from its AViiON family of open systems computers continued to be strong, sales of its older line of proprietary systems had slowed. The company said that second-quarter revenues would be below industry analysts' projections. The company blamed competitive pricing pressures and a weak worldwide economy. The workforce reduction would be worldwide, with 'a significant number of administrative positions being eliminated within the company's international operations', Data General said. Neither the company's salesforce nor its research and development operations would be affected. 'This is a painful, but necessary, step,' said Mr Ronald Skates Data General president and chief executive. 'Competitive and economic factors are accelerating the need for companies both within and outside the computer industry to become more efficient. 'Data General is positioned both organisationally and strategically to succeed,' said Mr Skates. 'Our product strategy is correct. In addition, our financial position continues to be strong.' For the first quarter, Data General reported net income of Dollars 4m, or 12 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 294.8m, down from Dollars 12.4m, or 41 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 311.7m in the same period a year earlier. On Wall street yesterday, Data General's stock price closed at Dollars 9 1/8 , a fall of Dollars  1/8 . As recently as January, Data General was trading as high as Dollars 18 5/8 .</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Kyrgyz fear their tiny nation will fall into iron hands: MPs' warnings of democratic developments at least threatened, at worst crushed If the development of democracy in Kyrgyzstan has been threatened by the president's taking almost complete control over the country, the chances of its taking hold in the other former Soviet states of Central Asia are remote, and the 'realists' who increasingly claim it is not on offer anywhere in the post-Soviet world will add another scalp to their belts. Kyrgyzstan, whose population is small, natural resources minor and weight in the world negligible, had the highest of hopes, mainly because in President Askar Akayev it had a head of state who encouraged these ambitions. In a series of speeches, he established the image of an administration which, in contrast to the other four states in the region, was determined to embed the rule of law, to ensure press freedom and establish a fully functioning civil society. Largely for these reasons, the international financial institutions have committed more funds per head to Kyrgyzstan, in the form of support of the currency, assistance for restructuring the agrarian and industrial sectors and humanitarian aid, than to any other of the post-Soviet states. Thus, the country largely owes its present living standard and future success in restructuring its economy, and its abiding commitment to democratic development to foreign support. But on Tuesday the Kyrgyz parliament heard speaker after speaker warn that democratic development was at least threatened, at worst crushed. The cause was a series of moves either by Mr Akayev or attributed to him. First, the parliament was inquorate: only 125 deputies out of 323 were present. The rest, it was said, had been induced to stay away until a new parliament was created. Anticipating such a result, the president had asked the government to resign, arguing it had to do so because the constitution specified it could not outlast the parliament. He had called elections for a new parliament on December 24. This would be preceded by a referendum on October 22 to pass a constitutional amendment specifying a bi-cameral parliament of less than 100 full-time MPs. The session was the last futile meeting of a doomed institution. Further, the deputies argued that the president or his administration were afraid of allegations which would have been made of corruption, and, that since the legislature had been suppressed, the constitutional court not been appointed, and the executive under his control, President Akayev was on his way to being an autocrat. Further, three of Bishkek's newspapers did not appear that day. Svobodny Gori (Free Hills) had been suppressed some weeks before by order of the procurator after an appeal to him by the president. The other two, Politika and Res Publica, were more recent casualties. Bishkek is in the midst of its latest wrenching change, having been carved out of tribal societies by Soviet power in the 1920s. Its industrial output has fallen since the Soviet Union collapsed, dragging gross domestic product down by 19 per cent in 1992 and 16 per cent in 1993, with a similar fall expected this year. 'We supported democratic reform,' said a caller to a television phone-in to President Akayev. 'But give us the elementary conditions for living. Pay wages and pensions on time'. The small diplomatic community in Bishkek is concerned. For the envoys there, who have persuaded their governments that this was an oasis of open development, a wobble by Mr Akayev is a serious matter. They can find no good reason why he has forced a parliamentary crisis now, when parliament would have been dissolved next March. They fear a turn towards the authoritarian rule evident in neighbouring Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. In an interview, Mr Akayev repeated his continuing dedication to democratic development. The economy was showing real signs of recovery, he said. Inflation was the lowest in the Commonwealth of Independent States, at 1.7 per cent a month; the som, introduced in May last year, is the most stable currency, at 10.7 to the dollar. Farm reform had gone farthest, with most state and collective farms probably liquidated and private farms showing signs of higher output. Most small businesses were also private. Real incomes were rising and foreign investor confidence increasing. Until the end of the year, President Akayev will indeed be the only figure of authority. His claim that democracy is not just being preserved but deepened cannot be judged until the referendum and the elections have happened, and properly. On that depends his economy, his reputation, and the hope that Central Asia is not doomed to be ruled by iron hands.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic indicators  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        ------- Forecast ---------                             1993     1994    1995    1996    1997                             ----------- Percentage change ------- Real economic growth       -16.0     -6.6     0.4     2.7     4.7 Consumer prices           1366.0    108.2    30.6    12.7     6.6                            -------- Percentage of GDP ----------- External current account  deficit*                  -16.0    -12.3    10.9     9.8    -8.7 Overall budget deficit**    -8.2     -4.7    -3.5    -3.0    -3.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * excluding official transfers and interest obligations ** before grants  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMF  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

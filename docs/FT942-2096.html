			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Tea-tray travel Now that the Thais have found a purpose for redundant Thames river-buses, perhaps Britain's rail commuters might follow their practice regarding rail networks. In provincial Thailand, people use rail tracks for their personal transport, improvising their own rolling stock from wheels placed under a tea-tray-sized platform. Standing, they punt their way briskly down the line, with the help of a long pole. How many have not yearned to be their very own train driver? Imagine the advantages: fitness addicts would take to it like ducks to water. It might take a day to get into the City from Tunbridge Wells. But on Wednesdays at least it would avoid sitting in traffic jams . . .</p>

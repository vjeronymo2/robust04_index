			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 5 (XINHUA) -- A Russian Government  delegation is leaving for Malaysia today to sign a 615 million  U.S. dollar contract on the sale of 18 MiG-29 fighters to the  southeast Asian nation, according to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY.    The contract is expected to be signed in the Malaysian  capital of Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday [7 June], the last day of the  visit by the Russian delegation headed by First Deputy Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets.

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance breaks lower 10-year trend Sun Alliance has improved pay-outs for with-profits endowment policies over both 10 and 25 year terms, making it the first insurer to raise its 10-year pay-out so far this year. The company said the upturn in the UK equity market during 1993 allowed it to improve maturity values by increasing terminal bonuses, but it has cut reversionary bonuses, which are added to each policy annually and reflect the company's view of likely future investment returns. The pay-out on a typical 25-year policy, taken out by a 29 year old man paying Pounds 30 a month is Pounds 52,640, up 5.2 per cent from last year. The 10-year pay-out is Pounds 6,115, up 1.8 per cent. However, Sun Alliance's maturity values are still at the lower end of the scale: the comparative figures for General Accident are Pounds 65,604 and Pounds 6,567, and for Norwich Union Pounds 58,694 and Pounds 6,674.</p>

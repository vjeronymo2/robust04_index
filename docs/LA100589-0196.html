			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> EXPLOSIONS NEAR CSUF THOUGHT TO BE A PRANK  </P> <P> In what police are calling a prank, residents of the University Village  apartment complex near Cal State Fullerton were awakened at 4 a.m. Wednesday by  seven loud explosions.  </P> <P> A Fullerton police spokesman said no injuries were reported. Residents,  primarily students, called the police to the Oxford Avenue complex. When  officers arrived, they also heard explosions. They found nine plastic beverage  bottles -- seven of which had already exploded -- containing an unidentified  gas.  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff Department bomb squad defused two of the containers  holding the mysterious mixture. The gas had not been identified as of Wednesday  night. Police are looking for suspects.  </P> <P> The culprit did not apparently want anyone or anything to be hurt by the  blasts, officers said, because the bombs were placed far enough away from the  apartments to avoid injury or property damage.  </P> <P> Police officials speculated Wednesday that whoever mixed the chemicals must  have known that they would blow up after sitting for a while and probably did  it as a prank.  </P></p>

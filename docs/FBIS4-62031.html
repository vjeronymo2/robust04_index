			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Customs" rubric: "Russia </F> Insists on Standardizing Tariffs with Belarus and Imposes  Unfavored Nation Trade Status with Baltic States"]    [Excerpt] Anatoliy Kruglov, chairman of the Russian  Federation State Customs Committee, has said that Belarus failed  to bring its customs tariffs in line with Russian ones by 1 May  according to the treaty on the unification of the two countries'  monetary systems. Mr. Kruglov said also that a meeting of the  Russian and Belarusian customs committee chiefs would take place  next week, in which the Russian side is going to insist on  adherence to the treaty.    However, Mr. Kruglov thinks, "the unification of customs  systems" is proceeding best precisely with Russia's western  neighbor: Only joint efforts of the CIS countries' customs  services will make it possible to stifle smuggling. The CIS  council of customs agency chiefs, which was set up by nine  republics last December, has already reached agreements on the  prevention of the illicit export of cultural values and a  framework agreement on cooperation in customs matters. A  similar document is being drawn up on illicit drug trading. As  it insists on the integration of customs systems, Russia is  pursuing an even more serious objective -- it is simply unable  to set up and to control on its own the border that has emerged  with the near-abroad countries.    Regarding the Baltic states, things stand much worse.  According to Mr. Kruglov, Russia has begun to set up a "real  border" with the Baltic states. Moreover, both the Baltic  states and Russia have imposed "for political reasons" the  unfavored nation status in trade with each other. This means  that Russian tariff rates on the border with the Baltics will  double automatically, a move that will scarcely boost foreign  economic activity in the region.    Anatoliy Kruglov said that, as far as he knows, no new  changes in import tariff rates have been planned; he thinks that  "the golden mean" needs to be found in setting tariffs so that  they will be both protectionist but not "prohibitive." As a  matter of fact, the customs committee is not going to deal with  tariff policy, as it has delegated this function to the  customs-tariff council that is being set up within the Russian  Government. The fiscal side to the tariff policy, however, will  still fall under the committee's jurisdiction. [passage omitted]</p>

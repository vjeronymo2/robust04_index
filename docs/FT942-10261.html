			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: BSN puts new name on the table - Danone wants to expand across the globe What's in a name? For Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, France's largest food group, the answer is a great deal. Yesterday, the 75-year-old founder of the company announced that BSN would change its name to Danone, after its dairy and yoghurt products and the company's most important brand in an industry where brands are all-important. 'It is one of the most significant announcements I have made,' said Mr Riboud. 'I built BSN with my own hands.' The importance of the decision lies partly in a break with the company's past. Formed in 1966 through the fusion of two glass manufacturing companies, Boussois and Souchon-Neuvesel, the group moved rapidly into foods. In the past 25 years, it has risen to become the biggest in the sector in France, and the third-largest food group in Europe, with annual sales of FFr85.5bn (Dollars 622m). More significantly, however, the decision to become Danone reflects Mr Riboud's strategy of aggressively expanding in markets beyond Europe. 'The three letters that make up our name reflect its past more than its future. These initials are not well-known in the international arena . . . Danone is the second brand name in Europe after Coca-Cola, and my dream is to make Danone the Coca-Cola of the future,' said Mr Riboud. His ambition is to become a worldwide group through expansion in Asia, eastern Europe, Russia, and Africa. To illustrate these goals, the BSN chairman announced a string of investment and acquisition plans. In Russia, the company is to set up its first production plant there, called Danone Volga, in which it will hold an 80 per cent stake. In Brazil, it will take a 49 per cent stake in Campineira de Alimentos, the country's second-largest biscuit producer. In Morocco, the French group is to take 2.7 per cent of the capital in ONA, the country's leading food group. In Spain, it will take full control of San Miguel breweries, one of the country's largest brewers, in which it already has a 24 per cent stake. For Mr Riboud, such international expansion is essential to keep pace with the development of the industry. 'Since the beginning of the 1990s, the globalisation of the food industry has accelerated,' he says. This is attributed partly to the development of more international tastes by consumers and the growth of tourism. In this context, the emergence of worldwide distribution groups and television advertising have enabled the development of global brands. BSN, says Mr Riboud, has been left behind in the battle for name recognition. 'A recent survey showed our name was recognised by 93 per cent of people in France, but just 7 per cent in Italy and 5 per cent in Spain,' he said. In Malaysia, BSN is the name of a bank; in the US, the name of a textiles company; and in Japan, the name of a television network. 'We have a weakness,' he admitted. 'The weakness is our name.' Hence the decision to change to Danone, a brand which accounts for one-quarter of the group's sales and is present in 30 countries. 'It is an interesting move, which is in line with the decision of other companies, such as Heinz, to focus on a corporate name,' said Mr Sylvain Massot, European food and drink analyst at Morgan Stanley. However, if changing a name is relatively easy and cheap, becoming a global group is expensive and a great deal more complex. Mr Riboud admits to hiccups on the trail of international growth, citing the group's battle with its partner in India for control of Britannia, the Indian foods group, which was finally resolved last year. Industry observers point to the strain on management resources with BSN's programme of rapid expansion. 'The problem they face is that, as a relatively young company, they need to grow quickly to catch up with the Nestles and Unilevers of the world,' says one industry analyst in Paris. 'But this clearly costs money and is open to risks.' Mr Georges Lecallier, BSN vice-chairman, counters that expanding through the development of existing brands such as Danone limits the risks. And by establishing joint ventures and partnerships, existing groups supply first-hand knowledge on the local markets. On the financial front, Mr Christian Laubie, finance director, points to the health of the balance sheet, reinforced last year by a FFr3.5bn convertible bond issue. He says that cashflow, which reached FFr3.6bn after industrial investments last year, provides adequate scope for expansion through acquisition. Total net debt fell from FFr10.3bn at the end of 1992 to FFr8.6bn at the end of last year, giving a debt-to-equity ratio of 22 per cent. According to BSN, yesterday's deals will be easily absorbed. The FFr1.9bn to be spent on acquiring San Miguel, the biggest of yesterday's deals, is to be spread over a four-year period. The investment in Russia is described by Mr Riboud as 'light', with annual production of between 2,000 and 3,000 tonnes. 'We can build on it later,' he says. Given his ambitions, this is highly likely. 'We want to become a French aircraft carrier,' he said yesterday, referring to his expansion plans. Investors will hope that he can steer clear of the reefs.  ------------------------------------            SALES BY AREA  ------------------------------------ France                       46.4% Rest of Europe               21.5% Italy                        14.7% Spain                         8.8% Rest of the world             8.6%  ------------------------------------ FINANCIAL BRIEF (FFrbn)  ------------------------------------                          1993    1992 Sales                    70.1    70.8 Net Income                3.4     3.6 Capital expenditure       3.1     3.5 Market capitalisation at 31 December           63.4    60.6  ------------------------------------</p>

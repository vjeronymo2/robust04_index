			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 1 (XINHUA) -- More input into  agriculture has helped Anhui Province, one of China's key  agricultural producers, improve its farming conditions.    The province has built more than 4,500 reservoirs and dug a  network of river courses and ditches since the late 1970s when  the country began its rural reform.    At present, the province has brought 2.63 million hectares  of  farmland under irrigation, which may secure a good crop despite  drought or excessive rain.    "Science has played an important role in Anhui's  agricultural  development," a provincial official in charge of agriculture  said.    The Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences alone has since  1986 made 189 research achievements. Many of them have been  applied in production.    One survey shows that farmers in Anhui have spent 5.6  billion  yuan in purchasing farm machines.</p>

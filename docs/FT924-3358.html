			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and Options Trading A SQUEEZE in stock index futures led to a strong advance in the first half of the session before sizeable selling brought a decline in the afternoon, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in December opened firmly at 2,779, some 11 points above Friday's close and strong demand moved it quickly forward and it pulled the underlying cash market ahead. By noon, the December contract was trading at 2,792, which proved to be the day's high, with sentiment encouraged by favourable data on UK consumer credit for the month of October. It was however the weakness in the short sterling contract that led to a turnaround in the fortunes of the contract and it fell heavily, not only causing a decline in the premium, but led to falls in the underlying equities though some bargain hunting at the close was reported by dealers. December finished at 2,757, around 11 points below Friday's close and around its fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover was 7,571 contracts. In traded options, activity in the index options accounted for the bulk of the day's total turnover of 23,954 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 12,451 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE option saw business of 3,947 lots. In stock options Lonrho was the busiest with a total of 755 contracts. Asda traded 723 lots, followed by Shell which traded 633 contracts.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Graft and painting in 16th century Rome - Timothy Potts on a great artistic patron, Alessandro Farnese, who commissioned numerous paintings and buildings THE FARNESE were relative newcomers to the courtly circles of 16th-century Rome. But when one of their number - Alessandro Farnese the elder, alias Paul III - managed to attain the papal tiara, he did his utmost to ensure that they were there to stay . For all four grandsons he skilfully negotiated duchies or had them ordained as cardinals. In the case of his namesake Alessandro this was the only beginning: cardinal at 14, he was appointed a year later vice-chancellor of the Roman Church (a station only second to that of the pope himself). Miriad other honours and benefices followed and with them an income equivalent to one-tenth that of the whole Vatican. Even in Cinquecento Italy this was nepotism on a truly grand scale. Alessandro liked to boast that he owned the three most beautiful things in Rome: the Gesu, his palace, and his daughter Clelia. That two of these were buildings was no accident. Eager to follow the Farnese's political and ecclesiastical position (he vainly hoped one day to follow in his grandfather's footsteps), Alessandro lavished much of his phenomenal wealth on erecting and decorating his various episcopal residences, especially the Chancelleria, and his private villa outside Rome at Caprarola (a magnificent construction which many contemporaries praised above the Escorial), as well as a vast number of churches and other public monuments. Titian remarked: 'The fame so great of the great Cardinal Farnese resounds in the ears of the world in such a way that no one speaks of anything else'  -high praise, even if his tongue may have been silvered by the hope of finally getting paid. The sack of Rome by the forces of Charles V in 1527 had left much of the city in urgent need of reconstruction, presenting an opportunity for conspicuous piety in which Alessandro was not to be outdone, becoming the most prolific church builder of his day. His crowning commission, designed by Vignola, was the Gesu, the largest holy edifice of the time besides St Peter's and destined to be the blueprint for innumerable Jesuit churches the world over. Although no connoisseur of painting, Alessandro also made sure that his walls were decorated by the best: Vasari, Salviata, Taddeo and Frederico Zuccaro, Titian and El Greco. Alessandro seems genuinely to have enjoyed the company of scholars and artists, whom he cultivated and patronised in lavish style - indeed more lavish than many in post-Tridentine Italy thought appropriate. It was at one of his dinner parties in 1546 that the idea of a series of lives of the great artists was floated. Proposed by Alessandro's artistic mentor of the time, Paolo Giovo, it was another of his guests, Vasari, who was eventually prevailed upon by the assembled concensus to undertake the project - to the eternal gratitude of Renaissance historians ever since. The life and patronage of Alessandro, from his early interest in the decorative arts (the Farnese Hours and Cassetta Farnese) through the propagandistic celebrations of Farnese achievement in the palace frescoes to the sacral commissions of his more pious old age are ably expounded and documented, replete with references and editions of the original sources, in Clare Robertson's book. Despite its handsome, lavishly illustrated appearance, however, the text reads much like the doctorate from which it grew. Dense and comprehensive, its merits are those of scholarship rather than popularisation, a difficult metamorphosis to carry off for even as visual a subject as this. As the latest wave in a flood of patronage studies over the past 30 years (the watershed was Haskell's classic Patrons and Painters of 1963), this offering sounds a rather hollow note. What was patron X's 'taste' and how did it evolve? What influence did this have on his commissions? Issues which marked such a novel departure when first explored by Haskell, here have more the hackneyed tone of the examiner's favourite perennials. With Haskell, there was a feeling of important questions which just had not been asked before. With Robertson, one feels they are addressed from a sense of obligation, devoid of any intuition for what will get to the heart of this particular subject. The answers - 'he was generally more concerned with iconography than stylistic issues. . . His choices of architect. . . seem to be based on aesthetic criteria, though presumably considerations such as efficiency and speed of execution must also have been important' - are often unsurprising and sometimes unconvincing - 'The concern for impressive facades and piazzas in front of his churches. . . suggests that religious patronage was not simply motivated by piety' - leaving a prevailing feeling of sympathy that so much effort was expended for such slight returns. So why will we study patrons? Because, Robertson tells us, 'we may therefore increase our understanding of the constraints imposed on (the artist) during the process of creation. . . By isolating such influences the art historian may hope to understand more fully how the work of art was made. This will help us to better appreciate the artist's skill in responding to external limitations.' This is all very well, but it is not done. The artists are never reassessed, the loop is never closed. The early promises are left in an empty and unfulfilled rationalisation. Better surely, and more honest, simply to declare the importance of patronage in its own right to social history and indeed to catholic art history. As for Alessandro, it is an artist who should properly have the final word, especially when the verdict of of Michaelangelo himself is preserved: '(In France and Italy) you will find private individuals and lords who do not at this moment appreciate painting. . . like Cardinal Farnese, who does not know what a painting is, but who made very reasonable conditions for Messer Perino (del Vaga), simply so that he could be called his painter. . . in addition to paying him very well for his works'. A patron with more money than sense - what more could an artist ask for? 'Il Gran Cardinale': Alessandro Farnese, Patron of the Arts by Clare Robertson, Yale Pounds 35, 323 pages</p>

			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses take profits in post-holiday consolidation After a level day on Friday and a lot of excitement on Monday as the year-end rally appeared to resume, bourses fell on a round of profit-taking, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's DAX index hit an high of 2,253.98 on Monday, up 31.14, peaked at 2,284.56 early yesterday and closed 11.16 lower at 2,242.82, nearly a percentage point higher than when the holiday began. Turnover rose from DM8.95bn to DM10.45bn. One consistent feature of both days was the recovery in Metallgesellschaft, up DM17.30 on Monday, and another DM13.80 to DM291 yesterday for a two-day gain of 11.9 per cent on hopes that its new chairman, Mr Kajo Neukirchen, will be able to restructure it effectively. Sectors which saw continued gains included chemicals where BASF, up DM1 to DM301.80, and Hoechst, DM1.70 better at DM316.50, both hit new 1993 highs; and carmakers, where BMW and Daimler rose DM1 to DM717, and DM2 to DM822.50. BMW said yesterday that it would make a profit in 1993, and all four posted gains of more than 2 per cent on Monday. PARIS fell back, consolidating after setting its third consecutive high on Monday. The CAC-40 index ended 11.91 lower at 2,264.64 in turnover of FFr3.5bn. Insurers, actually or relatively weak on Monday, suffered further from fears of the impact on their results of severe flooding in northern and eastern France. UAP lost FFr16 at FFr640, AGF FFr11 at FFr688 and GAN FFr19 at FFr528. Euro Disney dropped another FFr1.35 to FFr29.05 after losing FFr2.80 on Monday, for a two-day drop of 12.5 per cent. Monday's slide reflected a report that banks were being offered 55 per cent of face value for Euro Disney debt. Yesterday, it was confirmed that minority shareholders had asked the French COB to look into changes in the company's accounting methods. MADRID lost Monday's gains and more, the general index closing 4.37 lower at 319.34. Banks were especially weak, with attention fixed on Banesto, suspended by the National Securities Market Commission at lunchtime, having lost Pta140 pesetas to Pta1,995 amid rumours that the Bank of Spain was looking into its accounts. The central bank's move to replace the board with a provisional administration, came after the market had closed. ZURICH's profit-taking brought to an end a rally over the previous six sessions, which saw a succession of record closes. The SMI index fell 41.7 or 1.4 per cent to 2,930.9. CS Holding, trading for the first time since the five for one share split, shed SFr28 or 3.2 per cent to SFr728. Other recent high-flyers suffered from profit-taking: Ciba-Geigy bearers eased SFr15 to SFr900. Swiss Re, still under pressure after its recent share split, closed SFr12 lower at SFr737. MILAN finished ahead but below session highs, as weakness elsewhere brought profit-takers in late. The Comit index added 3.74 to 617.93 as turnover picked up from Monday's L230bn, little more than a third of the daily average over the last month. The market balanced anxiety over potential delays in calling the general election against hopes of lower interest rates in coming weeks and the usual new year influx of retail demand. Montedison saw speculative interest from traders seeking to cash in on intra-day fluctuations, closing L16.40 lower at L882.60, after a day's high of L907.00. Banks found renewed demand: BCI added L55 to L5,236 in volume of 3.5m shares while Credito Italiano rose L19 to L2,295 in 6.7m. AMSTERDAM was lower as option-related business and selling by several German investment funds pulled prices back from Monday's record highs. The CBS Tendency index shed 1.70 to 148.10. Publishers, recently outperformers, were hit hardest. Wolters Kluwer sagged Fl 4.00 to Fl 124.50 in fair volume as CLN Oyens &amp; Van Eeghen downgraded the share from a buy to a hold. VNU shed Fl 1.60 to Fl 173.90 and Elsevier lost Fl 2.70 to Fl 182.20. ABN-Amro eased 20 cents to Fl 70.70 amid market rumours that a US investor was about to sell 2m of the bank's shares. COPENHAGEN's KFX index added 1.34 or 1.3 per cent to 106.65 as strong demand emerged in a market with a dearth of sellers. Novo Nordisk put on DKr12 to DKr662, with Sophus Berendsen B DKr10 up at DKr534. ATHENS jumped in heavy, across-the-board trading as continued strength in building stocks led shares higher. The general index closed 25.17 or 2.8 per cent higher 935.17 in turnover of about Dr7.2bn, almost twice last week's daily average. BRUSSELS, closed on Monday, caught up with the Bel-20 index closing 11.13 higher at a new high of 1.473.53, in turnover of BFr1.66bn after a cut its central bank rate by 15 basis points to 7.25 per cent. WARSAW reflected selling pressure almost as dramatically as the buying which it has soared on this year, the WIG index falling by 1,057, or 8.2 per cent from its record high to 11,761 in fairly average turnover of 1,350bn zlotys.

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 KILLED IN ATTACK ON HIGH-STAKES TEXAS DICE GAME  </P> <P> Masked men wearing camouflage clothes and ski masks burst in on a high-stakes  dice game and opened fire Monday, killing four people and wounding three.  </P> <P> The gunfire erupted at the Glass Key Cafe, a bar in a poor neighborhood known  to police as a gambling and drug hangout and the scene of a similar attack last  October.  </P> <P> Four men broke into the game, shouted "task force," and began shooting, police  said.  </P> <P> Up to 15 people were inside.  </P> <P> Some scrambled into a back room, and others ran outside to escape the gunfire,  Police Chief Thomas Windham said.  </P> <P> "It appears to have been a robbery of a gambling game," Windham said. "We have  information that it was an extremely high-dollar gambling game with tens of  thousands of dollars involved."  </P> <P> The chief did not know if the gunmen got any money before escaping in a car.  </P> <P> The clothes and "task force" reference could have been intended to make the  gamblers think they were being raided by police, Police Capt. Randy Ely said.  He noted similar tactics were used in a March attack on another gambling spot  in which one person was slain.  </P> <P> The bar's owner told reporters that two men entered the lounge, robbed several  patrons who were sitting around drinking coffee and then began firing what he  described as semiautomatic weapons.  </P></p>

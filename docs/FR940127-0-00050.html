			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section summarizes the regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA on the amendments to 14 CFR parts 121, 127, 135, and 145_Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36, Development of Major Repair Data. This summary and the full regulatory evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector consumers, and Federal, State, and local governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full regulatory evaluation in the docket for this final rule). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA estimates that the one-time total cost of compliance will be approximately $55 for the industry and about $840 for the FAA. This cost estimate was derived based upon two components: (1) Current SFAR 36 certificate holders (that will not qualify under the amended rule) applying for a DER, and (2) FAA costs to review SFAR 36 and DER authorizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefit Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule, with the amended extension date, will allow certain firms to continue to operate under SFAR 36, and will avoid economic hardship to those relying on it as it presently exists. The final rule will also eliminate ambiguities that exist in the present rule. These ambiguities have allowed component repair stations that do not have return to service authorization to receive SFAR 36 authorizations. Repair stations that specialize in component or piece parts of products (instead of aircraft engines or air frames, for example) and are not returning those products to service, do not necessarily possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service. Only repair stations and air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product should be authorized to approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There have been no known documented instances where aviation safety has been compromised as a result of these repaired products being returned. Nevertheless, the level of certitude should not be compromised, and only those that understand the form, fit, and function of the product should be permitted to return the product to service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The benefits of this action are the potential improvements in aviation safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comparison of Costs and Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The costs associated with this final rule ($55 to industry and $840 to the FAA) are minimal. In view of the negligible costs of the rule, coupled with benefits in the form of enhanced safety to all aircraft operators, the FAA has determined that the rule will be cost-beneficial. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

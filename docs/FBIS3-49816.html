			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Unidentified correspondent] The HVO [Croatian  Defense Council] has been operating successfully in Mostar. The  area in which we are now was in Muslim hands yesterday. Today  this is not the case.    [Zlatan Mijo Jelic, commander of the HVO in Mostar] Yes, as  of today, this part of the city is in HVO hands. Only 10 meters  [m] away from us you can see a building held by the Muslim Army.  It is only a question of time before the HVO will take this  building too. The demarcation line between us is currently  between five and 10m. The Muslim army tried to push the front  line into our territory.    Members of the HVO's First Storm Battalion initially  repelled  the Muslim Army attack and then launched a counterattack,  shifting the front line around Santic Street [main front line in  the city center is parallel with Santic Street] and capturing a  significant Muslim stronghold in the [nearby] kindergarten and  five to six other well-fortified buildings. We pushed the front  line about 100m forward, toward the Neretva [river, Muslims  control entire left bank and part of right bank] [passage  omitted]</p>

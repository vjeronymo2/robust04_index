			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] Press commentaries today highlight the upcoming  visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the  region to advance the peace process. They also speak about  Israel's continued circumvention of the peace process.    In its editorial, TISHRIN comments on U.S. efforts to  advance  the peace process, and notes the upcoming visit of U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region next  Saturday. The paper discusses the ideas conveyed by Christopher  to Syria during his recent talks with President Hafiz al-Asad,  saying: Informed quarters revealed at the time that the  proposals conveyed by Christopher from Israel to Syrian  officials during his recent visit did not include anything new.  The ideas turned the priorities of the peace process upside  down.    TISHRIN adds: Instead of Israel's public commitment to full  withdrawal from the occupied territories in line with Security  Council resolutions and the Madrid conference foundations, the  Israeli ideas focused on security arrangements and then a peace  treaty, and withdrawal eventually being achieved over a long  period of time. Israel, in other words, would secure security  and peace in advance. As for the land, it will continue to be  under Israeli occupation and blackmail.    Syria has made it clear to Secretary Christopher that full  and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal is a top priority and that  peace and security are a consequence of withdrawal and not the  opposite.    After pointing out that Israel has dragged the Palestinians  into the trap of autonomy and deprived them of their rights,  TISHRIN adds: The land is the basic factor of conflict, and  there can be no peace or security without the return of the  land, which means regaining all of the Golan; Lebanon regaining  its southern part in full; Jordan regaining its occupied  territory; and the return of the evacuee and displaced Syrians,  Lebanese, and Jordanians to their land. Any solution to our  conflict with Israel that is not based on returning the land is  futile and has no future.    TISHRIN concludes: It is well known that Syria has insisted,  right from the very beginning, on a comprehensive and just  solution in the Middle East that ensures the implementation of  Security Council resolutions to the letter, and consequently,  the return of all the occupied territories. Syria has also  rejected phased settlements and partial solutions and insisted  on a just and comprehensive peace. It is enough for us to look  at the Gaza- Jericho reality and the Palestinians'  across-the-board displeasure to see the soundness of Syria's  attitude and its concept of a true, honorable peace in the  Middle East.    Peace does not agree with occupation and expansion and  hegemony. There can be no peace without full Israeli withdrawal.    Under the headline "Syria Will Not Relinquish Any Iota of  Rights," AL-BA'TH writes: Once again, there is news about a  visit to the region shortly by the U.S. secretary of state to  advance the peace process. The visit might include shuttle  tours that serve his mission.    The paper adds: Israeli sources have acknowledged that the  gap is still wide between the proposals made by Israel and  conveyed by the U.S. secretary to Damascus recently and the  Syrian reply to these proposals.    AL-BA'TH adds: If we contrast the two positions, it is  possible to assert that the Rabin government has continued to  try to circumvent the peace process and evade a serious  discussion that addresses the substance of this process. This  is done through adopting the principle of separate solutions and  partial deals.    The paper stresses that just and comprehensive peace in the  region will not be achieved except through commitment to the  principle of full and comprehensive withdrawal from all the  occupied Arab territories, in line with the foundations of the  peace process to which Syria has committed itself as a strategic  option.    It is natural, therefore, that the gap will remain wide  between the Syrian and Israeli positions, as a result of the  Rabin government's rejection of the peace initiative and Syria's  commitment to this initiative.    The paper concludes that separate solutions do not serve  peace. Depending on the Oslo accord is a trick that is  convincing only to those who abandon pan-Arab rights. Syria can  never relinquish an iota of these rights.</p>

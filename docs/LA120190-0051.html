			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WILL JAMERSON; CLAIMED TO BE WORLD'S OLDEST MAN  </P> <P> Will (Pops) Jamerson, 117, who was unable to qualify as the world's oldest man.  </P> <P> Jamerson failed to meet the criteria for the Guinness Book of World Records  because he never had a birth certificate and could not prove his birth date of  May 28, 1873. The date had been recorded in the family Bible, but that was  destroyed in a fire at the family homestead in Broken Bow, Okla. Guinness  listed the world's oldest man as John Evans, who died at 112. On Sunday in  Philadelphia of a heart and lung infection.  </P></p>

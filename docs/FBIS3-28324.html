During the meetings and telephone conversations, the prime  minister asked them to work for an intraparty coordination of  views on the issue of securing financial resources to make up  for a fiscal shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction,  saying that he intends to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7  February.    Prime Minister Hosokawa held a series of meetings today with  Foreign Minister Hata, Finance Minister Fujii, and Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura at his official residence. After the meeting  with the prime minister, Foreign Minister Hata said the prime  minister told him he would draw a conclusion on the issue by 7  February. The foreign minister also made it clear that they  agreed to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 February. Prime  Minister Hosokawa met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to  discuss how to deal with the issue. Asked by a reporter after  the meeting if there was no change in the prime minister's plan  to draw a conclusion on the issue by 7 February, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura said he will have to draw a conclusion by  that day.    Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama, who met with the  prime minister this evening, said the prime minister, speaking  by telephone with representatives of the ruling coalition  parties, asked them to coordinate views of the ruling coalition  parties on the issue at the council.    Sakigake [Harbinger) and the Japan New Party affirmed their  support for the national welfare tax, but proposed that the  coalition parties discuss how to set its tax rate, when to put  the new tax into effect, and draw a conclusion on them before  the current Diet session ends. The two parties notified their  affirmation and proposal to the prime minister. In response, the  prime minister said: I hope the ruling coalition parties will  fully discussion the issue and I intend to draw a conclusion on  the issue by 7 February in light of compilation of the fiscal  1994 budget.    The ruling coalition parties held today a meeting of their  secretaries in charge of tax affairs to discuss ways to handle  the income tax reduction and secure financial resources to make  up for a fiscal shortfall from the income tax cut, but no  headway was made at the meeting.</p>

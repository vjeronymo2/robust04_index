			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Videotron profits slip to CDollars 19m Videotron, the Canadian communications group developing cable television franchises in southern England, recorded lower profits for the first nine months of fiscal 1994, mainly due to problems with its Montreal broadcasting unit. The Canadian cable-TV business continued to grow and was profitable, and the UK cable and telecommunications operations reached 11 per cent of Videotron's total consolidated revenues. For the first nine months ended May 31, consolidated net profit was CDollars 19m (USDollars 14m) or 12 cents a share, down from CDollars 22m, or 15 cents, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 487m, up 8.7 per cent. Videotron said heavier depreciation stemming from expansion of the UK operations also reduced consolidated earnings. Alcan Aluminium plans to sell its two North American building products divisions, with annual revenues of USDollars 425m, to Genstar Capital.</p>

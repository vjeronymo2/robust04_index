			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 3 May -- The forthcoming signing of the  "Gaza-Jericho-First" agreement between the PLO and Israel will  open a new, no less complex stage connected with the  implementation of the agreements which have been reached,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated today before his  departure for Cairo where he is to take part in the ceremony at  which that historic document will be signed. [passage omitted]    In the opinion of the Russian minister, questions on the  practical transition to a peaceful life, on setting up economic  ties, and guaranteeing security are of exceptional importance  for the whole region. It is gratifying that Russia also has  made its contribution to the achievement of progress along this  path. In particular, "it is generally acknowledged" that the  recent visits to Moscow by the PLO and Israeli delegations, the  meetings which Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin had with Boris  Yeltsin "gave a good boost to the work being carried out,"  A.Kozyrev noted.    He also voiced satisfaction with the constructive  cooperation  which is under way with the U.S. side. "We are are in daily  contact, we are acting in unison, in complete accord," the  minister stressed.    A. Kozyrev expressed confidence that the present first step  in the Near East peace process should be accompanied by the  search for mutually acceptable solutions with regard to all  Palestinian territories and by progress in other areas of the  talks. The minister believes that it is necessary, first and  foremost, to attain progress in the Israel-Syrian area of the  talks, as the most difficult one. In his words, Russia has an  opportunity to play an active mediatory role.    Touching upon Russia's idea of convening the second Madrid  conference on the Near East, A. Kozyrev noted that it aimed to  open new "political-diplomatic" prospects and that it is still  topical, of course. "I think," he continued, "that this idea  will receive a wider recognition since a certain stage in the  current process is now coming to completion." It is necessary  to assess the path which has been traveled and to specifically  outline future areas of the talks to capitalize on the  achievements of the first Madrid conference.    In the opinion of the Russian minister, the present peace  process could become a model for resolving many "chronic  conflicts fraught with bloodshed and intolerance." This applies  in particular, he noted, to the Karabakh conflict. A.Kozyrev  voiced the hope that the warring sides will be able to reach  agreement on a cease-fire and to "enter an agreement drawn up  with Russian mediation."    The head of the foreign policy department of the Russian  Federation noted that the Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS  states could make a weighty contribution to resolving this  problem. "We will also strive to step up cooperation in this  direction in the CSCE," he said.    The minister also said that he intended to meet soon with  Jan  Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE peace conference on  Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

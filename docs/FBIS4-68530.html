			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Troitskiy: "The `Blacklists' as the </F> Highest Form of Social Protection"]    [Text] After October 1993 there were "disfranchised"  people in Russia once again, just as there were after October  1917. In the 1920s this is what they called the members of the  "exploitative classes" who had been deprived of the right to  vote. At that time they numbered hundreds of thousands. Today  the scales are not the same: The "sequential constitutional  reform" has limited the rights of only around 150 people.    These people of different genders and ages are united by a  common "social status": All of them were people's deputies of  the Russian Federation of the 1990-1995 convocation. Their labor  books now bear the following inscription: "Dismissed from work  on a permanent basis in accordance with RF Presidential Edict No  1400 without eligibility for the social guarantees specified in  RF Presidential Edict No 1435."    This inscription, which was composed by experienced  personnel  from Old Square (members of the presidential administration, not  the CPSU Central Committee), was required after several hundred  people lost their jobs as a result of the forcible elimination  of their place of employment--the Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet. That was when our solicitous president issued Edict No  1435--"for the purpose of providing people's deputies with state  guarantees of social protection." The highest social guarantees  were offered to the deputies: They could not be arrested without  the president's consent; they would receive financial benefits  in the amount of their annual salary (i.e., 3 million rubles all  at once); they would have job placement and pension privileges;  they could keep the living quarters they were assigned in  connection with their office and could even privatize them; they  could vacation in "official" resorts until 30 June 1995; and so  on and so forth.    Aleksandr Pochinok, then the chairman of the RF Supreme  Soviet's planning and budget commission, quickly calculated that  the edict would cost the state budget 25 billion rubles (not  counting adjustments for subsequent inflation and cost-of-living  raises). Incidentally, the amount depended as much on the  deputies as on the president. The fact is that Yeltsin was  planning to offer this security not to all of the people's  representatives, but only to those who acknowledged his Edict No  1400. In other words, the chief of state decided to reward--at  the treasury's expense--his supporters and possible turncoats.    The applicants were many in number, and a commission, headed  by former Procurator and Deputy Aleksey Surkov, was set up as  part of the presidential administration. This commission was  authorized to "separate the sheep from the goats" and dispense  the "social guarantees." It went to work with such zeal that  even completely loyal democrats had difficulty passing its  screening process. It stayed in session for a whole five months,  verifying the allegiance of former comrades in the corps of  deputies and making detailed reports to the Kremlin personnel  division: recommending the specific entry for the labor book of  each, either allowing or disallowing the social guarantees.    But this was long ago. Much has happened since then: The  parliamentary elections were held, the country acquired a new  Basic Law, a political amnesty was declared, and the president  asked everyone to join the crusade for national reconciliation.  It appeared that Surkov's commission was obsolete and that its  reports could be deposited in the trash can of history.    But no, the commission survived all of the discord and still  has not been dissolved. On 9 March the presidential  administration issued Directive No 415 under Sergey Filatov's  signature, summing up the results of the activities of the  government screeners. A list of 151 people who were not eligible  for the "guarantees" was attached to the directive. The contents  of this document were to be brought to the attention of local  representatives of the president and agencies of the executive  branch of government.    The names on Filatov's list include those of 15 deputies of  the present State Duma, including one speaker, one faction  leader, one head of a Duma committee, and four members of the  Federation Council. For these lucky few, all of the  "deprivations" are in the past. It is true that they did not  receive their severance benefits, but they did avoid the "career  restrictions" and can even collect a regular pension. Things are  more difficult for those who were unable to renew their deputy  mandates or at least find a place on the parliamentary staff.  Several former deputies (they asked the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent not to mention them by name) took the risk of  going back home, filling out a new application for a residence  permit, and trying to find a job. They learned right away that  the orders of the top Russian leadership have a more direct  effect than the constitutional declarations of human rights.  Local officials who looked through their labor books and checked  their own papers suddenly became impervious and refused to help  the ex-deputies find jobs. Now the miserable wretches have to  come to the capital periodically to seek forgiveness.    Filatov recently implied that the president might be  charitable and that the notorious directive might be rescinded  in connection with the impending civic accord, but this  unexpected outpouring of clemency will not solve anything: These  people will still have the ineradicable entry in their labor  books and no severance benefits.    The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent asked many attorneys for  a  legal assessment, rather than a political one, of the present  situation. This turned out to be an extremely complex matter.  Boris Zolotukhin, now one of the leaders of the "Russia's  Choice" faction in the Duma and formerly the lawyer of the civil  rights advocates and a people's deputy of the Russian  Federation, said that the legitimacy of the "blacklists" was  difficult to assess because the legality of the "social  guarantees" themselves is quite dubious (although this did not  keep Zolotukhin and his associates from making use of all of  these "guarantees").    Independent attorneys confirmed that Presidential Edict No  1435, Surkov's commission, and the proscribing lists are all  links of the same chain and are beyond the legal fringe, but  today no court has the power to overturn "Yeltsin's  discriminatory legislation." After the president abolished the  constitution and a whole branch of government, he set up his own  patterns of legal relations with members of parliament, so he  cannot be expected to correct the situation. During the  conversations about the disfranchised, experienced attorneys  spoke in strictly ethical terms: "They lost the 'social  guarantees' because they could not be bought. Why then should  they now receive these '30 pieces of silver'?"    The inscription in the labor book is a different matter. The  notation "dismissed from work in accordance with Edict..." (the  rest is unimportant) is, according to attorneys, "a definite  violation of the labor rights of citizens." Labor legislation  does not recognize a "presidential edict" as grounds for  dismissal. This notation "discredits the worker" without giving  him any chance for appeal, because no one knows exactly which  official dismissed him. This is an obvious infringement of civil  rights.    It may be obvious, but no one is trying to defend the  violated rights of the disfranchised at this time. Members of  the staff of Human Rights Commissioner Sergey Kovalev told the  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent that they have not looked into  the matter and would not know where to begin. The Duma has  remained silent. Speaker Ivan Rybkin, whose own name is on the  "blacklist," has dismissed the matter with the broadest  generalizations. The disfranchised have no faith in the  independence of the judiciary. During their years as deputies,  they learned the ins and outs of Russian governmental power, and  that is why they are now relying on the good graces of their  leader, and not on the supremacy of the law.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS GOOFED UP ADVICE  </P> <P> I enjoy reading your "Ask the Handyman" column very much. Sorry to say, there  are a couple of goofs in the Aug. 4 edition that bear comment.  </P> <P> In the item about the six-outlet adapter, Don Jordan of Jordan Hardware was  quoted as saying, "Once you turn all six of those things on, you'll overload  the circuit." WRONG. One could have thousands of neon lights plugged in, or  hundreds of electric clocks, or dozens of 25-watt light bulbs. The criterion is  the total load on that particular circuit.  </P> <P> As long as it is under 15 or 20 amperes including power factor (unless you know  for sure, presume 15 for safety), the number of outlets or cords or appliances  is meaningless. Right now in the den in which I am writing this letter, I have  my entertainment center plugged into one wall outlet with 17 active outlets  daisy-chained from it. But the maximum total load on that wall outlet is under  500 watts, the total load on that circuit is well under 15 amps, my extensions  are all new, are protected from physical damage, are rated at 15 amps although  they only carry up to four, and thus the setup is perfectly safe. I use many of  the six-outlet adapters.  </P> <P> Next, Ames Kergesian of Buena Park Lumber said, in reference to the  water-to-cement ratio for mixing concrete: "There is no perfect consistency.  The thinner the mixture, the slower it's going to set." WRONG. Setting time is  normally of no real significance whatever. However, the final strength of the  concrete, which is usually very significant, varies roughly as the inverse of  the amount of water used in the mix. Always use the absolute minimum of water  you can get by with on any particular job. The ideal mix is one so stiff it  must be pounded into place. If it must be poured, use the least amount of water  that will still allow it to flow. I know commercial operators usually use soupy  mixes, but their chief aim in life is to pour quickly.  </P> <P> JOHN HAMAKER  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

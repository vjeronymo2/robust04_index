			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The importance of neighborhoods in combatting neglect is also emphasized in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1994 Kids Count Data Book <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (The Annie E. Casey Foundation, pp. 4&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report issued by the National Research Council (NRC, 1993, pp. 50&hyph;52) also highlights the ecological aspects. The report suggests that ``dysfunctional families are often part of a dysfunctional environment'' (p. 50). Its recommendations for intervention programs include: home-based approaches (p. 264), impacts on socio-economic conditions (p. 134), and impacts on social isolation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (p. 135).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent research focuses on the psychosocial foundations of neglect. DiLeonardi (1993), for example, reported that ``family empowerment, the use of groups to develop social support networks, and the assistance of volunteers or paraprofessionals as home visitors or parent aides, appear to be beneficial'' (p. 557) to prevent neglect among families reported for neglect. The study concluded that families were able to reverse their neglectful child-rearing patterns with this model of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gaudin, Zuravin, and Polansky also found that family dynamics explains ``a significant portion of the variance in quality of parenting/neglect'' (Gaudin, 1993). Depression and substance abuse, for example, have been suggested as powerful forces in family dynamics and mediators of neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In June of 1993, NCCAN sponsored a symposium on chronic neglect. The issues addressed included consensus building on definitions, strategies for change through empowerment, research, treatment and policy topics. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proceedings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from this symposium will be available from the NCCAN Clearinghouse. A number of studies, referred to in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proceedings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , suggest that programs for neglectful families based on building interpersonal strengths, fostering individual empowerment, and ensuring the provision of basic human needs in a safe environment were most likely to improve parenting, self-esteem and coping ability among the neglectful population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent work by the Kansas Cooperative Extension Service (Smith, C.A., Cudaback, D., Goddard, H.W., &amp; Myers-Walls, J., 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Extension Parent Education Model <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) may provide a useful guide for designing the parent education component of a comprehensive psycho-social model. Parent education can help parents in many ways including: learning to care for themselves, managing personal stress, managing family resources; providing children with developmentally appropriate opportunities and learning appropriate disciplinary techniques; maintaining developmentally appropriate expectations of children; improving communication skills, building social support systems; and learning to access community, social service, and family support resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects may either present innovative approaches or be replications of previously evaluated and promising models. Proposed models should build on previous research and NCCAN-sponsored Symposium findings and incorporate mental health, parenting education components and family support services. They should collect data on the costs and potential cost-benefits of providing the proposed services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These projects may be based on one of two types of models described above: either the ecological, i.e., neighborhood model, or the psycho-social model. If a project chooses the ecological model, it must be aggressive in its outreach to the community; conversely, if a project chooses to follow the psycho-social model, it must include home-based/family support services, parenting education, and mental health services in its approach to addressing neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCCAN intends to fund up to ten demonstration projects on neglect (five in each model). Structurally, these projects are intended to function cooperatively as a cluster. Participation in a cluster affords the grantees the greatest opportunities to cooperate and collaborate. NCCAN will assist this cooperation by providing assistance through a technical assistance contract, encouraging meetings to develop use of common evaluation criteria, data elements, and measures to maximize comparability of evaluation findings. Evaluations will be required of each demonstration project. Priority will be given to those who provide evidence of a partnership between CPS/IV-B agencies which provide Family Preservation/Family Support services and community-based mental health/family resource centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Guardian ad Litem Model Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1975, the Congress has required States to provide a guardian ad litem in every case of alleged child abuse or neglect that results in a judicial proceeding as a condition of eligibility for a grant under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). Though there are enough attorneys in every jurisdiction to meet the needs of children for legal representation as attorneys or guardians ad litem (GAL), many States do not have funds to pay the attorneys, and most abused and neglected children and their parents are unable to afford attorneys' fees. As a result, in many locations, the juvenile court depends upon attorneys to represent children on a voluntary ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro bono <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

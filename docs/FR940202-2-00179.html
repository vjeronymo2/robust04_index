The option agreement period must extend through the end of the current fiscal year and contain a renewal provision so that the option can be renewed for at least an additional six months. The Sponsor must also identify any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. In the case of a site to be acquired from a public body, evidence that the public body possesses clear title to the site, and has entered into a legally binding agreement to lease or convey the site to the Sponsor after it receives and accepts a notice of section 811 capital advance and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. However, in localities where HUD determines that the time constraints of the funding round will not permit all of the required official actions (e.g., approval of Community Planning Boards) which are necessary to convey publicly-owned sites, a letter in the application from the Mayor or Director of the appropriate local agency indicating their approval of conveyance of the site contingent upon the necessary approval action is acceptable and may be approved by the Field Office if it has satisfactory experience with timely conveyance of sites from that public body. In such cases, documentation shall also include a copy of the public body's evidence of ownership and identification of any restrictive covenants, including reverter clauses. For properties to be acquired from the RTC, include a copy of the RTC prepared Transaction Screen Checklist or Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and applicable documentation, per the RTC Environmental Guidelines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposed project site may not be acquired or optioned from a general contractor (or its affiliate) which will construct the section 811 project or from any other development team member.]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Now that the anniversary of Earth Day has passed,  opportunities abound to "act locally."  </P> <P> On a regional level, interested volunteers can help reclaim the environment by  assisting in the Nature Conservancy's reforestation project at the Kern River  Preserve near Lake Isabella.  </P> <P> Located on the South Fork of the Kern River, the riparian forest of the  1,100-acre preserve is home to a variety of wildlife, including the endangered  yellow-billed cuckoo, one of the state's rarest birds. For the past three  years, members of the Conservancy and concerned volunteers have succeeded in  restoring 140 acres.  </P> <P> Reforestation activities range from irrigation to planting and weed control.  Different activities are scheduled each weekend. Planting is scheduled for  Saturday and Sunday and again on May 5 and 6.  </P> <P> On a neighborhood level, El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach is promoting a  program to encourage families to clean up the block on which they live.  </P> <P> Participants will monitor the debris found in the gutters on their street for  six weeks with the goal of becoming more aware of the kinds of materials that  start the journey into the storm drain system and ultimately out to the oceans.  </P> <P> For information on the Kern River Preserve project call (800) 733-1763; for El  Dorado Nature Center call (213) 421-9431, Ext. 3421.  </P> <P> SCIENCE POLICY  </P> <P> Bioethicist Alexander Morgan Capron will discuss the dilemmas posed by advances  in medicine and life-sustaining treatment at 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday in room 124  of USC's Seeley G.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonia will make no concession to Russia at  bilateral negotiations another round of which will open  tomorrow, vice chairman of Estonia's parliament said on Monday  [4 April].    "Estonia has adopted the Law on Aliens under which we can  meet with humanitarian requests, but Estonia will not retreat in  main issues," Tunne Kelam said at a traditional Monday afternoon  picket before Russian military headquarters in Tallinn.    The Estonian National Independence Party (ERSP) held the  picket for the eight time to press for complete and orderly  troop pullout by the August 31 deadline. Another issue they  press for is that retired Russian military should not be allowed  to stay in Estonia.    "We have enough patience and as long as ERSP stands in the  ruling coalition, there will be no concessions to Russia," MP  Viktor Niitsoo said.    One of the slogans carried was "Latvia's washout is a  warning  to Estonia" referring to Latvia's consent to allow residence of  the retired military.    All Estonian higher officials, including Defence Minister  Juri Luik, have said that Estonia would make no concessions.    Prime Minister Mart Laar said on Monday that Estonia could  not possibly follow Latvia's Way as Estonian and Latvian laws  are different and in order to agree to documents similar to  those initialed between Russia and Latvia, Estonia would have to  change its legislation which the present government would not do.    Laar also expressed his regret that cooperation between  Estonia and Latvia in foreign policy was not good enough.</p>

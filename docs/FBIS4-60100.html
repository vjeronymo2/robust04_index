			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Lothar </F> Menne; place and date not given: "End of Hunting Season"]    [Text] [Menne] Foreign Minister, when we met one year  ago, you developed almost Messianic visions of a pacified "New  Middle East," but you made no mention of the fact that you had  been negotiating with the PLO in Oslo for months...    [Peres] ...and what would have become of the secret  negotiations if I had told people like you about them under seal  of strictest secrecy?    [Menne] Will you tell us instead what you currently have in  the diplomatic pipeline?    [Peres] We are currently negotiating on another peace  agreement with the Palestinians. Then we will test what can be  achieved with the Syrians, but we have a dual problem there:  Not only are the positions of the two parties opposed, but  above all, we are not in direct negotiation. Everything goes  via the United States.    [Menne] Do you still attach importance to an agreement with  Syria?    [Peres] Yes, because there is no real solution for any  country in the Middle East before we have achieved an economic  and political agreement for the whole region.    [Menne] The United States continues to play an essential  role in Middle East diplomacy. Can Russia, for its part, take  on a role?    [Peres] Well, Russia's role is more a symbolic one today:  The Russians have to ensure that the Middle East is on their  agenda, but this will not mean for a long time yet that Russia  is on the agenda of the Middle East. They simply want to  maintain the image of the great Russia.    [Menne] Some questions about the personal side of the  political development. What was the happiest day of your  political life?    [Peres] The day on which the state of Israel was born.    [Menne] What did you feel when you heard about the massacre  in Hebron?    [Peres] I was shaken to the marrow of my bones, I was  ashamed and shocked.    [Menne] And do you fear for the peace process?    [Peres] No.    [Menne] What was your reaction when Yasir 'Arafat first  refused to initial the maps of the Jericho territory during the  signing of the autonomy agreement in Cairo?    [Peres] I fancied I was a doctor whose patient had just  fallen and who had to find the right treatment very quickly.    [Menne] How did you feel when you saw the pictures of the  Palestinian policemen marching into Jericho?    [Peres] These were very satisfying pictures for me. I did  not feel any regret, on the contrary: I hope that the  Palestinians will quickly develop a successful administration.    [Menne] You have worked for Israel all your life. Does it  hurt that some of your compatriots are now calling you a traitor?    [Peres] No, I can live with it. I have only pity for these  people.    [Menne] As defense minister, you dealt primarily with  military tasks. You are regarded as the "father" of the Israeli  nuclear reactor in Dimona. Now you are working on a peace  solution. Has reality changed or have you changed?    [Peres] The basic conditions have changed. During the first  45 years, Israel's security was the main problem. Now it holds  true that we only find security if we have peace. The "lever of  deterrence" of Dimona directly influenced the peace agreement  with Israel. I am still working for the same objectives, only  the means have changed. In former times, the country needed  above all weapons, today it needs wisdom. If one wants to  achieve peace, wars have to be made impossible.    [Menne] What can still endanger the peace process now?    [Peres] Actually, only something idiotic or unpredictable.  I believe that the current of history is leading the people  away from war. Seen from the historical point of view, we have  come to the end of the hunting season -- what is important  cannot be hunted any longer and what can still be hunted is no  longer important.    [Menne] That is to say, you think that the peace process is  irreversible?    [Peres] Certainly. The process was not initiated under  pressure from other countries or by threats of war, but by a  national process of will, like almost all great achievements of  the past decade. A communist caused the end of communism, a  white South African the end of apartheid, a Peronist the end of  Peronism. And Israel initiated the termination of the Middle  East conflict.    [Menne] What will happen next?    [Peres] The next step is the development of the New Middle  East. In concrete terms, this means for the Israelis and  Palestinians that the two national footbridges grow together  into a bridge in the next five years. After the election in the  autumn, we will negotiate on the extension of the autonomy  settlement.    [Menne] What will become of the Jewish settlers in the  occupied territories?    [Peres] Everything will depend on the relations between  Palestinians and Israelis. If 500 Jewish settlers live among  190,000 Arabs in Hebron, this will be no problem if the  relations are good. However, if they are bad, the situation  will be unbearable.    [Menne] That is to say, the psychological barriers between  Israelis and Palestinians first have to be reduced?    [Peres] Exactly. As it was also possible between Germans  and French, Germans and Poles. We must not forget that on both  sides the third or fourth generation has already grown up now  with completely consolidated hostile images; everyone imputes  the most devilish intentions to the other from the start. It  will take some time until both sides understand that they are a  community of fate.    [Menne] Is it not the prerequisite for such a peace process  that the Palestinians get their own state?    [Peres] There is, of course, a completely legitimate  national consciousness, which also needs a political form of  expression. And the autonomy settlement grants them everything  that makes up a state, except for defense and foreign politics.  However, there will be all symbols of independence, from  passports to stamps. Over the long term, I prefer the model of  a confederation -- politically between Jordanians and  Palestinians, economically between Israelis, Jordanians, and  Palestinians, which can be approximately compared to the Benelux  structure. In the near future, however, we still have to be  very careful with Israel's security interests.    [Menne] How is the New Middle East supposed to look in  concrete terms?    [Peres] Like the European Community. Borders would only be  defined in demographic and cultural terms, but they would not be  permitted to impede the movements of people, ideas, and goods.  What television can do must also be possible for streets,  railroads, and aircraft. The most important objective must be  the general raising of the standard of living because if someone  has a low income and a television set, he will compare his  situation with that of a European and feel envy, bitterness, and  rage; in this way, fundamentalist movements are created.    [Menne] Will the economy play a greater role than politics  in the creation of the New Middle East?    [Peres] We should introduce economics in politics, instead  of politicizing economies. Many Arabs still see their economy  in an old-fashioned way as a national economy, which, however,  no longer exists because markets are more important than nations  and because one cannot place flags on one's children's breakfast  table. "Cannons instead of socks, tanks instead of shoes," it  was said in Israel in the fifties, today I hear more and more  frequently: "Better a bank than a tank." We have to create a  regional community with a common market.    [Menne] And who is supposed to pay for it?    [Peres] For one thing, this does not cost a penny, we would  only have to restrict some crazy expenses. In the last decade,  the Middle East spent billions of dollars on arms, the Syrian  armament budget devours almost half of the GDP, in Israel it is  only 26 percent. These are enormous sums, of which a reasonable  part might flow into economic development. Only very rich  countries can afford expensive armies and costly dictatorships.    [Menne] What can Israel offer to its neighbors?    [Peres] Above all technology and science. Only think of the  rapid spreading of the desert in the Middle East -- we have very  precise experiences with techniques that can check and force  back this desertification of the region. Our neighbors can  immediately benefit from it.    [Menne] And what can the Arab countries offer to Israel?    [Peres] We can economically survive without our neighbors;  our exports are well developed. But politically it is very  problematic for Israel to exist as an island of affluence in a  sea of poverty. Therefore, the Arabs can give the most important  thing to us: peace.</p>

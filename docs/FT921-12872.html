			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Nestle confident as sales increase 9% NESTLE, the Swiss foods group which launched a FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.5bn) bid with Indosuez on Monday for Source Perrier of France, said sales in 1991 reached SFr50.5bn (Dollars 35.8bn), 9 per cent above 1990 levels. It confirmed that 1991 profits were also higher, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The better-than-expected increase in sales was attributed to favourable trends in all parts of the world, except the Gulf region, and to a slightly positive net movement of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc. Sales volume, excluding acquisitions and disposals, grew at more than 4 per cent, with the largest increases in Latin America and Asia. In Europe and North America, all product groups contributed to the increase, except the pet food business in the US, which suffered from a stagnating market and intensive competition. The group said it expected further growth in sales and profits this year. A complete financial statement is to be published on March 20. Sales of Sandoz, the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, grew 9 per cent to SFr13.4bn last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "We Know  How To Defend Our Sovereignty"]    [Text] [REPUBLIKA] You will put forward the Slovak  Defense Doctrine at the government session. What does this  document mean for Slovakia?    [Andrejcak] The defense doctrine is an umbrella document  containing the principle issues of our defense philosophy. This  means that it does not deal with the way soldiers defend our  homeland but with the way the state approaches defense issues,  how it will defend its sovereignty, and how our defense policy  will be formulated. I think that the defense doctrine  guarantees all of this.    [REPUBLIKA] Is this not a bit late? Virtually a year after  the state's establishment?    [Andrejcak] Not at all. After all, countries like the  United States and Great Britain do not have a defense doctrine  like this, and they have been around for quite a while. This is  a form that makes public the substance of the Slovak Republic's  defense principles. The military part, however, is specific,  but that is strictly classified in every country.    [REPUBLIKA] A great deal was once said about a home guard,  but the public, in general, was not inclined toward it. What is  the situation today?    [Andrejcak] We actually have a home guard. We have home  guard brigades and home guard regiments; however, we will assign  them only in the event of a defense emergency. The home guard  units are part of the ground forces.    [REPUBLIKA] When will the Slovak Defense Doctrine be  regarded as an official document? Does it have to be approved  by parliament?    [Andrejcak] It would be enough for it to be approved by the  State Defense Council, and that has already happened. However,  if parliament also wants to approve it, there is nothing  preventing this. The National Council of the Slovak Republic  committees have already discussed and approved it. However, it  is already an official document because the State Defense  Council has approved it.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Ukraine sends reform signals Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma yesterday consolidated his grip on economic policy by naming a radical reformer, Mr Viktor Pynzanek, as first deputy prime minister for economics. The appointment of Mr Pynzanek, who quit the same post in frustration last year when Mr Kuchma was prime minister, undercuts the conservative prime minister, Mr Vitaly Masol. Mr Masol, who was strongly criticised by Mr Kuchma yesterday for trying to obstruct last week's unification of the currency exchange rates, had said any appointment to that economics portfolio would weaken his own position. Mr Kuchma promised further austerity measures soon and progress toward a new constitution. He commented: 'I'm ready to compromise on all issues except economic reform and executive power.' He also urged parliament to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty because, he said, economic help from both Russia and the west depended on it.</p>

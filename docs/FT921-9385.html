			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Creditors seek return of Drexel bonuses LAWYERS for creditors of the defunct US investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert yesterday filed court papers seeking the return of Dollars 250m (Pounds 136.6m) in bonuses the company paid out to employees just before it went bankrupt in February 1990. The lawyers claim the payments hastened Drexel's slide into bankruptcy. Under US law, a company facing bankruptcy is restricted from making payments that might be part of a plan to delete assets of the company's estate. Yesterday's filing follows a report last October by staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US watchdog, which said that a bankruptcy trustee for Drexel would stand a reasonable chance of proving the company was insolvent when the cash bonuses were paid in late 1989 and early 1990, and that evidence existed that the payments represented 'fraudulent conveyance' of Drexel's assets. Any money recovered from the bonus payments would be distributed among Drexel's many creditors.</p>

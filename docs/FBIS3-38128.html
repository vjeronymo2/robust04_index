			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Bonn Provides Massive Help"] </F>   [Text] The Federal Government has increased its help to  the ailing arms industry with Hermes export guarantees for  international transactions. According to a confidential list of  projects from the Finance Ministry in Bonn, in October 1993,  government guarantees for military exports amounted to 2.3  billion German marks -- three times more than in the previous  year.    According to the list, which contains 10 projects,  transactions with Indonesia account for more than half of the  amount. The second major client is Turkey, which took the  lion's share of Hermes guarantees for export deals in 1992.  Both countries have promised billions in orders for German  shipyards. In addition, the Federal Government provided several  minor guarantees for the sale of helicopters of the Munich  Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm company to Botswana, Swaziland,  Argentina, the Czech Republic, and the Philippines.</p>

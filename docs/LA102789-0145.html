			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> FIRM OFFERS TO SELL 276 ACRES OF PROJECT  </P> <P> Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren Thursday offered to sell 276 acres of land  earmarked for the controversial Laguna Laurel housing community to the city of  Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Bren's offer, carrying a $38-million price tag, would scrap plans for a  237-acre private golf course and reduce the controversial 3,200-home project  near the mouth of Laguna Canyon by about 250 homes.  </P> <P> Company officials said the offer is contingent on the city's accepting the rest  of the terms of the Laguna Laurel proposal. Under the agreement, city officials  would also be required to lend their support to the proposed San Joaquin Hills  Transportation Corridor and the widening of Laguna Canyon Road, two projects  that have met stiff resistance in the city.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Mayor Pro Tem Lida Lenney criticized the offer.  </P> <P> "From my point of view, there are too many strings attached, and it is too  cost-prohibitive," Lenney said. "They're still going along with their  development; they will still be wrapped around both sides of the canyon and one  of the lakes."  </P> <P> Mayor Robert F. Gentry said that although the company addresses some of the  city's concerns, such as possible pollution from the proposed golf course, the  project's density will not change dramatically, Gentry said.  </P> <P> "If we would spend $38 million, the question . . . is if we reduced development  by 500 homes, is that an equitable deal?" Gentry said. "That takes about 5,000  car trips a day out of a development that is going to generate about 35,000 car  trips a day."  </P> <P> City officials and residents have contested the proposed development because of  environmental concerns. They fear that the 2,150 -- acre project would send  runoff, including pesticides from the golf course, into the ocean through storm  drains. Others simply want the rural canyon maintained in its natural state.  </P> <P> The golf course would be a dead issue were the city to accept the terms of the  agreement.  </P> <P> Gentry said the matter will be placed on the agenda for the Nov. 7 City Council  meeting.  </P> <P> Gentry said company officials made the offer during a meeting Thursday with  Gentry, Lenney, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank and Irvine Co. Executive Vice  President Gary Hunt.  </P> <P> Company officials said they made the offer because the proposed golf course  appeared to be an obstacle to the project.  </P> <P> Environmental groups, who say the new offer doesn't change much, are still  making plans for a Nov. 11 walk along Laguna Canyon Road to protest the  project.

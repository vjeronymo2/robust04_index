			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Lilley caps level of home loans benefit A CEILING is to be put on mortgage interest payments paid by the social security system for the formerly well-off who have lost their jobs, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said yesterday. The measure will mean that along with existing restrictions, only mortgages of up to Pounds 150,000 will be eligible for social security help in 1993, and this will be lowered to Pounds 125,000 in 1994, and reviewed again after that. The move, which will be implemented in the second half of April, follows severe ministerial embarrassment last December over a case in which mortgage interest payments of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were made to a former insurance sales executive. It coincides with a survey commissioned by the housing charity Shelter which shows that 55 per cent of backbench MPs - spreadamong all parties - support the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief. Mr Lilley said of the plan to cap social security help on home loan interest: 'We want to focus support on those whose needs are greatest, not on those whose assets are greatest. Why should the taxpayer keep the former millionaire in his mansion? 'It is one thing to tide over ordinary mortgage payers hit by the double blow of redundancy and a weak housing market. And we have no intention of damaging the current recovery in the housing market. 'But the system was never intended to bail out the super-rich on mega-mortgages who made no provision against tough times,' he added. The government says about 1,500 people claim income support help with mortgage interest on sums above Pounds 150,000, and 3,000 on sums above Pounds 125,000. The new ceiling will not apply retrospectively. Beyond solving a political difficulty, the move reflects a belief among ministers that social security payments should increasingly be targeted at those most in need, and that people should be encouraged to make provision for themselves against risk. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the cross-party social security committee of MPs, said: 'We now have the worst of all possible worlds. This will make the rich homeless - and I am against making the rich or the poor homeless.' Help for council tenants, Page 8 MPs 'back ending of tax relief', Page 8</p>

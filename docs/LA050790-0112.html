			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 COLOMBIANS HELD IN PLOT TO BUY STINGERS;  </P> <P> DRUG WAR: MEDELLIN CARTEL SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF EFFORTS TO SHOOT DOWN COPTERS,  KILL PRESIDENT BARCO, CABINET.  </P> <P> Two Colombians linked to the Medellin cocaine cartel face charges of trying to  buy Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and automatic weapons as part of a plot to  shoot down Colombian government helicopters, the FBI said today.  </P> <P> FBI Special Agent William Gavin could not confirm an ABC News report that the  weapons were to be used to kill Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas and  his Cabinet.  </P> <P> Gavin said at least one other arrest is pending.  </P> <P> The suspect arrested in Miami, Luis Fernando Arcila-Giraldo, 28, claimed to be  a close associate of Medellin drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar, Gavin told a  news conference.  </P> <P> Arcila-Giraldo was arrested without incident Saturday near Miami International  Airport and was scheduled to appear this afternoon before a U.S. magistrate,  Gavin said.  </P> <P> The second suspect, Alfredo Antonio Ramos-Tinoco, 47, was arrested without  incident Saturday while playing pool at the Marriott Hotel. He is scheduled to  appear before a U.S. magistrate in Tampa this afternoon.  </P> <P> Both men were charged with conspiracy to receive stolen property, conspiracy to  export arms without a license and aiding and abetting the importation and  possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine.  </P> <P> Gavin said both men had negotiated with undercover agents in Polk County to buy  Stinger missiles and automatic weapons with proceeds from cocaine and marijuana  sales. Ramos-Tinoco told undercover agents that he had recently imported  "thousands of pounds" of marijuana into the United States.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, undercover agents showed the two suspects a Stinger missile and  the two men later agreed to make a $1-million down payment for an unspecified  number of Stingers, Gavin said.  </P> <P> The FBI also seized marijuana and semi-automatic weapons and pistols from a  Miami house that both men had visited.  </P> <P> "The missiles were to be exported to Colombia to be used against Colombian  government helicopters," Gavin said. "We know of no assassination plot in  association with this case."  </P> <P> Gavin said he has no information on the relationship between Arcila-Giraldo and  Escobar, except for the suspect's own comments to undercover agents that he was  a "close associate."  </P> <P> The FBI began an undercover investigation April 18 after the suspects  approached Polk County undercover agents asking to buy the Stinger missiles,  Gavin said.  </P> <P> "The representation was that the money was to come from the proceeds of  marijuana and cocaine sales," Gavin said.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Paul Game Jr. of Tampa issued arrest warrants for the suspects  after the Tuesday meeting with undercover agents, Gavin said.  </P></p>

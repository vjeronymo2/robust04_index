Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said the dispute  would in no way be the focus of Mahathir's visit this week, but  he pointed out that "the air could be cleared to some extent and  things clarified" with the Malaysian leader's meeting with  members of the Philippine Congress.    It is just as well. Although the executive since the time of  former President Corazon C. Aquino has made moves to drop the  Sabah claim to improve our relations with Malaysia, opposition  by senators has consistently stood in the way. [passage omitted]    Mahathir has since said that he understands the peculiarity  of the Philippine system, declaring that certain processes have  to be followed before Manila could relinquish its claim to Sabah.    The Sabah issue, therefore, represents just about the  exception in the traditional dictum that foreign policy is  formulated by the executive. The issue is an emotional one and  cannot be resolved by mere executive fiat. But more than that,  the Sabah issue represents the challenge facing the Philippine  government system on one hand, and Philippine-Malaysian  relations on the other. Since the Senate has insisted on  becoming a partner with Malacanang [presidential office] in  setting the foreign-policy agenda at least in so far as the  Sabah issue is concerned, it is compelled to define a  far-reaching but workable stand to resolve the thorniest problem  plaguing our relations with Malaysia. Prolonged opposition by  lawmakers to executive initiatives to drop the claim without any  initiative on their part to make practical proposals will  inevitably be construed as nothing but obstructionism. In  short, the issue is a challenge to Philippine democratic  consensus-building. [passage omitted]    To be sure, the exchange visit of Mr. Mahathir will show  that  Philippine-Malaysian relations have matured. It signals the  desire of Malaysia to continue on the path of regional  solidarity and cooperation. The grand vision of ASEAN appears  secure and cannot be derailed by territorial disputes. Like  France and Germany, the Philippines and Malaysia have managed to  build a strong partnership in spite of pending historical  claims. [passage omitted]    It is up to our legislators to show to the Malaysian leader  that their opposition to dropping the Sabah claim at this time  upholds the national interest, an aspect of which is fostering  better relations with Malaysia. The dialogue perhaps will make  tentative steps toward resolving the dispute once and for all in  a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner. If so, the Sabah  issue may yet instruct and impress the Malaysians on the glory  of Philippine democracy.</p>

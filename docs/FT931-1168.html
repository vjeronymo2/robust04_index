			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vauxhall record result bucks trend VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, more than doubled 1992 operating profits from Pounds 128.4m to a record Pounds 269.1m. The result was achieved despite the deep recession in the UK new vehicle market and when Ford of Britain and Rover suffered continuing losses and Peugeot Talbot's pre-tax profits fell by 80 per cent. However, Vauxhall has been forced to implement short-time working at both its assembly plants this year for the first time since 1982 in response to a steep fall in demand from continental European markets. Mr William Ebbert, chairman and managing director, warned market conditions in Europe were worsening and that there was 'little hope of being as productive and profitable' in 1993 as last year. The Luton assembly plant has been working a four-day week with output cut by about 15 per cent since the beginning of January, and the Ellesmere Port plant has been forced to implement four-day working since the beginning of March. Mr Ebbert forecast an increase of about 7 per cent in the UK new car market this year to 1.7m but warned that overall west European new car sales could fall by more than 1m units or about 8 per cent to 12.3m in 1993. Pre-tax profits rose by 69 per cent to Pounds 223.7m (Pounds 132.6m) on turnover ahead 16.5 per cent to Pounds 3bn (Pounds 2.57bn). The pre-tax figure was struck after currency losses of Pounds 18.9m incurred in the wake of the devaluation of the pound last September and a Pounds 28.8m write-down on Vauxhall's holding in Avis Europe, the car rental group. Vauxhall holds the parent company's 26.5 per cent stake in Cilva Holdings, the holding company for Avis Europe. However, there were no significant launch costs during the period and increased materials purchasing in the UK had helped contain costs. The results were boosted by record vehicle production at both assembly plants, with output rising by 15 per cent to 301,857. Exports, which only began in significant volumes in 1990, rose by 8 per cent to 111,700 and accounted for 37 per cent of output. New car sales in the UK rose by 7 per cent to 266,072, gaining a record market share of 16.7 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent. The improvement included the success of the new Astra range, which was launched in late 1991. There was amarginal increase in the overall UK new car market of only 0.1 per cent. Productivity rose by 8 per cent with the assembly plants, which operated at full capacity last year, having a cost advantage of more than 15 per cent against GM's continental European plants and achieving the same quality levels.</p>

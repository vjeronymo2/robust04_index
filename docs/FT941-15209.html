			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Baby Bell sets up telecoms venture US West, one of the US 'Baby Bell' telephone companies, has established a joint venture to channel up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 337.8m) into upgrading Russia's telecommunications. The Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation brings together US West's existing Russian assets, totalling Dollars 110m, Dollars 40m of equity commitments from financial investors, and Dollars 85m in debt and quasi-equity funding from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a US government agency. The funds, boosted by borrowing and receipts from existing US West investments, will be used to fund network modernisation and mobile communications projects in Russia. AT&amp;T, the US long-distance operator, has Russian investments but US West is the only one of the seven US 'Baby Bells' making a significant commitment to Russia. Its Russian operations include mobile services in St Petersburg and Moscow, and a 50 per cent stake in a company operating three international gateway telephone switches. Analysts estimate it will take Dollars 80bn-Dollars 120bn to bring Russia's telecoms network up to the level of Spain, which is itself far behind the most advanced western nations. According to CIT Research, a London-based consultancy, Russia has about 15 lines per 100 people, less than the Baltic states but significantly more than Poland and Hungary. Spain has about 35 lines per 100 people. US West's investment priorities are the '50:50 project' for modernising Russia's trunk telecommunications network, and an expansion in its number of cellular licences. It currently has eight licences, and has applied for a stake in 15 of the 60 likely to be awarded next month. Seven investors are providing the extra Dollars 40m of initial equity investment - Baring International Investment, Capital Research International, Emerging Markets Investors, GT Capital, Invesco CEAM, Montgomery Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley Asset Management.</p>

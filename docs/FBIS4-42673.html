			<p>BFN     [Text] Given the opposition she receives from a wide  spectrum, Turkey's first female prime minister may easily claim  to be today's political leader enjoying the least support from  her country. Apart from the anticipated criticism from the  opposition parties, her standing with the constitutionally  neutral president, the powerful businessmen's lobby, TUSIAD, her  junior coalition partner, SHP [Social Democrat People's Party],  and even her own party, appears to be deteriorating.    Despite her calls for a consensus on a war of economic  salvation, opposition against her is growing visibly, fed with  allegations of mismanagement and even corruption.    Does anyone support Ciller, who came to power a year ago  with  promises of change?    The Association of Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen  (TUSIAD) does not. The prime minister, who once referred to the  members of the lobby as "traitors," has already burned her  bridges.    President Suleyman Demirel, who drew Ciller into political  life as his protegee, has been angered by her efforts to put the  blame for the economic difficulties on the previous government,  which was under his own leadership.    She has also started a serious controversy with the  president  with her calls for extending the term of Chief of Staff Dogan  Gures.    Despite the displeasure shown by political circles at  "alternative government formulas," including a scenario that  involves the formation of a government by a team of technocrats  -- a throwback to 1971 -- some True Path deputies continue their  opposition to Ciller. Allegations about the involvement of her  husband in state affairs further fuelled tensions, as well as  the ambiguous financing of her trip to the United States for the  graduation of her son. A schematic look at the mounting  opposition reveals the following highlights:  <H5>  Mother Path Formula </H5>   Following the 27 March local elections, business circles  represented by TUSIAD met with opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz,  to feel his pulse on a "Mother Path" coalition between his  Motherland Party and Ciller's True Path. Yilmaz, who has  habitually advocated a Mother Path coalition on the condition  that Ciller leaves the party leadership, interpreted the move as  a signal for fiercer opposition to Ciller, calling her "a  finished-off prime minister." But he maintained that they would  form a coalition if she left her post.    Yilmaz also disclosed that business circles, who had been  warm at first toward Ciller's April 5 package, now wanted him to  "topple the government."    "They think Ciller should resign right away. Each day she is  in office costs the nation three months," Yilmaz said.  "Considering the mess she has made, it would be better that  some one who was not an economics professor was prime minister."  But he also allowed that he was powerless to topple Ciller.  "This should be done by the True Path deputies," he said.  Yilmaz's call did not fall on deaf ears. Two True Path  deputies, Koksal Toptan and Ibrahim Gurdal, said Ciller's  resignation would be the "best thing that could be done for  Turkey." Koksal advocated the Mother Path coalition.  <H5>  TUSIAD and Treason </H5>   Ciller, defending her package, said that business circles  were against it because it had not been in their interests.  "Not supporting this package would be treason," she said,  adding insult to injury.    TUSIAD's answer was no milder than the prime minister's  remark. The association, which has a long tradition of severe  opposition to governments (it had taken newspaper ads to  criticize Ecevit government in the pre-1980 era) this time used  the television. TUSIAD Chairman Halis Komili said there were two  keys to escaping from the economic crisis in the country -- the  meticulous implementation of decisions, and confidence. "The  government has lost on both counts. It gives no confidence and  has no credibility," he said.    Within 10 days, Osman Unsal, the undersecretary of Treasury  whom Ciller called "half of her brain," quit his job.  <H5>  Gures Crisis </H5>   Ciller received another setback when her conversation with  two of her ministers on extending the term of Dogan Gures was  leaked. Demirel fervently opposed the idea, saying the decision  was anyway his. Ciller, however, maintained that it was  entirely up to her to extend the term or not. The debate ended  with Gures' own remarks: "This is no time for heroism nor  gracious gestures. When the time comes, one has to transfer  one's duties to someone else proudly." Gures said a week later  that he would be resigning on September 1. But Demirel's  insistence that Ciller should see "whether she can extend the  term" created some serious discord between Demirel and Ciller,  which was displayed in Ciller's pointed absence from the  ceremony to see Demirel off on his trip to Egypt.    Meanwhile, Yilmaz accused Ciller of trying to draw the  Turkish Armed Forces into a political debate.  <H5>  Ozer Ciller Controversy </H5>   "Wherever I dig, out pops Ozer Ciller," complained Ekrem  Pakdemirli, the vice chairman of the Motherland, who deals with  economics.    Ozer Ciller's yacht, claimed to be worth TL [Turkish lira]  30  billion, was also used by Yilmaz: "Will those who cruise around  in billion-lira yachts save the people who are stricken by  poverty?" he asked.    Ciller's own party adopted a similar line: "I wish we could  take you out in disguise, so you can see the queues for bread,"  Irfan Koksalan, True Path's Ankara deputy, said in a party group  meeting. "The present situation is due to inefficiency. People  curse you and the True Path."    Koksalan also targeted Ozer Ciller, saying he should not  allow himself to be pictured in luxurious yachts. "It is  claimed that your husband is influential in the appointment of  bureaucrats and even ministers. You are the prime minister,  give him a ministerial post and let's stop the allegations," he  told Ciller.    The prime minister, who took the rostrum after those  remarks,  defended Ozer Ciller. "The yacht is not new. We bought it long  ago, but repaired it recently, so he can get some sea air. Is  this a crime?" She was quoted as saying. "It is only worth  one-tenth of the amount that is claimed."    But according to press reports, Ciller gave her ministers a  good scolding, accusing them of "not rising to the defense of  Ozer Ciller." A daily claimed that Ciller charged the ministers  of being glued to their chairs and red-plated cars. "But no one  is indispensable," she allegedly hinted.    The press was not spared Ciller's harsh words for their  articles about her husband. "You have criticized him in  everything. He could not even talk to friends. He cannot go  out. Should he just play around to pass the time?" she told a  group of journalists from HURRIYET.  <H5>  Blame-Throwing Game </H5>   Ciller's less-than-constructive statements, coupled with her  repeated attempts to lay the blame for the economic crisis on  the previous government, sent True Path delegates to President  Demirel. A subtle change was seen in the attitude of the  president, who had generally refrained from criticizing the  prime minister.    Demirel drew attention to the fact that Ciller had been the  state minister responsible from the economy in the previous  government. "If someone has been in power for 11 months,  wouldn't other people ask her what she has been doing during  that time?" Demirel said in an interview.    Demirel's criticism continued. "There is always the  possibility of resignation," he said, implying, too, that Ciller  could have resigned from the past government if she did not like  the policies adopted.    He also took a tough stance against attempts to get the  military involved in politics. "Whoever wants to use the  military as a means of support will regret the day he was born,"  he said.  <H5>  The Bill for U.S. Trip </H5>   The latest controversy to appear is over who would foot the  bill for Ciller's "private visit" to the United States in which  she was to attend her son's graduation ceremony.    The Prime Minister created much speculation by taking a  large  delegation of advisors, although she claimed the visit to be  private. She defended herself by saying that the group of  advisers, including her foreign policy adviser Volkan Vural,  would have "gone anyway." While the opposition and members of  her party criticized the visit, True Path Deputy Esat  Kiratlioglu said since she was the prime minister, "she could do  whatever she liked."    "She is not the woman next door, she is our prime minister.  Of course the state will foot the bill" he said.    Ciller ended the controversy with a statement saying that  she  would pay the whole bill herself, including the cost of the 10  rooms being kept empty on the floor of her Boston hotel.</p>

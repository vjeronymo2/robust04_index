			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BBA plans to focus on four core activities BBA, the engineering group, yesterday said it would focus on four core businesses as it reported half year profits to the end of June. In response to its critics, who have attacked the group for lacking strategic consistency, Mr Vanni Treves, chairman, said the group would concentrate on building up its automotive, industrial, aviation and electrical businesses. Mr Treves said: 'We are not oblivious to what the institutions have been telling us. However, we decided to articulate the new strategy, which has been evolving for some time, without prompting from anyone.' Operating profits increased from Pounds 40.9m to Pounds 45.3m as the group benefited from further cost cutting. The automotive business, which bore the brunt of the redundancy and reorganisation costs, saw profits fall from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13m. Industrials increased profits from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 23.7m as its businesses continued to cut costs. Aviation profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 8.6m as programmes were reduced and delivery schedules delayed because of difficulties in the worldwide aviation market. COMMENT When a company seeks to reassure investors that it has no plans to ask for more cash for the foreseeable future it is a sure sign that things are not what they ought to be. Equity issues to fund a rapid succession of deals may have looked attractive in the roaring 1980s, but not in the more sober 1990s. After six share issues in eight years, BBA's investors are understandably weary of cash calls. The share price peaked in 1986 at 274p; it yesterday fell 1p when the market rallied to close at 166p. BBA is now talking about a new stage of consolidation which involves focusing on four core businesses. It is a message many of the group's investors have longed to hear, and happens to coincide with the departure of the the managing director responsible for the empire-building. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 65m, giving earnings per share of 7.5p, the shares are on a hefty prospective multiple of 22.1. Investors should hold on unless the company goes back to its bad old ways of issuing more shares.</p>

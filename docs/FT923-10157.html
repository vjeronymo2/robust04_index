			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brierley Investments considers Gibbs Mew bid BRIERLEY Investments Limited, which holds stakes in Budgens, the supermarket chain, Alvis, the defence contractor, and Mount Charlotte, the hotels group, yesterday announced that it was considering making an offer for the 80.3 per cent of Gibbs Mew, the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property group, that its subsidiary, BIL Securities (Far East), does not already own. It said its offer would be at a premium to 138p, Gibbs Mew's share price at the time of the announcement. Gibbs Mew's shares jumped to 173p, to fall back to 168p. The possible offer hinges on certain pre-conditions: that Gibbs Mew's activities remain as normal; that it makes no disposals or acquisitions; and that it does not issue or allot any shares. Last night BIL would not comment further than its statement. Gibbs Mew was equally reticent. However, it is thought that a dispute is growing between the USM-quoted brewer and its biggest non-family shareholder over possible moves the Gibbs Mew management may be considering and the announcement of BIL's possible bid is designed to stymie the management plans. Market rumours suggest one such move might be the acquisition of a business connected with the drinks side of Gibbs Mew's operations. Gibbs Mew was founded in the 1850s by the great-grandfather of Mr Peter Gibbs, the current chairman. Some 58 per cent of the equity is held by Mr Gibbs, his three daughters and his son. BIL was founded by Sir Ron Brierley, who was ousted in a boardroom coup in 1989 by Mr Bruce Hancox, the current chairman, and Mr Paul Collins, chief executive.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Economics: Financial markets to dominate FINANCIAL market developments are likely to dominate the headlines further this week in the run up to France's September 20 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and following last Friday's gloomy US employment report. But some important inflation indicators will also be announced. In Britain, last month's retail price inflation will be published on Friday. August normally sees a rise in seasonal food prices and certain shop prices as summer sales end. However, only a very courageous retailer would have raised prices significantly last month when lack of consumer confidence continued to keep people away from the high streets. As a result, analysts expect only a modest month-on-month rise following the 0.4 per cent fall in the RPI in July, the sharpest monthly fall for 25 years. US producer price inflation is expected to show a similarly subdued trend after prices rose by just 0.1 per cent in July. With consumer confidence and demand remaining low, US manufacturers are finding it difficult to raise prices, a situation that is unlikely to change in the near future. Other economic highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts, from MMS International. Today: UK, July credit business (down Pounds 50m); housing starts and completions; week long annual conference of Trades Union Congress begins in Blackpool.

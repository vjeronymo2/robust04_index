			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Lucas Mangope has vacated his presidential  residence in Mmabatho, and several of his cabinet members,  including the chief negotiator of Bophuthatswana, Mr. Rowan  Cronje, have resigned. The commissioner of police, General P.  Seleke, is also out of office.    This follows an announcement by the South African Government  that its ambassador, Dr. Tjaart van der Walt, has taken over as  acting administrator of the homeland. Dr. van der Walt said at  a news conference that Mr. Mangope had accepted that he was no  longer in power. He had returned to his house at Matswedi and  measures had been taken to ensure his safety. Dr. van der Walt  said the joint South Africa and Bophuthatswana security forces  had succeeded in stabilizing the situation in the homeland. Dr.  van der Walt said there would now be free political activity in  Bophuthatswana, South African constitutional regulations would  apply, and South African officials could be seconded to assist  with the administration of the homeland.    Shops would be able to reopen from tomorrow, and glass  companies had been approached to repair broken display windows  to discourage further looting. It was hoped to have schools  reopened as soon as possible, and steps would be taken to get  the television services back on the air. Dr. van der Walt  appealed to striking public servants to return to work, and said  their salaries and pensions were secure.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / 'Foul' cried over football tournament ticket system The Football Association was accused yesterday of encouraging a black market in tickets for the 1996 European football championship, by unfairly requiring fans to buy tickets they do not want. The tournament is to be hosted by England. Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary responsible for sport, said: 'The aim of ensuring that the real fans get the best chance for tickets is a sensible one, but the Football Association appears to have devised a system which, perhaps inadvertently, will not end up with this aim fulfilled. Furthermore, it will facilitate the starting up of an illegal black market.' FA rules mean that a fan wanting one Pounds 60 ticket for the Wembley final must spend at least Pounds 280 on a total of 11 tickets. For one final ticket, fans must buy two for the semi-finals, two for the quarters, and two for each of three group games - even if they want only one for each. The tickets went on general sale last Thursday on a 'progressive loyalty' basis: To buy tickets for the final knock-out stages of the competition - the quarter-, semi- and final matches - fans must buy tickets for at least three matches from the earlier group stage. To qualify to buy one ticket for the final, fans must buy two for the semis. To qualify to buy semi-final tickets, supporters must buy two for the quarter-finals. However, they cannot buy more tickets for the knock-out matches than for the group games, so they must buy two tickets for each of the three group games - even if they want only one. Supporters say the unwanted tickets will deprive other fans of the chance to see games and encourage fans to become ticket touts. 'Without question, this system will create a black market,' said Mr Steve Beauchampe, international officer of the Football Supporters' Association. Mr Mike Parry of the FA said he hoped that love of the game would compel holders of spare tickets to pass them on to true fans. Imposing a penalty, Page 7</p>

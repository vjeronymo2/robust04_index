			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Norwich Union switches agents to salaries Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, yesterday switched its life and pensions sales agents from commission to salaries. The move is part of a re-structuring of its direct sales operation, which will see a sharp cut in its sales force. Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager, said there would be a new sales force - Norwich Union Financial Services - which was intended to expand to be 300 to 400-strong in three years' time, in contrast to the existing life and pensions sales force of 500. In March the insurer announced that it was suspending its entire sales force for a month for re-training, after the life industry's regulator identified breakdowns in management control. Instead of being paid by commission on the policies they sell sales agents in the new operation will receive a basic annual salary of Pounds 12,000 as well as commission. The number of Norwich Union branch offices is to be almost halved, from 25 to 13. The reduction in the sales force and the restructuring of payments are signs of the pressures affecting the life industry. A new regime of giving the customer more information about products, including the commission paid to sales agents, is to be introduced from the beginning of next year. Traditional life companies are also facing increasing competition from entrants to the market, such as building societies, while the volumes of new business are flat and likely to remain so for a while. As well as the new sales force, Norwich Union will have a separate team of about 20 sales agents, paid entirely by salary and devoted solely to dealing with the insurer's past sales of personal pensions to those transferring out of occupational schemes. The insurer has 5,000 such cases. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to publish a report soon giving guidance to companies on how to identify and compensate those who have suffered as a result of following poor advice on pensions. Mr Scott said work on the change of strategy began last October. It reflected a need to move from a culture in which insurers regarded service as an optional addition to sales, to one where service to customers was paramount. He said he would be surprised if there was still a large industry sales force paid entirely by commission in a couple of years. Among other large insurers, Legal &amp; General and Allied Dunbar currently pay sales agents only on the basis of commission.</p>

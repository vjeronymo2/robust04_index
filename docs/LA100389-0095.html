			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USX PUTS RESERVES OF TEXAS OIL &amp; GAS UNIT ON THE BLOCK  </P> <P> As part of an ongoing restructuring to lower debt and bolster its stock price,  steel and energy giant USX Corp. said Monday that it will sell off the oil and  gas reserves of its unprofitable Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary, which  USX bought in 1986 for $3 billion.  </P> <P> The company declined to put a value on the reserves -- "we wouldn't want to  limit the imagination of potential buyers," said USX spokesman Don H. Herring.  But analysts estimated their worth at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.  </P> <P> At the end of 1988, the reserves included 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural  gas and 28 million barrels of oil in six states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,  Louisiana, Colorado and Kansas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consistent With Strategy  </P> <P> Proceeds from a sale would provide the company with cash to buy back stock and  to help pay down long-term debt, which stood at $5.85 billion at the end of the  second quarter, Herring said.  </P> <P> The sale would also be consistent with the company's recent strategy of selling  off assets to streamline operations and guard against possible takeovers.  </P> <P> "The mandate is to bring shareholder value, and one way is to take major assets  that are not contributing to the bottom line and convert them into something  that will," said George Gaspar, an oil industry analyst with Robert W. Baird  &amp; Co. in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Former USX Chairman and Chief Executive David M. Roderick drew criticism when  he engineered the deal valued at $3 billion to buy Texas Oil in exchange for  133 million newly issued shares of stock. Charles Corry assumed Roderick's job  June 1.  </P> <P> USX based its hopes of profitability on the eventual bursting of the natural  gas "bubble," or oversupply, analysts said.  </P> <P> Now, the company admits that the unit's performance has disappointed its  corporate parent.  </P> <P> Texas Oil reported an operating loss of $31 million in 1988, compared to  operating income of $2 million in 1987, Herring said.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the situation in the natural gas marketplace has had a depressing  impact on TXO's profitability," Herring said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stock Undervalued  </P> <P> Texas Oil's inconsistent profitability has hurt USX's per-share earnings at a  time when USX's steel operations are rebounding and demand has been strong for  refined petroleum products, analysts said.  </P> <P> At the end of the second quarter, USX reported net income of $250 million, up  17% over a year ago. Sales totaled $5 billion, up 16%.  </P> <P> But the company's stock price remains undervalued, with some analysts saying it  is worth as much as $50 to $55 per share.  </P> <P> Following Monday's announcement, USX stock closed up $1.75 at $34.875 on  trading of 2.8 million shares, the second highest volume on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> USX hopes to strike a deal by the end of the year. Herring would not discuss  potential buyers, except to say, "There seems to be a lot of interest now in  obtaining oil and gas reserves -- particularly gas reserves -- so it looks like  it's an improving market at this point."  </P> <P> Demand for natural gas is also expected to increase in the wake of impending  clean air rules.  </P> <P> Analysts mentioned Pennzoil Co. as a logical buyer, especially since it still  has about half of its $3-billion settlement from its damage suit against  Texaco. A Pennzoil spokesman declined to comment.  </P> <P> Other potential buyers include Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Phillips  Petroleum Co., analysts said.  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Security tight as Sri Lankans hold elections Sri Lanka's opposition People's Alliance appeared to be ahead early today in the island's parliamentary election, opening the door to the possibility of the ruling United National Party's first defeat in 17 years, according to unofficial returns. Final election results were not expected until later today and there have been no reliable opinion polls. The UNP has won every national election since 1977 but political analysts said the socialist People's Alliance appeared to have a chance of winning. Early this morning unnamed officials were quoted as saying that the five-party opposition alliance had won approaching half the 160 electoral precincts from which the 225 members of parliament will be chosen in a complex system of direct election and proportional representation. Yesterday the government imposed a state of emergency and over 40,000 policemen and thousands of soldiers patrolled the streets to prevent more of the violence that scarred a campaign in which 24 died. The opposition coalition has promised to restructure the government by stripping the presidency of many of its powers so the prime minister and parliament would have more control. It pledged to negotiate with guerrillas fighting for a Tamil homeland. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the 11-year-old revolt. Over 75 per cent of Sri Lanka's 11m voters cast ballots, officials said. Observers from the US, Britain and other nations monitored the polls, tainted by fraud in the past. Sri Lanka has seen unprecedented economic growth under UNP rule. But many Sri Lankans have expressed concern about signs of corruption and nepotism and evidence prosperity was not filtering down to the poor.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Perez de Cuellar joins race for Peruvian presidency Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary general, has announced that he will run for the presidency of Peru for the period 1995-2000. The decision will pit the 74-year-old diplomat against both serving President Alberto Fujimori - expected to confirm in coming days that he will seek re-election - and Mr Fujimori's wife, Ms Susana Higuchi. Ms Higuchi has formed her own opposition political movement and will run for the presidency if she can ensure a law impeding her candidacy is quashed. In a brief and low-key announcement made before a small gathering of press and key supporters, Mr Perez de Cuellar gave only general outlines of future policy. Like most of Mr Fujimori's opponents, Mr Perez de Cuellar was obliged to recognise the advances made in Peru in the past four years. Unlike others, he was able to remind his listeners that he himself had assisted Mr Fujimori in designing 'the indispensable corrections in economic policy' made in 1990. In what appeared to be an attempt to calm the nerves of local and foreign businessmen, who fear he could represent a return to more a socialist line, Mr Perez de Cuellar promised: 'What has already been achieved will be perfected. . . (but with) democracy, genuine stability, development and jobs.' With the first round more than six months away, it is too soon for reliable opinion polls. A nationwide poll by the Apoyo organisation last weekend showed Mr Fujimori currently enjoys 44 per cent support and Mr Perez de Cuellar 24 per cent. Ms Higuchi is trailing with only 6 per cent. According to the same poll, the qualities most admired in the current president are his capacity for hard work, his decisiveness, his preoccupation with the poor, his knowledge of Peruvian reality and his honesty (although conversely, among his failings, 17 per cent of those polled dubbed him a liar). Meanwhile, Mr Perez de Cuellar's strengths in Peruvian eyes centre on his international prestige, his experience and his commitment to democracy. It is easy to make the charge - and Mr Fujimori has already done so - that the former diplomat, who has lived most of his life outside Peru, is unfamiliar with national problems. Mr Perez de Cuellar's retort is, 'I've spent 40 years serving my country, Mr Fujimori four'. Many observers question whether Mr Perez de Cuellar has the will, or indeed the physical stamina, for what promises to be a bruising six-month campaign. Certainly, he seems to have stood up well so far to five weeks' intensive travelling in the hinterland where, he says, he has found 'vast areas of poverty. . . (and) a systematic ill-treatment of institutions'. Although presidential candidates and new movements are now proliferating in advance of the October 9 deadline for registration, Mr Fujimori remains in the driving seat. Largely ignoring both his wife and other potential opponents, he devotes most of his working week to travelling in the provinces, inaugurating schools and newly-resurfaced roads. Mr Fujimori acts like a man whose mission to change the face of Peru is unfulfilled. With undeniable, and concrete, achievements to point to, he will prove a formidable opponent. Nevertheless, Mr Perez de Cuellar could prove a welcome alternative for those Peruvians who distrust Mr Fujimori's authoritarian leanings and disapprove of his 1992 overturning of democracy.</p>

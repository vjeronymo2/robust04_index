			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 8 (AFP) -- Fierce fighting kept up  Friday [8 April] in the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde as a  24-hour ceasefire failed to take hold in Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN  spokesman and Serb reports said.    Charles Redman, the special US envoy for ex-Yugoslavia,  arrived in Sarajevo Friday to try to help efforts to reach an  overall ceasefire agreement, a UN spokesman said.    The 24-hour truce was to have started Thursday evening and  cover all remaining battlefronts in Bosnia.    But "there has been no real ceasefire in Gorazde, the  shelling has continued," said UN spoksman Major Rob Annink  Friday, as both Sarajevo radio and the TANJUG news agency in  Belgrade reported new fighting there Friday.    Redman immediately held talks with General Michael Rose, who  was to meet again Friday with Bosnian and Serb military leaders  to present them with a new ceasefire proposal, according to a UN  spokesman who would not give any details on its contents.    Rose spent Thursday trying to get the Bosnian and Serb  generals, Rasim Delic and Ratko Mladic, to the negotiating  table, notably to stop the Serb offensive around Gorazde in  eastern Bosnia that has left 67 dead and 325 injured among the  population in nine days.    After shuttling back and forth between Sarajevo and  Serb-controlled Lukavica, Rose had announced the two sides  agreed in principle to a 24-hour cooling-off period that was to  have started at 6:00 p.m. Thursday.    But the truce was immediately violated and the sitaution in  Gorazde "remains tense," according to the UN Protection Force  which since Thursday has 13 military observers and liaison  officers in Gorazde.    Redman meanwhile was due to meet Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic later Friday, a Bosnian Government source said. The  U.S. envoy would then head on to the Serb stronghold of Pale  just west [as received] of Sarajevo before returning to Belgrade.    Annink, the UN spokesman, said Friday that Serb forces were  about five or six kilometers (three to four miles) from the  center of Gorazde and were using smokescreens to camouflage  their movements. [passage omitted]    Annink, meanwhile, said that Serb forces had captures "less  territory than we thought" around Gorazde and now controlled  about five percent of the enclave, in its southeastern sector.    He said they had penetrated an area about three kilometers  (1.8 miles) deep and about 10 kilometers (six miles) wide into  the enclave.    This differed with a report, seen by journalists, by  military  observers in Gorazde dated last Tuesday saying the mainly Moslem  Bosnian Army had lost 10 percent of the enclave and that the  front line was only three kilometers from the center of Gorazde.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / All sides in Bosnia suspected Carrington equally LORD Carrington's resignation yesterday as chairman of the European Community-sponsored peace conference heralds what may be the end of his active involvement in the Yugoslav peace process. Many diplomats believed the former British foreign secretary, who in 1979 chaired the Lancaster House Conference which led to the end of the Rhodesian war and the emergence of Zimbabwe, could crack the Balkan problem. Instead, the Balkan conflict conquered Lord Carrington. As a Briton he was viewed with suspicion by the Croats. On the one hand, the government in Zagreb saw him as a representative of the traditional pro-Serbian stance of the British establishment. Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman resented his persistence in insisting that the ethnic rights of the Serb minority had to be protected in an independent Croatia even as its historic port city of Dubrovnik was being bombarded. But the Serbs did not like Lord Carrington either, particularly when the EC bowed to German pressure in recognising Croatia's independence in January 1992, before any political settlement was reached on dissolving Yugoslavia. 'Carrington was always criticised. Croatia and Serbia did not see that Carrington was not the EC. He could only make recommendations to it,' said one British official. The criticism of Lord Carrington intensified after the talks in Lisbon in March which in effect established the basis for a constitutional settlement for the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Bosnia's Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban and backed by Mr Tudjman, and Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and backed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, agreed to the plan, which envisaged the establishment of cantons in Bosnia. Although Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic accepted the plan, the Moslems  -43 per cent of the republic's 4.3m people - believed the cantonisation process would lead eventually to the creation of ethnically homogenous regions in a republic which until recently was an ethnic patchwork. 'Were this plan to be realised, Croatia and Serbia could easily annex Croat- and Serb-inhabited territories of our country,' a senior Bosnian official said. 'Had the Moslems stuck to the plan, we might have avoided war in Bosnia,' an EC official involved in the negotiations on Bosnia said. From March onwards, Bosnia's Moslems became increasingly suspicious of Lord Carrington, believing he was intent on 'morally equating' all sides in the war in Bosnia. 'That was not what he was trying to do,' said a UK official. 'The point is that Carrington had to talk to all sides in the war. He could not afford to close the door on any one side, because if he did, it would be more difficult to bring them back again to the negotiating table.' But the gap between the bloody fighting on the ground in Sarajevo, and the world of gilded diplomacy in European capitals, infuriated the city's besieged inhabitants. 'There were many times that we were being asked to sit at a table as our republic was being bombarded by those sitting at that table as well. There is no room for moral equations in this war,' said a Bosnian foreign ministry official.'</p>

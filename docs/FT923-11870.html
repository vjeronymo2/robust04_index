			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Council mortgage scheme launched COUNCIL tenants will soon be able to convert rent payments into part ownership of their homes, according to a government consultation paper published yesterday, Bethan Hutton writes. The rents-to-mortgages scheme, a manifesto promise, is aimed at local-authority tenants in England and Wales who cannot afford to exercise their full right to buy. Under the scheme's proposals, tenants will be able to take out a mortgage on an equity share of their homes, with repayments equal to, or greater than, their current rent. They will also be entitled to a discount on the purchase price, in proportion to the amount of equity they take on. The remaining equity share will stay in the hands of the local authority but can be bought out later. Sir George Young, the housing minister, launching the scheme at an Institute of Housing seminar, said it would extend choice and opportunity for local authority tenants. 'It could offer them a way of using money they would have given to the landlord to acquire a stake in their home,' he said. The scheme is likely to form part of a Housing, Land and Urban Development bill in November.</p>

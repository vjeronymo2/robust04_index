			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin dismissed acting  administration head of Nizhny Novgorod Dmitriy Bednyakov for  "flagrant misconduct."    The regional Governor Boris Nemtsov appointed his deputy  Ivan  Sklyarov to act as Nizhnyy Novgorod mayor.    Officials in the regional administration explained to  Interfax that the misconduct lay in Bednyakov's refusal to carry  out Governor Nemtsov's order to cancel the referendum on the  city charter draft. The refusal destabilized the city and the  region, discredited the authorities and made their joint work  impossible.    Nemtsov said at a news conference Wednesday that "continuous  rallies, picketing, ballot rigging and a large-scale  anti-Semitic campaign could not be described as stability."</p>

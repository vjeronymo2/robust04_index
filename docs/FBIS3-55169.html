The draft was submitted to the  president at the end of last year. Yeltsin discussed its  details with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and several other  leading figures.    The sources say the president had questioned several key  provisions of the draft.    The sources believe the resignation of Vice-Premiers  Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Shakhray is a decided issue. They  also feel Vice-Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha are  going to be dropped from the cabinet too. As for Anatoliy  Chubays, it is not clear whether he is going to leave the  government altogether or remain the head of the State Property  Committee without being a vice-premier.</p>

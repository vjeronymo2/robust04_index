			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] At 0800 on 25 January, the Vietnamese communist  puppet ringleaders -- including (Kieng Savantha) of the  Vietnamese communist puppet General Staff; a number of generals  serving as deputy commanders in the 4th Military Zone; the  provincial chief and deputy chiefs; district chiefs; and many  military officers at the rank of colonel, major, and captain --  organized a meeting at a Siem Reap hotel. They were to announce  their support for the three-point conditions of the puppets Hun  Sen and Chea Sim and the Cambodian People's Party, and their  rejection of the king father's five-point policy. They forced  over 1,000 people from the market places and officials from  various offices to attend the meeting.    After they had been speaking for about two minutes, three or  four bombs exploded in the middle of the mass meeting, killing  three officers at the rank of colonel and brigadier general,  three provincial officials, two district officials, and six  policemen. The others fled in great alarm. The lower part of  (Kieng Savantha's) trousers was hit and torn by a bomb fragment.  He fled in great alarm. The other military personnel and  policemen also fled from the crowd.    The people there were frightened, but they felt very happy  about this development. It showed that a number of people and  parasoldiers [puok para] [troops of the Khmer People's National  Liberation Front] arranged this attack against the Vietnamese  communist puppets who have bullied, starved, and forced the  people to fight and die for them.

Applications for this  device--whose demand is indicated by a 200 percent growth rate  abroad over the past few years--include indicators, gunsights,  optical disk storage, bar code scanners, and laser printers.  For interested manufacturers, equipment investment costs are  about 5 million yuan, which should generate an output value of  15 million yuan within 3 years, after which profits should begin.</p>

It has emerged that an unidentified criminal or group of  criminals set off two large explosions.    We think that what you can see on your screens requires no  comment.    The explosion seriously damaged not only the building of one  of the Security Ministry's services, but also the neighboring  buildings of the Meteorological Center of the Academy of  Sciences and the Defense Ministry's Military Academy.  Fortunately, neither the students at the Military Academy, nor  the security service officials on a night shift in the building  were injured.    The material damage is probably worth hundreds of millions  [no denomination as received] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Ministers hint at retreat over BR franchise bids THE government yesterday signalled the possibility of a retreat over its plans to exclude British Rail from bidding for passenger franchises once privatisation of the network is under way. Ministers acknowledged that it might now prove impossible to overturn in the House of Commons an amendment passed by the Lords allowing BR to bid for franchises. More than a dozen Conservative MPs had indicated they were determined to support the amendment, wiping out the government's majority among MPs. But ministers are to explore at this week's Conservative conference in Blackpool the possibility of a deal with the rebels which might restrict the conditions under which BR - as opposed to BR managers - could compete. When the Lords amendment was first passed in the summer, ministers warned that it could wreck the whole basis of the planned privatisation - turning it effectively into a process of compulsory competitive tendering. With a majority in the Commons ranged against them, that message has been gradually toned down. One minister said yesterday that the government remained determined that the arrangements for BR managers to bid should remain in place but that did not exclude the possibility of separate BR bids. One Tory backbench MP said yesterday there were signs the government might move towards the rebel position. Sir Keith Speed, the rebel leader, had met ministers during the summer to discuss the way ahead. But Sir Keith, the usually loyal Conservative MP for Ashford, is to spend conference week in Qatar, where he is on a parliamentary visit.</p>

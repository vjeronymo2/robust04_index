			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY  </P> <P> The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's response (Oct. 15) to the editorial entitled "The  Freedom to Decide" was, to say the least, quite interesting.  </P> <P> The crux of his argument is that homosexuality is not prescribed in the genetic  code. My question for the reverend is: Since when is bigotry contained in the  genetic code?  </P> <P> Sheldon states that the act of sodomy is the underlying connection of  homosexuals. And I ask: Is prejudice not the common link of bigots? And most  unfortunately, I know of no reparative therapy or medical treatment for those  who desire change.  </P> <P> KENT NEAL  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

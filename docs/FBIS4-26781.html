			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 26 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Li  Guiren has been released from prison after serving a sentence  for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, friends said  Sunday. Li, 51, was released Saturday from his prison in the  central city of Xian. The sources said he was weak and in poor  health.    The former journalist was arrested June 26, 1989. He was  sentenced to five years jail for "anti-revolutionary propaganda"  in February 1991. The dissident had organised a strike at the  Xian publishing house where he was chief editor and openly  supported deposed Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang during the  pro-democracy demonstrations that were brutally suppressed in  1989. He was freed on parole in February 1993 for medical  treatment after suffering severe heart problems but continued  his pro-democracy activities and was imprisoned again in  February of this year.    Li's family said he was refused proper treatment while in  hospital.</p>

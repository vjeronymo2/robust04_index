			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Employers short of school leavers The decline in recruitment of 16-year-old school leavers has been halted, but employers are facing growing difficulties in finding appropriate youths because so many are staying on at school, says an Industrial Relations Services survey. The survey of 167 organisations found that one in six employers recruiting 16-year-olds was experiencing difficulty. 'Even at this stage of the economic recovery, a significant proportion of recruiters is finding it difficult to find suitable school leavers,' say the authors. Almost 70 per cent of 16-year-olds now stay on in full-time education and employers say that they face a shrinking pool of potential recruits who will be progressively less well-qualified. Employers are beginning to return to the school-leaver market but the increase in activity is small. According to the survey, 45 per cent of respondents said they would be recruiting, compared with 38 per cent in the 1993 survey. On average, school leavers will be offered starting salaries of Pounds 6,381 a year. Jobs with training provided tend to be less well paid.

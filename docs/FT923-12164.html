			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Sakura Bank to issue new bond SAKURA Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, is preparing to issue Dollars 800m (Pounds 418m) perpetual subordinated bonds in the international market to shore up its depleted capital base. The move is likely to herald a wave of similar issues by other Japanese banks following a decision by the Ministry of Finance to sanction new types of capital-raising bonds. The sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market has undermined the capital-to-assets ratios of Japanese banks. Most of the Japanese banks' Tier II, or non-equity, capital consists of unrealised gains on stock holdings. At the end of the past financial year in March, Sakura had a capital ratio of 7.92 per cent. It was alone among the 11 commercial or 'city' banks failing to meet the 8 per cent limit set by the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy. However, the Nikkei stock market average has fallen by a further 18 per cent since the end of March, eroding Tier II capital at other leading banks. The banks have tried to alleviate the problem by suppressing asset growth and by seeking subordinated loans from domestic life assurers. However, if the stock market slump continues, banks will have to restrain further loan growth. In addition, some of the banks are close to their limits of subordinated loans - 50 per cent of Tier I capital. Sakura said it would boost its capital ratio by 0.3 per cent by issuing perpetual subordinated bonds. However, bankers point out that issuance of bonds is a last resort. 'The ministry has been cautious in allowing Japanese banks to issue such bonds due to the higher interest rates on the bonds,' said a Japanese banker. The perpetual floating-rate note market was popular in the early 1980s but fell in 1986. Bankers point out that such events added to the reluctance of the Ministry of Finance in permitting Japanese banks to reopen the market. However, the decision by the ministry comes when Japanese institutional investors have begun to review their investment strategies. Many face large losses on portfolios due to the falls in stock prices, and are becoming increasingly reluctant to commit funds to new investments.  -------------------------------------------------------   MAJOR BANKS' BIS RATIOS AT DIFFERENT NIKKEI LEVELS  ------------------------------------------------------- Nikkei         Tier 1       Tier 2       BIS  ------------------------------------------------------- 15,000          4.6          2.7         7.3 17,000          4.6          3.0         7.6 20,000          4.6          3.6         8.2  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Kleinwort Benson International  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

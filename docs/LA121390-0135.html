			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD COOKING: MAKE YOUR HOLIDAY INDULGENCE BITTERSWEET  </P> <P> Even with the current emphasis on health and fitness, the mere mention of  chocolate makes most people extremely hungry. It is the just reward for going  that extra mile, the special indulgence that eases any other food sacrifice.  </P> <P> And since holiday celebrations make extravagance acceptable, there's every  reason to make that extravagance chocolate. The following desserts reinforce  chocolate's finest features: its seductive smoothness, its richness and its  deep, dark, satisfying flavor. All do-aheads, each chocolate recipe makes an  elegant presentation.  </P> <P> The chocolate mille-feuille is the quickest and easiest to prepare with a 1-2-3  last-minute assembly. The glazed frozen fudge cake is served partially frozen,  making it a refreshing dessert. The chocolate pecan torte with strawberry  butter cream is a show-stopper on a dessert buffet table in both appearance and  taste.  </P> <P> While most of your guests are sure to go for the chocolate, it's still a good  idea to serve fresh fruit alongside. Berries are the most versatile choice, and  they make a delicious complement to chocolate. Fresh orange segments in a light  syrup work well with chocolate, too.  </P> <P>  This is a wonderfully easy dessert that satisfies chocolate cravings without  being too rich. The thinnest sheets of chocolate are used as puff pastry; they  are cut into rectangles to resemble Napoleons or into any other shape that fits  your fancy. (Cookie cutters offer a wide range of holiday shapes.) Use them to  loosely sandwich raspberry sorbet, ice cream or frozen yogurt. Obviously, many  other flavors would work well too. Arranged on a dessert plate sauced with  raspberry sauce and dotted with fresh raspberries, the presentation belies its  ease. Easily doubled or tripled, the chocolate mille-feuilles keep well in the  refrigerator or freezer.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE MILLE-FEUILLE WITH RASPBERRY SORBET AND FRESH RASPBERRIES  </P> <P> 4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons oil  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed, pureed and strained, chilled  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon raspberry liqueur, optional  </P> <P> 1 pint raspberry sorbet, ice cream, or frozen yogurt  </P> <P> 1/2 pint raspberries  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon powdered sugar  </P> <P> Grease baking sheet and line with parchment paper. (It's important that paper  stay flat. Weight at corners, if necessary.) Use pencil to trace 9x7-inch  rectangle. Set aside.  </P> <P> Melt chocolate and oil in double boiler over gently simmering water or in  microwave oven in microwaveable dish on (MEDIUM-HIGH) 75% power. Stir just  until smooth. Pour into center of rectangle. Quickly spread chocolate with  small rubber spatula to fill rectangle. Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes.  </P> <P> Use pizza cutter to cut vertically in half. Then cut each half crosswise into 4  equal rectangular pieces (about 3 1/2x2 1/4 inches). Or cut chocolate into any  other desired shapes. Carefully peel pieces off paper and transfer to airtight  tin, placing wax paper between pieces. Refrigerate or freeze. Use thawed but  chilled.  </P> <P> To assemble, combine pureed raspberries with liqueur. Swirl enough raspberry  sauce on dessert plate to coat. Let sorbet soften. Center plate with chocolate.  Arrange scoop as desired. Top loosely with another chocolate piece at angle.  Dust lightly with powdered sugar. Arrange raspberries on sauce. Serve  immediately. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  Here, dense, fudge-like layers are filled with cocoa-flavored whipped cream.  Topped with a velvety glaze, it's a chocolate dessert that appeals to all ages.  </P> <P> GLAZED FROZEN FUDGE CAKE  </P> <P> 16 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 1/2 cup unsalted butter  </P> <P> 5 eggs  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> Cream Filling  </P> <P> Glaze  </P> <P> Grease 2 (9-inch) layer cake pans. Line bottom of pans with circle of parchment  paper. Grease paper. Set aside.  </P> <P> Melt chocolate and butter in top of double boiler over gently simmering water  or in microwave in microwave-safe dish at 75% power. Transfer to large mixing  bowl.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, beat eggs, sugar and salt in electric mixer until very thick, fluffy  and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Stir flour and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Add 1/4 whipped mixture. Stir  well to combine. Fold in remaining whipped mixture. Divide batter between  prepared pans. Bang pans on counter to settle batter.  </P> <P> Bake at 400 degrees on center oven rack until wood pick inserted into center  comes out fudgy but not wet, about 8 to 9 minutes, rotating pans midway if they  appear to be baking unevenly. Surface will be slightly cracked. Let cool in  pans on wire rack. When completely cool, use flexible knife to separate cake  from sides of pan and gently invert onto rack. Remove paper. (Layers can be  frozen up to 3 months, wrapped airtight.)  </P> <P> Spread Cream Filling on bottom layer. Top with remaining layer, smooth side up.  Place in freezer. Once frozen, wrap airtight. Can be frozen as long as 3 weeks.  </P> <P> Pour Glaze over top of cake. Spread most on top with thin coating on sides. Can  be frozen as long as 3 days, once glazed, wrapped airtight after it is frozen  solid.  </P> <P> To serve, let stand in refrigerator 1 hour until semi-frozen. Use serrated  knife to cut into serving pieces. Makes 10 to 14 servings.  </P> <P> Cream Filling  </P> <P> 1 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons cocoa powder  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> Combine cream, cocoa and sugar.

Stir in vanilla. Place in  refrigerator just until slightly thickened but still flowing.  </P> <P>  Chocolate makes this torte extremely rich, moist and dense. Strawberry butter  cream is spread between the layers, and a thin chocolate glaze coats the  surface. The chocolate-dipped strawberries garnish the top. Fortunately for  those with a lot of last-minute shopping, its flavor is greatly enhanced when  made in advance and refrigerated. Fresh strawberries and raspberries, tossed in  a little sugar and raspberry liqueur, make a great accompaniment.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE-PECAN TORTE WITH STRAWBERRY BUTTER CREAM  </P> <P> 12 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  </P> <P> 8 eggs  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons vanilla  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 3 1/2 cups pecans, very finely ground in food processor  </P> <P> Strawberry Butter Cream  </P> <P> Chocolate Glaze  </P> <P> 8 medium strawberries, with tops  </P> <P> Butter 4 (9-inch) round cake pans and fit bottoms with rounds of parchment  paper.

Stir in chocolate and pecans until combined. Divide batter  between pans. If baking layers in sequence, leave batter at room temperature.  </P> <P> Bake at 375 degrees on 2 center oven racks until wood pick inserted in center  comes out fudgy but not wet, about 22 minutes. Reverse pans on rack if they  appear to be baking unevenly. There will be cracks on top. Cool in pans 5  minutes. Use flexible spatula or knife to loosen torte from sides of pan.  Gently invert onto cooling rack. Peel off paper and cool completely. Layers may  be wrapped separately in plastic bags and refrigerated 2 days or frozen for as  long as 3 months. If frozen, bring to room temperature while still wrapped.  </P> <P> To assemble, place 1 torte layer bottom-side-up on cake plate. Work 4 strips of  wax paper under torte to protect plate. Spread generous 2/3 cup Strawberry  Butter Cream evenly over surface. Carefully set another layer, bottom side up,  on top and spread with same amount of butter cream. Repeat with 1 more layer.  Top with fourth layer, bottom side up. Refrigerate overnight to set. Once  chilled and firm, use hands to gently compress layers to make them uniformly  straight.  </P> <P> To finish, pour Chocolate Glaze over cake, allowing to drip down sides. With  long icing knife or spatula, spread smoothly over top, then sides. Split 8  strawberries lengthwise. Holding end with greens, dip strawberries into  remaining Glaze to coat bottom 2/3 of each. Place strawberries at equal  intervals around edge of torte, with hulls on edge and strawberries pointing  inward. Refrigerate cake and any remaining Glaze at least 4 hours or as long as  1 day.

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EX-PRODIGY'S PRODIGIOUS MEMORY MAKES RECALL OF NUMBERS EASY AS PI;  </P> <P> THE MIND: IN 1981, RAJAN SRINIVASEN MAHADEVAN QUALIFIED FOR GUINNESS BOOK OF  WORLD RECORDS BY RECITING 31,811 DIGITS OF PI. BUT HE CAN STILL FORGET WHERE HE  PUT HIS KEYS.  </P> <P> It's only fitting that Rajan's story begin with a number: MYX1689, the number  that started it all.  </P> <P> MYX554 was the license plate on the second car that pulled up to the house in  Mangalore, India, where his parents were having a party. MYX558 was the third.  </P> <P> Some other 5-year-old might have sung a song or passed hors d'oeuvres to show  off to the grown-ups: Rajan Srinivasen Mahadevan recited the license plates of  all 40 cars in the order in which they had been parked.  </P> <P> That was the first anyone knew of Rajan's astonishing memory. Twenty-seven  years later, millions know of it, and there are days when he wishes he had sung  a song or passed hors d'oeuvres.  </P> <P> A memory that can hold fast to 31,811 random numbers yet persistently forgets  where keys have been left is a curious thing, a wondrous oddity that can bring  opportunity, fame -- perhaps even immortality -- to its owner.  </P> <P> But what of the other things a man has -- humor, creativity, intellect?  </P> <P> "This damn thing overpowers everything else, to a point," Rajan said.  </P> <P> As a child, he said in the fluid, accented English he was reared with, "I used  to be so lost in my own thoughts, I would talk to myself. It was hard to fit  in. Other kids didn't know what to make of me."  </P> <P> Rajan's memory was not unexpected. "It's like John Lennon's son and music," he  said. His father, a prominent surgeon, knows all 2,156 lines of William  Shakespeare's 154 sonnets.  </P> <P> "I was expected to make it big in life. But my academic career was like the  drawing of a mountain range."  </P> <P> Rajan tried engineering and business administration but felt no affinity for  either. Then, someone suggested that he put his memory to the test by trying to  win a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.  </P> <P> He began studying a computer printout of the first 200,000 decimal places of  pi, the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle. Pi, the  ultimate test of numerical memory, begins 3.14159, then continues on  indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern. Two Columbia University  mathematicians recently calculated pi to 480 million decimal places.  </P> <P> On June 12, 1980, Rajan flew to Chicago, where he stunned the fifth  International Congress on Yoga and Meditation by reciting the first 10,000  numbers.  </P> <P> On July 5, 1981, he stood before a capacity crowd in a Mangalore meeting hall  and rattled off numbers so quickly that the judges could barely keep up. For  three hours and 49 minutes, his memory never faltered. Then, finally, a lapse:  He forgot the 31,812th digit of pi -- a 5.  </P> <P> Never mind. The record -- 20,013 -- had toppled. "On Feb. 16, 1983, I saw my  name in the Book of Records, and I relaxed. That was the argument stopper.  Until then, people could say: 'So you have a good memory, so what?'  </P> <P> "But, from 1981 to 1987, I was the best in the world."  </P> <P> In 1987, that honor went to Hideaki Tomoyori of Japan for reciting 40,000  digits in 17 hours, 21 minutes.  </P> <P> Still, memory expert Charles Thompson, a Kansas State University psychology  professor, believes that Rajan's memory is superior. "The Japanese guy made up  a story, a mnemonic, to help him remember the numbers. His memory isn't as  good."  </P> <P> In the lab where Thompson is studying Rajan's memory, numbers flash past on a  computer screen, one a second, and Rajan responds as if to music. He taps his  feet and rocks rhythmically back and forth in his chair. Now and then, he  jiggles his legs.  </P> <P> "There's something about the way the numbers sound," he said. "It's not the way  they look, it's the way they sound."  </P> <P> For example, Rajan finds the numbers in pi from the 2,901th to 3,000th places  -- 81911979399520614196 and so on -- particularly melodic. The series between  3,701 to 3,800 -- beginning 2332609729 -- is "very jarring."  </P> <P> "Just as you can't describe how you remember your phone number, neither can  Rajan describe the process by which he remembers pi," said Thompson, who, along  with Jerome Frieman, an animal behaviorist, and Thaddeus Cowan, a cognitive  psychologist, has been trying since January to figure it out.  </P> <P> "The first time we tested him, we said, 'Oh my God!' "  </P> <P> Thompson thinks Rajan may have the most remarkable numerical memory known to  science since "S," a patient immortalized in clinical literature by A. R.  Luria, the Soviet psychologist who studied him for nearly 30 years.  </P> <P> "S" was S. V. Shereshevskii, a Soviet newspaper reporter whose memory was  discovered during the mid-1920s by an editor infuriated by his failure to take  notes. "S" didn't need to; he recalled everything he'd ever seen or heard.  </P> <P> What he couldn't do was forget. Ultimately, unable to distinguish between  conversations he had heard five minutes or five years before, "S" wound up in  an asylum.  </P> <P> Rajan's memory is exceptional only for numbers. In all other areas -- names,  faces, words -- it is average. And, unlike "S," he can forget, although "it is  hard to willfully forget numbers." Random numbers memorized one session come  flooding back during another. Keeping the sequences straight requires  discipline and concentration.  </P> <P> The tests he is undergoing are tedious. One test records ability to recall  random digits that appear one a second on a screen. Ten is extraordinary; most  people remember about seven. Rajan has recalled 64.  </P> <P> His is not a photographic memory but a highly structured system of some sort,  Thompson said. "Rajan has pi stored in a very systematic way in his brain."  </P> <P> As photocopied from a textbook, the numbers are organized in blocks of a  thousand, with five blocks to a page. "We'll say, 'Give us the 18,336th digit  of pi.' " The time it takes Rajan to search his memory for the right block of  one thousand, then the right hundred and, finally, to pinpoint the number,  hints at how these storage and retrieval processes work.  </P> <P> So does the occasional error. "If he makes a mistake, without fail he'll be in  exactly the right spot but a thousand digits off. Or, he'll be in the right  spot, only 10,000 digits off." Right position. Wrong page.  </P> <P> A three-year National Institutes of Health grant pays for the research and for  Rajan's work toward a master's degree in physiological psychology. "I want to  know what neurons, what neurochemicals, are responsible for memory."  </P> <P> The entire project "could be interesting and fun and yet not tell us a thing,"  Thompson said. "What we hope is that we're luckier than that. We hope his  memory serves as a magnifying glass to show us how ordinary memory works. That  will depend (on whether) we're clever enough and lucky enough to do the right  tests. There are a jillion tests."  </P> <P> As random numbers rush past, Rajan sometimes makes fleeting associations with  formulas learned in physics, chemistry or mathematics, with distances between  cities, with ZIP codes or historic dates. Now and then, he chuckles softly at  some private numerical joke. As the computer spits out 1,8,6,5, he murmurs  "Lincoln," who was assassinated that year.  </P> <P> Such connections don't help him remember, he said. They are merely random  thoughts that flit through his mind, small points of interest along the  infinite journey through the decimal expansion of pi.  </P> <P> With testing over for another day, Rajan would much rather discuss something  else -- his talent for languages, artwork or cooking. A man is more than his  memory, no matter how good it is.  </P> <P> "Thirty years from now, I want to see myself as well-rounded. I want to learn  more languages, to learn musical instruments, to become as accomplished as  possible. One way to grow as a human being is to develop your potential and  expand mentally, then to help others develop as well."  </P> <P> After 67 interviews in 56 days, he is tired of performing, tired of being asked  if he could memorize a phone book as Dustin Hoffman did in "Rain Man," tired of  explaining that he is not an idiot savant.  </P> <P> Rajan's growing celebrity is evident as he lopes along the wooded paths of the  campus, a solitary figure deep in thought, reed-thin with dark eyes darting  restlessly beneath inky curls. He shrugs off his reverie and responds jovially  each time a student approaches to comment on this TV appearance or that  magazine article.  </P> <P> He chose Kansas State for its psychology department as well as its generous  financial aid, never imagining how lonely -- how incongruous -- he might feel  in a small town in Kansas, no matter how friendly the town.  </P> <P> "There are far fewer distractions at KSU than at a UCLA or a Columbia," he said  philosophically. But he never misses a chance to travel to bigger cities, and  the distances are among the numbers locked in his memory: 1,361 miles to New  York, 1,294 to Washington; 498 to Dallas; 114 to Kansas City.  </P> <P> There are other foreign students at KSU, but most are men, and it isn't male  company he longs for as he trudges back and forth between the campus and his  bachelor apartment. He shares it with another Indian student, who is usually at  his girlfriend's place. "I'm an incredibly lonely guy," Rajan said.  </P> <P> It is hard to tell at Fast Eddy's, the pool hall, where he seems to greet  everyone. For 20 joyful minutes, he stretches gracefully over a table in the  corner. His lanky arms send balls crashing as Dave Jenson watches approvingly.  </P> <P> The regulars know all about Rajan's memory but "we try not to talk about it,"  said Jenson, the owner's son. "We take things in stride."  </P> <P> Later, Rajan finds refuge with best friend Ruth Ridder, who feels a kinship  based on her own British upbringing. Ruth, husband Tony and 3-year-old Hannah  are "my American family," Rajan said. He and Ruth take turns cooking Indian  meals in her kitchen, where his memory is as irrelevant as a trick knee.  </P> <P> "He's funny, he's generous with his time and his finances. He's also  unreliable, forgetful and annoying in lots of ways. . . . He forgets our phone  number constantly," Ruth said.  </P> <P> "When it comes to his memory, I'm in the what's-the-point category. I worry for  him. He has a million acquaintances but he's lonely. Too many people try to  make him a performing animal. We try not to talk about it."  </P> <P> In spite of himself, Rajan sometimes uses his memory to draw people to him.  Once, he got a woman at a cafe to give him 57 random numbers.  </P> <P> "He drank two cappuccinos, read Interview magazine from cover to cover and  discussed the ill way we treat Nicaragua," Tony Ridder recalled. "Then, he  repeated them to her. Backwards."  </P> <P> Rajan admits to having hustled an occasional beer -- a beer he would barely  touch -- but he said that is all in the past. These days, he confines his  wizardry to the lab "so as not to contaminate the research."  </P> <P> Besides, "Nobody will touch me with a barge pole."  </P> <P> Tonight, it is his turn to cook, and he arrives at Ruth's laden with spices  from an international market. He chases everyone into the living room, strips  off his shirt and spends the next hour alone in the kitchen, shrouded in steam.  </P> <P> "I close my eyes, and I'm back at my mother's table eating supper," he said,  lost in a memory not of numbers but of how it feels to belong.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Yemeni Socialist Party Politburo in </F> Aden on 14 May]    [Text] O masses of our great Yemeni people, O living forces  in Yemen, the Arab homeland and the world, to all those with  consciences who reject war everywhere: The bloody influential  gang in Sanaa has chosen war as a method of dealing with a  political crisis which the country has witnessed for 11 days  now. Days pass and the war continues to dispel the illusions of  those who ignited it and believed that it would only last for  some hours or two days at the most because of what the leaders  of this war said at the time. The circle of destruction is  widening as well as pain and suffering affecting our country and  homeland all of which threaten the unity of the country and its  stability.    Despite the appeals of the presidents and kings of the  fraternal Arab countries and the leaders of many countries in  the world, in addition to the pleas of international  organizations and national leaders to stop this war and submit  to the language of dialogue, the influential bloody gang in  Sanaa disdainfully rejected them. This is because that  bloodthirsty gang continues to ignore all those appeals and  initiatives and boasts about its insistence to continue the  march over a river of blood and over the skulls of soldiers and  citizens [words indistinct].    The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has shown a (?positive)  response to the appeals and initiatives of brothers and friends  to (?end) this war on the basis of rejecting the principle of  force to settle differences. The YSP initiative announced  yesterday (?calling) for the war to cease came from its  realization of the gravity of bloodshed, the destruction of  towns, installations and the armed forces.    When the YSP politburo rejects the war, and is concerned  about ending the bloodletting of people and soldiers, and  responds to the appeals and initiatives of the leaders of  fraternal and friendly countries, it does so not because it is  weak, but because it has a profound belief in the need to  prevent Yemen from suffering the continuation of this  destructive and bloody war which cannot be confined to a part of  the shores and mountains of Yemen. Indeed, its flames will  spread to include all the towns, shores, mountains and valleys  of the homeland without any exception.    The YSP, as it responded to the appeals and initiatives of  the leaders of states and fraternal and friendly governments who  called for an end to the fighting, was fully aware that Arab  countries, as well as the international community, would voice  their stand with regard to those who refused to respond to the  initiatives which embodied the realization of the leaders of  fraternal and friendly countries about the necessity to stop  this bloody war and its destructive effects on the unity and  progress of Yemen.    Those who believed this war would end in hours or a few days  and conducted themselves accordingly in the arrogant manner of  invaders and conquerors, ought to realize well that this war  will not end if they want to continue it. They will bear the  historic responsibility and the high price which the people and  the homeland will have to pay due to their insistence in  continuing this war in which nobody will be the winner.    We appeal to all the good forces in Yemen and the  neighboring  countries, all the fraternal Arab and friendly countries and all  those with consciences in the world to continue their efforts to  convince the bloodthirsty to submit to reason and end the  hysteria.    The politburo confirms that it rejects the war and welcomes  all Arab and international initiatives and appeals to end it.  It will not submit to the superciliousness and arrogance of  those who insist to continue the war and destroy the unity of  the country under the cover of legitimacy. Those who wish to  continue to ignore the appeals of reason and conscience and the  necessity to stop this war must bear the responsibility of  continued bloodshed, banishment of families, destruction of  towns, killing of innocents, and the destruction of the Armed  Forces. They must realize that if they have opted for war as a  means of imposing hegemony and annexation and if they also opt  to ignore the initiatives and appeals of the good forces which  reject the war in Yemen, the Arab homeland, and the world, they  will not be able to choose a definite place for this war and  impose it on us. When war is ignited, it burns where it wills.  When the spark of war is not extinguished, then that spark will  change to fire and ultimately hell. Those who have committed  injustice will get their just rewards. God has spoken the truth.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Leading Article: The wheel of fortune A NERVOUS frisson passed through the City of London yesterday when news emerged of convictions in the Blue Arrow trial. It was not simply that the convictions were unexpected in the light of Mr Justice McKinnon's summing up and his decision to have most of the indictments struck out. This was the first time, in the spate of recent financial cases, where scandal penetrated to the heart of the banking and securities community. While the judge had admittedly ordered the corporate defendants in the case to be acquitted, the four convicted individuals were former senior executives in subsidiaries of mainstream City institutions: National Westminster Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The same was not the case in the first Guinness trial, where three of those convicted, Mr Ernest Saunders, Mr Gerald Ronson and Sir Jack Lyons, came from outside the City, while the fourth, Mr Anthony Parnes, was remote from the City establishment. Few in the City had even heard of Mr Peter Clowes, who on Monday was found guilty on 18 charges of theft and fraud, before the collapse of his Pounds 150m investment group. And unlike Mr Roger Seelig, late of Morgan Grenfell, who ended up defending himself in the second Guinness trial which collapsed earlier this week, the men from NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew were not abandoned by their former employers. Their legal fees were underwritten. At the end of it all, it is hard to escape the feeling that the wheels of justice have ground slowly, messily, expensively and indeed randomly in a financial community that is no longer ruled by the club ethic. Different defendants in the Guinness and Blue Arrow trials, for example, enjoyed wholly different degrees of legal support depending on their private means, a worrying inequity that calls to mind the words of the learned judge who remarked that the law in Britain is open to all, like the doors of the Ritz hotel. Arbitrary compensation The extent of compensation for the victims of recent crimes looks even more arbitrary. Those investors who voluntarily handed their spare cash to Mr Peter Clowes to invest in an off-shore tax haven have been baled out by the government because the Department of Trade and Industry behaved negligently in its handling of the affair. In contrast, the pensioners in the late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire, many of whom were obliged to contribute to the pension fund as a condition of employment, are being promised no compensation at all, despite the government's dismal and repeated failure to heed warnings about the vulnerability of such funds to both criminal and legally permitted forms of rape. And there is, of course, no escape from randomness where the law operates in volatile markets. The Blue Arrow rights issue was overtaken by the 1987 stock market crash. If the crash had taken place in November rather than October, executives at County NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew might never have found themselves in the dock. Overhauled structures Practitioners in the City in the 1980s were operating in a period of transition, as the nature of regulation and the structure of financial markets were simultaneously overhauled. They were as prone to swings of fortune as any Elizabethan courtier. It took the present raft of criminal trials to persuade them to minimise the risk by seeking legal advice at every step. Yet there is another sense in which these trials have not been random. They are the inevitable coda that follows a period of monetary excess. De-regulation in banking, the removal of the old stock exchange cartel and the internationalisation of financial activity have contributed since the mid-1980s to an immense increase in competitive pressure, which in turn has increased the temptation to cut corners to preserve profits. Against that background, it may appear arbitrary that a handful of individuals carry the can, when the leaders of the banking community made such grave errors of judgment, notably in throwing huge sums of money at Blue Arrow, Maxwell Communication Corporation and the rest. If there is a justification for such justice, it is that huge takeovers involve important decisions on matters of industrial structure and employment. In the absence of the club ethic, the rigour of the law must be implemented pour encourager les autres. But the framework remains flawed. In retail financial services, recent legislation failed to put adequate obstacles in Mr Maxwell's way as he looted pensioners' money; it failed to prevent yet more complaints about Lloyd's of London, or to crack down on the sale at fat commissions of inappropriate insurance products. In predominantly wholesale markets the administrative processes of the law failed dismally, most notably in the Guinness trial. There has to be a better way.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / The quagmire of Russian reform: Reformers and industrialists are heading for a showdown over the direction of economic policy Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, is widely seen as the most powerful man in Russia after President Boris Yeltsin. That position lends an ominous tone to his gloomy assessment of the country's political and economic outlook. 'The policy of the reform government is about collapse,' he said yesterday. 'The attempt to reach the market in one jump is utopia.' Mr Volsky was articulating the complaints of managers who have a finger on the productive pulse of the economy. After a period of growing restlessness, his statement yesterday may mark the beginning of a showdown between the radical reformers and the country's industrialists. Mr Volsky has stepped up his criticism of the government at a time when a series of interconnected dilemmas are confronting the Russian authorities. The economy continues to weaken and the impoverishment of the Russian people is worsening; the political tone of the country grows harsher; and foreign assistance is becoming more uncertain. The danger inherent in the current malaise is not so much of total economic collapse or the sudden seizure of state power by reactionaries. Instead, the continuing economic and political setbacks, which have delayed both marketisation and democratisation, threaten regional security and prolong the impoverishment and hopelessness of millions. The stakes are high enough for us to take Russia's dilemmas seriously. The most urgent issues fall into closely intertwined, categories: first, the economy's performance is worse than forecast. Exports, at just over Dollars 12bn for the first five months of the year, are down one-third on the same period last year, against a forecast 20 per cent drop. Imports, at around the same figure, are now heavily skewed towards grain - at the expense of vitally needed parts and equipment. Oil production, which accounts for 67 per cent of hard currency exports, continues to fall. Output in Russia fell 13 per cent in the first half of this year, and it is unlikely to pick up in the second six months. Last month, a group of government experts predicted that the production level might fall to about 228m tonnes by 1995, less than half of last year's level of 460m tonnes. The expected level of this year's grain harvest - between 92m and 96m tonnes  -is not encouraging. Part of the problem is that collective and state farms, no longer the obedient satraps of the state, are withholding grain, while demanding higher prices. The likely price the government will have to pay is currently estimated at about Rbs10,000 a tonne, not too far away from the world market price of Rbs15,000 to Rbs16,000 a tonne. The poor harvest will mean that the price of a loaf of bread could quadruple. Consumers have already been hit with a tenfold rise in bread prices over the last year. The question is, will the public tolerate another huge price increase? Pessimists believe the answer is no. The decline in oil and grain production is a bitter pill for the reform government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister who still has 'acting' in front of his title. Since the beginning of the year, Mr Gaidar and his colleagues have worked seven days a week, 18 hours a day, to try to pull the economy out of its structural decline. Mr Gaidar's team has enjoyed some success: the liberalisation of most prices; the removal of restrictions on foreign trade, the beginnings of privatisation; the strengthening of the fledgling market processes initiated before their accession to office. Further, a growing core of entrepreneurs and profit-oriented managers has been established. This group may help to sustain the process of economic reform and bring Russia into the mainstream of the world economy. The Gaidar team has not run into a wall, but it appears to have waded into a marsh, which grows steadily deeper and stickier the more it attempts to plough on. Put simply, Mr Gaidar's team is being forced to make ever more costly compromises to forces which can be called, conveniently, the 'industrial lobby' - that is, the managers and bureaucrats who struggle to keep production going in the face of tight credit, high interest rates and the fraying links between enterprises. Relations between enterprises have deteriorated because of barriers to trade among the former Soviet republics and big drops in orders. These enterprises have top-level representation in Mr Volsky's Union of Industrialists. Mr Volsky is a clever political operative who has transformed himself from executive in the Soviet Central Committee under successive general secretaries in the 1980s to the chief representative of big business in the post-Soviet era. Three of his supporters from within industry are now in senior positions in the Russian cabinet, and more are expected to be appointed. With their 'industrial experience', they are seen as a counterbalance to the cabinet's 'theoreticians', which dominate the Gaidar team. Mr Volsky has also been the moving force behind the creation of the Civic Union, which groups together his own 'Renewal' party, the Democratic Party (the largest in the country in membership) and the Free Russia Party, led by Gen Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. This diverse group - which Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Saint Petersburg, is joining - is the largest political bloc in the country, and its partners all have different, and perhaps incompatible, agendas. However, it shares a determination to stop radical market reform and replace it with one or other version of managed change, with the management often more evident than the change. On top of this, a new, hard-edged political mood has become evident in the country, even among many politicians who were once radical democrats with a Western orientation. This mood was best expressed recently by Mr Sergei Stankevich, a state counsellor and presidential adviser, who called a press conference to denounce as a 'liberal dream' the rapid transformation to a market economy. Instead he called for a strong central state as the indispensable element of controlled reform and national revival. Inter-republican relationships have got better, but not much. Ceasefires are holding in two of the 'hot spots' - in South Ossetia and (less surely) in the Trans-Dnestr area of Moldova. Earlier this week, Mr Yeltsin agreed to postpone the division of the Black Sea fleet by proposing a joint control with Ukraine for three years. However, a solution to the question of the removal of Russian troops from the Baltics is still no nearer. In Estonia, Russian and Estonian military exchanged fire at the end of last month in Tallinn, the capital, and relations remain very tense. Difficulties also persist in Russia's relations with Ukraine, despite the agreement on the Black Sea fleet. There has been a sharp drop in Russian supplies to Ukraine, especially of oil. No agreement has been reached on the introduction of the Ukrainian currency, and sputtering quarrels over control of the Crimea continue. These tensions have further hardened the tone of Russian political life. To cap this, the role of a so-far shadowy body, the Security Council, is now increasing. It was created by Mr Yeltsin to deal with security issues, and includes in its membership Gen Rutskoi and Mr Gaidar. Under Mr Yuri Skokov, its powerful secretary, the council is extending its range. Recently it sharply criticised Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, for warning of a coup. More importantly it has decided to review the progress of privatisation, according to report quoting Gen Rutskoi. This is hardly an issue thought to require a large security input. The west, with its store of financial assistance and technical aid, has proved less a counterweight to these trends than was expected. Indeed, Russia - and to a lesser extent the other former Soviet republics - often experience the rich foreign powers not as givers of assistance but as demanders of recompense - the repayment of the Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn hard currency debt, and from Japan, the return of the four Kurile Islands. In the short term, it is impossible for Russia to satisfy either of these demands. The country does not have the sufficient funds even to pay the interest on its debt. In regard to the disputed islands, political resistance to their return is so great that it would probably be suicidal for the government to do so. The International Monetary Fund has managed to win approval of Dollars 1bn in aid for Russia, to be formally ratified by its board in the next few days. However the conditions attached to the aid package - a budget deficit no higher than 5 per cent of GNP and a 9 per cent monthly inflation target by the end of the year - are almost certainly unattainable. That means that the more substantial standby agreement with the IMF is in serious doubt. Even worse, the IMF has not been able to strike up a close relationship with its Russian interlocuters, who see it as nit-picking and unhelpful. The IMF, meanwhile, sees the Russian authorities as untrustworthy and dismissive. The World Bank, which is developing programmes of technical and agricultural aid, is hampered in its lending by lack of a substantive agreement with the IMF (though a Dollars 1.7bn package will go ahead, with the first tranche to be agreed this week). Adding to its problems, Russia is no longer a central concern for the west. Japan is frank in its refusal to assist substantially before a deal on the Kuriles. Germany is consumed with the difficulties of integrating the east. Britain, Canada, France and Italy are too weak economically to take a leadership role. The US, the natural leader, has an administration focused on its re-election prospects and a Congress which still has not given authorisation to the main Russian aid package. It is an overstatement to say that Russia is now on its own, especially since commercial interest continues to grow. However, at such a crucial time, foreign governments appear to be pre-occupied elsewhere. The anniversary of the August putsch is in three weeks. It will be celebrated with pomp and rhetoric. Beneath the surface, however, the darker forces that were unleashed by the celebrated victory over the reactionaries are becoming increasing evident.</p>

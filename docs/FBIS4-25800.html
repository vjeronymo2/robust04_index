			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  expressed the hope here today that China and Italy can seize the  present opportune moment and propel their economic and trade  links to a new high.    Several years ago, the premier noted, the Italian Government  took the lead among Western countries in readjusting its  policies toward China and has taken positive steps toward  developing Sino-Italian ties.    This, he added, has resulted in the relatively fast growth  of  economic and trade ties between the two countries.    "We hope this momentum of development will be sustained," he  told a group of visiting Italian entrepreneurs from the General  Confederation of Italian Industry (GCII).    Li voiced the conviction that Italian entrepreneurs will  exert themselves toward this end.    China and Italy can cooperate not only in heavy industry,  but  also in the light and textile industries, and leather and food  processing industries, where Italy has its unique technical  advantages, Li said.    Referring to it as a major influence in Italian economic  circles, Li said the confederation has contributed to bilateral  economic and trade ties. He also expressed the hope that the  visit will yield fruit.    GCII Chairman Luigi Abete told Li that Italy's economic  cycle  has entered recovery, which will surely provide better  conditions for Italy-China economic and trade cooperation.    The GCII consists of numerous medium and small-sized  businesses, all keen on developing cooperation with China, Luigi  said.    The visit is designed to inform them more about China's  development strategy as they determine key sectors in which to  invest in China, he said.    The Italian visitors are here as guests of the China Council  for the Promotion of International Trade.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARATHONERS WHO RUN HOT, COLD;  </P> <P> HYPOTHERMIA CHIEF ENEMY OF INEXPERIENCED RUNNERS  </P> <P> Question: I've started two marathon races, but both times I've had to drop out  because I got overheated. But I've heard stories about other marathoners that  had to drop out of a race because they got too cold. How can it ever be  possible for someone who is running in a marathon to become too cold?  </P> <P> Answer: I assume that neither of the marathons in which you participated was  held on a cold, windy or wet day. If you try this some time, you will find that  heat loss (hypothermia) can be a serious problem.  </P> <P> Hypothermia is most likely to occur if the runner proceeds at a relatively slow  pace. Among inexperienced marathoners (which, I believe, would include you),  the critical time comes during the second half of the race when fatigue causes  the runner to slow the pace. At such times, the body may very well be losing  heat faster than it is producing it.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any explanation for the fact that some children are simply more  graceful than others? For example, some boys seem to be natural athletes, while  others have two left feet. Why should there be such a difference in children?  </P> <P> A: What you are describing may simply be two ends of a spectrum of motor  skills. At one end are the natural athletes; at the other, less gifted  children.  </P> <P> It has been suggested that some clumsiness may be the result of minimal brain  damage. Once this has been ruled out, it would seem that children simply differ  in relation to their motor skills just as they differ in intelligence and other  traits.  </P> <P> Q: I'm just beginning to realize how many conditions are being treated with  hypnosis. I've heard of its being used by dentists and by women at the time  they give birth. Would it ever be possible for a child to be hypnotized?  </P> <P> A: The peak age for susceptibility to hypnosis has been reported to range from  7 to 10 years; it then declines with age. Children can also learn self-hypnosis  more easily than is possible with adults.  </P> <P> Q: You have mentioned at various times that a loss of weight and poor sleep are  symptoms of depression. Is this always true?  </P> <P> A: Weight loss and insomnia can be symptoms of depression. However, a person  may experience weight loss and impaired sleep because of some medical condition  or even as a side effect of medication. Similarly, sleep disturbance due to the  need for frequent urination would not be considered a symptom of depression.  </P></p>

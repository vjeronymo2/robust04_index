			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AQUINO'S VICE PRESIDENT WILL HEAD OPPOSITION PARTY  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino's adversarial vice president, Salvador Laurel, on  Sunday was elected head of the Philippines' main opposition party.  </P> <P> In a national convention, the Nacionalista party also elected two former top  aides of deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to the party's next two most  powerful positions.  </P> <P> Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister, was chosen secretary general,  while former Labor Minister Blas Ople was elected executive vice president.  </P> <P> The platform of the party, which is holding its first convention since it  became inactive during the martial-law years in the 1970s, proposed the gradual  dismantling of key U.S. military bases in the Philippines when their lease  expires in 1991.  </P> <P> Laurel, who broke with Aquino in September, 1987, over the president's handling  of a 20-year-old Communist insurgency, was unanimously elected party president.  </P> <P> In a speech to 1,000 cheering delegates, Laurel called the Aquino  administration "the most incompetent this nation has ever had."  </P> <P> "We cannot remain a nation divided, a nation wracked by insurgency and  lawlessness. . . ," he said. "The government goes not govern. The leader does  not lead."  </P> <P> Both Laurel and Enrile are considered leading candidates for the 1992  presidential election. Aquino has said she has no plans to seek reelection when  her six-year term expires.  </P> <P> The 81-year-old Nacionalista party, the country's oldest political grouping,  was the party that brought Marcos to power in the 1965 presidential elections.  </P> <P> It disintegrated in 1972 when Marcos declared martial law and formed his own  New Society Movement.  </P> <P> At a press conference Sunday, Enrile said the ailing Marcos should be allowed  to return to his homeland.  </P> <P> Aquino has banned Marcos from returning -- dead or alive -- because she fears  he would destabilize the nation.  </P> <P> Marcos, 71, is in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital.  </P> <P> "There is no reason why he should be deprived of his right to come home at this  time of his life," Enrile said. "He is so ill. How can he destabilize the  country?" Laurel echoed Enrile's sentiments.  </P></p>

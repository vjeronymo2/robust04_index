			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed AZ: "Two Federal Council Members Visit the </F> Davos Forum This Weekend -- Talks Dominated by GATT and  Relations With European Union"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA  database]    [Text] Davos, 30 Jan (ATS) -- Federal Council members  Jean-Pascal Delamuraz and Flavio Cotti extended their bilateral  contacts this weekend in Davos, on the occasion of the [World]  Economic Forum. For Mr. Cotti, head of the Federal Department  of Foreign Affairs [DFAE], the talks focused on relations  between Switzerland and the European Union [EU]. Meanwhile, Mr.  Delamuraz was involved in discussions on the implementation of  the GATT agreements.    Concluded in mid-December after seven years of negotiations,  the Uruguay Round agreements ought to take effect as from 1  January 1996. "That is the majority opinion emerging in Davos,"  commented Mr. Delamuraz on Sunday [30 January], at the end of  his attendance at the World Economic Forum (WEF). In  Switzerland, this deadline for ratification is "tight," the  federal councillor said during an interview with the ATSA  database.    "The package of around 30 agreements that I will be signing  on behalf of Switzerland in Marrakesh in April will only be  available in French, Spanish, and English," explained the head  of the Federal Department of Public Economy [DFEP]. Now, the  Federal Council will wait until the official German version of  the EU is available before it launches the consultation  procedure.    "I was struck by the extremely lucid discussions that took  place this year among the Forum's participants," the head of the  DFEP pointed out, summing up his visit. Mr. Delamuraz mainly  discussed the future of GATT with the 20 or so leading world  figures whom he met there.  <H5>  Promising Development </H5>   Before leaving Davos, Mr. Delamuraz particularly stressed  the  Swiss interest in those zones undergoing rapid economic  development. On Friday, the Federal Council member had given a  dinner for several members and heads of governments of Southeast  Asia. "The ASEAN zone is one of the most promising areas for the  Swiss economy," he said. On Saturday, Mr. Delamuraz also hosted  a dinner in honor of an Argentine delegation led by Foreign  Minister Domingo Cavallo.    The head of the DFEP also made the most of the presence in  Davos of his Spanish, French, and Egyptian counterparts to  exchange views with them bilaterally. Nor did Mr. Delamuraz  neglect the countries of East Europe. In particular, he met  with Bulgarian Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, Czech Prime Minister  Vaclav Klaus, and head of the Russian Government Viktor  Chernomyrdin.  <H5>  Swiss-EU Relations </H5>   On Friday and Saturday, Federal Council member Flavio Cotti  was in Davos, where he discussed relations between Switzerland  and the EU. He met with the heads of the German, Belgian, and  Finnish Governments to discuss this topic, as well as with the  Danish foreign minister. Both Belgium's Jean-Luc Dehaene and  Denmark's Niels Petersen welcomed the Swiss strategic objective  -- to join the EU in the medium term -- as a measure of  confidence.    On Friday, Mr. Cotti held talks on the Middle East with his  Israeli and Egyptian counterparts, Shim'on Peres and 'Amr Musa,  respectively. The Federal Council member expressed the hope  that the meeting between Mr. Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  would relaunch the peace process. Mr. Cotti was due to meet  with the Palestinian leader in Bern on Monday, accompanied by  President of the Swiss Confederation Otto Stich.    The chief of Swiss diplomacy took advantage of his presence  in Davos to meet the South African delegation, during which the  situation in that country before the first general elections,  scheduled for 27 April was discussed. Switzerland feels  committed to work side by side with countries undergoing an  historical development, Mr. Cotti emphasized. The elimination  of racial problems in South Africa is one of the main  preoccupations of the DFAE.</p>

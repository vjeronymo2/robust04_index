			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Poll tax default summonses reach 11m - News in brief A TOTAL of about 11m summonses for poll tax non-payment were issued between April 1 1990 and the end of last year, Mr John Patten, Home Office minister, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes. His written answer came after Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, had highlighted the efforts of Labour councils to collect the poll tax. In London's Lambeth and Islington more than 140,000 summonses had been issued. Mr Blunkett condemned the government for its delay in clearing up the confusion about the admissibility of computer evidence in court and for failing to abolish the minimum 20 per cent poll tax contribution by the worst-off. Mr Michael Portillo, local government minister, said the 10 councils with the worst poll tax collection rates were all Labour-controlled. ***** UNION ATTACK: Sir Patrick Mayhew, the attorney-general, yesterday joined the Tory attack on Labour's links with unions by highlighting the party's 'sinister' plans to reform union law. Sir Patrick said Labour's plans for a special industrial relations court called into question its trust in the 'fairness' of the judiciary. He also said some proposals were so loosely framed that they would allow a return to the mass picketing of the 1970s. ***** SUNDAY TRADING: A fresh attempt to break the deadlock on Sunday trading reform was made yesterday in a backbench bill which would allow limited types of shops to open but set stiffer penalties for those which break the law. The bill, to be debated tomorrow, has some cross-party support, but stands no chance of becoming law.</p>

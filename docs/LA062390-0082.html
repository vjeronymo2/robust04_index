			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEXICAN FRUIT FLY FIND PROMPTS SETTING OF  TRAPS  </P> <P> The discovery of a Mexican fruit fly this week in a trap in South Los Angeles  has prompted agriculture officials to set scores of new traps to determine if  there is an infestation in the area or if the fly is a so-called "lone  hitchhiker."  </P> <P> The unmated female fly was found in a trap that had been set in a lemon tree in  a residence not far from the city's border with Vernon, said a spokesman for  the state Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> As a result, workers will set 80 additional traps in the square mile around the  spot, 40 traps in the square mile surrounding that and 20, 10 and five traps in  the successive square-mile zones.  </P> <P> Some of the fruit that attracts the Mexican fruit fly is the same that appeals  to the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Acuna, Casas &amp; Araiza  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Association for Union Democracy, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has carefully reviewed and considered all statements made in the comments in developing this final rule. The following is a summary of the comments and the Department's responses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Discussion of the Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All four labor organizations supported the amendment. Each organization addressed why they believed the amendment is necessary, arguing generally that the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was correct in its interpretation of the officer removal provision as not granting the Secretary authority to file suit against a union for not following its concededly adequate officer removal procedure and, therefore, the Department should amend its regulatory language to reflect the court's decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clothing and Textile Workers referenced the legislative history of the LMRDA presented by the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to demonstrate that the Secretary is not authorized to bring civil action against a union for not following its adequate officer removal procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Clothing and Textile Workers also indicated that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision is buttressed by the general proposition that Congress intended that unions should govern their own internal affairs as expressed by the Supreme Court:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In drafting Titles II through Title VI, Congress was guided by the general principle that unions should be left free to ``operate their own affairs as far as possible.'' S. Rep. No. 1684, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 4&hyph;5 (1958) *&blank;*&blank;* Given certain minimum standards, ``individual members are fully competent to regulate union affairs.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Steelworkers  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sadlowski,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 457 U.S. 102, 117 (1982).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Laborers also noted that the legislative history of the LMRDA indicates that Congress did not intend the Secretary's authority to include suits to compel union compliance with adequate removal procedures. In addition, the Laborers noted that the amendment does not leave aggrieved members without a remedy, because any member who believes his union has failed to comply with its constitutional procedures may bring a contract enforcement action in federal court and most union members may bring internal union charges against union officers who fail to carry out their constitutional duties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fire Fighters noted that it is important for the Department to file suit if a union does not have an adequate officer removal procedure ``to ensure that a fair democratic procedure be followed,'' but the Department should not interfere with a union's adequate officer removal procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Food and Commercial Workers support the amendment but also suggested the following three additional changes to the regulations in order to bring subpart B more closely into conformity with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

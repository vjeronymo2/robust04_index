			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: GOODBYE, COLUMBUS BY PHILIP ROTH (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> Thirty years ago, Philip Roth burst onto the American literary scene with this  outrageous collection of short stories. He may not have invented the characters  of the Jewish-American Princess and the overbearing Jewish mother that occupy  so large a place in contemporary fiction, but he epitomized them with rare  humor as Brenda Patimkin and Aunt Gladys in "Goodbye, Columbus." (Baby-boomers  who endured the 1969 Ali MacGraw-Richard Benjamin film will discover that its  longeurs have not tarnished the wit of the original story.)  </P> <P> Roth's merciless but affectionate stories of upper-middle-class Jewish life in  America have lost none of their pungency. "The Conversion of the Jews" pits a  literal-minded Yeshiva student against a conventionally pious rabbi; a shakren  (liar) gets a richly deserved comeuppance in "The Defender of the Faith"; an  Americanized lawyer learns the perils of judging by appearances in "Eli, the  Fanatic." Delightfully irreverent reading to brighten the gray monotony of  autumn in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALLY GEORGE OBSERVES 7TH YEAR WITH VOLATILE 'HOT SEAT' SHOW  </P> <P> Orange County Nixon-mania continues tonight with a tribute from one of the  former President's most stalwart supporters, Wally George, on the combative  talk-show host's seventh anniversary edition of "Hot Seat."  </P> <P> A poster of Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974 in the midst of the  Watergate scandal, has been a part of the "Hot Seat" set since the show began.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, he's one of our great patriots," George said. "My next favorite  would be Ronald Reagan of course, if that's a surprise to you."  </P> <P> And what about Watergate? "I've always thought he was railroaded and stampeded  out of office by the media," offered media commentator George.  </P> <P> Tonight's show, which airs at 11 on Anaheim's KDOC-TV, channel 56, will also  include taped "Hot Seat" highlights.  </P> <P> Among them: a 1983 confrontation with pacifist Blase Bonpane, who tipped over  George's desk in an incident that drew national media attention.  </P> <P> "That was the show that put us on the map," George said. "I have (since) been  tabbed by the media as the father of combat talk shows."  </P></p>

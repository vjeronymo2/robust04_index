			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING CLOSE CONTACTS OF THE ORANGUTAN KIND  </P> <P> Within a minute of our arrival by boat, my wife, Cat, had a baby orangutan  thrust into her arms.  </P> <P> "I must make tea. I must make tea," one of the rangers said frantically. "Could  you hold him for a moment? It's all right, isn't it?"  </P> <P> All right to hold a baby orangutan? My wife was wearing one of the biggest  smiles I had ever seen. "Welcome to Kutai, East Kalimantan," said the ranger,  returning with two glasses of tea.  </P> <P> My wife also let me hold the little orangutan. To hold the infant, to feel its  skin and hair and to have it grasp your hand was a unique and wonderful  sensation.  </P> <P> Kutai National Park on the Indonesian side of Borneo is where guests can make  close contact with orangutans, found in the wild only on the islands of Borneo  and Sumatra. These "wild men of Borneo," as an early explorer described them,  are an endangered species.  </P> <P> Because their ultimate fate rests with their habitat, the rain forest, getting  to see one of these apes outside of a zoo is a rare event.  </P> <P> Borneo and Sumatra have several orangutan rehabilitation centers, but most  restrict contact between travelers and orangutans because they receive many  thousands of visitors a year.  </P> <P> Kutai, on the other hand, is different. Because of its remote location, the  park gets very few visitors -- maybe 25 a year -- who generally stay only one  or two days. In a busy month, five or six travelers may show up. The rangers  spend most of their time in the reserve, which is about two hours by boat from  the closest town.  </P> <P> The Indonesian government for years has had plans to develop and expand Kutai  Park. Plans include a road that would link the reserve with Samarinda, the  provincial capital, as well as guest cottages and larger staff quarters.  </P> <P> The road will make Kutai more accessible, but may also destroy the special  quality that the area offers because it gets so few visitors. No one seems to  know when the road will be built; virtually no progress has been made on it in  the last three years.  </P> <P> Three guest bungalows are under construction now. If you want to see the park  in its pristine condition, visit it in the next few years.  </P> <P> After playing with the baby orangutan only a few minutes, one ranger said,  "Come quickly. Big orangutan."  </P> <P> We followed him outside into the clearing where an adolescent orangutan was  just coming in from the jungle. The rehabilitation center takes in orphaned  orangutans and trains them to live on their own in the jungle.  </P> <P> Occasionally, semi-wild "teenagers" come back for food. This one ran to Cat and  climbed up her clothing until he was holding onto her by the back of her neck.  He appeared to be as strong as he was heavy.  </P> <P> "He wants some food," said the ranger. "We call it 'Orangutan Terrorism.' He'll  hang on until you give him something to eat. He won't hurt you, though."  </P> <P> I went back for the bananas I had brought with us. When the orangutan saw the  food, he jumped onto me, plucked the bananas out of my hand and climbed into a  tree.  </P> <P> We went for a walk through the jungle, which felt like a scene out of an  adventure movie as the ranger hacked a trail through the brush with his  machete. He pointed out orchids, trees that had what looked like human hair  growing from their trunks and limbs, all sorts of medicinal and carnivorous  plants. He made us wait silently while a wild boar ran across our path.  </P> <P> We couldn't see the sun because of the forest canopy. If the ranger hadn't made  notch marks on trees as we walked, we would have had no idea how to get back.  We saw a wild orangutan in a tree and also came across some large monitor  lizards near the water's edge.  </P> <P> Just before sunset some deer came out to feed near the rangers' quarters. A  spectacular hornbill flew by as the baby orangutan crawled on our laps and  played. It was about as perfect as it ever gets.  </P> <P> The trip to Kutai Park is rough. First, you have to get to Samarinda or  Balikpapan on the Indonesian east coast of Borneo. Direct connections to the  outside world are few, the best being a direct flight to Balikpapan from Brunei  on the north coast of Borneo (with easy access from Singapore or Hong Kong).  </P> <P> A crowded longboat leaves Samarinda every morning about 6 a.m. to Bontang, an  eight-hour trip down the Mahakam River and onto the open sea. A few days a  week, from both Samarinda and Balikpapan, a "speedboat" makes the trip in four  to six hours.  </P> <P> Once in Bontang, go straight to Kutai Park headquarters, known in Indonesia as  Taman National Kutai or PPA. The rangers at the headquarters will help arrange  a hotel for the night, and a boat charter out to the park reserve.  </P> <P> Round trip from Samarinda to the park should cost about $40 U.S. per person for  everything: transportation, food and lodging. Lodging inside the park is free  now, but a nominal fee is expected to be charged when the guest quarters are  completed.  </P> <P> Longboats are not comfortable. The hotels in Bontang are definitely not Holiday  Inn caliber. And there are no mattresses at the park site. If you go, it's a  good idea to take along a pad or air mattress.  </P> <P> It's also a good idea to bring some food. The rangers have plenty of rice and  are willing to share it. But sometimes they run out of everything else (for  three days before our arrival they were living on only rice and sugar).  </P> <P> Noodles, fresh fruit, vegetables and protein, such as dried fish or meat,  hard-boiled eggs or canned meat are good ideas. You can buy everything in  Bontang. It would be a nice gesture if you shared the food with the rangers.  They do a lot for visitors.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Indonesia Tourist Promotion Office, 3457  Wilshire Blvd., Suite 105, Los Angeles 90010, (213) 387-2078.  </P></p>

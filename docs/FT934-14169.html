			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (22): Integration is the key - Paul Taylor examines developments in private network systems and services THE LIBERALISATION of telecommunications regimes has accelerated the pace of change in the provision of private network systems and services. At the same time, new technologies are being developed and many companies are considering alternatives to building, operating and maintaining their own dedicated networks. The market at stake is huge. According to some estimates the combined European telecoms equipment and services market will be worth Dollars 200bn by 1996, (see pages 14 and 15 of this survey). The world market equipment alone amounts to Dollars 128bn a year, with the US accounting for Dollars 44.8bn (35 per cent), and the EC for Dollars 30.7bn (24 per cent) - and within these totals the market for private branch exchanges (PBXs) remains one of the largest sectors. However, the advent of digital technology and the new rules of competition have created a much wider range of network equipment, service and supplier options. Customers no longer have to accept separate and inflexible approaches to their voice and data transmission requirements. Today's corporate network needs to be flexible, upgrade- able and expandable in order to accommodate the changing demands which are likely to be placed on it. The network may well be a hybrid, using private point-to-point links for steady high-volume and high-security traffic and dial-up bandwidth services to cope with traffic peaks and special requirements. Increasingly, it needs to support integrated voice and data communications as well as new applications, such as video-conferencing. This requirement for integration poses a challenge for the traditional private network and the manufacturers of PBX equipment, in particular. As the New Jersey-based Insight Research group noted in a recent report, the PBX industry 'is at a crossroads.' After three years, during which almost all PBX suppliers made losses Insight suggests that 'two major obstacles confront the entire industry' - how to make money, and how to re-ignite the enthusiasm the PBX industry enjoyed in the early 1980s. In particular, Insight warns that PBX manufacturers face a challenge from data communications equipment vendors who are begining to offer their local area network (Lan) customers true voice and data integration products. This challenge will be re-inforced by emerging new technologies like ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), which combines the best features of multiplexing and cell switching to mix high-speed voice, data and video traffic, and Frame relay which uses high-speed packet switching technology to handle data traffic between sites. However, perhaps the biggest change under way is the move towards managed network services (MNS), virtual private networks (VPNs) and 'outsourcing,'(see page 7 in this survey). Beginning in the 1970s, many large companies built their own dedicated telecommunications networks for voice and data traffic using leased lines. But now many large customers are either asking outsiders to manage their own internal networks and facilities, or buying-in the sophisticated network services which they need. This year MNS are expected to account for 16 per cent of the total European market for Value-Added Network Services (Vans), according to Datamonitor, the London-based technology research group, which also predicts that the proportion will 'rise dramatically as the key product segments such as network outsourcing grow at rates of up to 50 per cent annually for the next few years.' One of the most popular 'bought-in' services in the US is 'Centrex,' where the features of a conventional company PBX - such as desk-to-desk and short code dialing - are provided by the network operator who partitions off part of the public telephone exchange to act as a customer's office telephone system. The customer pays a regular fixed sum for the exchange equipment and a variable increment based on usage, but avoids the need for substantial capital investment. Centrex services have proved particularly popular in the US where they have been available since the early 1980s and where Insight Research notes they have been actively marketed by the regional bell operating companies as a 'cost-effective, hassle-free alternative to PBXs, especially to the small and medium-sized company that cannot afford the overhead of a dedicated telecommunications staff.' In the case of MNS, most - or all - of the day-to-day running of a corporate voice or data network (Managed Data Network) is undertaken by an outside contractor. In the UK, managed network services are also available from the two domestic network operators as well as international competitors like AT&amp;T of the US. 'Customers are usually looking for a long-term but flexible relationship,' says Mr David Sexton, customer director for MNS at Mercury. Several key factors help explain the recent rapid growth in MNS: First: the cost of private leased circuits has been increased in recent years as a result of tariff re-balancing in the late 1980s which changes the economics of private networks. Second: many customers are under-going rapid change themselves which often requires substantial re-oganisation of telecommunications services without disruption. Third: technological advances means rapid change or 'churn' in customer premises equipment. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) represent another, even more flexible alternative to the private network. VPNs provide the features and functionality of a private network based on leased circuits, with the flexibility and security of the public switched telephone networks - on a domestic or international basis. This eliminates the need for continual capital investment in new technology and means that capacity is available on demand and paid for on a usage basis. The simplest VPN simply provides a business customer with a way to link the switchboards on different sites - even if they are in different countries - without having the expense of installing and running their own private network. More sophisticated VPNs allow customers take advantage of the embedded intelligence in the network and, for example, 'dial-up' additional bandwidth (line capacity) when it is required for a video-conference or to accommodate a peak during the day in electronic mail messages. Perhaps most significantly, a VPN can be reconfigured rapidly to meet the customer's changing requirements. In the US, all three long distance carriers, AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint, introduced voice VPN services in the mid-1980s and almost all of the top 1,000 US companies use the service. Similarly, in the UK, the increasing competition between Mercury and BT for big business customers has helped stimulate interest in VPNs. For some companies the nature of their telecom traffic may mean that they continue to use private networks for their most sensitive data or on routes where very high volumes of traffic are regularly transmitted, but use a managed network or a VPN for other traffic.</p>

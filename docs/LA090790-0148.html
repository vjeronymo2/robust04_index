			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARACLETE TAKES COMMAND IN 2ND HALF TO WIN, 21-0  </P> <P> Paraclete High appeared to be grossly undermanned when it took the Larrabee  Stadium field in Ventura to meet St. Bonaventure on Thursday.  </P> <P> But the small 26-man squad of Paraclete took charge in the second half and  running back George Ordaz rushed for 125 yards and a touchdown to lead the  Spirits to a 21-0 win over St. Bonaventure in a nonleague opener for both  teams.  </P> <P> Ordaz, a 5-foot-10, 200-pound senior, broke open a scoreless game in the third  quarter, breaking three tackles on a nine-yard run with 9 minutes 25 seconds  left in the quarter to give Paraclete a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> Running mate John Harris (nine carries, 42 yards) gave Paraclete a 14-0 lead on  the Spirits' next possession, capping a nine-play, 57-yard drive with a  five-yard run.  </P> <P> Harris raced eight yards for a touchdown with 1:45 left to lock up the victory  for first-year Coach Jim Nattoli.  </P> <P> "It feels good to get the first one," Nattoli said. "I just wanted them to hit  hard and they responded well and the defense played with intensity."  </P> <P> "George (Ordaz) was a powerhouse again tonight, like always," Nattoli added.  </P> <P> "Paraclete was very physical and we made some mistakes on some scoring  opportunities that took us out of the game," St. Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack  said.  </P> <P> Running back Tony Noblin led the St. Bonaventure offense with 36 yards.  </P></p>

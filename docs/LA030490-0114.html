			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WORLD ACOMING -- AND A NEW PERIL, TOO;  </P> <P> SOVIETS: MOSCOW MOVES FROM ONE-PARTY TO ONE-MAN RULE. THE SWITCH TO DEMOCRACY  AND PLURALISM IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.  </P> <P> That the crisis of Soviet communism has ended the Cold War is by now axiomatic,  but what kind of world will follow is far from clear. The dominant view in the  West seems to be that upheavals in the communist world have been caused by and  must be managed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The presumed conversion of erstwhile  adversaries to pluralism and market economics is believed by many to have ended  not only the Cold War but history itself.  </P> <P> Such views leave the democracies -- at the moment of their greatest triumph --  dangerously irrelevant in the emerging world. For the deeper the upheaval of  the old order, the more urgent is the task of constructing a new one. And in  the end, the outcome of Gorbachev's revolution is far from clear; it may  produce, rather than a linear progression toward democracy, chaos -- the  replacement of one-party rule by one-man rule and repression, or all three in  succession.  </P> <P> The West diminishes both Gorbachev and itself by giving him all the credit for  what is happening in the communist world. Gorbachev's policies did not arise  from a blinding flash of insight; like all serious political leaders he has had  to respond to necessity. Gorbachev is a remarkable personality who deserves  great credit for acting courageously to overcome the crisis of his society. But  the steadfastness of the democracies in resisting communist expansionism over  four decades is what created the current international environment. Internally,  three realities have driven the changes in the Soviet Union: economic collapse,  the difficulty that mature communist systems have in achieving political  legitimacy and the nationalities problem. Like the popular Russian dolls, each  of these is nestled within the other. Gorbachev's dilemma is that the ideal  solution for each is to a considerable extent incompatible with the best  solution for the others.  </P> <P> The Soviet economic crisis is by now familiar; so are the necessary solutions.  Yet no centrally planned economy has ever managed the transition to market  economics. The Soviet Union has so far taken only the most tentative steps in  the direction of price reform and the ending of subsidies, two preconditions  for the establishment of market economics. China came closest to taking these  steps but suffered the catastrophe of Tian An Men Square, largely because  economic reform outgrew the Chinese political institutions' tolerance for it.  </P> <P> To avoid this outcome, Gorbachev is giving top priority to political reform. He  is in a better position than anyone to gauge two heretofore insuperable  political obstacles: that the Communist Party is institutionally committed to  central planning, and that the longer a communist system governs, the more  surely it deprives its leadership of the moral authority to ask sacrifices of  its people. No Soviet leader has ever retired voluntarily. Nor has the  reputation of any Soviet leader other than Lenin survived his own death. A  society incapable of generating heroes -- or even continuity -- is in no  position to demand sacrifice.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's political reforms seek to weaken the resistance of the communist  bureaucracy by giving him a popular legitimacy. But in Eastern Europe opening  up the Communist Party has proved its death knell. Democracy requires a belief  that the contest of ideas will produce something close to the truth. By  contrast, communists, regarding themselves as the repositories of historical  truth, consider compromise a bourgeois evasion that dilutes power. Deprived of  the instruments of state power, East European Communist parties, not designed  for democratic contest, are disintegrating at the first whiff of open politics.  </P> <P> Because the countries in Eastern Europe had the advantage of a national  tradition, the collapse of unpopular Communist parties spurred political  cohesion. But disintegration of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is  unlikely to have the same result.  </P> <P> For the Soviet Union is an empire, not a national state. Only slightly more  than half its population is Russian; glasnost has not produced any hint of an  all-Soviet non-Communist Party. The real political contests are waged inside  the Politburo and inside the constituent republics. Glasnost tempts Communist  parties in various republics to become independent of Moscow, a process  accelerated by opposing parties even more stridently nationalistic. The  emergence of real pluralism is inhibited because the democratic tradition in  most of the Soviet Union is highly tenuous. Currents that produced pluralism in  the West passed Russia by or touched it only tangentially: the struggle between  Pope and emperor, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the concept of free  enterprise.  </P> <P> I believe -- unhappily -- that the least likely Soviet outcome is linear  evolution to pluralistic democracy and market economics. The relative pluralism  now emerging may have as its ultimate result a virulent nationalism in the  constituent republics and, on the all-Soviet level, the replacement of  one-party rule by one-man rule, in effect making Gorbachev the czar. Once in  the possession of the trappings of state power, his course, and even more that  of his successor, becomes unpredictable. It could mean stagnation or worse.  </P> <P> History will always remember Gorbachev for having stood aside while Eastern  Europe freed itself and for having started the transformation of the Soviet  state. If the Soviet Union continues to reduce the percentage of its gross  national product devoted to defense and its retreat from far-flung outposts  such as Cuba, assistance in speeding the supply of consumer goods and technical  help -- as sketched by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and proposed by  Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel -- is surely appropriate.  </P> <P> But in the end Gorbachev's most intractable problems will be beyond the reach  of outside powers. Like all other revolutionaries, Gorbachev could be consumed  by the process he started. Gearing Western policies largely to the desire to  "help" Gorbachev would create three points of vulnerability for the West: it  would tempt Gorbachev to turn his tenure into the principal quid pro quo of  diplomacy; it would create paralysis in the democracies if he is engulfed by  consequences of his own achievements, and it would damage the credibility of  leaders who have staked too much on a single Soviet personality, however  meritorious.  </P> <P> The most worrisome outcomes of the crisis of communism are two sides of the  same coin: on the one hand, a return to traditional great Russian repression of  the nationalities; on the other, the disintegration of an empire built up in  the 400 years since Ivan the Terrible.  </P> <P> A nationalistic Russia could resume the pressures to which imperial Russia  subjected all contiguous areas in Europe and Asia for more than 200 years. A  disintegrating Russia could tempt neighboring countries to restore historic  ties with their kinsmen or simply to carve up the Soviet Union on the basis of  traditional expansionism.  </P> <P> The world has suffered so much at the hands of communist ideology that it has  nearly forgotten how uncomfortable a neighbor czarist Russia had been. Often  invaded across a flat plain without natural frontiers, Russia grew to identify  security with pushing out its frontiers as far as possible. However  understandable, that caused the Russian Empire throughout its history to seek  to dismantle every power center within its reach: Poland, Turkey, Sweden, the  Austro-Hungarian Empire, China, India.  </P> <P> One of history's jokes may be that the successors of Lenin will end up holding  the Russian state together with practices used by heirs of Peter the Great. The  nationalism of the smaller Soviet republics has already stimulated a virulent  counterpart in the Russian Republic itself. But Russian nationalism has always  been repressive and expansionist.  </P> <P> The challenge to the foreign policy of the democracies is to use the hiatus --  as Moscow must give priority to domestic problems -- to put in place a security  system seeking to transcend the historic Russian quest for absolute security,  which has meant absolute insecurity for everyone else.  </P> <P> In Europe such a system should return Soviet armies to national territory as  quickly as possible. The intricate balance of arms-control negotiation along  existing military dividing lines obscures the real problem of establishing a  realistic political dividing line. But once Soviet troops are returned home,  such a system must then also strive for an arrangement that genuinely reduces  Soviet fears of military attack from Europe.  </P> <P> All this must be accomplished while keeping in mind a diametrically opposite  danger to the peace of the world: the possibility of a break-up of the Soviet  state. The West can have no more interest in the disintegration of the Soviet  Union than in its expansion. I would except the Baltic republics. Their  annexation, never having been recognized by the West in the heyday of Soviet  power, cannot now be accepted in the period of glasnost and perestroika.  </P> <P> But for the rest, the West must take great care to avoid steps with  unforeseeable consequences. The collapse of authority in a country that  possesses tens of thousands of nuclear weapons must be of greatest concern to  all humanity. The problem is so terrifying, so contrary to traditional notions  of sovereignty, that it requires cogent study.  </P> <P> Nuclear perils aside, the breakup of the Soviet Union would surely produce an  extraordinary cycle of violence. Like a movie run in reverse, it could play  back a brutal two centuries, and in the end draw in all surrounding countries  whose competition provided the temptation for Soviet expansion in the first  place.  </P> <P> To be sure, if Moscow is unable to preserve the Russian state, neither  Washington nor other democracies are in a position to do so. But the West can  practice circumspection, while experience must have taught Moscow that there is  a level of repression that jeopardizes the democracies' domestic support for a  policy of detente.  </P> <P> Coming to grips with such contradictory prospects will force America to examine  categories of thought it has historically rejected; to act not with missionary  zeal but as custodian of an equilibrium, and to adjust policies to the  fluctuating requirements of a balance of power rather than fixed legal  principles or a doctrine of collective security. In that sense, the ultimate  challenge to U.S. foreign policy is philosophical.  </P></p>

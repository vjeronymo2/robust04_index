			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Receivers move into Rosehaugh's properties: Vanessa Houlder charts the UK developer that was the epitome of its times Rosehaugh, the property developer that yesterday went into receivership, was the epitome of its times. From a standing start at the beginning of the 1980s, it expanded with a verve and ambition that helped it reach into nearly every corner of the UK property market. At the same time, its reckless expansion and over-borrowing exposed it to the sharp downturn in property values of the past three years. From a peak of Pounds 746m in July 1987, its market value has eroded to nothing. Yesterday's appointment of receivers was the final stage in a slow lingering death, rather than a sudden blow. As huge losses heaped up over the past three years, it became clear that the company had no future. The company's former chairman and driving force, Mr Godfrey Bradman, resigned from the board at the start of this year, leaving its remaining management to work out its debts. As one of its bankers put it, yesterday's announcement merely puts the company in the hands of official, rather than unofficial receivers. The way forward for the receivership was cleared last week, when a Pounds 1.25bn refinancing was agreed for Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the subsidiary that owns the Broadgate complex that is Rosehaugh's main asset. The 26 banks had been reluctant to push RSDH into receivership as a rapid sale of some Pounds 1.25bn of assets would depress the property market and the return on their loans. But having ring-fenced RSDH, they felt there was little point in keeping the rump of Rosehaugh intact. The banks argued that receivership would cut administration costs, which ran to more than Pounds 10m last year. In particular, it would allow Rosehaugh to pull out of the lease on its head office in Marylebone, on which it pays rent at twice the market rate. Without RSDH, Rosehaugh is just a mixed assortment of minor commercial, residential and retail property schemes - much of which is unlet - around the country. It has sold some of the Pounds 190m of property it held in June 1991, but progress has been slow. The only significant part of its portfolio is Pelham Homes, a land bank developer which is part owner of Chafford Hundred, one of the UK's largest housing developments in Essex. The wide ranging interests of Rosehaugh are a reflection of its former chairman and architect, Mr Bradman, who is one of the most idiosyncratic figures in the property industry. Mr Bradman, a slightly-built accountant, was one of the most successful taxplanners of the 1970s before he moved into the property industry. He was also a prominent public figure, as chairman of Friends of the Earth and a crusader for causes ranging from lead free petrol to freedom of information. He is now pursuing developments in eastern Germany. Under his leadership, Rosehaugh was one of the most influential companies in the property sector in the 1980s, both in its developments and in its financing techniques. Its flagship development was the office complex it built with Stanhope Properties at Broadgate in the City of London, one of the most prominent developments to be constructed in the 1980s. With Broadgate, Mr Bradman pioneered the use of non-recourse loans within the UK. These loans, which were commonplace in the US, allowed the borrower to confine the security on a loan to specific assets, rather than the parent company. Thus, it allowed relatively insubstantial companies, such as Rosehaugh, to undertake large developments. In spite of Mr Bradman's fascination for finance, Rosehaugh was not noted for tight financial controls or a sophisticated approach to risk. In 1986 Mr Bradman was reported to have said: 'You can lose as much on a small development if it goes wrong as on a major project, but the upside is not nearly as exciting.' In the second half of the decade, Rosehaugh expanded in all directions, setting up dozens of subsidiaries to develop everything from inner city sites in Birmingham and the London Docklands to land in Arizona. Mr Bradman's confidence in the UK economy blinded him to the risks of a downturn. Borrowings were left largely uncapped as Mr Bradman believed that interest rates were heading downwards. The company remained dependent on trading profits and failed to secure a rental income that could cushion it when the market turned down. The result was that Rosehaugh was the first large property company to show the strain in the early months of the property downturn. Its problems were clearly signalled when it announced a Pounds 125m rights issue in February 1990. Its difficulties were also highlighted during the prolonged merger talks last year with Stanhope, the co-owner of RSDH. Rosehaugh's financial weakness was one of the main reasons the merger talks were finally called off. Stanhope, which is conducting talks about its own refinancing, yesterday said its position was unaffected by Rosehaugh's receivership. Bankers were keen to play down the implications of Rosehaugh's receivership for the rest of the property market. The rump of Rosehaugh's property, estimated by analysts at Pounds 100m, will result in a relatively small amount of new property on the market. 'It won't create a wall of property to be disposed of,' said one. Nonetheless, the receivership of one of the best-known UK property companies has an ominous message for other financially pressed companies. For many companies that are now being kept afloat by their bankers, their eventual receivership is a matter of not if, but when. Lex, Page 18</p>

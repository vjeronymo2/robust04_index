			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Innovative thinking needed on pensions Sir, I was interested in the report of a speech I made at the weekend ('Ministers look at ways to cut invalidity cash', March 29). I raised a number of questions at the conference. One was whether the problem of poverty in retirement could be solved purely by raising the basic state retirement pension. If the answer is no then clearly thought has to be given as to how additional support can most effectively be provided. These are highly relevant questions as this government insists that the value of the basic state pension will not be raised in real terms. That is why it is currently worth only 15 per cent of male average earnings and continuing to fall. Labour has recognised the need for innovative thinking in the field of pensions and social security with the setting up of the Commission on Social Justice. It is important that discussion is based on the practicalities of the situation. The questions I asked - and they were not assertions - were a contribution to that process.

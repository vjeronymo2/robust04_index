			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Italy issues bank guidelines on laundering - Legal Briefs Detailed guidelines have been issued by the Bank of Italy to banks on the operation of a 1991 law aimed at preventing banking channels being used to launder money from serious crimes. The law puts banks under an obligation to report 'suspicious' transactions carried out by their clients. According to Italian law firm, Carnelutti, the guidelines provide a list of unusual transactions which should put banks on the alert. The list includes: transactions disproportionate in value to the financial standing of the client or to the nature of the transaction itself; transactions in cash for substantial amounts; frequent transfers of substantial amounts to or from abroad; frequent transactions on behalf of third parties who never appear; and refusal by clients to provide information when requested.</p>

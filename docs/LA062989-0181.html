			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PADRES TRADE MCKEON'S SON-IN-LAW  </P> <P> Manager Jack McKeon confirmed Wednesday night that the San Diego Padres have  traded pitcher Greg Booker, McKeon's son-in-law, to the Minnesota Twins for a  player to be named.  </P> <P> The player is believed to be pitcher Fred Toliver (1-3), who has a 7.76  earned-run average. Toliver has not cleared waivers, but if he is unclaimed by  this afternoon, he will join the Padres Friday in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Booker, who has not appeared in a game since June 9, was almost traded a month  ago in a deal with the Chicago Cubs that would have brought shortstop Shawon  Dunston.  </P> <P> Booker is expected to report to the Twins' triple-A club in Portland, Ore., for  a 10-day assignment before joining the big league club after the All-Star  break.  </P> <P> In 1988 with Minnesota, Toliver was 7-6 with a 4.24 ERA.  </P> <P> Booker was 0-1 with a 4.26 ERA this season with the Padres. His ERA is the  highest on the club. Booker had a 5-6 career record before this season with a  3.76 ERA. BOB NIGHTENGALE  </P></p>

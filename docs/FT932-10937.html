			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 20% expansion for Tate &amp; Lyle - Benefit of sterling devaluation and fall in green pound offset one-off charges TATE &amp; LYLE, the sugar and sweeteners group, lifted half year pre-tax profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 107.6m, and is increasing its interim dividend by 7.5 per cent to 4.3p. Mr Neil Shaw, executive chairman, said the group was confident of making 'good progress for the year as a whole'. In the last financial year it suffered its first profit fall for 14 years. He said the group was looking at more investment projects than ever before. These included markets such as China, Russia and south-east Asia. The current year should see profits from the Hungarian sugar and starch operations, he said, although the potato starch plant in eastern Germany, opened last autumn, was suffering from oversupply in the market. Progress on sucralose, a low calorie sweetener, and Stellar, a low-calorie fat substitute, had been slower than Tate had hoped, however. The shares fell 8p to 397p. Devaluation of sterling and the fall in the green pound aided profits for the 26 weeks to March 27. Translation gains added Pounds 7.4m, and another Pounds 4m came from better sugar margins because of higher prices caused by the green pound fall, and a Pounds 3m stock profit also came from the green pound's move. However, Mr Paul Lewis, deputy chairman and group finance director, said there were also one-off costs in the half year, such as Pounds 4m relating to the five month strike at Domino Sugar's Brooklyn refinery in the US, and another Pounds 4m to bring the overseas pension funds up to UK accounting standards. The figures also included an amount, believed to be approaching Pounds 1m, of compensation to Mr Stephen Brown, the former chief executive whose departure was announced in March. Mr Shaw said there was no intention to replace Mr Brown from outside the company. There were four contenders for the post within the group, running the four main divisions, and one of these could become chief executive in the next two to three years, Mr Shaw said. Profits for the comparable half year were restated at Pounds 89.7m, down Pounds 2.3m, because of a change in accounting for employees post-retirement health benefits. Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn, and operating profits were up 12 per cent to Pounds 127.2m. Operating profits from sugar in North America fell 20 per cent to Pounds 17.3m, affected by the Domino strike and by weak prices and oversupply in the market. That was more than offset in the UK, European and Australian sugar operations where profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 51m. UK profits were boosted by the green pound and by improved productivity, while in Australia there was a record tonnage produced. The geographical mix was reversed in sweeteners and starches, with North American profits up 24 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, on the recovery at Staley, but European profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 21.5m. Profits from sugar by-products rose 47 per cent to Pounds 16.6m. Associates profits were up from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.8m. The net interest charge fell from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 24.4m. Strong cash flow reduced the bill but translation of overseas debt pushed gearing up slightly to 92 per cent, which is a seasonal peak. Fully diluted earnings per share were up from 12.9p to 15.9p.

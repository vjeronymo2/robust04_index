			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: IN SEARCH OF . . . ESTELLE PARSONS  </P> <P> When actress Estelle Parsons arrived on the set of "Dick Tracy" last May, she  informed producer-director-star Warren Beatty of a small oversight: "I said,  'Warren, I've never even seen a script. I haven't a clue what you mean when you  say I'm gonna do the scene now.' "  </P> <P> Beatty's not usually so absent-minded, says Parsons, who has a small role in  "Tracy" as Tess Trueheart's muffin-baking mom. "With Warren, the project is  really more important than life itself. You know that it's going to be  perfectly, exactly what he wants. . . . It's like working for some of the old  theater greats."  </P> <P> "Tracy" opens June 15. And Parsons will be seen again later this year as  Elliott Gould's tyrannical housekeeper in Miramax's "The Lemon Sisters." But  the actress hasn't been all that visible on the big screen since winning an  Oscar for her first film role more than two decades ago as the giddy wife of a  gangster (played by Gene Hackman) in "Bonnie and Clyde" (1967), which had  Beatty as star and producer.  </P> <P> (The chameleon-like actress can also be seen in her recurring guest spot as  Roseanne Barr's mom on ABC's "Roseanne.")  </P> <P> The three-time Tony nominee and two-time Obie winner tells us that she turns  down several movie offers each year -- theater is her "real" work. On the  agenda for fall is a starring role as a Kentucky hills woman in an Off-Broadway  production.  </P> <P> "Theater is the actor's medium," says Parsons from her Manhattan apartment,  which she shares with attorney-husband Peter Zimroth and their 6-year-old  adopted son, Abraham. "Film belongs to directors. The actor has a great sense  of power in the theater. I just love it."  </P> <P> Even after Broadway roles ranging from a singing nursemaid "The Pirates of  Penzance" (1981) to a dictatorial teacher in her one-woman show "Miss  Margarida's Way" (originally mounted in 1977, revived briefly last winter), and  scores of Off-Broadway and regional theater productions, Parsons says one goal  is elusive.  </P> <P> "I've never been in a really big Broadway hit. . . . But, who knows, maybe  someday I will be." Mary Helen Berg  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: S Koreans to assemble carsin Europe Kia Motors is to become the first South Korean carmaker to assemble passenger vehicles in Europe in a project to produce up to 30,000 vehicles a year in Germany. The Korean carmaker said yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann, the German automotive engineering and production group, to build its Sportage four-wheel-drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann plant in Osnabruck, north Germany. The agreement is a landmark deal in the development of the world car industry, and signals the Korean vehicle makers' determination to break into the developed markets of Europe and North America. The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble cars in Europe; a fifth has a plant under development. The Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas. Kia, the second-biggest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the US for the first time under its own brand, after entering many European markets for the first time last year. Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage, a compact sports/utility vehicle to compete against vehicles auch as the Suzuki Vitara, would begin in Osnabruck early next year. Initial output is planned to reach 15,000 a year, but Kia aims to double output to 30,000 a year for both four-door and two-door versions. In the first phase, the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea. But Kia said that, medium-term, it planned to involve 'as many German and European components suppliers as possible'. Longer-term, Kia planned to raise the number of components bought from German and European suppliers, with the aim of increasing the local European content of the vehicle to around 60 per cent.</p>

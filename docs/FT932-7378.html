			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Stage set for an end to E-II melodrama - A long-running tussle due to be culminated in a courtroom OLD financiers don't die; they just land on E-II. This exotically-named company owns some familiar businesses, including Samsonite luggage, Culligan water treatment systems, and Botany 500 menswear. But for months it has been notorious as the subject of an intense tussle between Mr Carl Icahn, the former corporate raider who until recently owned Trans World Airlines, and Mr Leon Black, once a senior banker with Drexel Burnham Lambert and now running his own investment business. Finally, it seems, matters will come to a head in a Manhattan courtroom today. E-II's affairs have been byzantine for years. In the late-1980s, the company comprised a clutch of businesses spun off from Beatrice Foods, and was based in Chicago. Rather cheekily, it built up a stake in American Brands and, in 1988, threatened the large Connecticut-based conglomerate with a proxy fight. In response, American Brands bid for, and acquired E-II for Dollars 1.1bn in cash and Dollars 1.5bn in assumed debt. A few months later, the new owner decided to recoup its money. It sold the bulk of E-11 on to Mr Meshulam Ricklis' privately-owned Rapid-American company. Mr Ricklis, husband of film actress Pia Zadora and perhaps best-known to UK investors for his role in the Guinness scandal, was one of the stable of 1980s financiers who drew on Drexel's junk bond financing capabilities. He paid around Dollars 1.2bn for the E-II operations, and took over Dollars 1.5bn of subordinated debt. Peace did not descend. In late-1990, E-II's disgruntled creditors ousted Mr Ricklis, alleging he had milked the company in an effort to prop up other personal interests. A legal action ensued, withMr Ricklis claiming that he was within his rights. While all this was going on, E-II caught the eye of Mr Icahn, whose successful money-making image was becoming badly tarnished by the management debacle at TWA. In early-1992, and in line with his new enthusiasm for 'workout' situations, the financier bought over 31 per cent of the junior subordinated debt for an estimated Dollars 77m. Simultaneously, Mr Black - who, in the wake of Drexel's demise, set up his own investment firm Apollo Advisers - had come into a 27 per cent interest in the junior bonds. This was largely thanks to Apollo's acquisition (along with Credit Lyonnais) of the large junk bond portfolio which once belonged to Executive Life, a Californian life company. In contrast to Mr Icahn, however, Mr Black also acquired a 24 per cent stake in senior debt securities. Soon the two businessmen, who sometimes play each other at tennis, had started a game of financial ping-pong - which intensified once E-II filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last summer. Essentially, their contest was over what rights the different classes of debt-holders would have under E-II's reorganisation plan - in particular, to equity in the ongoing, 'reorganised' company. So far, Mr Black is winning. The bankruptcy court judge has allowed the company to retain the sole right to put forward a reorganisation plan and, under its current proposal, the former Drexel banker stands to gain control just over 50 per cent of E-II. Apollo's potential stake comes from two sources. First, the reorganisation plan entitles junior debt holders to exchange their claims for a combination of new debt and equity. Secondly, holders of the senior debt, who are being offered a mixture of new debt and cash under the plan, also get the right to swap some of that new debt for equity. Critical to determining the amount of equity which they can get is the assumed price of E-II shares at which the swap would take place. Mr Icahn says it has been set too low. In typical fashion, the latter has been hustling to the end. Ten days ago, he threw in a Dollars 1.18bn bid for E-11, claiming he would pay in cash. On Friday, the company and creditors' committee politely declined the offer, adding that Mr Icahn was welcome to resubmit an offer after the reorganisation plan has gone through. But they also said they would modify the plan, although details will not be released today's bankruptcy court hearing. So the final act in this long-running melodrama promises to be as lively as the rest of the production. The original purpose of today's hearing was to confirm the reorganisation plan, voting on which had already taken place before Mr Icahn's cash offer was ever made. Now the deal is being tweaked at the last minute - giving Mr Icahn more grounds for complaint. Still, no one should weep too hard for either investor, whatever the outcome. Mr Icahn will probably double his money, even under the company's original plan. Mr Black, meanwhile, could do substantially better.</p>

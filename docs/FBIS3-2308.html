Sources in  Beijing said group of liberal intellectual had drafted a  petition which they hoped would be discussed at the upcoming  National People's Congres (NPC) and the Chines People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The drafters  intended to implement a signature campaign to go with the  petition but they were stopped by police and state security  agents last week.    The five-point petition asked the legislature to consider  constitutional and legal revisions allowing freedom of speech  and assembly. It said workers should be assured "freedom from  exploitation" and have the right to strike and organise  non-official trade unions. It also demanded a better deal for  the 800 million peasants and assurances that they get a fair  price for produce as well as the removal of excessive taxes. A  major focus was to ask the legislature and the CPPCC to put more  pressure on the Government to get tough on corruption. It  suggested that the NPC pass a law obliging senior officials and  their offspring to declare their assets.    Chinese sources said the petition was started by three  dissidents who were arrested by the Government last week--trade  unionist Zhou Guoqiang and legal scholars Yuan Hongbing and Wang  Jiaqi. The sources said, however, that while the three  initiators of the petition had been detained, this did not mean  an end to the movement. They said copies of the petition had  been circulated among the intellectual community in the capital  and had reached more-outspoken NPC and CPPCC members, including  those from Hong Kong. The sources said there was a possibility  other dissident intellectuals might proceed with the signature  campaign. The petition would then be presented to NPC and CPPCC  deputies on an individual base and be publicised in the overseas  and Hong Kong press.    Hong Kong businessman and publisher Xu Simin, who is a  member  of the standing committee of the CPPCC, has expressed support  for some form of an anti-corruption law obliging senior  officials and their offspring to declare their assets and  incomes. Mr Xu said the principle of the declaration of wealth  had been accepted by the leadership, even though there was  opposition to the ruling applying to the children of officials.    Legal analysts in Beijing said, however, that the  authorities  would not allow NPC or CPPCC deputies to discuss more  controversial aspects of the petition, particularly freedom of  speech, and the rights of workers to strike and to organize  trade unions. The analysts said the authorities had also  decided other controversial legal issues should be avoided at  the twin sessions. These included the suggestion that the law  on "counter-revolutionary crime" be abolished. Discussion on  the draft law on publication and the media would also be  discouraged, if not stopped, because of Beijing's fear that  liberal deputies might use this to clamour for a more free flow  of information.    While there is no clear evidence linking the unsigned  statement to the detentions, the points underlined in the  document are among those included in a "Peace Charter" signed by  some of those detained in the current crackdown.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Black and white and grey matter: Dominic Lawson looks at the inexorable advance of the electronic mind across the chess board Novelists have long known it: the most compelling struggle of the second half of the 20th century is that between the human and artificial minds. Arthur C. Clarke fantasised brilliantly about it in 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was no less memorably transferred to the cinema by Stanley Kubrick. You will perhaps remember the scene of the furious astronaut unplugging all the circuits of HAL, the on-flight computer, after HAL became a bit too uppity, not to mention homicidal. In what we laughably call the 'real world' the homicidal battle between man and machine is conducted symbolically: over the 64 squares of the chess board. This is fitting. Chess is the oldest of war games, and has been around for about as long as the abacus, the computer's still-thriving precursor. However, chess is less fitting as an ultimate trial than many non-chess players imagine. It is true that chess is very difficult. Because its possibilities are virtually limitless - mathematicians describe the game as 'non-trivial' - chess is a profound challenge to the scope of machines which feel most at home in the merely finite. But it seems to me wrong to assume that chess is necessarily the final frontier of human intelligence. For that we would have to construct a new game which would be a pure test of imagination, unlike chess, which for most grandmasters is as much a test of memory as it is of powers of original creative thought. Nonetheless, there, on well-trodden ground, the challenge lies. In the late 1960s the recently retired Russian world chess champion, Mikhail Botvinnik, a computer scientist by trade, announced a wager of Dollars 10,000 that by the end of the following decade the computer would be able to beat any human at chess. His bet was taken by a British computer scientist, David Levy. In 1979 Levy, a strong player but no grandmaster, crushed the world's strongest chess computer program in a match of six games. It was fortunate for Botvinnik that the value of the dollar had been devastated by inflation in the intervening period. But he was still embarrassed. It was only towards the end of the next decade that advances in computer science began to catch up with the human mind - which had, after all, had a start of about 2,000 years of chess playing. In 1989, in a tournament in America, the Deep Thought chess computer, programmed at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, defeated the leading Danish grandmaster, Bent Larsen. (It has to be said, however, that Larsen, though a great player, can lose to almost anyone - perhaps one should say anything - on one of his off days.) A few weeks after Larsen's loss, I challenged Deep Thought to a half-hour game by telephone link. While I eventually lost on time, I had been able to establish a winning position by the simplest of strategic means. I was not impressed. That particular Deep Thought program analysed positions at a rate of only 750,000 a second. I say 'only' although, at the time, that was considered astonishing. But far more astonishing has been the development of computer capacity in this decade. And that has finally begun to shift the balance in the battle between man and machine. Now, the Fritz 3 Pentium program is almost unbeatable at so called 'speed chess' - the one-hour games most popular with tournament sponsors. In a recent event, sponsored by the microchip manufacturer Intel, Fritz 3 tied for first with Kasparov, and beat the world champion in their individual game, before losing the play-off match. In London next week Kasparov, along with the best of his fellow humans, rejoins the battle with Fritz 3 in another event sponsored by Intel. But what would it signify if Fritz came out on top in this tournament? I would be inclined to recall the remark of Dr Max Euwe, a world chess champion in the 1930s and a mathematician who thought early about such matters. 'Even though the car has been invented,' said Euwe, 'man still gets great pleasure from walking.' Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

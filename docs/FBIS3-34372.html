			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Kashif; from the "Attention" column: </F> "Decisions of the U.S. Era"]    [Text] The U.S. President and his secretary of state see no  reason to continue the Arab boycott of "Israel," saying "it no  longer belongs to this age." And since Senator Brown cannot  comprehend continuing that blockade, he submitted a bill to the  U.S. Senate imposing sanctions on any Arab government abiding by  resolutions that boycott U.S. firms dealing with "Israel". The  Brown bill was immediately approved by a majority of 93 votes.  Nobody in the U.S. Senate supported the Arabs, although the U.S.  decision will first affect pro-U.S. Arabs, because it "bans the  sale of U.S. arms to Arabs and withholds all types of U.S.  services and military consultations to any state not abiding by  the U.S. decision."    Of course, pro-U.S. Arabs will not be disappointed by their  Washington master. In fact, they will use the Congressional  decision as an excuse to get rid of the boycott resolutions to  which they are committed by Arab unanimity.    We do not expect pro-U.S. Arabs to resist, reject, or speak  out against the decision, because those following the course of  recognizing "Israel" have already begun dealing with it on  political and security levels, and will soon begin dealing with  it on the economic level, through economic projects in Gaza and  Jericho, or through the Middle East market now being established  via relations and agreements that cover the entire Arab homeland  and extend to all its capitals.    Since Washington is committed to the peace it is formulating  and leading in the Middle East, it considers the Arab boycott to  be harmful to the peace efforts. It does not understand how the  pro- U.S. Arab camp can recognize "Israel," guarantee its secure  borders and establish normal relations with it, without  cancelling the boycott resolutions and measures with the open  decision that Washington has asked of the Arab League, now that  the United States has guaranteed the required majority in that  organization.    Washington is now working for Tel Aviv's economic  superiority, after it has guaranteed its military superiority.  With this superiority, Washington asks its Arab camp to  guarantee Tel Aviv's economic and military hegemony without  condition or restriction. A powerful Israel guarantees U.S.  interests in the region and guarantees the continued existence  of the rulers -- presidents of kings -- that Washington appoints  over the region.</p>

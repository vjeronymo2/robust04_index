			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Emil Constantinescu, president of the </F> Democratic Convention of Romania, by Constantin Lupu; place and  date not given: "We Are Not Opposition for the Sake of  Opposition"]    [Text] [Lupu] A document by the Romanian Foundation for  Democracy [FRD] and the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]  entitled "Romania 1989-1994" was released a few days ago. What  is the purpose of this document?    [Constantinescu] The document is the result of a long study  carried out by the Foundation's experts exclusively on the basis  of official data supplied by the National Statistics Commission.  By referring to that data, the document drew up suggestive  charts on the main components of our economic and social life,  such as unemployment, inflation, production, and trade (both  domestic and foreign). Along with the public presentation of  this image, we are also presenting the CDR's solutions for  taking Romania out of the crisis and promoting the country's  recovery.    [Lupu] Why now?    [Constantinescu] After enduring the last stage of the  communist dictatorship and after this transition period, which,  in our opinion, should now draw to an end, we would like to see  these documents -- on what has happened and what should happen  -- become the subject of a dialogue between responsible  political forces, a dialogue which should be adequately covered  by the press. At this point, I would like to digress a little  from your question and tell you at the very beginning that I am  particularly interested in striking up a relationship with the  readers of ADEVARUL daily. I am not saying this to incur their  liking, which is a common political trick. I say it as a steady  reader of your newspaper, which addresses not an important  category of the electorate, but an important category of  citizens of the country. I have no doubts that a large  proportion of ADEVARUL readers did not and do not share the  ideas that I am promoting on behalf of the CDR. But, as I said  during my election campaign, I am more interested in those who  do not vote for us. I realize that one can never convince  everybody. There must be people with other opinions, as well.  If we had come to power, the existence of an opposition would  have been as necessary as ever, since the opposition represents  the interests of the citizens toward any administration. I am  convinced that now is the time for a dialogue where facts -- not  words -- count.    [Lupu] A short while ago you launched a "Manifesto for the  Salvation of Romania," as a basis for future discussions with  the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Nevertheless, the  signals that you received from those quarters have not been all  that positive so far. Does the manifesto or the latest document  represent a last offer made by the opposition to the ruling  party?    [Constantinescu] No offer should be the last one and no  dialogue should be the last one, either. Politics is important  for the very reason that its role is to turn chaotic and violent  confrontations into exchanges of ideas.    [Lupu] Nevertheless, it seems that the negotiations  conducted by the CDR parliamentary parties with the PDSR have  only led to minor results. What are your plans for the  forthcoming period?    [Constantinescu] Unfortunately -- why not be open about it?  -- we have noticed that for the past four months the PDSR has  used us to counter the claims of its allied parties situated  even further to the left of the political spectrum and to offer  a false image of dialogue for both internal and external  consumption. I do not see any further point in prolonging this  incorrect and inefficient political game.    [Lupu] What is the Convention doing about it? What will it  decide at the next meeting of the CDR Council?    [Constantinescu] Next week, we will be holding a meeting of  the CDR Council. Speculations have been made, particularly in  the press, to the extent that we will raise the issue of  launching an election campaign. But this campaign is not a goal  in itself. It should only be a means for a positive change in  people's lives. What we now see as the current power's behavior  is a reaction to the latest public opinion polls, which,  regardless of nuances, have primarily emphasized that the CDR is  ahead as far as the people's trust is concerned, thus turning  our movement into the primary political force in the country.  Then, according to the views of the participants in these  public opinion polls, a CDR government has now edged into first  place (with 35 percent), followed by a CDR- Democratic Party  [PD]-PDSR government second, and a monocolor government like the  current one third (with only 14 percent). Nowhere in the world  can you have a viable government when all the opinion polls  indicate that the level of distrust exceeds 70 percent!    [Lupu] On the basis of the data in these polls, we conclude  that, if elections were to be held now and these results were  achieved, then the CDR and the PD would find themselves in  today's situation of the PDSR and its current allies.  Therefore, the basic aspects of the problem would not change  and the parliamentary blockage would remain. How would you  proceed in such a situation?    [Constantinescu] Indeed, this is the direction indicated  by all recent opinion polls. In all seriousness, though, I must  say that elections are not carried out by opinion polls. We  must take into consideration the huge means of influencing and  organization available to the current power, primarily their  ability to present themselves as a party-state. They are using,  to a greater or lesser extent, the force of the state for the  benefit of the party. However, if the blockage generated by the  government's immobility persists on the key issues of reform,  then the situation will further deteriorate and public support  for the current opposition will grow.    [Lupu] Do you hope that you will exceed the 51 percent that  the opinion polls credit you with?    [Constantinescu] Yes, so as to create a clearer majority  that I believe the country needs so much. At the same time, I  would like to clarify further a point linked to the  parliamentary blockage, as you called it and as the rulers also  call it. Well, there is no such thing as a parliamentary  blockage! It only appears in the excuses of the current power,  which wants to pass their only failures into the opposition's  court. When the current parliamentary majority wants to pass a  law, it does so, as the case of the Law on Agricultural Income  Tax clearly shows. The opposition strongly opposed that law and  even left Parliament's hall. However, the law was passed. Of  course, the opposition can do something about it all, and it did  so. For instance, these are the tactics that we adopted in the  case of this law: The opposition seriously participated in the  debates of the parliamentary commissions, thus managing to  diminish the negative impact of this law by reducing the size of  the stipulated taxes. If the initial form presented by the  government is compared with the latest version, one can see the  improvement. Therefore, if we did not exactly manage to block  the government's draft law, we did manage at least to dilute it.  On this occasion, people may notice that Parliament is not to  be blamed for everything that does not work. Similarly, they  may realize that Parliament's achievements are also due to the  opposition's efforts.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls help Greggs rise by 15% GREGGS, the bread, confectionery and savoury products group, reported a 15 per cent rise, from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.97m, in profits before tax for the 12 months to December 26 1992. The outcome, which took in a Pounds 134,000 loss on a property disposal, was achieved on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 101m (Pounds 95.5m), the first time the company has broken through the Pounds 100m barrier. Describing 1992 as a 'much better year", Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said stable ingredient prices and improved efficiency and cost control had more than offset continuing effects of recession, increased competition and further escalation in rents. All divisions showed improved performances compared with 1991. The company was trading from 487 outlets at the year end, a net increase of 13. Net cash stood at Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 1.7m. With the volume trend slowly improving and 1993 sales and profit to date ahead of budget and of last year, Mr Darrington expressed cautious optimism despite recent ingredient price increases caused by sterling's devaluation. However, he urged the government to outlaw 'highly inflationary upward-only' rent review clauses: further escalation of rents in 1992 meant the proportion of turnover absorbed by rent was effectively depressing profits by Pounds 1.5m a year, compared with five years ago. Mr Darrington said Greggs hoped to double the size of its core business in the next seven to eight years and diversify into new areas, which he declined to specify. Earnings per share rose to 40.6p (36.8p). The proposed final dividend is 10p, making a total of 15p (14.125p).</p>

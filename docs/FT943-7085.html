			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Facts on The Body Shop difficult to obtain Sir, Gordon Roddick's defence of his company's commitment to social and ethical issues (Letters: August 24) fails to mention one important element of The Body Shop's position. His company has a firm policy of no paid advertising. However, it has been highly successful in promoting itself through public relations, spending millions of pounds annually. The Body Shop distinguishes between advertising and PR in this way - 'advertising is you saying you're good, PR is getting someone else to say it' (Body Shop annual report 1993, page 20). But, more so than advertising, public relations is difficult to call to account. New Consumer can only assess action and hard information. We have been debating disclosure on corporate social responsibility with The Body Shop for some time and have found great difficulty in obtaining relevant information. In September 1993, in a meeting at which Gordon Roddick was present, The Body Shop confirmed that, while a source/supplier analysis of basic product ingredients had been initiated, there had, as yet, been no development of an ethical sourcing policy for such materials, the bulk of these being bought as commodities on the world market. At that meeting we suggested: Clear delineation of Trade Not Aid projects as examples of micro-enterprise income-generation schemes whose presentation to the public would be substantially reduced, in line with their contribution to the overall product range. Analysis of ingredients and other raw material or finished product supplies to determine source and what was or could be originated in the developing world. This to be followed by a prioritised programme for applying appropriate fair trading criteria and recognising areas where no such possibilities existed at present, and seeking ways to introduce ethical sourcing in future. Taking the work involved in the above point to trade suppliers and processors for their comment and encouraging their involvement and creative thinking. Stimulating appropriate trade associations to consider these issues and engaging with other users of similar basic ingredients, including competitors, in evolving practical schemes for improvement in standards of sourcing. We believe that this was and remains a constructive and far from cynical approach, and we and many other ethical research groups would be reassured on this subject if The Body Shop had adopted it.

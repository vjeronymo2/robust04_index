			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 14 June TASS -- "The existence of a fixed  currency exchange rate is one of the main reasons of the fall in  production in Ukraine, which has gone down by 40 per cent during  the past four months," Viktor Pinzenik, people's deputy, said  during the Ukrainian parliament's session which opened today.  According to former vice-prime minister for economic reforms,  "two currency exchange rates are restraining exports and those  industries which depend on imports."    As is known, as of today, according to Ukraine's national  bank currency exchange rates, the U.S. dollar is equivalent to  16,500 karbovanets, but the "black market" rate is over 45,000.  "As a result, the national bank has sold only $75 million during  March, less than a half of what was sold before the introduction  of the fixed exchange rate," Viktor Pinzenik said. According to  the deputy, currently exchange offices are selling as much  currency as the whole system of the national bank.    Viktor Pinzenik told deputies that as a result of such a  ratio of internal and world prices, exports have become  unprofitable. He proposed to change the currency regulation act.    The parliamentary session intends to consider the currency  question this week. Deputies plan to hear a government report  on social and economic state in the country and a report on this  issue prepared by the Supreme Soviet chairman.    The election of Ukraine's prime minister will constitute a  problem. The majority of deputies think that it is inexpedient  to change the head of the government before presidential  elections.</p>

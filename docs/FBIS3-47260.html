Some 130 of the 300-odd projects under the Yulgok plan ought  to be reexamined to decide whether they should be continued, he  said.    He told the 18-member committee, chaired by Lt. Gen. Chang  Song, commandant of the Korea Military Academy, that it must  find ways to improve Yulgok projects and the defense procurement  system as well as to restore the people's trust in the military.    Also Monday, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong, head of the Armed  Forces Special Inspection Group, said that a special team would  start a full-scope probe of two of the five Yulgok projects it  is to investigate toward the end of the week.    The two are relocation of the Army's combat arms school and  the Navy's procurement of tactical data systems.    Cho Ki-hyon, 53, president of Chongwoo Construction Co.,  will  be questioned about his company's role in the relocation  project, Chang told reporters.    He said an exit ban on So Chon-sok, 52, president of Litton  Korea, has been lifted as he was found to have had nothing to do  with the Navy's tactical data system project.    The team will focus on what was overlooked or missed in the  Board of Audit and Inspection's probe last year, he said.</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (14): Eating out - Whether simple or extravagant, the tomato remains a vital ingredient of Catalan cuisine OF ALL Spain's regional cuisines, Catalan is the one which is most difficult to imagine before the tomato was introduced to Europe. The tomato is almost like a national symbol, as it is used to make tomaquet  -bread rubbed with tomato and seasoned with oil and salt - which forms the basis of the simplest and most authentic meal when eaten with fuet (a form of salami), butifarra (sausage), pernil (ham), and possibly various forms of truita or omelet. Barcelona has a wide range of restaurants - including Chinese - and one of the most expensive, Via Veneto, is Italian. But a good place to start is at Can Punyetes, a traditional Catalan establishment with an extravagant modernist exterior and a simple, rustic interior, located not far from the centre on the Carrer Maria Cubi. In addition to tomaquet, it specialises in grilled meats, eaten accompanied by the powerful garlic paste allioli. As Catalonia has a Mediterranean coast, a fertile interior and the mountainous region of the Pyrenees, its national cuisine is also highly varied. But as it becomes more sophisticated, it still relies heavily on the tomato, which is an ingredient in its sauces, the sofregit, samfaina and romesco. There is also the picada, made from ground almonds and garlic, which is used to thicken other sauces. The Casa Jordi, decorated in the style of a Catalan masia, or farmhouse, in the Passatje Marimon, is a good place to try some of the variations with these sauces. For the other side of Catalan cuisine, head for the port. One of the few losses to the Olympic renovation of the city were the ramshackle restaurants built illegally on Barceloneta beach that served fish and seafood without any frills to the crowds that used to descend on the district at the weekends. Although these have now been knocked down and their places taken by palm trees, some of the proprietors have relocated on the Passeig Nacional, the promenade which looks out over the port. The other latest venue for eating seafood, which became popular last summer, is the Port Olimpic. In both places the usual fare is paella, or mixed grilled fish. For fish cooked in a more complicated fashion, and for one of the most attractive restaurants in the city, it is worth visiting Els Pescadors, in the Placa Prim, which is a short journey out of the centre in the district of Poblenou. It is set in a square overlooked by old village houses, the front dining-room keeping the appearance of an old bar and the one at the back typical of modern Barcelona design. If it is warm enough, it is possible to eat at tables in the square. Here, there are plenty of Catalan dishes to choose from, such as the excellent bacalao (salt cod) amb samfaina.</p>

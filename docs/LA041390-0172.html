			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: RYAN WHITE 'MADE IT EASIER' FOR EL TORO BOY  </P> <P> Channon Phipps acts like your "typical 15-year-old," in the words of his aunt  and guardian.  </P> <P> He is "always wanting something new, like new (audio) speakers," Deborah Phipps  Franckewitz explained. "He's really into music. And he loves girls. Finding  girlfriends has never been a problem for him. . . . He has tons of friends.  People have been very understanding."  </P> <P> Franckewitz said she is always very careful to inform the parents of Channon's  friends about his condition. Like Ryan White, the Indiana youth whose death  this week captured national attention, Channon is a hemophiliac who has been  brushed by AIDS.  </P> <P> Channon is presumed to have been exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome  while receiving a blood medication for his hemophilia. Doctors say his blood  carries antibodies of AIDS but is not yet infected with the incurable AIDS  virus.  </P> <P> Also like White, Channon was initially barred from public school when his  infection became known. Then four years ago, as a courageous yet frightened  11-year-old, Channon marched into an Orange County courtroom to fight for his  right to return to class at an El Toro school.  </P> <P> Channon eventually won the legal fight when an Orange County Superior Court  judge ordered in February, 1986, that the Saddleback Valley Unified School  District admit him because he posed no health threat to his classmates.  </P> <P> Reacting now to White's recent death, Channon said the Indianapolis teen-ager  was always a tremendous inspiration to him.  </P> <P> "He opened up the way so I could go to school," Channon said. "He made it  easier for me to do it.  </P> <P> "Without Ryan," he said to his aunt, "my life would have been unbearable. If it  wasn't for him I don't know if I could have gone on."  </P> <P> White, who lost his battle with AIDS on Sunday, never met Channon. But the two  shared a determination to live as ordinary a life as possible.  </P> <P> "It really hurt Channon when Ryan died," Franckewitz said. "He was crying and  very upset. I think it's made him understand just how important it is for him  to take his medication, especially the AZT."  </P> <P> Although Channon won the right to go to school, he caught colds and flu so  often from classmates that he has been staying home and receiving tutoring off  and on since the fall of 1988. "Being around all the other kids made him sick,"  Franckewitz said.  </P> <P> Channon, who said he is healthy enough to "go swimming, biking, fishing and to  the movies with friends," prefers not to risk becoming ill.  </P> <P> "It's worked out better for me," he said about staying out of school. "I'm much  healthier than I was."  </P> <P> There have been some anxious moments for Channon and his aunt. At one point  last year, he fell very ill.  </P> <P> "I recall once, when I was driving him to the doctor," his aunt said, "I  started crying as I saw him lying in the back seat, wrapped in blankets and  vomiting."  </P> <P> As frightening as that period was, Franckewitz said, "we've always been  positive. We tell him, 'You don't have AIDS. They will come up with a cure  first. Since you don't have it right now, let's live our life to the fullest.'  That's what has kept him going."  </P> <P> What's the long-term prognosis?  </P> <P> "They don't give us any guarantees," Franckewitz said.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Prendergast, former county health director of epidemiology and  disease control, said that although Channon does not have acquired immune  deficiency syndrome, the "long-term prognosis for anyone with the AIDS  antibodies can't be good, in the sense that there seems to be a slow but  progressive effect of the virus damaging the immune system."  </P> <P> Prendergast, who has examined Channon and was a consultant in his court case,  noted that "the longer he goes without symptoms and the longer he stays well,  the more certain we are that we will have new medication and treatments that  can benefit him and alter the natural course of the infection. I think the  long-term outlook for someone in Channon's condition is certainly better than  it was just a couple of years ago."  </P></p>

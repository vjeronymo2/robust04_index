			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (27): Return of a heavyweight - Germany flexes its muscles IN A CORNER of a cavernous assembly shed on the banks of the river Elbe, just downstream from Hamburg, the first prototype of a new Airbus aircraft is being painstakingly rivetted together. For the 90,000-odd workers in Germany's aerospace industry, the final assembly of the A321 narrow-body Airbus is more than just the production of another aircraft. It is the first large passenger airliner to be produced in Germany - albeit from sections made in France, Britain and Spain as well - since before the Second World War. 'I am very proud that we got the final assembly,' says Mr Johannes Muller, Airbus programme director at Deutsche Airbus, 37.9 per cent partner in the four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium. 'It has an historic importance for us.' Deutsche Airbus is the most visible sign of the German aerospace industry's emergence as a new force in Europe, alongside the longer-established French and British industries. By the end of September, it will be 100 per cent owned by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the umbrella group brought together by Mr Edzard Reuter of Daimler Benz to co-ordinate and consolidate the industry. Dasa is an extraordinarily ambitious effort to combine all the big players in the German industry under one roof: Mr Reuter has brought together MBB (Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm) and Dornier, the two principal aircraft manufacturers, with MTU (Motoren und Turbinen Union), the aircraft engine manufacturer, and TST (Telefunken Systemtechnik), in space and communications technology. Welding them into a co-ordinated unit is proving a real challenge , even for Daimler Benz, Germany's The new group employs 56,500 people out of the 90,000-odd in the industry, and accounts for more than DM12bn sales out of an industry total of DM24bn. Last year it made a profit of just DM50m, thanks to Deutsche Airbus moving into the black. Nevertheless, Dasa has been flexing its muscles on the international stage in recent months: as the successful purchaser of a majority stake in Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft manufacturer, and as a potential buyer of British Aerospace's own space division. Yet the German aerospace industry finds itself caught in a contradictory situation: on the one hand aggressively looking to establish itself as an equal to other international players; and on the other, desperately defending itself against the potential loss of its two most lucrative state-financed contracts, the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), and the Hermes space shuttle. If Germany does pull out of those two European collaboration projects, because of the budget cuts ordered in Bonn to pay for the costs of German unification, it will deal a grievous blow both to the standing of the national industry, and to Mr Reuter's whole concept of Dasa as a key new profit centre for Daimler Benz. Yet the prospect is real, and it makes leaders of the industry apoplectic. 'We cannot preach pro-Europeanism, and then pull out of a European project from sheer national egoism,' says Mr Karl Dersch, a Dasa director and current president of the BDLI, the German aerospace industry federation, about the decision of the ruling German coalition not to go ahead with EFA production. 'It is simply crazy. An ad hoc decision like this will strangle the industry.' He says it is not the big companies, such as Dasa, which would suffer as much as the small: about 110 of the 120 companies in the BDLI are in the small to medium-sized sector. 'The cancellation of the EFA could mean bankruptcy for one third of the companies in the industry.' The EFA project is a joint programme with British Aerospace, Italy's Alenia and Spain's Casa. The Hermes space shuttle, in which France is the leading partner and Italy another minority shareholder, is also in doubt because of the budget squeeze in Bonn. Dasa has produced its proposals for the space programme which still require an extra DM200m to DM300m from Bonn. 'Making false economies in the European long-term programme to achieve short-term budgetary relief means throwing away the technological future of Europe in space, and the future of its top engineers on earth,' Mr Dersch says. Having said which, he insists that the German industry is now far less reliant on the public purse than 20 years ago.</p>

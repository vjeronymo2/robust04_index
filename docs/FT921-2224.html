			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Property Market: The people's jury is out Canary Wharf, the largest, most expensive office project in Europe, is being put to the test. More than 3,000 people have arrived at the development in London's Docklands over the past few months including the staff of Morgan Stanley, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and the Daily Telegraph. So does their experience justify the long-held belief of Olympia &amp; York, the developers, that 'once people are there, Canary Wharf will sell itself'? The project has some enthusiastic advocates. 'It looks absolutely first class,' says a senior executive of Morgan Stanley, which has swapped five cramped buildings in the City and West End for spacious, state-of-the-art offices, a canteen and a gymnasium. 'Marvellous,' says Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which has moved its staff away from a tatty, 70-year-old building north of Waterloo Bridge to two open-plan floors in Cabot Place. Staff milling around the shopping mall at lunchtime have mixed views. 'It is disastrous,' says a brisk, smartly dressed Morgan Stanley employee, scanning the bookshelves in the newsagent. 'I hate it. It's like Ford open prison,' she adds. Although Canary Wharf boasts a dozen shops, a pub, a restaurant and two cafes which report brisk trade, the range of diversions in the West End is widely mourned. 'There is nothing here for anyone. What there is, is too expensive,' says a young back-office worker at Morgan Stanley. Even the limited amusements offered in the southern Isle of Dogs inspire nostalgia in one Daily Telegraph employee. 'I never thought I'd say that,' she says wryly. Transport heads the list of complaints, although several Canary Wharfers have found it better than they feared. Employers are smoothing the transition with free car parking, free river bus passes and even, in the case of Morgan Stanley, a temporary private bus service. Heavy car parking charges (up to Pounds 35 for a day) are designed to encourage people to use public transport. But the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is still unreliable and overcrowded. The riverbus does not currently have sufficient capacity to cope with peak demand. Getting to Westminster through lunch-hour traffic takes up to an hour. Many of these gripes will disappear in time. Two extra riverbuses will be in service by May, reducing intervals between the boats to just 10 minutes; the DLR is being upgraded; the opening of the Limehouse Link next year will cut congestion on the roads; the Jubilee tube line will be in place in 1996. Several other shops and restaurants are due to arrive, including Marks and Spencer. A post office counter will open in May; there will be a health club, although its opening has been delayed for six months until next spring. In the summer, the 25 acres of open space and riverside promenades will seem more inviting for the office workers who complain of having nowhere to go at lunchtime. That said, Canary Wharf's claim that 'the environment offers a higher quality of working life than any other in London, with incalculable benefits in terms of morale, productivity and staff retention' looks far-fetched at present. What of Canary Wharf's central claim that it offers 'unprecedented benefits to modern, competitive businesses' compared with London's other inadequate and dear office accommodation? The property industry would largely agree with Canary Wharf that 'the quality of the buildings surpasses that of any other office accommodation in the capital'. Nonetheless, there is no shortage of high-quality, modern buildings in other parts of London. According to APR, an independent research body, two-thirds of the 40m sq ft available for let in central London is brand new. In any case, the problem for London developers is not that companies are happy with their existing offices, but that they cannot escape from lengthy leases at overpriced rents. Similarly, Canary Wharf is not unique in its promise to help companies 'improve their operational efficiency and competitiveness', although the claim is well founded. Ogilvy &amp; Mather is pleased with the improvement in culture and communications that has resulted from its move. 'There is a real buzz,' says Mr Walsh. The cost savings of moving to Canary Wharf have narrowed over the past two years, as rents in some parts of central London have halved. Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which is thought to be paying around Pounds 30 per sq ft at Canary Wharf, signed its lease when the rent at its old headquarters was threatening to soar. Now agents reckon that renewing its old lease would cost the same as or less than it is paying at Canary Wharf. Canary Wharf is expensive compared with the rest of Docklands, where it can cost less than Pounds 10 per sq ft to rent modern, air-conditioned space. If, for instance, the Department of the Environment moves to Docklands, it will be difficult to justify a deal with Olympia &amp; York, unless it is at an unprecedentedly cheap rate. Canary Wharf also claims that its tenants 'will be at the heart of the most rapidly improving transport infrastructure in the country, in an area which will become the most accessible in the capital'. The first point is probably true: Pounds 3.5bn is being ploughed into Docklands transport links. The second point is more controversial. Some commentators think that, if Canary Wharf achieves its projected 50,000 jobs, the rail, riverbus and road capacity may be stretched. The reservations expressed by some occupants and potential tenants are not usually shared by casual visitors. The scale, detail and sheer novelty of the project impress many who flock to it at weekends. Visitors' reactions to the architecture vary hugely. Cesar Pelli's imposing steel tower has been widely acclaimed, but many, like Prince Charles, detest the monolithic scale of the buildings. Canary Wharf's visitors' centre plaintively reminds critics: 'Sir Christopher Wren's plans for St Paul's attracted a considerable amount of criticism for its size at the time.' The verdict is also mixed on the interior, which ranges in style from an elegant glass dome at Cabot Place East to a slightly oppressive atrium tower clad in 199 tonnes of streaky, blood-red marble. Visitors are not just regaled by the architecture. A thousand people a day visit Canary Wharf's visitors' centre, which is an entertaining mix of history and hyperbole. 'Canary Wharf, London's third business district, is perhaps this century's prime example of Britain's unwavering strength and confidence,' says a display board. 'The best transport system in London,' trumpets another. The greatest attraction of Canary Wharf lies in the views from its 800 ft tower, the tallest in the UK. Visits have been limited to potential tenants, opinion-formers and potential investors in the Enterprise Zone Trust - which was trying to raise Pounds 215m on one of the Canary Wharf buildings before it was withdrawn yesterday. But O&amp;Y is 'seriously considering' extending this opportunity to the public. A chance to see a view of London hitherto confined to aircraft pilots is likely to pull in the crowds. From 800 ft up, there is a panoramic view across areas as diverse as the City, Wapping, Limehouse, Stepney, the Royal Docks, Bromley, Stratford, Greenwich and the Isle of Dogs, displaying dramatic contrasts in architecture and wealth. Letting visitors up the tower could be a profitable marketing ploy. Anything that adds to Canary Wharf's profile could help overcome the business world's ambivalence towards the project. As a starting point, the invitation to the top of the tower has been extended to London's taxi drivers - some of the most influential arbiters of opinion in the capital.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                      Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Year to Jan 92         -2.9    -13.8         -1.1             -6.9 Quarter to Jan 92       0.6     -3.0          0.3             -0.8 Month of Jan 92        -0.1     -0.9          0.2             -0.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Investment Property Databank  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Euro Disney: The story so far - City measures success in feet CITY of London analysts believe that Euro Disney's success depends on its ability to meet its target of 11m visitors in its first year of operation, up to March 1993. But the signs are that it is already failing to do so. Euro Disney recently released figures suggesting that so far an average 30,137 people a day visited in its first two months after opening on April 12. This would put it on course to achieve its 11m target. But what threatens to savage the venture in the mid-term is a looming failure to maintain the daily attendance figure into October and beyond. While the venture may be achieving its daily 30,000 admission figure, analysts view a daily 20,000 average for the period October 1992 to March 1993 as optimistic. Even given a mini-boom of a daily average of 45,000 in the peak months of July and August, some analysts estimate that it could be heading for a total of 8.4m visitors. According to Ms Anita Hibbert of securities house Smith New Court: 'Although that daily average is meeting Euro Disney's 11m target, it does not allow for sea-sonality.' By having achieved only 30,000 per day so far - in good weather and with frequent holidays in its main European markets - it is already facing difficulties meeting its target, especially as winter draws closer. Euro Disney has projected 14m visitors for its second year; that figure is already looking over-optimistic, according to analysts. Mr Nigel Reed, of Paribas Capital Markets Group, is another sceptic, although he believes it premature to make conclusions. 'We are cautious about the project. It's early days but the early signs have not been encouraging. Paribas has been advising shareholders to sell.' Mr Nicholas de Schonen, head of corporate communications at Euro Disney, said yesterday: 'We need to go through one year to have a picture of the situation. Our experience is too short to make any conclusions.'</p>

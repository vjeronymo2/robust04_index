			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOREROS OPEN WITH 20-12 VICTORY OVER OCCIDENTAL  </P> <P> It was classic USD-Occidental football -- with one exception.  </P> <P> For the first time since 1981 and the first time in USD Coach Brian Fogarty's  eight years at the school, USD was the winner -- 20-12 in front of 4,000 fans  in USD's Torero Stadium.  </P> <P> "It was one of those deals where we knew we could always do it, but in years  past, we never could quite pull it off," Fogarty said.  </P> <P> This time, of course, USD pulled it off, despite:  </P> <P>  -- Having to wait a while to start after the stadium's lighting system shut  down before the game. The delay created doubts as to whether the game could be  played but lasted only 15 minutes.  </P> <P>  -- Having to watch Brian Madlangbayan, a freshman who led El Camino High to  the San Diego Section 2-A championship in 1989, run for 157 yards in 28  carries.  </P> <P>  -- Having to wait until just 2 minutes 10 seconds were left in the game before  being able to breathe easily.  </P> <P> On a fourth-and-three from the Toreros 19-yard line with 2:10 left, USD  linebacker Lenny Territo stopped Occidental quarterback John Selle for no gain  to preserve the victory.  </P> <P> Charles Taumoepeau gained 146 yards in 25 carries to earn game ball honors for  USD.  </P> <P> Occidental, taking advantage of a number of early USD mistakes, took a 12-10  lead into halftime. The Tigers' advantage could have been much greater, but USD  pulled together defensively a number of times to keep it close.  </P> <P> Madlangbayan had 99 yards in nine carries in the first quarter alone, including  a 65-yarder on the Tigers' first scoring drive. From the Occidental 31, he took  a handoff, veered to the right sideline, high-stepped a diving USD tackler and  ran to the 4-yard line before being dropped by Darryl Jackson.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Selle scored on a nifty keeper around left end The snap was  high on the conversion, and Occidental held a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> On its ensuing possession, USD drove 45 yards in 11 plays before All-American  kicker Dave Bergmann was successful on a 40-yard field goal 4:29 into the  second quarter.  </P> <P> In the first quarter, Occidental kicker Mark Collinsworth had missed badly from  40 yards. That occurred just a few minutes before USD stopped Madlangbayan for  no gain on a fourth-and-one from the Torero 9-yard line.  </P> <P> Those opportunities for Occidental came after two USD fumbles in the first 5:15  of the game. This after Todd Jackson, USD's all-time leading rusher who  graduated last spring, had just two fumbles in 189 attempts in 1989.  </P> <P> Occidental's second touchdown came with 7:07 left in the second quarter and  gave the Tigers' a 12-3 lead. Sophomore fullback Michael Winslow dived over  from the 1, capping a 65-yard, 10-play drive. The conversion again was no good  after a muffed snap.  </P> <P> With 2:58 remaining, USD sophomore Damien Staricka scored on a 6-yard option  play around left end to cap a 59-yard, nine-play drive. The carry was  Staricka's first as a college player.  </P> <P> Occidental looked to be in great shape after Ben White returned the ensuing  kickoff 68 yards to USD's 20, but backup quarterback Derrick Williams, who came  in for the first time on the drive, fumbled four plays later, and USD  linebacker Dan Chandler recovered at the 3-yard line.  </P> <P> To start the second half, Bergmann kicked a 41-yard field goal to give USD a  13-12 lead. Then after Occidental went nowhere on its possession, USD drove  55-yards for a touchdown in just under four minutes to pull ahead, 20-12.  </P> <P> Quarterback Brendan Murphy hit Zac Fielder on a crossing pattern for the score.  </P></p>

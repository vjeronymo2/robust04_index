			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (3): Enter the foreign investor - Dhaka Stock Exchange The sight of foreign capital has stirred the sleepy Dhaka Stock Exchange into action. An estimated Dollars 50m has flowed into Bangladeshi shares since the end of last year, borne by the tide of money washing through emerging markets over the past 12 months. It amounts to a few drops of capital compared with the buckets poured into India and China, but for Bangladesh any sign of foreign investment interest is welcome. After rising a mere 6 per cent last year, the Dhaka SE index has doubled in 1994. 'This is the first time foreign investors are investing in Bangladesh,' says Mr Kurshid Alam, the DSE chairman. Fund managers who have visited Dhaka include executives from the Hong Kong-based Regent financial services group, which manages the Regent Pacific Moghul Fund, which invests in southern Asia, from Jardine Fleming of Hong Kong and Fidelity of the US. Stockbrokers from Smith New Court of the UK and WI Carr, an affiliate of France's Banque Indo-Suez, have also called on Mr Alam and his colleagues. Foreigners now own an estimated 5 per cent of Bangladeshi stocks which have a combined capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn. There are no ceilings on foreign ownership of the 142 listed companies. But stock can be difficult to acquire because an estimated 50 per cent of shares are owned by founding entrepreneurs and their families and a further 40 per cent locked in long-term holdings with government financial institutions. Mr Imtiyaz Hussain, a broker and investment adviser, says this leaves only about 10 per cent of stock floating free. 'Of course, this tends to drive up prices.' Foreign buyers have concentrated on about 15 leading shares whose prices have climbed 300 per cent and more. For example, Beximco, a diversified trading company, was quoted last month at Tk80, more than four times higher than its low of last year of Tk18. Bangladesh Tobacco, the affiliate of Britain's BAT Industries traded last month at Tk230, up from last year's low of Tk70. The trading room is a dark hall in which tables covered with white tablecloths are set out in a circle. The stockbrokers sit at the tables, with microphones in front. Trading is carried out in bursts of frantic shouting into the microphones. Officials record the prices in chalk on a large blackboard occupying one whole wall of the room. Trades are settled in five days. There is no forward or futures market. The market is supervised by a Securities Commission, founded only last year.</p>

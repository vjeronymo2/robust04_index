			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Observer: Reconstructed thoughts More proof, if such were needed, that French monetary policy is still in disarray after August's European currency upset. Bank of France governor Jacques de Larosiere has abruptly withdrawn his contribution to a book, The European Currency Crisis: One Year On, to be published later this month. His action contrasts with that of other distinguished contributors such as Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank boss, who cheerfully amended their offerings to take account of last month's upheavals. That de Larosiere might be in a fix is understandable. His piece was to be entitled 'The experience of defending the franc' and would presumably have needed to be rewritten to reflect the recent discomfiture of the currency. No doubt he has his hands full moving from his gilded Parisian office to the president's desk at the equally opulent, if more modern, headquarters of the EBRD. But Paul Temperton, the book's editor at Probus Europe, is a bit miffed that no French official has been prepared to step into the breach. Despite repeated badgering, there has also been silence as to whether de Larosiere or another official will join the book's authors and speak at the London launch later this month. 'We've tried everything,' cries Temperton, who would still be prepared to make space for a French contribution in any second edition.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Lord Hollick and Paul Foot leave the Mirror: Resignations raise questions on newspaper's policy THE uncertainty over the future of Mirror Group Newspapers intensified yesterday with the resignation of two very different men - Lord Hollick, a non-executive director, and Mr Paul Foot, long-standing Daily Mirror columnist. Both personified the traditional links between Mirror Group Newspapers and support for the Labour Party and both had become increasingly isolated at the popular newspaper group. Last month Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and chief executive of MAI, the financial services and television company, found himself in a minority of one on the MGN board. Lord Hollick said then that he could not support fully the view of his fellow directors. The board had backed the leadership of Mr David Montgomery, the chief executive and the policies the company had been pursuing. The move seemed to represent a split between the Labour peer and Mr Montgomery. The two had come to the company together to try to improve efficiency and undo some of the financial damage left by its former proprietor Mr Robert Maxwell. Lord Hollick did not resign immediately because he was waiting to see whether note was taken of any of his criticisms. Yesterday he said in a statement: 'I have for several months voiced my concerns about a number of governance and policy matters which I believe to be important to the long-term commercial and editorial success of Mirror Group Newspapers.' He added: 'Unfortunately it has not been possible to resolve these matters and I have therefore tendered my resignation. I wish MGN every success.' Lord Hollick was not immediately available for any further comment but it is believed he was concerned about the editorial independence of the paper, the strength of its commitment to Labour, the number of journalists hired from Today - which Mr Montgomery used to edit - and the way Mirror staff have been treated. Lord Hollick is believed to be concerned about what he sees as the growing gap between what the Mirror preaches and how it behaves. He is also concerned about the effect that a weakening of the paper's traditional links with Labour could have on its business prospects. The Mirror's political stance has usually been seen as an important part of its appeal to readers. Mr Foot, the award-winning journalist who last week tried unsuccessfully to publish a column critical of Daily Mirror management, said in a letter to Mr David Banks, the Daily Mirror editor, that his position had become impossible. After Mr Foot handed out copies of his unpublished page in the street outside the Daily Mirror building last week Mr Banks issued a statement saying Mr Foot should take sick leave to rest. The Mirror editor said yesterday Mr Foot had done the honourable thing and that he would be replaced this week.</p>

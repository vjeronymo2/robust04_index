			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Report calls Pounds 2bn road-building programme into question Techniques used by the Department of Transport for more than 20 years to assess road-building schemes are challenged in a report by independent transport experts published yesterday. Their conclusions bring into question the methods by which the government justifies its annual Pounds 2bn road-building programme. But its publication by the government, after a nine-month delay, may not be entirely fortuitous. With the roads spending programme under pressure from budget cuts it will provide arguments for ministers trying to justify the failure to build long-promised projects. The authors, a group of nine academics, traffic consultants and surveyors, set out to answer four questions: Do road improvements create more traffic  -as opposed to diverting vehicles from other congested roads? If so, what are the consequences for the planning and design of road schemes and does it matter? What road schemes are most likely to be affected? How should present methods of forecasting and appraisal be amended? Their answers provide a highly critical analysis of the government's current techniques. The experts conclude: Additional, or 'induced' traffic 'can and does occur, probably quite extensively, though its size and significance is likely to vary widely in different circumstances'. Since the Department of Transport's own calculations assume that people attach value to time savings made on travel 'travellers must, as a matter of logic, be assumed to respond . . . by travelling more or further.' 'The economic value of a scheme can be overestimated by the omission of even a small amount of induced traffic. We consider that this is a matter of profound importance.' Induced traffic makes most difference to plans when congestion is already high. Schemes must be most carefully appraised when they involve roads in and around towns, tunnels or bridges crossing river estuaries and strategic motorways. Road planning must take account of the likelihood that new roads create traffic. Improvements to long-distance routes must weigh their impact on the entire corridor or region involved and not just on local traffic. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said that all road schemes at the planning stage would be reviewed and that further research would be carried out into ways of forecasting traffic volumes. But he tried to play down the impact of the report, saying: 'Although the report is consistent with our long-standing view that new schemes do not generate a significant number of trips which are entirely new, the overall amount of traffic on the network may in some cases rise by more than is usually allowed for.' Transport 2000, which opposes the government's road-building programme, called the report 'a watershed in the transport debate'. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England said the review 'tears the heart out of the government's road-building policy and should trigger a fundamental review'.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN OPPONENT PULLS PLUG ON BID TO BROADCAST GAME;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CAL POLY SLO OFFICIALS FEAR THAT ALLOWING KADY TO TELEVISE  DIVISION II PLAYOFF WOULD CUT ATTENDANCE.  </P> <P> Television station KADY's plans to broadcast Saturday's Division II football  playoff game between Cal State Northridge and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo were  scuttled Tuesday by athletic officials from the host school.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo administrators denied the station permission to broadcast the 1  p.m. game, saying they feared television coverage might adversely affect  attendance. KADY had planned to televise the game on a delay basis beginning at  11 p.m.  </P> <P> The decision, San Luis Obispo officials say, came down to a matter of money.  </P> <P> "We've gotta come up with some big bucks," said Ken Walker, San Luis Obispo's  athletic director. "We submitted a bid based on a gate and we had to guarantee  the NCAA a healthy fraction of it. We need to have as many people here as  possible."  </P> <P> Walker said school officials might change their minds if advance ticket sales  are brisk, but KADY sports director Clay Morgan said the station no longer is  interested in televising the game.  </P> <P> "We won't be doing it. We just can't," Morgan said. "If they called us back  later this week, we'd have to say no. There's just too many logistics  problems."  </P> <P> Morgan said the station's broadcast of a Nov. 3 regular-season game between the  same teams drew a very good response.  </P> <P> "We've had a ton of calls, people asking if we were going to do this week's  game," Morgan said. "I was a little surprised (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) said  no. But I understand."  </P> <P> In the teams' earlier meeting, San Luis Obispo (9-1) defeated Northridge (7-3),  6-3, before a capacity crowd of more than 7,000 at North Campus Stadium. The  victory earned the Mustangs a share of the WFC championship with CSUN.  </P> <P> Northridge is making its first Division II playoff appearance.  </P> <P> Saturday's game will be broadcast live on radio by KGIL 1260 and KJDJ 1030,  beginning at 12:45 p.m.  </P></p>

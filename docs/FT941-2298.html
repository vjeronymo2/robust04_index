			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Transport police muddle resolved Fears expressed by Labour MPs that the jurisdiction of British Transport Police may be curtailed to provide new business for private-sector security companies were rejected by the government in the Commons last night. Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, insisted that a bill hurriedly introduced to repair an omission in the legislation privatising British Rail would ensure that the jurisdiction and powers of the transport police were unimpaired. The error arose because the railway privatisation act ignored several amendments to the act that nationalised the railways which had widened the powers of transport police. In effect, the legislation would have allowed transport police to deal with incidents affecting privatised railway companies but would have prevented them carrying out further inquiries. Transport police also warned that the legislation as it stood made it unclear whether they would have the authority to pursue offenders outside railway property. Mr Freeman confirmed that the transport police would have 'complete jurisdiction' wherever necessary when pursuing a suspect off railway premises. The transport police (jurisdiction) bill now goes to the House of Lords. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the Lords to examine the bill closely to ensure that it would not lead to more of the railway network being exempted from coverage by the transport police. Mr Dobson warned that if the bill resulted in the ending of the transport police's comprehensive coverage of the rail network it would become more vulnerable. He said that the bill had been introduced as an emergency measure because of 'another fine mess' by the government. Mr Freeman said some 'non-core activities', such as the guarding of freight depots, might be undertaken by private security companies.</p>

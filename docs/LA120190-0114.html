			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CONVICTED AFTER DAUGHTER RECALLS MURDER  </P> <P> A retired firefighter was convicted on Friday of murder after his daughter  testified that she witnessed the killing of her girlfriend 21 years ago but had  repressed it until after she became a parent.  </P> <P> Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, now 30, told a bizarre and shocking tale in the San  Mateo County Courthouse of how as a girl of 8, she watched in horror as her  father, George Franklin, crashed a rock into the skull of Susan Nason, her best  childhood friend in September, 1969.  </P> <P> For reasons that she could not explain, she forgot what she witnessed, and only  began recollecting the murder one afternoon in early 1989, as she looked after  her own young daughter in her Canoga Park home.  </P> <P> When the jury foreman read the verdict of guilty of first-degree murder,  Franklin-Lipsker, who was sitting in the front row of the courtroom, turned and  embraced Margaret Nason, the mother of the victim. Both women wept.  </P> <P> "There can't be a true victory for me because it is my father,"  Franklin-Lipsker said after she composed herself. "I'm relieved it's over. I  know I did the right thing to come forward."  </P> <P> "It does lay it to rest, 21 years later," Nason said. She and her husband, Don,  had attended virtually all of the 3 1/2-week trial. The Nasons live in the same  suburban Foster City home as they did when Susan, the younger of their two  daughters, was abducted on Sept. 22, 1969.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be there. I wanted to hear the conclusion to what happened to my  daughter," Margaret Nason said.  </P> <P> Jurors left the courthouse without speaking about the case. They reached the  verdict after a day and a half of deliberation.  </P> <P> "They saw through the smoke and did their job," said Bob Morse, a district  attorney's inspector who investigated the case. "They're heroes."  </P> <P> Franklin, 51, a burly, craggy-faced and silver-haired man, showed no emotion  when the verdict was read. Superior Court Judge Thomas Smith set Jan. 29 for  sentencing. Frankin faces a penalty of life in prison with the possibility of  parole. The capital punishment law in effect at the time of the crime was later  ruled unconstitutional.  </P> <P> His lawyer, Douglas Horngrad, did not comment. But his face fell into his hands  when the verdict was read. He had spent long hours cross-examining the  often-combative Franklin-Lipsker in an effort to point up voids and  inconsistencies in her memory.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced that the verdict will stand," said San Mateo County Deputy Dist.  Atty. Elaine Tipton, who prosecuted the difficult case.  </P> <P> She attributed the verdict to the "compelling nature of the evidence" that  corroborated Franklin-Lipsker's testimony, including the crushed ring that  Susan Nason had been wearing at the time of her murder and that the San Mateo  County Sheriff's Department kept for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> Franklin-Lipsker had testified that she was riding in her father's van when he  picked up her schoolmate Susan from the street near their homes. They drove to  an isolated spot on the road to the coast west of Foster City. There, her  father molested Nason on a mattress in the back of the van, then took a rock  and smashed her skull. When she tried to go to her friend, her father stopped  her and threatened to kill her if she ever told what had happened.  </P> <P> As they drove home that evening, she testified, she told her father that they  should not leave "Susie" because she would become cold and frightened.  </P> <P> Franklin, who retired on disability from the San Mateo Fire Department in 1981,  had been living in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael and dabbling in real  estate when he was arrested Nov. 28, 1989.  </P> <P> Other members of the Franklin family revealed that they had suspected him of  committing the crime. A sister even called authorities a few years ago. But  there was nothing to connect him to the murder until the eyewitness,  Franklin-Lipsker, came forward. As it was, her memory often was hazy and  shifting. She testified that details continued to come back even as the trial  opened.  </P> <P> Franklin-Lipsker, who recently moved to Switzerland, acknowledged that she sold  her "life rights" in lucrative book and film deals. In addition to a book based  on her authorized version of the story, another author plans to write a book  about the strange case.  </P> <P> The murder of Susan Nason was the first ever investigated by the Foster City  Police Department. The city had been created only a few years earlier when a  developer began building on what had been a dairy farm and mud flats on San  Francisco Bay, between San Francisco and San Jose.  </P> <P> With its motto, "Growing Beautifully," low-priced houses and promises of safe  streets, the so-called instant suburb quickly drew many young families in the  mid-1960s. Among the first to move in were the Nasons and the Franklins. They  lived only a few doors apart.  </P> <P> George and Leah Franklin had married in 1957 and had five children by 1963.  Eileen, the middle child, and Susan Nason had just started the third grade in  September, 1969, at Foster City Elementary School a short walk away.  </P> <P> Nason disappeared at roughly the same time as one of California's most  sensational murders -- that of actress Sharon Tate by Charles Manson and his  followers. But in the San Mateo Times, the disappearance of Susan Nason was the  headline news, and remained so until after her body was found on Dec. 2, 1969.  </P> <P> Tipton, trying to explain how Franklin evaded capture for so long, said the  "mind set" of investigators at the time was that child molesters are strangers.  In fact, she noted, most child molesters and killers know their victims.  </P> <P> Bill Hensel, who had been the lead detective on the case in 1969, retired from  police work nearly 20 years ago, but said in an interview after Franklin's  arrest that he often thought about the crime. For years after he left police  work, he would write to the state Department of Justice with any ideas he had  for investigators to follow.  </P> <P> "Any time a kid is snatched, I always think of Susan," he said. And he often  thought, "What could I have missed?"  </P> <P> Hensel was a firefighter before he went into police work, and said he wonders  whether he would have suspected fellow firefighter Franklin, if for some reason  his name had come up. "Firefighters save people," he said. They're "heroes"  trained to save lives, he said.  </P> <P> In retrospect, Hensel said, he should have interviewed each child who lived in  the neighborhood separately. Perhaps that would have given young Franklin the  courage to reveal what she knew. "I think the girl would have broke down," he  said.  </P> <P> "It will go to sleep now," Hensel said. ". . . There will be rest."  </P></p>

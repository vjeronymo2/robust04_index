			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The chetniks have only stopped short of dropping an  atom bomb on the residents of Gorazde. They are mercilessly  killing the people with everything they have, destroying their  houses. Yesterday afternoon, the chetniks wreaked havoc in  Gorazde with aerosol surface-to-surface missiles PAB-275.  Houses were destroyed as if made out of cards. The roofs of  all buildings within a radius of 200 meters were blown off and  the walls fractured. Dozens of people were killed and wounded.  Owing to the constant fire by chetniks from the surrounding  hills, the casualties have not yet been evacuated from these  ruins.    According to reliable information, these missiles were  launched from Pljevlje [in Montenegro, 60 km away]. This is yet  another proof of the involvement by the so-called Yugoslavia in  the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The crying and screaming  of the seriously wounded were heard coming from these ruins  throughout the night.    The Gorazde valley is a valley of pain, screaming, and  horror. The constant deadly pounding by those who do not  distinguish between killing people and drinking water last night  killed Dr. Muhamed Pasic, who, despite a rain of sniper bullets,  went to give medical help to the seriously wounded in the 1 May  district.    This morning, the chetniks are continuing the realization of  their bloody plan, wiping Gorazde from the face of the earth.  The chetniks confirmed this morning that they only understand  the language of force and that they are unable to live in peace.  The inferno in Gorazde continues. Further human lives are  being lost, so is the hope among the survivors that someone will  finally demonstrate to the chetniks with force that the time of  cavemen, barbarism, and unpunished crime has long gone.</p>

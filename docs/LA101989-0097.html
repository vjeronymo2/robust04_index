			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN DIMAS;  </P> <P> PANEL TO WOO DEVELOPER  </P> <P> A City Council subcommittee has been created to explore whether Century  American developers, who in August turned to the county for approval of a  119-home development in an unincorporated island north of Via Verde, can be  persuaded to resume discussions with the city.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Maria Tortorelli and Councilman Sandy McHenry were named to the  subcommittee last week, when the council voted unanimously to go on record  opposing the project, which is being processed by the county.  </P> <P> Roger Hobbs, president of Century American, an Orange-based development firm,  told the council he abandoned the city's review process after at least 16  months of discussion with a city review panel only because he was uncertain of  support from the council. He said the company would like a joint city-county  project.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM ANNOUNCES AGGRESSIVE PRICES ON SATURN CARS  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. on Thursday announced an "aggressive pricing strategy and  warranty package" for its long-awaited Saturn compact cars, with base prices  for the new line starting at $7,995 and ranging up to $11,775 for a sporty,  two-door coupe.  </P> <P> The least expensive model, a four-door sedan, will get 37 miles per gallon of  gasoline in highway driving and 27 miles per gallon in the city, GM said.  </P> <P> "The market has been waiting for Saturn for some time, and these prices put us  at a distinct competitive advantage against imports," GM president Lloyd E.  Reuss said Thursday night at a meeting of Saturn dealers in Nashville, Tenn.  </P> <P> GM will unveil the four new models publicly for the first time next Thursday at  Saturn's final assembly plant in Spring Hill, Tenn. All four are powered by a  new 1.9-liter, four-cylinder aluminum engine.  </P> <P> To counteract consumer resistence to an unproven model, Saturn will offer a  warranty package that includes a three-year/36,000-mile warranty with no  deductible and a money-back "charter buyer" guarantee that allows original  buyers of 1991 models to return them for a full refund within 30 days or 1,500  miles if dissatisfied.  </P></p>

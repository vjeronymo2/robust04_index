			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kwik Save jumps Food retailer Kwik Save soared as contrasting stories did the rounds in the market. One tale was that Kwik Save was planning to acquire the Lo-Cost food retail chain from Argyll Group. Another view held that 29.2 per cent stake holder Dairy Farm, a Hong-Kong based group, planned to sell its stake in Kwik Save - a move that could trigger a bid from the purchaser. However, both stories were treated with some caution by analysts. Dealers also said that German discount food retailer Aldi was looking for a UK alliance and Kwik Save could be a candidate. The favourite for such an alliance remains Gateway. Shares in Kwik Save closed 37 ahead at 649p, while Argyll put on a more modest 7 1/2 to 303 1/2 p, after volume of 5.2m.</p>

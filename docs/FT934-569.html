			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Exxon wins Dollars 2bn tax dispute in US Exxon won a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) tax dispute with the US Internal Revenue Service in a transfer pricing case which it said would set a precedent for other US companies operating internationally, writes Richard Waters in New York. The IRS had claimed that an oil trading consortium, of which Exxon was a part, along with other US energy companies, had sold Saudi Arabian crude oil at below market prices in 1979-81 to affiliates overseas. This reduced taxable profits in the US, where the trading company, Aramco, was based. In a ruling handed down late on Tuesday, the US Tax Court backed Exxon's argument that it had been constrained by a Saudi Arabian government directive at the time. The kingdom was attempting to damp down the oil price, and had specified the price at which Saudi crude could be sold, it said. 'For the first time, a foreign legal restriction has been granted weight' in a US transfer pricing case, said Mr William O'Brien, Exxon's general tax counsel. Other US companies which operate under pricing restrictions outside the US would be less open to challenge from the US tax authorities as a result, he said. This week's judgment also found in favour of Texaco, another partner in Aramco. Two other partners, Mobil and Chevron, were not involved in the case which led to yesterday's decision.</p>

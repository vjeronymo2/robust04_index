			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- The sending to Rwanda of the  multinational forces under French command does not fully meet  the "classical" criteria for UN peace-keeping, but in conditions  of the continuing tragedy it is a step that is necessary in  order to stabilize the humanitarian situation in that country.  This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the department of information and press of the  Russian Foreign Ministry.    A few days ago the UN Security Council, he noted, adopted a  decision on sending multinational forces to Rwanda. The core of  these forces would be made up of a contingent of French troops.  It is proposed that the French contingent will number about  2,000 men. All the expenses connected with carrying out this  operation will be borne by the relevant countries.    Russia supported this UN Security Council resolution,  considering that this decision is an enforced step but an  essential one in the present circumstances. Here, we proceeded  from the position that the human tragedy in Rwanda, which is  unprecedented in its scale, and the continuing extermination of  the civilian population of this long-suffering country dictates  the necessity of adopting urgent and commensurate measures  capable of halting further bloodshed in Rwanda. Moreover, we  have taken account of the fact that the full deployment of  additional UN forces will need quite a long period of time,"  Karasin said.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): The logic is impeccable - Multi-Purpose Vehicles THEY call them multi-purpose vehicles, or MPVs for short, and their numbers are growing fast because they are so practical. Buyers all over the world have found that MPVs are like dishwashers and home laundries. Once you have acquired one you find it hard to believe you ever managed to live without it. The logic behind the MPV is so impeccable it seems odd that cars were ever made car-shaped instead of box-shaped. There is no better shape for a container to put things - or for that matter, people - in than a box. It combines maximum interior space with minimum external dimensions. Could there be a better formula for a car to be driven and parked on increasingly crowded roads? Why should a car's engine stick out in front, as the horse did before mechanically propelled vehicles were invented? Designing the 'three-box' car (bonnet, body and boot) was really a retrograde step because the first horseless carriage had all the machinery underneath. But the first MPV was rear-engined. The VW Microbus of over 40 years ago was a delivery van with three rows of seats and windows, powered by a hard-worked VW Beetle engine under the boot. It was incredibly successful, and so long lived that it has only been replaced within the last 10 years. Since then, MPVs have largely left their commercial roots behind. They are now like cars to drive, even though some still look rather van-like, being essentially box-shaped. Best known of the new generation of MPVs in Europe is the slant-nosed Renault Espace that resembles a French TGV (train grand vitesse). It seats up to seven, but takes up no more road or parking space than a Ford Mondeo. In a market segment that accounted for 1 per cent of total new car sales in Western Europe last year and is projected to grow to 2 per cent in 1996 and 3 per cent by 2001, the Espace continues to dominate. The 56,317 units sold last year (one in four of them turbo-diesel powered) accounted for exactly 50 per cent of the Euro-MPV market. Next to Espace the most significant purpose-designed Euro-MPV, as distinct from a panel van conversion, is the Nissan Serena. It is made in Spain, where Nissan is half-way through a Dollars 1.4bn, five-year investment programme running until 1996. About 80 per cent of Serena's content is European. Current production capacity is 205 units per day and the line is 50 per cent automated. If demand rises, Nissan will install more robots to boost output. But Espace and Serena are only the tip of a European MPV iceberg. Next year, a vehicle jointly developed by Fiat and PSA and bearing a flattering resemblance to the Renault Espace will enter the market. The year after, a co-operative venture by VW and Ford will result in production of a multi-purpose vehicle starting in Portugal. Other European manufacturers with MPVs on the way include BMW and Mercedes-Benz; Volvo (a joint effort with its partner, Renault); and Opel. European producers appear to be contemplating a merging of function and identity between the currently popular on-off road 4x4 vehicles and MPVs. Few on-off road 4x4 owners ever contemplate seriously driving across country  -not least because it is difficult to find anywhere to do so without offending either the law or environmentalists, perhaps both. Many of these 4x4s are bought to use as car alternatives by people who value their high driving position, roominess and individual styling, and to whom sheer off-road capability has very low priority. Some may well want enough additional traction to cope with snowy hills or crossing a muddy field but would not dream of driving over really rough terrain. For them, the ideal vehicle would be a tall MPV with four-wheel drive - such as the Renault Espace Quadra or the Mitsubishi 4x4 Space Wagon. The current boom in sales of 4x4s designed specifically as off-road vehicles could run out of steam in the next few years, as manufacturers introduce on-road MPVs with either selectable or full-time four wheel drive. Japan has a number of MPVs in production, although not all of them come to Europe. One that does come is the Toyota Previa, a purpose-designed MPV which succeeded the original panel van-based Space Cruiser. Previa is a little bigger overall than the Espace, seats up to eight people and has a 2.4-litre, 4-cylinder engine laid on its side and tucked away under the floor. Although strikingly spacious, it is not so big and bulky as to be difficult to squeeze into a meter bay. Although Europe, beginning with the VW Microbus of the 1950s, is the ancestral home of the MPV, the US is where the concept has really taken off. There they are called mini-vans, although by European standards they are anything but mini-sized. Nearly 4m units of Chrysler's Voyager mini-van (MPV) have been sold worldwide since its launch in 1983, about 500,000 of them in the 1993 model year just ending. It is the world's most popular MPV; for the last seven years it has held more than 50 per cent of the mini-van market in the US. Production of the Voyager began in Europe last year at the Eurostar plant in Austria operated by Chrysler in partnership with Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG. This year's scheduled output of 27,000 units is forecast to increase to 50,000 a year in 1994-95. In two years time a new model with sliding passenger doors on each side, instead of only one on the right hand side, will make the production of right-hand steering versions for the UK market commercially viable. Ford's rival to the Chrysler Voyager is the Aerostar, launched in the US in mid-1985 and - a foretaste of things to come in the European MPV market - produced in two-wheel or four-wheel drive versions with 3-litre or 4-litre V6 engines.</p>

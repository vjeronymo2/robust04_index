			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" report] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem leader  Alija Izetbegovic on Tuesday [24 May] dismissed as utterly  unacceptable the European Union (E.U.) plan on the territorial  division of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  under which 51 per cent of the territory would go to the  Moslem-Croat federation, and 49 per cent to the Serbs.    In a statement to Radio France International (RFI), whose  programme was monitored in Belgrade, Izetbegovic said that the  world's insistence on such a settlement implied a continuation  of the war. Foreign ministers of the United States, Russia,  Great Britain and the European `troika' (Belgium, Greece and  Germany) accepted in mid-May the E.U. formula envisaging this  division of the Bosnian territory.    The Bosnian Serbs, who owned 64 per cent of the territory  before the outbreak of the war in 1992, now control 70 per cent.  Izetbegovic described the forthcoming Geneva meeting of a  Bosnian Moslem delegation with U.S. presidential envoy Charles  Redman and the contact group for Bosnia not as negotiations, but  simply as meetings in which Redman and the contact group would  inform the Bosnian Moslem side about their stands.    The contact group, made up of U.S., Russian, E.U. and U.N.  representatives, was set up in late April with the aim of  restoring the Bosnian peace process. Izetbegovic took another  opportunity to disparage special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi and  said that Akashi had fallen into oblivion and that he was  already regarded as history in Bosnia.</p>

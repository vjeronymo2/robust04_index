			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Elizabeth David's kitchen items sold The pine kitchen table on which Elizabeth David prepared recipes for cookery books that changed the eating habits of a generation sold for Pounds 1,100 at Phillips in Bayswater yesterday to Pru Leith, the restaurateur. Like most of the 177 lots taken from the kitchen of Elizabeth David, who died in 1992, it went far ahead of its pre-sale estimate. The auction brought in Pounds 49,000 compared with a Pounds 20,000 forecast. More than 1,000 people crowded the small saleroom. David is credited with introducing the taste for Mediterranean flavours to post-war Britain. A copper frying pan made Pounds 368 and an earthenware pot containing a selection of wooden spoons and forks Pounds 460. A group of seven of Elizabeth David's cookery books, one with handwritten recipes, made Pounds 520 (top estimate Pounds 120). Two albums containing cards, scraps and cuttings, with some hand-coloured sketches by John Minton, the artist and illustrator of her books, realised Pounds 483.</p>

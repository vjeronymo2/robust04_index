			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: SA bank expands in Mideast South Africa's biggest bank, ABSA Bank, has announced the establishment of links with 15 financial institutions in Bahrain's offshore banking centre to try to finance trade between the two areas, Reuter reports from Manama. Mr Stephanus Smith, head of ABSA's international banking services, said all of the Bahrain-based banks he visited agreed to open foreign exchange lines and most were also prepared to consider placing money market lines for offshore finance at the South African bank's disposal. He said this would bring the total of Middle East banks ready to do business with ABSA Bank to around 40. Gulf states have not formally lifted sanctions against South Africa but deals which took place for years are gathering momentum as apartheid is dismantled.</p>

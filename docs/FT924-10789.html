			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts spurred on by stronger sterling UK GOVERNMENT bonds enjoyed a strong rally, spurred on by sterling's firmness in the foreign exchanges, and gained up to a point at the long end. The pound strengthened to DM2.4269, from DM2.4207 late on Tuesday in London. Dealers said the market received a further lift in the afternoon following comments from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. The governor stressed the need to aim for non-inflationary growth and said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 1.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent target range for inflation was likely to be met assuming Britain kept a tight fiscal stance. Dealers added that the calmer political climate also contributed to the market's buoyant mood. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 yesterday rose to 103 1/8 from 102 3/32 at Tuesday's close. In the futures market, the Liffe gilt futures contract climbed from 100.17 to a high of 101.09 before ending at 101.04. US Treasury prices eased slightly yesterday afternoon after firming in the morning in the wake of Tuesday's gains. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  7/32 at 95 15/32 , yielding 7.631 per cent. The two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 27/32 , yielding 4.333 per cent. The decline was attributed to profit-taking following the afternoon Treasury auction of Dollars 10.75bn in five-year notes at a stop-out rate of 5.84 per cent. Dealers and investors were pleased with the market's resilience on Tuesday in the face of a much better-than-expected third-quarter GDP report, and follow-through buying in early trading yesterday kept prices firm. Analysts said that Tuesday's performance suggested the market may have found a temporary floor. Sentiment was also buoyed by news of a 0.7 per cent rise in consumer spending and personal income in September. Excluding special fators, the figures were consistent with sluggish economic growth and pointed to continued weakness during the final quarter. DISAPPOINTMENT over the Bundesbank's decision to leave the repo rate unchanged yesterday pushed German government bond prices lower in the morning, but the market later recovered to end firmer on the day. The central bank left the rate for securities repurchase agreements unchanged in its latest money market operations, dashing hopes of a cut in the key interest rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting. The central bank injected DM11.4bn of liquidity at its allocation of 14-day repos, leaving the lowest accepted repo rate unchanged at 8.75 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 91.48 to trade at around 91.61 by late afternoon. HOPES of an easing in interest rates lifted Japanese government bonds with both the cash and futures markets reaching new highs. The December futures contract rose from its opening of 107.25 to end at 107.36, the high of the day. In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 issue moved from 4.755 per cent at the opening to end at 4.725 per cent. Dealers said investors were hoping to see an easing in interest rates this week in conjunction with the quarterly meeting of the Bank of Japan's branch managers.</p>

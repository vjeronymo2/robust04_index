			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 30 (XINHUA) -- North China's biggest  industrial center is taking steps to readjust the industrial  structure to invigorate the state-owned enterprises and enable  them to be more competitive in the current socialist market  economy.    According to an official with the municipal planning  commission, the city's strategy of restructuring state-owned  enterprises was projected as early as in the 1980s.    The official said that its focus of the restructuring is on  the development of auto, machinery, micro-electronics and  communications equipment, petroleum, marine and refined  chemicals industries, quality steel pipes and other steel  products.    He said that Tianjin, as the third largest city in the  country, has already formed a comprehensive industrial system in  which light industry has played a considerable part since 1949  when New China was born.    But, he added, the policies of reform and opening to the  outside world have given rise to numerous joint ventures and  township enterprises which are posing a great challenge to the  state-owned ones and rendering them less effective in a market  economy.    To support the state-owned enterprises, the investment from  the local government has mainly gone to the four main industries  for automobiles, electronics, chemistry, and metallurgy, the  official said.    The city has now become one of the biggest auto production  centers and the annual production output of autos has reached  120,000, he said, adding that it has added an investment of 2.8  billion yuan to expand its production to 450,000 autos each year.    The official said that one of the steps the city has taken  to  restructure industry is to develop the local electronics  industry through international cooperation.    To date, he said, Tianjin has developed computer-controlled  telephone exchanges, video recorders and computers jointly with  many world-renowned companies, such as the U.S. giants IBM and  AST, Japan's NEC and Samsung of the Republic of Korea.    In addition, the U.S. Motorola company has built a  semiconductor and portable telephone production center in  Tianjin, he said.    The official said that many of the country's vital chemical  plants are located in Tianjin. Two of the country's biggest oil  fields, the Dagang and Bohai fields, are also under city  jurisdiction.    A number of petroleum and marine-chemical projects are being  built in the city, including a 140,000-ton ethylene project, a  200,000-ton polyester plant and a 2.5-million-ton refinery, he  said.    He said that the Bohai chemical group, the country's biggest  salt-chemical industrial group, has recently been listed in Hong  Kong to raise more money to develop China's fine chemicals.    In Tianjin, he said, the most attractive project is the  Tianjin Steel Pipe Company, with a total investment of more than  ten billion yuan and an annual output of 500,000 tons of  seamless steel pipes.    The planning official concluded that when completed, all  these projects will change the city's industrial structure and  become the mainstays of the city's industries. And the output  value of these four major industries last year already accounted  for about 70 percent of the city's industrial total.</p>

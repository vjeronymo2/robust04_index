Dr van der Walt, addressing a media  conference at the South African Embassy said he had held  meetings with community leaders while one of his colleagues had  spoken to public service heads of departments. Both had  emphasised the need for the homeland, wracked by violence for  days, to return to normal.    Starting off the conference by saying "the past days have  been horrendous," he went on to say he as administrator would  "leave no stone unturned until justice has been done". Dr van  der Walt said he had been the one to contact South African  Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha to send SA [South African]  Defence Force troops to the embassy in Bophuthatswana "to  protect South African lives". "After that it was up to other  negotiators to take decisions to move out of the embassy. What  we desperately need to achieve is law and order, peace and  quiet. We wanted Bophuthatswana's participation in free and  fair elections."    Dr van der Walt appealed to the press "not to crucify  anybody  at this stage" as there were many reasons for the collapse of  law in the homeland.    The decision was taken to strip the cabinet of its powers  and  to remove the former president, Lucas Mangope, from power as  time was running out for the homeland to participate in the  elections. "I tried to convince Mr Mangope of the urgency of  the matter often," he said. "The political government is no  longer in place -- Mr Mangope and the cabinet have no power ...  but the government's executive departments will continue to  function."    Mr van der Walt reiterated Mr Botha's statement of early  Sunday that civil servants, including those fired by strike  action, would be employed. This included staff at the  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] who were fired on  Wednesday after occupying the building on Tuesday. Mr van der  Walt emphasised the urgent need to reopen the BBC to establish  communication with the people.    The SA Police had to start taking over in the now  incorporated homeland so rule of law could be maintained.    Regarding the removal of Mr Mangope from power, Dr van der  Walt said: "I can't say he accepted it, but he complied." He  added after the conference, in reply to a question, that Mr  Mangope "had lost touch with reality and the will of his people."    Dr van de Walt also appealed to the civil servants not to  demand their pensions be paid out now that they had the  assurance of both the Bophuthatswana and South African  Governments that their funds were safe. He added that a number  of cabinet ministers had resigned and cite? the example of  Health Minister Ned Khaole "who resigned sometime last week but  was seen at the Victoria Hospital helping out with their heavy  workload after this had taken place."    Head of the police force Gen P J Seleke had also been  removed  from his post, Dr van der Walt confirmed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR praises the wisdom  and courage of President Husni Mubarak, who loudly declared that  Egypt will send no soldier to Yemen. Yemen, the paper says, is  a country where brothers fight each other and launch air raids  on northern and southern cities and villages.    In its editorial today, the paper says President Mubarak's  decision to send no Egyptian or Arab forces to Yemen was made  because any role these forces might play could endanger them or  subject them to accusations from rival Yemeni parties. It adds:  The harm would be great and could complicate the crisis in a  tragedy that no one can resolve except those who created it.    The paper notes that a dialogue with words, not guns and  tanks, is the only way to resolve the Yemeni crisis. It  expresses the hope that the rival Yemeni parties will come to  their senses, replace their weapons with more civilized means, a  dialogue between brothers, resort to reason, and renounce  differences to preserve Yemen's unity.</p>

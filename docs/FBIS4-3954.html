			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Timothy Sun and Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Manila, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Monday [25  April] pledged to reduce import duties on Philippine products by  an average 18 percent during the first year of its entry into  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    The commitment was made after just three hours of tariff-  reduction negotiations with the Philippines held at the Ministry  of Industry and Commerce in Manila.    Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of  Foreign Trade, headed a 13-member delegation at the meeting.    Lin said the meeting was harmonious, and that the two sides  agreed to hold further consultations to work out details of the  agreement.    This was Taiwan's first tariff-reduction meeting with any  Southeast Asian country. Taiwan has held similar negotiations  with Australia, [words indistinct], New Zealand, South Africa,  Turkey, and the United States.    Lin and his delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  Tuesday to conduct similar talks with Malaysia.    Bilateral tariff-reduction talks with GATT contacting  parties  are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth accession to the  Geneva- based world trade regulating body.    Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September  1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of the year.</p>

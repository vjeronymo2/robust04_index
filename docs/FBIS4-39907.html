			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Their Dollars for Our Environment"] </F>   [Text] The World Bank has made a decision to grant Russia  a loan of $110 million to implement a series of nature  conservation projects. The World Bank is providing $45 million  of that amount on a nonreturnable basis.    This credit issue is the result of more than two years of  negotiations with the Bank in which the Russian Ministry of the  Environment and Natural Resources played the main role.    In connection with the bank's decision, Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, the head of the ministry concerned, believes  that the loan will help to attract Western investors to  environmental projects which are being carried out on Russia's  territory. The minister said that it is planned to implement  these projects in the most environmentally disadvantaged areas  of the country and in particular the Lake Baykal region and Tula  and Kemerovo oblasts. There is also a plan to create the  necessary infrastructure of Russian nature conservancy organs.    The Ministry of the Environment has also announced that the  Danish Environmental Protection Fund has made Russia a gift of  $3 million for filter equipment for the Northern Thermal  Electric Power Station in Moscow. The introduction of these  devices will help to reduce discharges of nitric oxide from 5.5  tonnes to 1.8 tonnes a year and to subsequently close down  several dozen boilers operating on obsolete technology.</p>

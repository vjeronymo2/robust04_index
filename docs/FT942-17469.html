			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / S Korean economy expected to grow by 6.5% South Korea's leading private economic institutes predict that the economy will grow by at least 6.5 per cent this year, up from 5.6 per cent in 1993. The greater growth is attributed mainly to increased industrial investments and higher domestic consumption. Companies are adding production capacity due to a surge in exports caused by the weakness of the Korean won, the currency, against the Japanese yen and by stronger demand in its biggest overseas markets, including the US, Japan and China. The central bank, however, warns that the current account, which posted a slight surplus of Dollars 450m (Pounds 305m) in 1993, may fall into a deficit again this year as imports increased due to stronger domestic demand. Last year's surplus was the first since 1989. The brisk economic activity is also reviving fears of inflation, which reached 5.8 per cent in 1993, the central bank announced yesterday. It was among the highest in Asia, although down from 6.2 per cent in 1992. The Korean economy has steadily recovered since 1992, when gross national product growth fell to 4.7 per cent, the lowest since 1980. The Samsung Economic Research Institute predicts that GNP will increase by 6.5 per cent this year. Other institutes are more optimistic, with the Hyundai Research Institute expecting GNP growth of 7.3 per cent.</p>

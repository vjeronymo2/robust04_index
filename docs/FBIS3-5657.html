			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry says the law in Singapore must  take its course and the ministry cannot be expected to intervene  in the due process of the law. This is the ministry's response  to the U.S. Embassy here over its concern on the caning sentence  passed by the court on an American teenager, Michael Fay. The  ministry noted that Fay's sentencing was the outcome of a fair  and transparent legal process. Fay was given every opportunity  to defend himself with representation and counsel of his choice.  It stressed that the Singapore judicial process cannot apply  different standards to persons subjected to the same law.  Therefore, it is not correct for the U.S. to say based on the  facts on the treatment of other similar cases, this punishment  is extreme.    The ministry pointed out that Fay is not the first teenaged  person nor foreigner to have received the sentence of caning  under the Vandalism Act. Twelve Singaporeans and two  foreigners, aged 18 to 21, have received caning sentences for  vandalism since 1989. The ministry cited some previous  vandalism cases. In 1990, a 20-year-old Singaporean was  sentenced to a month jail and three strokes for damaging public  property. Last year, there was a similar case where a  19-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three months jail and  three strokes of a cane. The ministry said in contrast to these  cases, Fay admitted in all to 18 counts of vandalism and six  counts of misdeeds. These facts, among others, show that the  court sentence meted out to Fay is neither extreme nor  unprecedented. Fay, who is 18, was sentenced last Thursday to  four months in prison and six strokes of a cane for vandalism.  Fay is appealing against the sentence and he is currently on a  [Singapore] $75,000 bail.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: 'White Nights' in St Petersburg - The city is witnessing both the death and renaissance of classicism St Petersburg, built as Russia's window on the west, is History City. It is not as old as Moscow, or as Russian; but its whole essence - layout, architecture, statuary, ornamentation - is classical. Every foreign visitor is bound to notice this, and every Petersburger is steeped in it. But what is it like to live a modern life in a classical city? The immense irony of living there struck me on my first visit, ten years ago, for the White Nights festival. Along the canals and the embankments of the River Neva, in front of the palaces whose colours become strangely luminous in the midnight light of late June, numbers of old men stood, for long hours, fishing to supplement their limited groceries. The contrast of old and new appeared so great, in the Leningrad of 1984, that I wondered why the Russian communists had not adopted a Maoist attitude to history and destroyed the monuments that so reproached their daily lives. And yet the government was still spending fortunes on gradually repairing the damage done to the city by the German siege in the second world war, and old women queued for hours - with none of the quick-admission privileges granted to foreign tourists  - to enter the city's most richly adorned interiors. On revisiting the city for the White Nights of 1994, now that it has regained its original name of St Petersburg, I found a new set of ironies. Cindy Crawford's photograph hangs large in Nevsky Prospect (the city's main street); the city's trams bear Rothman's adverts (in English); the great Palace Square on one side of the Hermitage was occupied, for one long weekend, by an Adidas softball promotional display. Russians no longer have to queue for hours, either to enter the Hermitage or to buy groceries. Whether they can afford to buy groceries any more is another matter. There are far fewer fishermen, but many more beggars. And the city is dirtier, dustier. Everyone today seems happy that the city has been re-named St Petersburg. Nonetheless, though Lenin's name is no longer ubiquitous, his statues still stand in many places around the city. He too is part of history, and accepted as such. The guides refer to the more grim aspects of the communist regime in the same tones that they discuss the darker episodes of life under the Tsars. The truth is that life in so classical a city was always ironic: as reading Dostoyevsky should remind one. From my hotel to the city centre, I would walk each day routes that had been taken by the leading characters of The Idiot during their most distraught episodes. We tend to think of classicism as something measured, formal, Apollonian; and this side of St Petersburg is obvious enough. But classicism, in Petersburg as in Ancient Greece, is large enough also to contain wildness, morbidity, despair. The Kirov (or Maryinsky) Ballet, however, is no longer a classical company - if we are to use the word 'classical' in any serious sense. There comes a point, alas, when the true classicism of some ballet companies declines into hollow academicism. This happened, decades ago, in Paris to the Paris Opera Ballet; and it is now happening, I believe, in New York to New York City Ballet. In terms of academic distinction, these three companies are probably the foremost in the world; and they are fed by first-rate schools (though it is possible that Kirov Ballet's decline in style has been occurring at school level also). Most Kirov dancers have numerous stylistic niceties in their dancing that are not to be found in, say, the Bolshoi of Moscow; and possibly the dancers find inspiration for some of those niceties from living amid the architecture of St Petersburg. And yet the firm core of Kirov style is being gradually drained away (whereas the cruder Moscow style still retains a certain classically vital simplicity). Just take two of the key features of classical style in ballet: musicality, and stance. In terms of musical timing and phrasing, the Kirov has been musically decadent for decades, especially in dictating convenient decelerations of tempo and then ignoring the beat and phrase that they themselves have dictated. The decline of stance is more recent. When first I saw the company in 1982, I would have paid just to see the dancers stand, walk, and take curtain calls; they made these simple matters radiate with classical purity. By 1992, the dancers were standing like gymnasts, with an anti-classical arch of the pelvis and lower spine. As a result, an exaggerated dichotomy of upper and lower body has developed, and an element of strain has distorted all Kirov deportment. The death of classicism - or its chilling translation into the mere facade of academicism - is a depressing spectacle. It has happened in other arts and other cities, but to see it happen to St Petersburg's great ballet company is one irony I could do without when visiting that city today. Some observers attribute the Kirov Ballet's decline to financial and political causes, and no doubt the company's economic situation is serious. It is obliged to tour extensively to support itself. But the same is true for St Petersburg's Maly Drama Theatre, which has also been touring extensively for years now, and which, on its seven-week tour of Britain this year showed theatrical standards of the highest calibre. And during the very period that the ballet of the Kirov/Maryinsky Opera House has declined, the same theatre's opera has been enjoying an extraordinary renaissance. Truly extraordinary: for the city has not really been a serious home for opera since the time of the Tsars. In 1984, the Kirov Opera was not merely backwards in terms of stage production, it was also a mess in musical terms, with only Sergei Leiferkus an exception, casting his baritonal pearls among the surrounding swine. Today, the company is a nonpareil model of ensemble, and it possesses solo voices and instrumentalists of world class. Several of these singers - Galina Gorchakova, Olga Borodina, Gegam Grigorian, Leiferkus, Vladimir Chernov, and others - are already internationally acclaimed. Yet they keep returning to St Petersburg, and principally because of one man - the artistic director of the Kirov Opera, Valery Gergiev. Ten years ago, the White Nights festival was mainly of interest to balletomanes; the best musical evenings occurred not at the Kirov at all, but at the city's second opera house, the Maly. Now, however, the festival is, musically, world class. I never had the time this year to go to the Maly, because Gergiev &amp; Co. were producing so rich a supply of great performances at the Maryinsky (or at the Philharmonic Halls). St Petersburg was conceived not just as a classical city but also as Russia's window on the west. Ever since Peter the Great, the city's founder, the debate between Europhiles and Europhobes has been a central issue in Russian culture. Before Diaghilev brought Russian ballet and opera to the west, he had spent years audaciously bringing western art to Russia; he also worked hard to re-introduce Russia to overlooked aspects of Russian art. The centre of his activities in those days was St Petersburg, which was then the country's capital. When Moscow became the capital city again under the communist regime, the xenophobe strain of Russian culture became uppermost again. Today, however, the beauty of Gergiev's work at the Maryinsky is that he is working along Diaghilev lines. As the White Nights festival showed, the Maryinsky today honours Russian music - not just Glinka, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Tchaikovsky, but also Prokofiev (who returned from the west to communist Russia), Shostakovich (who suffered under the communist regime), and Stravinsky (who chose to remain in western exile from his native land). It also gave performances of western repertory, from Haydn. And the performances I heard Gergiev give of Berlioz's Damnation of Faust and Verdi's Force of Destiny were simply the best I have ever heard. Suddenly the window on the west is again open wide. The history of Russian culture in this century is extremely curious. Russian art was a galvanising force upon artistic modernism throughout the world; and the Russian revolution was as key an event for the culture of the observing world as the French Revolution has been for the Romantic movement. Yet when the doctrine of Leninism-Marxism descended upon Russia, its effects upon artistic life was stultifying, even crucifying. Today the doctrines have lifted with remarkable speed; but it will take far longer for their effects to disappear. St Petersburg is the most classical city in the world, but classicism is a virtually extinct strain in world culture. Is it to become a museum city? or something more? One watches the fall of the Kirov Ballet with dismay, the rise of the Maly Drama Theatre and the Kirov Opera with exhilaration. For a westerner, the most exciting fact is simply that one can watch. Russia, which did so much to shape our century, is gradually re-entering it; and St Petersburg - History City - is open again to the west.</p>

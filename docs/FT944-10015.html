			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Wales and north lead the way as recovery continues Wales and the north of England, the UK's most export-oriented regions, are leading the recovery among British manufacturers, a quarterly regional trends survey showed yesterday. The survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional economic consultancy group, said Wales and the north had reported the fastest growth of Britain's 11 regions in terms of total demand and output in the four months to October. The survey was carried out between September 23 and October 12. Of four regions that reported order books 'above normal', Wales and northern England produced the strongest results, followed by the West Midlands and south-west. Wales and northern England also reported the highest level of anticipated export orders for the four months ahead. New orders rose in all 11 regions for the third quarter in succession and output increased for the second consecutive quarter. Companies in all regions expected higher export orders in the four months ahead, while all regions except Northern Ireland were more optimistic than before about exports over the coming 12 months. Manufacturers in 10 regions said they intended to authorise increased capital spending on plant and machinery in the next 12 months, with companies in Wales, the south-west, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside showing strong investment intentions. Only in East Anglia did companies plan less investment. Paradoxically, East Anglia was the region where general business confidence was strongest. Mr Charles Burton, BSL's joint managing director, said the strong export business of manufacturers in Wales and northern England explained their strong showing in the survey. Thanks to growth in world trade, those regions, which also benefited greatly from inward investment, were now catching up the West Midlands and the south-east, which had led recovery. Manufacturers in East Anglia and Northern Ireland lagged in the latest survey because they depended more on domestic demand and consumer goods production, he said. Manufacturing in north-west England also suffered - partly because of the region's dependence on the defence industry and a relative lack of inward investment. The survey showed upward movement in prices and costs. CBI/BSL Regional Trends, November 1994. Subscription details from CBI Economic Trends Dept (071-379 7400) or BSL (071-630 5959).</p>

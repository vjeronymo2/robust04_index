			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Teaching service, not servility Across the world young people equate the service industry with 'servility', according to American Express. The company, whose business is critically reliant on travel and tourism, has responded with an ambitious programme of investment in education, tightly controlled from its New York headquarters. John Petersen, a director of Amex's European division, outlined the extent of the problem. He said: 'Europe's population is declining and there's a high staff turnover already in the industry as a result of its poor image. This is creating growing shortages of skilled labour.' Young people's perception of the industry existed, he said, partly because education was 'ill-adapted' to the industry's needs. Thus it failed to provide the necessary pool of skilled labour, even while unemployment was rising. Amex's European response is carefully modelled on an approach pioneered in New York, where the company has created a foundation to deal with its philanthropic activities in the US and elsewhere. Local Amex managers play a role in implementing programmes in their areas, according to Donald Hirsch of Warwick University, but always under the financial control of the corporation. In the US, Amex decided to focus on pre-vocational and vocational programmes for secondary school pupils. They chose to do this by setting up, with the investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton, an 'academy of finance' in a state high school in New York. It offered a curriculum tied to the last two years of compulsory education, organised thematically around careers in the financial services industry, but also including more general programmes in subjects such as maths. Teachers, as well as pupils, were offered opportunities to learn more about the industry. By 1989, the academy of finance had spread to 35 schools in 17 cities. A smaller operation, the academy of travel and tourism, started in Miami and New York in 1986. In the UK, Amex's first educational involvement was modelled directly on the US experience, with an attempt to start a travel and tourism academy, in conjunction with several hotel companies, in the London borough of Ealing in 1986. But it soon found it was necessary to tailor the programme to the UK's more specialised school curriculum, where pupils study a limited number of subjects for GCSE exams from the age of 14. Rather than operate academies, the company developed the syllabus for the new GCSE subject of 'travel and tourism'. It also sponsored printed curriculum material and textbooks to help teachers deliver the courses. Amex accepts this will not produce directly quantifiable benefits. But with 50,000 pupils taking the GCSE exam in England each year, it is confident its development can only help the industry. Amex has also adapted its programme to the needs of other markets. In Ireland the syllabus includes history and literature - in line with the country's approach to attracting tourists; in Hungary the programme accentuates skills which had not been fostered by the communist regime, such as entrepreneurship and building personal and social skills for dealing with customers. According to Hirsch, Amex's centralised approach to the programmes 'does not create dirigisme so much as a broadly common set of standards for controlling spending, and a set of local managers who identify with the central ethos'.</p>

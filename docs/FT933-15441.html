			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING IN stock index futures started on a weak note and deteriorated throughout the morning, with dealers nervous from the previous day's Wall Street performance and a dearth of economic indicators, writes Christine Buckley. In mid-morning trading the September contract on the FT-SE 100, which opened the day at 2,841, touched a low of 2,828 - a fall of more than 100 points from a brief high point last week of 2,933. Its generally poor fortunes were exacerbated by one trader selling 500 contracts. There was also some unwinding by arbitrageurs. But as dealers began to anticipate a reasonable early performance from yesterday's Wall Street session the contract mustered a slight rally. With that hope realised there was a sigh of relief and it moved up to close at 2,851.5 - the same point at which it finished the previous day - in a reasonable volume of 8,288 lots. There was additional bolstering of confidence with the steady performance of US bonds. The contract continued to trail its fair value premium to cash of 7 points - ending 4 points below. Traded options were lacklustre with volume down considerably - standing at 22,075 lots against Tuesday's 31,189. The FT-SE 100 option saw 7,752 lots traded and 3,897 changed hands in the Euro FT-SE. Asda was the largest traded stock option at 2,023.</p>

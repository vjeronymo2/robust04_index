			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Four types of restoration actions are identified and discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan: General restoration, habitat protection and acquisition, monitoring and research, and public information and administration. Alternatives to the proposed action will place different emphases on each of these categories of restoration actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Restoration consists of activities that fall within manipulation of the environment, management of human use for reduction of marine pollution. Decisions about conducting general restoration projects would look at the following factors: Extent of natural recovery, the value of an injured resource to the ecosystem and to the public, the duration of benefits, the technical feasibility of the project, the likelihood of success, the relationship of costs to expected benefits, potential for harmful side effects, benefits to more than one resource, effects on health and human safety, consistency with applicable laws, and policies, and duplication with other actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Habitat Protection and Acquisition is a category that includes purchase of private land or interests in land such as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights. It also includes recommendations for changing public agency management practices. Specific policies that relate to habitat protection and acquisition are proposed. These policies deal with ranking potential lands to determine potential benefits, the need for a willing seller, purchasing at fair market value, post acquisition management of the acquired lands and involving the public in the prioritization process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring and Research consists of recovery monitoring, restoration monitoring and ecological monitoring and research. Specific policies governing the selecting and performance of monitoring activities are discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Information and Administration is the last category of restoration actions. It consists of all necessary administrative actions that are not attributable to a particular project. The Draft Restoration Plan goal for this category is for administrative costs to average no more than 5 percent of overall restoration expenditures for the remainder of the settlement period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General restoration objectives have been developed for resources that are recovering, resources not recovering, resources where the recovery is unknown, resources such as archaeological resources and wilderness, and services. These broad objectives will guide in the development of annual work plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further information regarding the proposed action and possible restoration alternatives is included in the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration, Volume I: Restoration Framework, April, 1992; the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, April 1993; the Supplement to Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, June 1993; the Summary of Public Comment on Alternatives of the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, September 1993; and the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, November 1993. Copies of these documents may be required from the Oil Spill Public Information Office, 645 G. Street, Anchorage, Alaska, 99501. Phone number 907 278&hyph;8008 or within Alaska 800 478&hyph;7745, outside Alaska 800 283&hyph;7745. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C. Scoping and Issue Development <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> With publication of this Revised Notice of Intent, the Trustees are continuing a process intended to identify those issues that need to be addressed in preparing the Draft EIS (DEIS). Under the National Environmental Policy Act, this process is called ``scoping.'' Two rounds of public meetings have been held within the spill area soliciting comments on development of the Draft Restoration Plan. The results of the scoping to date have guided the preparation of the Draft Restoration Plan. During the scoping process for development of the proposed action the Trustees obtained information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations interested in, or affected by restoration. Several of the documents referenced above provide summaries of public comments received to date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further scoping is being conducted to identify the issues to be addressed in the EIS and the range of alternatives that will need to be developed and analyzed. In addition to publishing this Revised Notice of Intent, interested and affected people within the spill area will be contacted through the news media. The Public Advisory Group will also be contacted soliciting comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. Expected Time for Completion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A DEIS should be filed with EPA by mid June 1994 and the final EIS should be filed in late October 1994. The Trustees will consider the comments, responses, disclosure of environmental consequences, and applicable laws, regulations and policies in making decisions regarding restoration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> E. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and concerns.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritage, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1138 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael A.

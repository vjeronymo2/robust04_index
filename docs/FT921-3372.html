			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Green light - Customs and Excise BRITISH and other EC citizens should be able to gain speedier passage and carry more purchases across UK frontiers as a result of Budget proposals. The moves come as part of an effort to harmonise Customs procedures across the EC as part of the single European market from the start of 1993. The red channel at customs for those with goods to declare is to be all but abolished and replaced with what one official calls 'a green channel with a red spot'. Spot checks on the cars of EC citizens at borders will also stop. Private individuals will be allowed to buy any reasonable quantities of alcohol and tobacco for their own consumption from other EC states (on which they will have paid duty at local rates) and bring them into the UK. Paradoxically, as a result of lobbying by the duty-free industry, duty-free shops will continue to operate for departing passengers until 1999. Duty free limits will remain in place until then. At the same time, air passengers in transit may not have their baggage searched until they arrive at their final destination. Instead of Customs inspections at Heathrow, for example, they may take place at Manchester or other large provincial airports, which should considerably speed processing and reduce delays. Non-EC citizens will still be subject to existing restrictions.</p>

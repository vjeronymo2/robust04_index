			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS END BRIEF TIME OF FUTILITY;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: WORTHY, IN WRONG PLACE AT RIGHT TIME, INTERCEPTS PASS AND HITS  KEY SHOT TO HELP BEAT ATLANTA, 112-106. LOS ANGELES ENDS TWO-GAME LOSING  STREAK.  </P> <P> Alarmists who were wringing their hands and gnashing their teeth after two  consecutive Laker losses had reason to be less than totally satisfied with  Friday night's partial return to form in a 112-106 victory over the Atlanta  Hawks at the Forum.  </P> <P> Showing little outward sign of a problem, the Lakers maintained a slim lead for  best record in the Western Conference and -- at times -- showed flashes of  their dominance on a recent Eastern trip.  </P> <P> What more could you want?  </P> <P> Well, perhaps a more convincing victory. The Hawks, after all, have been  decimated by injuries. Three Atlanta starters are injured, and the Hawks had  lost seven of 10 games before Friday.  </P> <P> But the Lakers, leading by 10 points with 5:07 to play, went into a late  tailspin, and the Hawks pulled to within three before a clutch steal and basket  by James Worthy finished them.  </P> <P> Because the Lakers (32-11) had been playing so well before their losing streak  -- which was helped along by Magic Johnson's bout with the flu -- Friday  night's performance paled in comparison to earlier play. But the Lakers showed  enough efficiency to build a double-figure second-half lead and protect it.  </P> <P> "We came off the road and we took a sigh of relief," Laker Coach Pat Riley  said. "Now, we've just got to catch it back to the way we were. That happens  during the season. But the whole priority tonight was just to win. We had to  get out of that (losing streak)."  </P> <P> The Lakers accomplished that. Although they could not put away the Hawks, the  Lakers showed enough positive signs for all but the most severe critics to be  encouraged.  </P> <P> They shot 55%. They had seven players in double figures. They held their own  rebounding against the taller, more physical Hawks. And, in the end, they made  the big plays to secure the victory.  </P> <P> Individually, the Lakers had to be heartened by the shooting of guard Byron  Scott, who appears to be emerging from a season-long slump. Scott made nine of  11 shots and led the Lakers with 20 points. In his last three games, Scott has  sunk 26 of 42 shots.  </P> <P> "The last four or five games, it's been going good," said Scott, whose left  hamstring still is slightly weakened from last season's injury. "I've got the  lift back in my legs. The (left) leg is getting stronger. Tonight, Earvin  (Johnson) did an excellent job of getting me the ball at the right time and the  right spot."  </P> <P> Power forward A.C. Green ended a brief slump by scoring 15 points and grabbing  seven rebounds, and center Mychal Thompson had 17 points -- two below his  season high. Orlando Woolridge and Vlade Divac each came off the bench to score  12 points.  </P> <P> Johnson fell only a rebound short of a triple-double. He scored 19 points and  had 13 assists and nine rebounds.  </P> <P> But Worthy, who tied his season low with only 10 points, made the play that  repelled the Hawks for good.  </P> <P> The Lakers had gone scoreless for about 3 1/2 minutes, enabling Dominique  Wilkins (36 points) and his cohorts to cut the deficit to 105-102. After Green  missed a long jump shot simply to beat the shot clock, the Hawks had the ball  with 1:45 to play.  </P> <P> With Laker players scrambling to return to their men after a brief front-court  trap, Worthy found himself guarding Hawk guard John Long. Worthy started a move  toward Antoine Carr, the player for whom he was responsible, but instead  knocked down and then retrieved Long's pass.  </P> <P> Worthy gathered the ball on the run and converted a fast-break dunk with 1:27  to play.  </P> <P> "I had seen their pattern the whole game, how they did a good job swinging the  ball around," Worthy said. "I was able to fake like I was going back to my man,  and I was right there to take the pass."  </P> <P> That Worthy basket gave the Lakers a 107-102 lead, and Atlanta (21-22) went  into a futile succession of fouls. The Lakers converted most of free throws,  sending what was left of 17,505 fans to the exits only a little early.  </P> <P> As pleased as the Lakers were to end the losing streak, they knew they still  have a way to go to return to the dominating play they showed in road victories  over Detroit, New York and Indiana late last month.  </P> <P> Johnson's bout with the flu, which coincided with the losses to San Antonio and  the Clippers, obviously played a vital part. But the Lakers seemed to, in  Riley's words, "exhale" before that.  </P> <P> "We didn't really relax (in) these last couple games," Worthy said. "Maybe we  just got a little comfortable being at home. It may not be easy, but I think we  can get back to where we were before."  </P> <P> Johnson and Michael Cooper still were recovering from the flu. Johnson said he  became "out of shape" after spending about three days in bed. He said he could  feel the effects in the fourth quarter when he missed shots he usually makes.  </P> <P> For instance, after the Laker lead had been cut to four points with about three  minutes to play, Johnson drove the lane but missed a short push shot. On the  Lakers' next possession, he missed again on a similar drive. Johnson made only  five of 15 shots.  </P> <P> "My timing is just off," Johnson said. "There were three of four shots there I  usually make. I got to work now on getting back my timing and get back in  shape."  </P> <P> Judging by Friday's result, the Lakers, as a group, have taken the initial  steps round back into shape.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Quintin Dailey was a Laker for only a week during training camp before being  waived, and the club is paying the bulk of his $400,000 contract after signing  him during the off-season. After he was signed to a 10-day contract by Seattle,  his former teammates had a few things to say. "I knew he'd make it back," Laker  center Mychal Thompson said. "I'm sure (being waived by the Lakers) opened his  eyes and told him that, no matter how much talent you have, you have to take  the responsibilities. I'm sure it was humbling for him."  </P> <P> Added Larry Drew, the Lakers' backup point guard: "I'm pulling for him, because  this may finally be his last go-around." . . . Vlade Divac, the Lakers' rookie  center from Yugoslavia, turned 22 today. "I feel old," Divac said, laughing. In  case you're wondering, "Sretan Rodendan" means happy birthday in  Serbo-Croatian, Divac's native tongue. . . . Divac is required to complete one  year of mandatory military service before age 29. With Yugoslavia on the verge  of a civil war between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo,  Thompson jokingly speculated that Divac might be called back. "Hey, that would  mean more minutes for me," said Thompson, taking the world view. . . . The  Lakers are off today and play the New Jersey Nets at the Forum on Sunday night.  </P></p>

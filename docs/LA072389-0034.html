			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING CAN BE DONE  </P> <P> The killing of 21-year-old actress Rebecca Schaeffer, who was shot dead in the  doorway of her Fairfax District apartment building last week, is one of those  terrible contemporary tragedies that leaves people wringing their hands and  saying that nothing can be done.  </P> <P> In fact, something can be done, even if, as police and prosecutors allege, Miss  Schaeffer's assailant was a disturbed young man whose fan's crush on a young  actress somehow mutated into a murderous obsession.  </P> <P> The deviant and the deranged always have been with us. Their presence is an  unavoidable fact of life. The presence of cheap, easily obtainable, easily  concealable handguns is not. It is an artifact of human folly. Or, rather, it  is a peculiarly American folly, born of the fact that across this country  craven lawmakers persist in behaving as if the legislative bodies to which they  were elected are subsidiaries of the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> Crimes such as that committed against Miss Schaeffer attract public sympathy  and revulsionbecause the victims are well-known. But weekly, young people in  South and East Los Angeles and in poor and working-class communities all over  America are gunned down in the streets by people wielding firearms a sane  society long ago would have jerked from their hands. There are no film records  or glossy publicity photos to mark their brief lives. There are only the fading  snapshots in family albums and the memories in the minds of their grieving  parents.  </P> <P> If they were given the opportunity to speak, they might echo Danna Schaeffer,  Rebecca's mother, who said Thursday that while she harbors no animosity toward  her daughter's alleged killer, she is "angry at the system that allows things  like this to happen, that allows a deranged person to get his hands on a deadly  weapon."  </P> <P> Opponents of rational handgun regulation must not be allowed to turn the Second  Amendment into a blood-stained abstraction. They must not be allowed to draw  the rest of us into a conspiracy to countenance the murder of other people's  children.  </P></p>

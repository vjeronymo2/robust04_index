			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Markets: The lure of expensive paper - The Bottom Line HONESTY is the watch word of Robert Gavron, chairman of St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer. Told by institutional investors that they were thinking of buying his shares he was forced to admit his surprise. 'I had to tell them I was somewhat amazed given how expensive they are' he said. With forecast full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22.2m, St Ives's shares do look pricy on a prospective multiple of 22 - well above the market average. But the decision on whether to invest more heavily is a comparatively easy one for the company's big shareholders. If they want to top up their holding in a printing company St Ives is one of the obvious choices. It is offering a quality product with good medium term growth prospects and a strong balance sheet. But if its high rating does not put off some of its institutional shareholders it may deter small investors. Are they right to be put off? What they will be looking for is a feel of what might be in store for them over the next few years. One of the best indicators of the future is the past. Since the company came to the market in 1985 it has undergone three main phases. Phase one was a phenomenal success. In the first three years the share price more than doubled to around 220p. The company used its highly rated paper and cash to make a string of acquisitions, including a book printer, magazine printers and a packaging business. Gavron stresses that St Ives was never out to emulate the Hansons or BTRs of the corporate world. 'When we went public, they just came to us and we were offered some very good opportunities,' he said. The next phase was disappointing. St Ives made its biggest acquisition, of Burrups Printing Group, by way of a rights issue, which coincided with the stock market crash of October 1987. A lot of shareholders held on to their new shares until the price recovered and then sold, driving the price back down. St Ives went on to make some small acquisitions in 1989, the last of which was a magazine printing company, which made a loss before being turned around last year. The financial printing market also collapsed and the company's shares steadily declined and lost their premium rating. After October 1990 the group regained all of its lost ground. Its market capitalisation jumped from Pounds 176m to Pounds 245m in 1991 and to Pounds 330m today. Over the last three years the City decided that the unfortunate timing of the Burrups acquisition did not matter. In relative terms the group was doing well. Further more, its decision to spend Pounds 130m over the past four years on some of the most advanced printing presses in the world looks to have been a wise one. Its high operational gearing should allow it to benefit quickly from the expected upturn. The printing presses are now running at almost 80 per cent of their capacity and should soon run at full speed. The next phase is likely to see the company return to the acquisition trail. With a high rating and a war chest of more than Pounds 13m. St Ives is actively looking for opportunities in the UK and on the Continent. Its brief history, since it went public, shows that St Ives has never made a bad acquisition. The timing of Burrups was mainly responsible for the disappointing second phase but, having been restructured, it proved a good buy. Even the US subsidiary reversed a Pounds 278,000 first- half loss to a Pounds 304,000 profit for the half year to January 29. It should be making more, and Gavron believes it will. The last phase of its history also shows that the company is capable of earnings growth without making acquisitions. It is also well managed as underlined by its financial position. Even after the adverse effect of currency movements, primarily on its US debt, of Pounds 6.7m, it still ended the year with net cash of Pounds 13.6m. Medium-term growth is likely to continue. The shares looked expensive in 1991 but continued to outperform over the next two years. It would be a mistake to buy the shares as a short-term gain. But the stock looks very attractive to anyone thinking of holding them for at least a few years.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor  Yasushi Mieno told the Diet on Wednesday [1 June] the domestic  economy is showing signs of recovery.    Mieno told the House of Representatives Budget Committee, "I  think the downturn is about to end, and the environment for  economic recovery has almost been completed."    He cited progress in inventory adjustments, the effects of  the government's fiscal and monetary measures and economic  recovery overseas as favorable factors.    Mieno, however, took a cautious view of recovery, saying it  remains to be seen whether the bright signs will continue  because of uncertainty over the yen's exchange rates against  other currencies and employment adjustments.</p>

			<p>Offenses   <F P=102>   LD0405141094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1304 GMT 4 May 94 </F> <F P=103> LD0405141094 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow INTERFAX </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Up to four drug smugglers are being arrested in  Tajikistan every day, Deputy Interior Minister Gennadiy Blinov  said on Wednesday.    He said that the number of drug-related offenses since  January went up by 28 percent compared with the same period last  year. "The lion's share of drugs is being smuggled via  Gorno-Badakhshan into Kyrgyzstan and from there, to the whole of  the Commonwealth of Independent States," Blinov said.    As much as 60 kg of raw opium and 100 kg of marijuana was  seized in the four months to May, or a mere 15-20 percent of  what is smuggled in, he said. Blinov said Russian border guards  and troops were also engaged in the drug trade. He put the  number of such incidents occurring in 1993 at ten.    Blinov said that one kg of raw opium fetched an average  150-160 million rubles on the black market in Moscow--but five  to eight times cheaper inside Tajikistan.    The Interior Ministry is due to start an operation to  destroy  illegal poppy plantations in two or three days, he said.  However, Blinov said the main flow of drugs would come from  neighboring Afghanistan because it was much cheaper and safer to  cultivate drug-related plants there than in Tajikistan.    In 1993, local police destroyed hemp and poppy crops on an  area as big as 400 hectare as well as six tonnes of raw opium.</p>

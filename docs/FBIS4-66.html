			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The decision to  declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal was "politically  wrong and tragic", the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] said in a  statement on Thursday [31 March]. A PAC spokesman said: "The  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has no control over the  armed forces which remain in the control of the regime. This is  a contradiction. We would have expected that control of the  armed forces be given to the TEC". The organisation called for  a special sitting of multiparty negotiators to reverse the TEC's  decision and mandate an international peacekeeping force to  normalise the situation in violence-torn areas.</p>

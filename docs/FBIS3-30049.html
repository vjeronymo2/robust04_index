That is connected with the running out stock of coal at the  electric power stations as well as with the financial  difficulties.    Due to the fact that corresponding payments are not being  paid timely by its consumers the central power system has had  arrears of more than four million US dollars ought to have been  paid to the Russian Federation for the electricity supplied in  the previous year. Also it failed to pay off its tariffs to be  paid in advance for electricity for the current year which runs  to 2.5 million dollars.</p>

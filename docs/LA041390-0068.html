			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS ASSAILED BY HEAD OF EPA  </P> <P> EPA Administrator William K. Reilly criticized environmental activists  Thursday, saying that they hurt their cause by being relentlessly critical of  President Bush and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu.  </P> <P> As a result, Reilly said in an interview, environmentalists were excluded from  a recent White House meeting with business and industry leaders to discuss the  Clean Air Act.  </P> <P> "They haven't learned to deal with a White House (that) clearly wants to engage  them, take their ideas and move the environmental agenda forward," Reilly said.  "Maybe it's expecting too much to expect that they will, but I think it's going  to hurt the (environmental) community."  </P> <P> He particularly faulted environmentalists for focusing on Sununu, who has  become a lightning rod for criticism on environmental issues.  </P> <P> Several leaders of environmental organizations expressed surprise at Reilly's  comments, which an EPA spokesman said were harsher than any he has made  publicly before.  </P> <P> "What it does is signify that Bill is being co-opted, and co-opted in order to,  I presume, be a more effective team player," said Jay D. Hair, president of the  National Wildlife Federation.  </P> <P> "I think he's saying what he has to say to earn his way out of purgatory," said  Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club, who noted that Reilly's loyalty  to the Administration had been questioned after he lost several internal  fights.  </P></p>

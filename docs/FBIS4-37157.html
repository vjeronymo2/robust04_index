			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sami 'Abudi and Samiyah Nakhkhul: "PLO Dismisses </F> Officials Who Exceeded Their Authority"]    [Excerpt] Jerusalem, Cairo -- A Palestinian official said  Tuesday that the PLO has dismissed officials who signed an  interim agreement with Israel confining the movement of  Palestinian prisoners released by Israel to the autonomy area of  Jericho. He added that these officials, who were members of the  [Joint] Liaison Committee with Israel which observes security in  the autonomy areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip, were not  authorized to sign. After seven tense hours, 287 prisoners were  handed over to the Palestinian police in Jericho last week.  Israel says that the Cairo agreement on autonomy allows it to  insist that the prisoners handed over to the Palestinians should  remain in the autonomy areas. Faysal al-Husayni, the most  senior PLO official in the West Bank, has stated that the person  who signed the agreement had no authority to sign, and that is  why a decision was issued to replace the Palestinian Security  Committee with another committee.    Al-Husayni left for Jordan yesterday, Tuesday, and is  expected to travel to Tunis for a meeting with 'Arafat.  [passage omitted]</p>

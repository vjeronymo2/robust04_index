			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN'S TRUSTEE STOPS PAYMENTS TO TEXAS AIR  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines' court-appointed trustee has halted management services  payments to Texas Air Corp. and moved forcefully to untangle Eastern from its  parent company.  </P> <P> In an interview published Thursday in the Miami Herald, Martin A. Shugrue said  Eastern no longer pays Texas Air $250,000 a month for management services.  </P> <P> He said he also expects to negotiate with Texas Air to settle claims over asset  transfers that bankruptcy court adviser David Shapiro said may have cost  Eastern $403 million.  </P> <P> A settlement "is very important to the viability of Eastern," he said. While a  negotiated settlement is likely, the airline is prepared to go to court to  collect if necessary, Shugrue said.  </P> <P> "We're not about to roll over and play dead to anybody," said Shugrue, who was  appointed two weeks ago to run Eastern.  </P> <P> In a 500-page report to the bankruptcy court, Shapiro said the management fees  were one of 12 areas in which Texas Air may have overcharged Eastern. The fee  was reduced from $500,000 a month to $250,000 a month when Eastern filed for  bankruptcy protection.  </P> <P> Some management services Texas Air provided, including advice and legal  support, were no longer needed, Shugrue said.  </P> <P> Eastern has also stopped leasing planes and crews from Continental Airlines,  which is owned by Texas Air, Shugrue said. Eastern still buys fuel and leases  planes from Texas Air, but the transactions are independent of the management  services contract, he said.  </P> <P> Shugrue said he would proceed with plans to sell Latin American routes to  American Airlines. Like the previous managers, he believes that would allow  Eastern to pare its money-losing Miami hub and marshal its forces in Atlanta.  </P> <P> But he rejected speculation that Eastern may move its headquarters to Atlanta.  </P> <P> Separately, Texas Air reported that it lost $107.1 million in the year's first  quarter.  </P> <P> The loss came on revenue of $1.86 billion and compares to a loss of $255.53  million on revenue of $1.88 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since  employees struck in March, 1989, recorded a net loss $136.5 million on revenue  of $557.2 million before a $7.8-million charge for dividends payable to its  preferred stockholders.  </P> <P> A year ago, Miami-based Eastern lost $255.2 million on revenue of $620.6  million before a $10.4-million charge for preferred dividends.  </P> <P> Under generally accepting accounting principles, Eastern's operating results  will be excluded from Texas Air's future reported operating results beginning  April 19.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Houston-based Continental Airlines reported first-quarter  earnings of $21.3 million, contrasted with a loss of $16.5 million a year ago.  </P></p>

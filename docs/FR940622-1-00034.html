			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The more limited scope of the temporary cease and desist order is not problematic to the Department because the authority provides the SEC with the ability to issue such an order not only if a rule violation has occurred but also if one is threatened. Since the SEC is the appropriate regulatory agency for government securities brokers or dealers subject to &sect;402.2, an impending violation of a &sect;402.2 requirement would be cause for the issuance of a temporary cease and desist order. The SEC would still be able to anticipate sizeable capital withdrawals that might result in violations of &sect;402.2, since it would receive the notifications required by the proposed rule, as described earlier. The SEC would only be prevented from issuing a temporary cease and desist order in the circumstance where a government securities broker or dealer would remain in capital compliance and would not breach the rule's early warning levels as a result of the withdrawal. Assuming the adequacy of the current capital standards and withdrawal restrictions, it is difficult to foresee a circumstance in which issuance of a capital withdrawal order would be desirable when a government securities broker or dealer would continue to remain in capital compliance. For these reasons, the Department believes that, in lieu of developing a separate capital withdrawal order provision, it should rely on the SEC's existing cease and desist order authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with this approach, the Department also is excluding this provision of Rule 15c3&hyph;1 from the compliance requirements for those government securities brokers and dealers registered under Section 15C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;5) that are subject to the SEC capital rule (i.e., interdealer brokers operating under &sect;402.1(e) and futures commission merchants).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In amending the withdrawal provisions, the Department has restructured certain related definitions of terms into a Miscellaneous Provisions paragraph (i)(3) and has added a description of what constitutes an advance or loan of liquid capital, which is one component of the restricted activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Conforming Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the revisions of the minimum capital requirements under both the SEC and Treasury capital rules, a conforming change is required in the recordkeeping provisions of Part 404. Specifically, paragraph 404.2(a)(4) contains references to the minimum dollar capital amounts required of government securities clearing brokers and dealers. The Department is proposing to revise these references in accordance with the proposed fully phased-in minimum capital level of $250,000 required of clearing firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed regulations are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), it is hereby certified that the proposed regulations, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As of June 30, 1993, only 39 government securities brokers and dealers were subject to the capital requirements of &sect;402.2. Of these, only 11 firms would be considered small entities. Accordingly, the relatively low dollar value of the proposed capital increase and the small number of firms affected indicates that there is not a significant impact. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. In accordance with this requirement, the Department has submitted the collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking for review. Comments on the collection of information should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20503; and to the Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, at the address specified at the beginning of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collections of information in this proposed rule are contained in proposed &sect;402.2(i)(1). This paragraph would require a government securities broker or dealer, subject to the requirements of &sect;402.2, to provide written notification of certain specified withdrawals of capital. This collection of information is intended to allow the SEC and the designated examining authority of the firm to better monitor the government securities broker's or dealer's operations and financial condition. The rule applies primarily to larger government securities brokers and dealers since aggregate withdrawals of less than $500,000 are excluded from the requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Estimated total annual reporting burden: 5 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated average annual burden per respondent: 1 hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated number of respondents: 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated annual frequency of response: Twice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR Part 402  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brokers, Government securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR Part 404  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, banking, Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

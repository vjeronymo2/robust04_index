			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish  at 0000 GMT on 19 January features a report in three parts by  correspondent Diosdado Maso from Camaguey City. Maso reports  that the Urban Buses Enterprise has established a new pilot  system on three routes which consists of a profit- sharing  scheme among the inspector, mechanic, driver, and electrician of  each bus, where a percentage of the profits are divided among  them at the end of each shift.    Maso interviews a driver and inspector who stress their  renewed effort to ensure people pay their fares. One worker  reports having made 200 extra pesos in two weeks, and another 70  pesos in four days. Maso interviews several customers who highly  praise the renewed quality and timeliness of the service. Maso  stresses that since December, when it was first implemented,  absenteeism has dropped, the number of trips has increased,  breakdowns have been eliminated, costs have been reduced, less  fuel is being used, the workers' morale is higher, and the  people are receiving better service. Maso concludes: "This is an  experience worth imitating."</p>

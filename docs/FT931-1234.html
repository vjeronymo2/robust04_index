			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: GIB lifted by sales improvement GIB Group, one of Belgium's two largest retailers, pushed up sales by 5 per cent in the year to January 31 1993, and increased consolidated profit before tax by 10 per cent to BFr4.18bn (Dollars 124m) from BFr3.79bn The group's share of consolidated net profits slipped 3 per cent to BFr3.25bn from BFr3.35bn, partly because GIB had to provide BFr258m for deferred taxes, to bring the group in line with new accounting rules. Consolidated turnover last year rose to BFr228bn from BFr217bn and all four sectors of the group's activity - supermarkets, do-it-yourself, fast-food and speciality retailing - showed an increase in sales. Super and hypermarket sales, which account for 61 per cent of the group total, rose by 2 per cent. Cash flow rose 15 per cent to BFr8.9bn. The group expects to announce detailed results and dividends in May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Chances are high that the  UN Security Council will approve and actually impose sanctions  against North Korea if the nuclear standoff continues on its  present course, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday.    Without going into detail, Han said the Seoul government has  prepared measures "for every possible situation."    China, the uncertain variable if the council does opt for  sanctions, could play an important role regardless of whether it  joins in the sanctions, he said.    Han, who is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on a state  visit to Russia June 1, said he hopes Seoul and Moscow will  reaffirm their cooperation in resolving the North Korean nuclear  row.    Kim leaves for Russia in the midst of a tense situation,  with  North Korea refusing core inspection activities at a disputed 5-  megawatt reactor that could reveal its past nuclear development.    Han had said that Pyongyang would be crossing the line if it  destroyed the opportunity for the IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] to segregate and sample fuel rods from the  reactor for later measurement.    "If the fuel rod discharging work continues at the current  pace, North Korea will, in a short while, cross that line," he  said in a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. But Seoul  has not been informed that Pyongyang actually crossed the line,  said Han.    Asked about the possibility of the Security Council opting  for sanctions, he said the "chances are high that sanctions will  actually be put into effect."    "But it's not the time to discuss military sanctions," Han  said, despite President Kim's earlier remarks in talks with the  opposition leader that economic and military sanctions may be  sought simultaneously.    "We are not ruling out any possibility," he said when asked  if Seoul is willing to seek sanctions outside the Security  Council in case China refuses to go along.    Predicting China's role will grow as the Security Council  discusses whether to impose sanctions, he suggested other ways  for Beijing to exert influence. "China would be able to assume  various important roles, regardless of whether it does or does  not participate actively in the sanctions," he said.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / EC urged to free energy market URGENT action is required to quicken the pace of energy liberalisation throughout Europe, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday. Mr Eggar said he would press for the quick introduction of a free energy market when he meets European Community energy ministers in Brussels tomorrow. He was speaking at a conference in London organised by the Confederation of British Industry and the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry. His comments suggested that energy liberalisation might be a theme when the UK takes over the EC presidency in July. The UK leads the way in deregulation of electricity and gas industries, but may face strong opposition in pushing for greater liberalisation from countries such as France and the Netherlands. Mr Eggar said industry and 350m consumers across Europe would have 'everything to gain' from cheaper gas and electricity, with only a handful of vested interests likely to be losers. He suggested there was a 'striking contradiction at the heart of Europe'. 'It is quite extraordinary that we have been spending so much time making sure that goods can cross frontiers but we apparently find it impossible for gas and electricity to flow across frontiers.' He said significant disparities still existed between electricity and gas prices in different European countries. He also warned that European industry might find it impossible to compete with the rest of the world unless energy prices fell, as they were in the liberalised markets of the US and Japan. Mr Eggar said arguments that electricity and gas were natural monopolies, and that only monopolies had sufficient economic security to undertake large investment programmes required by energy projects, had been proved wrong by the liberalised UK electricity market, and the gas market in the US. He also countered claims by opponents of energy liberalisation that it would require a 'huge centralised regulatory bureaucracy'. Regulation could be left to member countries operating within an agreed framework.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] China's national offshore oil corporation will go  abroad to seek potential cooperators later this month. The  partners will explore for oil and natural gas in the South China  Sea. Li Peichun has the story:    [Begin recording] [Li Peichun] The China National Offshore  Oil Corporation or CNOOC will open up a total of 13 blocks for  foreign exploration. All of them are located near coastal areas  of the South China Sea. The Chinese company will send a  delegation to Houston, Texas in the United States to seek  exploration partners. The program was first announced in early  May. By 1 June, more than 10 U.S. oil companies had expressed  interest in bidding for the project. Arco, Unical, Chevron, and  (Namical) are the largest U.S. oil firms who want a piece of the  action. CNOOC says more than 60 companies will take part in the  bidding in Houston. Senior geologist (Gong Zaisheng) is leading  the Houston delegation. He said he is sure that bidding will be  a success because all of the blocks are rich areas.    [Gong speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation]  (Gong Zaisheng) says seven of the areas are rich in natural gas  before this. China originally reserved the areas for  independent exploration, but due to the lack of funds and the  need for more advanced technology it decided to seek help from  overseas counterparts. (Gong Zaisheng) says that the blocks at  the mouth of the Pearl river have large oil deposits. During  the four day bidding, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation will not only tell potential investors about the  geology of the areas, but also exchange technology with their  overseas counterparts.    The explorations in the South China Sea are important for  south China which is suffering from a shortage of energy.  According to the English newspaper CHINA DAILY, Guangdong  Province will need to triple its current energy capacity in  order to cope with the rapidly expanding economic growth in the  area. Hainan, Fujian, and Guangxi are also expected to  experience increased demands. At present, the southern  provinces transport more than 1 million tonnes of coal from  north China every year to meet the demand. Geologist (Gong  Zaisheng) says his company is planning to build a long-distance  gas pipeline which will serve major coastal cities. The pipeline  will carry natural gas produced offshore in the South China Sea.  [end recording]</p>

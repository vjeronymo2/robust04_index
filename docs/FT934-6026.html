			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Power tops Pounds 115m Scottish Power, the vertically integrated electricity company, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 115.7m in the half year to September 30; the underlying increase, however, adjusted for an exceptional charge last time, was 6.6 per cent. The interim dividend is raised to 4.13p (3.72p) on earnings per share up 27 per cent to 10.78p (8.49p). Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said that as part of the strategy of increasing efficiency the company had reduced the workforce to 7,610, against 9,500 at privatisation two and a half years ago. There were further staffing reductions to come, he added. Gearing at the period-end was 2.3 per cent, with net borrowings at Pounds 20m, but the company expects that by the year end borrowings will rise to equal last year's Pounds 98m, when gearing amounted to 11 per cent. Mr Preston said improved profitability in the first half reflected higher prices in the English wholesale mar-ket. The upgraded transmission link to England and Wales, completed ahead of schedule and within budget, would increase the company's ability to sell power outside Scot-land by 75 per cent from 1994-95. The retail operation was ahead of this stage in 1992. The company has opened its 100th store and is increasing market share. The company yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Ian Russell, director of financial control at Tomkins, as finance director. COMMENT Scottish Power has effected a significant recovery since its disappointing stock market introduction two and a half years ago and these results demonstrate why. It appears to be one of the few power companies to be making a success of retailing and its contracting arm made profits, if only minimal, this half. The company was yesterday making the most of the reinforced interconnector with England which will enable it to export the equivalent of a third of its Scottish sales. But what most pleases the City is the stick-to-basics approach through which, for example, it has eschewed foreign ventures of the type being pursued by National Power and PowerGen. The company is expected to make Pounds 335m to Pounds 350m pre-tax for the full year and pay out about 12.4p in dividends. At that level the prospective yield on the shares, down 2 1/2 p to 406 1/2 p, is 3.8 per cent. That is below the sector average signifying City approval. However, the shares may suffer if the regulator lifts the cloud over the English generators by deciding against refering them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

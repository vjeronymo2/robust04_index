			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 11 ARRESTED IN MEXICO OVER YUCATAN FIRES  </P> <P> Eleven people have been arrested on charges they set fires that scorched  370,000 acres of jungle in southeastern Mexico, according to the attorney  general's office.  </P> <P> The group started a number of fires in the state of Quintana Roo "for the  purpose of exploiting lumber resources and creating areas for cultivation and  uncontrolled human settlements," the office said in a communique released  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Residents near one of the fires told authorities they saw two of the suspects  pour gasoline across a wide area of jungle, then set it ablaze, according to  the communique.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fires Moved Slowly  </P> <P> The fires advanced slowly through the jungle for five months until rain  extinguished them in early August.  </P> <P> Dry wood and other forest litter from Hurricane Gilbert last September combined  with the late start of the rainy season to help spread the fires, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Mexican and foreign experts estimate that recovery of the jungle will take more  than 30 years, a spokesman for the Group of 100 Artists and Intellectuals, an  ecological organization in Mexico, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Eight of the 11 were arrested in Mexico City, two in the state of Quintana Roo  and one in the state of Veracruz.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought to Cultivate Land  </P> <P> With 30 others, they had taken over land in Campeche state, which is also  located in the southeast, and set fire to it to open land for cultivation, the  attorney general's office said.  </P> <P> Unable to control the blaze, they fled to Quintana Roo in late March, the  office added.  </P> <P> They were charged with property damage, carrying weapons without a license,  criminal association and violation of forestry and ecological protection laws.  </P> <P> The communique said some of those arrested Monday have been involved in fires  and illegal land dealings on Ajusco, a mountain at the southern edge of the  capital of Mexico City.  </P> <P> Two of those arrested were also wanted for various homicides in Mexico City,  the communique added.  </P></p>

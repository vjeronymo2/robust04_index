			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup is  currently on a two-day visit to Estonia. Priit Ennet attended a  news conference he gave at the airport.    [Ennet] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup intends to  sign an Estonian-Danish defense cooperation agreement tomorrow.  Denmark has already concluded similar agreements with Latvia  and Lithuania. They envisage the holding of consultations in  order to resolve defense and security issues and dialogue on  strategic planning. Hans Haekkerup said on arrival at Tallinn  airport that state defense greements with all Baltic states on  state defense cooperation are basically very similar.    [Begin Haekkerup recording, in English fading to Estonian  translation] It is important to us that the Baltic states should  not be set to trail behind other central and eastern European  countries. We wish to ensure that the Baltic states are part of  Europe and have access to our security structures, with the help  of bilateral and multipartite cooperation. We are much  interested in cooperation with the Baltic peacekeeping  battalion. The Nordic countries, in conjunction with other  countries, have been aiming to draft a program of assistance to  the Baltic battalion. We aim to help to design the battalion's  structure and cooperate in training. I hope we will be able to  supply some of the equipment. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

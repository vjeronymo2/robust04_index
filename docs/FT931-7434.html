			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nestle bows to pressure from EC NESTLE, the Swiss foods group, has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and renegotiated the proposed sale of part of the assets of Groupe Perrier in an effort to win EC approval for its takeover of the French mineral water producer. Under an agreement announced yesterday, Nestle will sell Perrier's Pierval brand to Castel, a French beverage company, in addition to the other Perrier brands and springs which Castel agreed two weeks ago to purchase for up to FFr750m (Dollars 136m). Castel, which owns the Nicolas wine business, had previously said it was not interested in buying Pierval because it did not fit in with its existing mineral water range. However, Nestle said yesterday that competition authorities in Brussels had refused to approve the earlier deal with Castel unless it included Pierval. Pierval was among the Perrier brands which the commission last year ordered Nestle to sell to a single buyer in an attempt to establish a 'third force' which would compete with the Swiss group and BSN, France's biggest food company, on the French mineral water market. Until Nestle complies with the order, it may not carry out a separate agreement reached during last year's takeover battle to sell Volvic, another Perrier mineral water brand, to BSN. Nestle and Castel would not disclose the price of the Pierval sale, but expressed confidence that it would enable them to comply fully with the terms of the EC order.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT / ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR: FAMILY LIFTS RECOVERING ADDICT  </P> <P> It's the little things that remind Karen Bagby how far she has come in a year's  time and how close she came to losing everything she cares about.  </P> <P> She thinks about it when she watches her son and daughter asleep with the easy  slumber of children who are well cared for. Or when her 3-month-old baby boy,  Auston, cries and she's there to comfort him.  </P> <P> Bagby, 27-year-old mother of three and recovering crack cocaine addict, was  given trial custody of her children in December. A few weeks ago she was  awarded permanent custody.  </P> <P> "I know it's permanent -- that it's all over with when they're sleeping at  night or I just sit watching them playing," Bagby said. "He (Auston) gets his  bath at a certain time every night and his bottle and he's gone. There's just  that feeling that this is permanent."  </P> <P> Bagby, who once spent her nights at a crack house, lost her two older children  -- Michelle, now 7, and James, now 5 -- about two years ago when authorities in  Los Angeles County ruled her neglectful and unfit as a mother. She moved to  Orange County about six months later and shortly thereafter entered the  county's drug treatment program.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County court's earlier decision to take away her children was  reversed on June 14.  </P> <P> "They terminated my case and wished me luck," Bagby said, recalling the moment  in court when the judge ruled her a fit mother. "It means I'm not in the system  anymore. It's like a happy ending, huh?"  </P> <P> For Orange County health officials, who last year spent $454,340 on a drug  rehabilitation program for mothers addicted to drugs, Bagby is a success story  to be heralded. It is a program in which officials acknowledge the relapse rate  is more than 50%. So far, Bagby is hanging on.  </P> <P> She admits to slipping once her first month in the program, more than a year  ago, but subsequently passed all her mandatory weekly drug tests while still  under the court's supervision. She regularly attends Narcotics Anonymous  meetings because, she acknowledged, she will always be an addict.  </P> <P> In April Bagby gave birth to a healthy, drug-free baby boy.  </P> <P> "He was a very active baby inside me. He moved around a lot," Bagby said,  laughing. Then, she added proudly, "He's starting to get where he's getting a  grip on his bottle. He'll probably be holding it by next month."  </P> <P> Bagby said she is now hoping her younger sister, who moved in with her a few  months ago, will be able to "get it together." Her sister, she said, has lost  custody of all five of her children, including the baby girl she gave birth to  while high on crack.  </P> <P> As children, the two sisters provided each other their only nurturing in an  otherwise loveless household -- a home where they were left to fend for  themselves.  </P> <P> As adults they have often followed the same path: They married brothers, lived  in side-by-side homes -- and became addicts. Karen Bagby said she offers  encouragement to her sister but can do little else.  </P> <P> "She's in the process of getting her children back -- she's been clean for six  months," Bagby said. "If you're going to get clean, you're going to get clean  yourself. All anyone can do is give you support."  </P></p>

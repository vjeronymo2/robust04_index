			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CORONA DEL MAR;  </P> <P> OASIS SENIOR CENTER TO GET VAN, DRIVER  </P> <P> The 3,200-member Oasis Multipurpose Senior Center will get a new van to  transport seniors to doctor appointments, grocery stores and other activities  early next year.  </P> <P> Money for the van and a driver for one year was donated last week by the Harry  and Grace Steele Foundation in Newport Beach, according to Norma Gilchrist,  Friends of Oasis president.  </P> <P> "Transportation for seniors is a priority," Gilchrist said. "Everyone thinks  people who come here are rich, but it's not true. And even if they do have  money to eat, they're lonely."  </P> <P> Gilchrist said an Oasis community survey of seniors revealed transportation to  be the most pressing problem faced. And hiring drivers costs up to $10 an hour  or more, she added.  </P> <P> "They live alone and can't get to the doctor or store or here to join in  activities," she said. "In other words, they're just stranded. This gift is  such a blessing."  </P> <P> The 24-seat van will have a wheelchair lift for the frail and elderly. The  Irvine Co. donated $2,500 to help with the maintenance and operating costs of  the vehicle.  </P> <P> The Oasis, located at 800 Marguerite Drive, is jointly funded and managed by  the city of Newport Beach and Friends of Oasis, a nonprofit organization.  </P> <P> More than 50 classes and activities are held there for members who come from  Irvine, Laguna Beach and Costa Mesa, in addition to Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The center offers meals, shared housing, counseling, health screenings and  extensive recreational and educational programs.  </P> <P> "We want to do everything we can to help enrich all senior citizen's lives,  whether it be social activities or human services," Gilchrist said.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Afghanistan President Bornahoddin Rabbani at </F> session of Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front in Kabul on 1  June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Esteemed brothers, esteemed  president of the Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front, and others  in the audience: The peace and blessing of God be upon you. I  am very happy to take part in your session today. (?You have  opened) your session as usual; from the beginning, since the  formation of the Peace and Islamic Brotherhood Front, you have  been working hard for the restoration of security, prevention of  disturbances and clashes, and for the consolidation of peace in  our beloved Islamic country, Afghanistan.    You have again opened this grand session with this sacred  aspiration [passage indistinct]. Under the present circumstances  yet again we need more action and more efforts, especially from  our brothers and our esteemed ulema -- those who are aware and  have honest feelings in particular under the present  circumstances. We must take faster steps along the road for the  restoration of peace and security and increase our efforts and  action. In regard to the current situation and solution of the  problems, I would like to raise a number of issues with you,  esteemed brothers [passage indistinct].    Of course you are aware of the political and military  situation of your country. You know why the fighting flared up?  Where was the problem? What were the causes of the clashes and  destruction? I have said time and again, and I emphasize again  that the Islamic government which is in charge now has not  grasped power through a military coup and has not usurped  sovereignty by conspiracy. You know yourself that a number of  decisions were made prior to the collapse of the previous regime  in Afghanistan. Decisions were made by the esteemed leaders, a  number of whom are with us in the present difficulties. A  number of them as onlookers see the events from far away and a  number of them are standing in the trench of hostility against  the Islamic state and their own people and they put Kabul city  and other regions under their cruel attacks and embark on  conspiracies, coups and anti-Islamic and anti-national actions.  [passage omitted]    For elections to take place as soon as possible -- we are  ready for the election to be held. The settlement that was  reached in Peshawar and various settlements that have been  reached [words indistinct] that elections should be held on the  basis of the formation of a new council to make a decision on  changing political leadership in Afghanistan. At the moment the  unanimous decision of all -- in all those agreements and in all  of their undertakings -- is for another council to be convened  in order that this council can reach a settlement about the  future [words indistinct]. Here we have some options: One is  that some people who say that they do not want to convene a  council and make no undertaking want six or nine people to sit  together and form another government -- form a transitional  government for a short time. And after that -- after a  transitional government is formed another council is to be  formed. The reality is that their goal is not the formation of a  transitional government. It is to create a vacuum or an  inertia, to have a situation come about that the present  administration -- before such a council is convened that has the  power of decisionmaking, with all issues be submitted to it, and  it should represent the whole of Afghanistan -- the regime is  dismantled before such a council is convened [words indistinct]  [sentence as heard].    Two or three brothers of ours are not even prepared to come  inside Afghanistan and sit together. Do they want to set up  this session outside Afghanistan or do they want to hold it  along the border? (?Do they care) that Kabul will again be put  under the rain of rockets? The elements that are lying in wait  will again cause disorder and embark on plunder and new clashes.  (?They do not think of this) but only aim to disrupt the  situation, and whatever happens in the future let it happen; no  one will be there to take the responsibility. There will be no  shura [parliament], no government, or any center of  decisionmaking, nothing, only an imaginary condition and  illusory situation. A government of transition; what can a  government of transition do? A government formed through the  Hal-wa Haqd Shura [constituent council] and a government which  is formed by their participation, they do not accept this  government. It is not clear how this transitional government  will be formed, [words indistinct] who will be in this  transitional government and for how long. As far as we see,  such decisions undermine the nation and make them a ground for  dangerous games [words indistinct].    You are all witness to the fact that (?most of the  countries), even some countries unfortunately in the east [words  indistinct], are those who really do not want stability in our  country. They do not want Afghanistan as a powerful,  independent, and Islamic country. Nevertheless, the decision  must be made by our people: What advice do they give and what  decision do they make? What should we do? What kind of climate  is to be created so that we can get rid of this situation? This  decision to set up a shura is the decision of those leaders to  which they are now disagreeing; all agree to the setting up of a  shura. But why are they not now agreeing to the setting up of  this shura; perhaps they say that the government might influence  it; that is to say that government might select their own chosen  people [words indistinct]. Such a belief is in fact an insult  against the people of Afghanistan [words indistinct].    I am prepared for solving their problem, and I believe that  the government should not interfere in the setting up of a shura  and should choose a neutral position. Representatives can be  chosen from among peace delegations, representatives from  formations or alternatively no representatives should be allowed  from formations for preventing struggles and conflicts. Let the  peace delegations [words indistinct] and also representatives  from those provinces that have jihadi councils, their  representatives should take part. From among this collection, a  gathering of fully neutral individuals can come into being.  This neutral collective should draft regulations for the  setting up of a shura and convene the shura. When the shura is  gathered then the government's responsibility [words indistinct]  should be handed over to this shura as a center of power. The  shura will have the power to choose the future leadership of  Afghanistan and take whatever decision they wish. The decision  of the shura should be respected. We must respect their  decision. Is it better to let six or seven people sit together  far away from the country and decide about the country or let a  thousand or thousand-and-a-half representatives of the people to  render such a decision [passage indistinct].    Nevertheless, I believe that a way should be sought by the  people themselves to get rid of this situation; a decision must  be taken by the representatives of the people. You, esteemed  ulema and the brothers who are present here and the rest of our  brothers must consult with each other about the future of our  country and render a decision representing the will of the  people. You should render a decision before our country's  difficulties increase. The government is at your disposal,  advise it [passage indistinct].</p>

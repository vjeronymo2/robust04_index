A Belarusian cabinet member who wanted to remain anonymous  told Interfax that the negotiating teams will discuss, as a  matter of priority, mechanisms enabling the most important  economic institutions of Russia and Belarus to function jointly  and engage in business contacts with third countries.    In his words, the two sides are about to agree on the need  to  have a transition period during which common approaches will be  worked out in customs, budgets, pricing, crediting and social  policies. He did not rule out that the replacement of  Belarusian currency by Russian rubles will take six months or a  year.    The minister thinks that the gap between Russian and  Belarusian positions has been narrowed on the two most  controversial issues, the prices of fuel and raw commodities for  Belarusian consumers and the exchange rate between the  Belarusian and Russian rubles. Following comparison of prices of  the 97 most important goods, one Russian ruble seems to be worth  two Belarusian rubles while discussion will have to continue on  the prices of oil and gas. Belarus wants to make these prices  equal to those in Russia, while the Russian negotiators insist  on freezing the existing prices for Belarusian factories and  gradually making them equal to those at which oil and gas are  sold to Russian factories.    The Belarusian minister said that a compromise was possible.    When the documents are agreed upon, Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin will go to Minsk for a signing ceremony.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / A heavyweight of the Basque stones: Inaki Perurena, superstar of an ancient sport THE BASQUE pavement artists draw just one living person. Not a politician or pop star. Nor Basque Miguel Indurain, winner of cycling's Tour de France in 1991 and 1992. The immensely powerful figure that looms between the religious scenes and Mona Lisas is that of another Basque, Inaki Perurena, holder of the world's most outstanding lifting records. Perurena lifts in the Basque style and is therefore comparatively little known internationally, but the style of lifting - raising traditional, carefully cut stones from the ground to the shoulder with most competitions decided by repetitions in a tight time schedule - in no way lessens Perurena's achievements. Basque lifting is a demanding, ancient sport, much older than orthodox weightlifting, closely supervised and widely followed; in summer, 50 and more competitions can take place on the same day. Perurena's achievements stretch credulity: supreme records, unbeatable for 15 years and for nearly as long, as a direct result of his dominance, without direct competition; one of the few both to have dominated a sport and to have revolutionised its technique and training. What puts Perurena ahead of Indurain is the fact that he has given more than 5,000 demonstrations, sometimes two or three a day, in just about every Basque town and village (as well as in the US, Argentina, Japan, France, Germany and Italy), usually as the highlight of a programme of Basque traditional sports. Perurena is a modest, at times, almost shy man, but well aware of his achievements. He is serious-faced, but with a deep chuckle never far away. He can show exasperation, but has the Basque's approachability. He has a rapport with his fellow Basques and is as instantly recognised  - and admired - in the remotest hamlet as he is in the docks of Bilbao or the elegance of San Sebastian. The first adjective that came to mind when I saw Perurena was 'non-effusive'. (Basques in repose tend to be non-effusive). I watched Perurena arrive at a meeting in a well-used van, a powerful but not massive man (he does not begin to look his 134 kilos), then stand talking to his driver, unsmiling. The second adjective was cat-like. He walked from the van towards a group of other competitors, then grinned and suddenly leapt a pile of logs to join them. Perurena's power needs time to sink in. His two-handed record for the rectangular stone (from the ground to the shoulder) is 315 kilograms, more than half the weight of a small van. His one-handed record is 263kg. When the American powerlifter Dwayne Selby bench pressed 300kg and the Belarussian weightlifter Leonid Taranenko - the silver medallist in the superheavyweight class in Barcelona - clean and jerked 266kg for world records in their disciplines, they each made the lifts once. When Inaki Perurena first lifted 300 kilos he raised the stone three times in the allotted four minutes. Had his third lift not almost sent the stone clean over his shoulder he would have achieved a fourth repetition. Only supreme strength and skill saved him from serious injury. Perurena met with reserve when he decided that a lifting technique used for over 200 years was unscientific, and changed it. He he also adapted the weight training methods of orthodox lifters. Until then, Basque lifters had trained principally on hill walking and hearty eating. More weight, so they reckoned, equalled more power. Perurena is not perfect (and would hate to be portrayed as such). Among other things, he is not king of the small stones - in Basque lifting, stones up to 200 kilos are classified, with deadpan nonchalance, as small. He is also less than perfect at subterfuge. His strong-willed father, once a top aizkolari (log cutter with an axe) wanted Inaki to follow in his footsteps. Inaki wanted to be a lifter. For a while Perurena cut logs by day and lifted by night. Inevitably he was caught. His love affair with his wife, Mayte, almost never started. She was not certain that she wanted a flashy (as she then saw him) sportsman husband. Her parents were certain that they did not want such a son-in-law. When Perurena finally persuaded Mayte to meet him in a neighbouring village they were seen within minutes. Perurena learned about gamesmanship the hard way. Early in his career, he accepted a challenge match, the hard edge of Basque traditional sport, went into strict training, and just happened to meet a member of the other camp in his favourite bar. 'Our man thinks he can beat you without training. He's drinking too much. I've lost money I haven't got', was the morose message. Perurena also began to spend more time in bars. When he arrived for the match he found an opponent in peak condition; and lost. For someone who has given over 5,000 demonstrations, Perurena's firm, 'I am not a professional,' at first seems illogical. He earns a good living from his exhibitions. He could, though make a lot more. But he has never had to lift to live. Years ago he opened a butcher's shop as insurance against sickness or injury, then added an equally successful livestock business. Perurena is 35, he will continue to give demonstrations, but an era has ended. 'A man cannot break records for ever', is how he recently acknowledged that commitments elsewhere mean that he can no longer undertake the training necessary to attack his own records. One wonders if Perurena is not secretly glad to have escaped the treadmill of expectation that 15 years of record breaking have created. He is unlikely to say, but his reputation, his near immortality in the Basque country was assured long ago. Indurain can continue to outride everybody else. But for the foreseeable future, the shrewd men of Basque art will continue to draw just the one living person. It is a unique hall of fame.</p>

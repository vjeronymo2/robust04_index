			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Kinnock passed over for EC post THE tortuous on-off saga of Mr Neil Kinnock's possible appointment as a Brussels commissioner finally ended last night when it was confirmed that Mr Bruce Millan will remain in his post for a further two years. The decision immediately provoked behind-the-scenes charges of bad faith against Mr John Major from senior Labour officials and fervent counter-denials from Downing Street that the prime minister had given any undertakings to the former opposition leader. Last July, Mr Major held a series of talks with Mr John Smith, Mr Kinnock's successor, over Labour's nominee for the post of second British commissioner. While officials emphasised that the final decision remained firmly in the prime minister's hands, there were widespread reports that, fresh from his April election triumph, Mr Major was in magnanimous mood and ready to approve the posting. Commentators also pointed out that Mr Smith might have his own reasons for pressing the appointment as he did not relish Mr Kinnock's declared aim of fighting a seat on Labour's national executive committee. However, the reports of the discussions immediately provoked a hostile reaction from Conservative backbenchers and opposition from the cabinet. Several argued that Mr Kinnock was not appropriately qualified for the job and should, anyway, be left in London in the hope that his presence would undermine Mr Smith's new regime. When the controversy over the Maastricht treaty deepened in the wake of the Danish referendum result, Mr Kinnock's prospects faded. Last week, he publicly claimed he had no interest in the Pounds 100,000-plus post - signalling that the decision had gone against him. The reappointment of Mr Millan alongside Sir Leon Brittan as British commissioner leaves a solid, experienced administrator in place for the next two years. Mr Millan, who has been in charge of EC regional policy since 1989, served in the Labour government as a junior minister in the 1960s and as secretary of state for Scotland under Lord Callaghan. Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr Millan has kept a low profile in Brussels. He has earned a reputation for hard work and skilful bargaining in his efforts to share out the Ecu60bn (at 1989 prices) allocated to poorer regions between 1987 and 1992. Mr Millan has indicated he would like to retain the regional policy portfolio in the new Commission that is due to take office in January 1993. He is understood to be pressing for a streamlining of responsibilities for structural funds. Observer, Page 19</p>

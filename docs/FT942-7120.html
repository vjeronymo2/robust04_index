			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (13): Impressive placing power - Merrill Lynch Some months ago, news that a veteran Merrill Lynch investment banker had flown in from New York to call on London clients sent shivers down the spines of the locals. Was he about to snatch a big deal from under their noses? asked worried eurobond syndicate managers at the London-based houses. His arrival was given further importance because it coincided with market rumours that Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, was about to launch a large global bond offering. The Hanson deal has yet to surface, but nevertheless the episode serves to illustrate the strong presence which Merrill has built in the international capital markets. As the biggest US securities house with a market capitalisation of Dollars 8bn and an enviable distribution system to institutional and retail investors, one expects Merrill to have a dominant position in the US and in the international arena. According to Securities Data, Merrill was the leading underwriter of worldwide public new issues of debt and equity in 1993 with business worth Dollars 193bn. It also maintained its market share of just over 13 per cent. Merrill's placing power, its wide range of services and its ability to execute currency swaps are some of the strengths which attract borrowers. Officials at a European sovereign borrower which has been active in the eurobond market in recent years say that although Merrill tends to be more anonymous than its competitors, it has strong ideas on derivatives, swaps and other structured products. The perception that the company 'transcends individuals' also appeals to the treasurer of a UK bank who regards Merrill as one of the best dealers in medium-term notes, a facility which is increasingly popular with borrowers. However, another UK corporate treasurer feels rather neglected by Merrill with respect to primary issues now that the yield spreads on his bonds have tightened substantially. 'They get more bang for their bucks by working with medium-range credits,' he says. Indeed, Merrill has been closely involved with issuers, sovereign borrowers in particular, which are seen to be improving credits. It has arranged issues for Portugal, Argentina and is widely expected to lead-manage the first eurobond offering for Lebanon later this year. Although Merrill is seen as a powerful fixed-income house, it has also made rapid strides in the international equity market in recent years. According to IFR Securities Data, Merrill raised Dollars 4.64bn in international equity issuance in 1993, putting it second in the book runners' table behind Goldman Sachs. Although it only moved up just one place from the previous year, it almost doubled the amount raised in equity issuance compared with 1992. By contrast, Merrill only achieved fifth position in the widely-watched eurobond league table last year when it raised Dollars 17.9bn out of total eurobond issuance of Dollars 400bn, putting it behind Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston. Syndicate managers at other London-based eurobond houses offer several reasons why Merrill's profile in the eurobond market is not as high as it could be. Some say it is because the London operation tends to report back more to New York whereas other US houses in London have more autonomy. Others put it down to Merrill's dependence on eurodollar issuance. 'It has virtually no penetration in sterling or D-Marks,' says one syndicate manager. However, Merrill has been taking steps to broaden its range of currencies which should enable it to underwrite more business in the eurobond market. It has built up a presence in yen and French francs and its return to dealing in UK government bonds earlier this year should help it to win more primary eurosterling mandates. Heavy losses had prompted Merrill to pull out of gilts in 1989. Expertise in money markets and floating-rate notes have also enabled Merrill to make the most of the change for the worse in market sentiment which has prompted investors to opt for short-dated maturities and for floating-rate as opposed to fixed-rate bonds. These developments already appear to be producing results. According to IFR Securities Data, by early May Merrill had clawed its way to second position in the 1994 eurobond league table with just under Dollars 10bn worth of new issue business or 6.5 per cent of the total. However, Merrill has exposed itself and its new issues to potentially harsh scrutiny by the market following its rather arrogant contribution to a recent debate on whether the eurobond market's fixed-price re-offer mechanism needed to be amended. In a letter to IFR magazine, which acted as a forum for the debate, Merrill said: 'Difficulties clearly arise with the fixed price re-offer mechanism with respect to transactions which are clearly mispriced and/or poorly mis-timed. It is our policy to avoid such transactions and hence are not in a position to make an informed comment.'</p>

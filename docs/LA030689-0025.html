			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOILEAU AND IVANOVA SHINE IN L.A. MARATHON;  </P> <P> HEAT MAKES RACE A BATTLE OF ATTRITION  </P> <P> Is it possible that a race may be declared victorious in Sunday's fourth annual  Los Angeles Marathon? That a course of deceptively undulating hills would  prevail over the fittest runners? That bright sunshine would conquer even those  athletes from the warmest regions of the world?  </P> <P> Believe it. As runners began to peel off over the course of the race's 26 miles  385 yards, it became clear that this marathon would be a race of attrition. It  is always the way in these matters, but Sunday was a day for chance and  caprice, for natural elements to triumph over plans of men and women.  </P> <P> Unplanned -- and nearly overlooked -- was Art Boileau's methodical overtaking  of the fallen leaders. The Canadian, who had won this race in 1987, was running  comfortably in 10th while chaos was befalling those who chose to set a fast  pace on a day when the sun beat down unobstructed.  </P> <P> The temperature at the 9 a.m. start was 63 degrees, not bad, but also not  likely to hold. It did not and it was tough going for the 18,861 entrants. A  fine sunny day burst out, sending temperatures up to the mid-70s, about 20  degrees above a marathoner's comfort zone.  </P> <P> Boileau's conservative first half of the race proved to be the day's brilliant  tactic. His winning time was 2 hours 13 minutes 1 second, well off his personal  best of 2:11:15 and further still from the course record of 2:10:19.  </P> <P> Likewise, the women's winner, Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union, couldn't gain  her personal best from her winning time of 2:34:42, but she was thrilled to be  around to try. She beat world champion Rosa Mota of Portugal, who ran 2:35:27.  Mota was slowed by a combination of leg pain and pounding heat.  </P> <P> So were they all.  </P> <P> Gidamis Shahanga of Tanzania, who led for most of the race, stopped at 26  miles, then slowly began to run again as Boileau, who had conserved his energy,  surged past both second-place Pedro Ortiz of Colombia and Shahanga.  </P> <P> Shahanga had forged a 42-second lead early in the race, setting what other  runners judged was, and what proved to be, a suicidal pace. Behind him were  Mark Plaatjes, formerly of South Africa, and Ortiz. They were running as a  pair. Behind them was a pack strung out and cautious.  </P> <P> "I was kind of concerned," Boileau said. "The front-runners were going out  fast, and I was thinking of keeping hydrated."  </P> <P> That concern for getting and keeping fluids was foremost on runners' minds.  According to medical officials, more than 200 runners were treated after the  race for dehydration.  </P> <P> Shahanga took water every mile while running easy and strong. He surged at 11  miles, gaining what was his longest lead. Plaatjes, Ortiz and last year's  winner, Martin Mondragon, settled in behind.  </P> <P> Where was Boileau, who seemed not a factor until the last mile?  </P> <P> "I was running pretty conservative," Boileau, 31, said. "I was in 10th place  with (Taisuka) Kodama (of Japan). We were helping each other. I was just  nailing the guys who would fall behind."  </P> <P> Turned out Boileau nailed everyone as the pace and the heat took its toll.  Orlando Pizzolato of Italy, one of the race favorites, dropped out at 17 miles,  a victim of the heat. Patricia Owens, Pizzolato's agent, said he felt dizzy and  weak. In addition, the Italian federation is requiring Pizzolato to run a  marathon next month at the World Cup in Milan.  </P> <P> Among the women, the situation was the same. Mota, who says she doesn't usually  mind heat, nevertheless ran amid a pack of male runners, who provided a wall of  shade for the 5-foot-1 Portuguese runner. Ivanova went solo; running at first  behind them, then slightly in front of Mota, but never side by side.  </P> <P> Their race was seemingly decided at the halfway point, because Mota had settled  for a slow pace. "I was not . . . running well by the half marathon," she said.  "I didn't feel very good in the legs."  </P> <P> Mota has an on-again, off-again injury involving her sciatic nerve. It was  on-again Sunday. Mota considered dropping out, too, but she had done that, for  her first time ever, in her last marathon, and she needed to finish for her  confidence and as someone well-paid to run here.  </P> <P> "The course is difficult," Mota said. "People don't think so, but there are  many, many hills."  </P> <P> Ivanova began to put distance between herself and Mota, and Mota didn't  respond. "I try to catch Zoya," Mota said. "I just can't catch. It was a bad  day for me."  </P> <P> For others, too. After Pizzolato, the next to drop out was Plaatjes, who was  third here last year. His luck in this race has been uneven. Last year, running  for the first time since turning in his South African passport, he was passed  for second place in the final yards. This year Plaatjes, who has run 2:08:58,  was primed to win.  </P> <P> Events seemed to favor him. As he pulled into second ahead of Ortiz, far ahead  Shahanga was laboring. It seemed that Plaatjes, who appeared to be running with  authority, would soon overtake the struggling Tanzanian.  </P> <P> Suddenly, at 18 1/2 miles, Plaatjes dropped out. He had no explanation for the  blood blisters that formed on the balls of his feet.  </P> <P> "If I'm not healthy, I can rationalize it," he said. "But I feel like a dog."  </P> <P> Plaatjes was aware of a problem between 11 or 12 miles. "I thought it would go  away," he said.  </P> <P> In the next mile, the pain grew worse. Meanwhile, Ortiz pulled away. Plaatjes  caught the Colombian at 17 miles. The 17th mile was a duel and Plaatjes finally  surged ahead, running smack into a hill at the 18th mile. There, the pain was  so great that Plaatjes decided to stop, only the third time he has ever dropped  out of a race.  </P> <P> Blisters seemed a common problem Sunday -- race officials said 115 people were  treated for foot ailments, mostly blisters.  </P> <P> Plaatjes veered off the course and stood still, wearing a stunned expression.  He was not alone in his pain. A television camera crew was there.  </P> <P> "A TV guy said, 'Geez, you're not even breathing hard,' " Plaatjes said. "Of  course I wasn't tired. I hadn't even started racing yet."  </P> <P> His race was over, but back on the course the racing had hardly begun. Ortiz  sped ahead to catch the flagging Shahanga. Boileau was coming from behind,  unseen but all-seeing.  </P> <P> "I knew I had a little more gas in the tank," he said. "Running from behind you  can tell if people (Shahanga) are wobbling. Once we saw Shahanga grab his leg,  I was kind of settling for second place."  </P> <P> Shahanga was overcome by the heat, and after stopping briefly he started again,  but at a shuffle pace. "The heat just got to me," he said. "I tried very hard.  I tried to move."  </P> <P> Boileau didn't have to settle for second. He overtook both Ortiz and Shahanga  in the 26th mile. Ernest Tjela of Lesotho was third in 2:14:30 and Shahanga was  fourth in 2:15:32.  </P> <P> Boileau and Ivanova each won $26,385 and an automobile. None of the various  performance bonuses were claimed on a day that produced slow times.  </P> <P> Ivanova was asked if she would be allowed to keep her money and the car, since  it is common in East Bloc nations that the federation takes a healthy cut of  prize money.  </P> <P> "I hope I will be able to get the car," Ivanova, 37, said through an  interpreter. "It is a long way from here to the Soviet Union. And even farther  to my republic, Kasakhstan."  </P> <P> Boileau almost didn't run here, as he hadn't last year. His San Francisco-based  agent disagreed before last year's race with marathon president Bill Burke as  to Boileau's worth. There was some wrangling this year, but Burke said he  wanted Boileau in the race.  </P> <P> Second-place finisher Ortiz said he felt unwanted, too. Despite his 10th-place  finish here last year, Ortiz was not among the invited runners.  </P> <P> According to Ortiz's manager, Luis Felipe Possa, Ortiz was not considered an  elite athlete and did not receive either transportation or a hotel room. Possa  said the Colombian community in Los Angeles pitched in to pay his air fare. He  said Ortiz slept at the home of a friend.  </P> <P> "I hope they can ask me back, now," Ortiz said.  </P></p>

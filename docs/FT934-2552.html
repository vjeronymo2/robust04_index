			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Search for allies steps up in Italy The populist Northern League led by Mr Umberto Bossi has decided to break out of its political isolation and work for a 'liberal-democrat' alliance that includes Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. This is the main upshot of a League congress at the weekend during which Mr Bossi imposed his full authority. In the run-up to the congress, Mr Bossi had been criticised both for his autocratic leadership style and for failing to see the need for alliances in the recent local elections. The League, the party winning most votes in the north, campaigned alone and lacked support to win vital mayoral seats in the biggest cities of Genoa, Trieste and Venice. The Italian media have been speculating on a link-up between the League and Mr Berlusconi's nascent political ambitions for several months, but the matter has now been taken one stage further. Over the weekend Mr Berlusconi was perfectly happy to let his name be linked openly to the League in what appeared a well orchestrated initiative. Mr Bossi admitted the League had to change tactics to ensure it maintained a voice in Italy's fast changing political scene. He proposed the League as the hard core of an electoral alliance to fight the progressive one formed to good effect at the local level by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) to contest the municipal elections of November 21 and December 6. 'In Mr Bossi's speech (to the congress), I found significant overtures towards the idea of a broad liberal-democrat alliance,' Mr Berlusconi was quoted as saying. 'I hope we can come close enough to form a coalition capable of representing a majority in the country and blocking the PDS's conquest of power.' Mr Berlusconi's supporters indicated the League's federalist ideas were a potential source of friction. The League congress called for reform of Italy's constitution to introduce a federal structure dividing Italy into three - Padania (north of the river Po), Etrurira (the centre) and the south. More importantly Mr Berlusconi could put his TV network licence agreements at risk by active involvement in politics. In the past three weeks he has used his networks, which control more than 80 per cent of Italy's commercial TV, for self-promotion that goes against the spirit of the licences. Mr Berlusconi's political judgment has already been exposed with his under-estimation of the consequences of associating himself last month with Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist MSI.</p>

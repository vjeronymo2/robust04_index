The Department recognizes that the values used in resource planning processes are not actually ``paid'' by either consumers or utilities. However, the use of these values appears to be directly analogous to that contemplated by the Department in the setting of appliance standards. As noted above, only seven states applied monetary externality values as of July 1993. Other jurisdictions applied qualitative externality values or no such values at all. If externality values used by state regulators were to be considered as an expression of willingness-to-pay, the Department would need to develop a national average measure that fairly characterizes a widely disparate set of policies across the fifty states. The Department now believes that any such average should reflect differences in the size of residential electricity markets across states. We solicit comment and suggestions regarding how averaging across different policy types could be implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue related to the possible use of externality values from the resource planning process is that some states have applied them in a manner that allows for the application of offsets for some or all pollutants. With offsets, sources can reduce the quantity of emissions to which externality values are applied by securing cost-effective emissions reductions (or emissions sequestration), often at a cost that is far below the official externality value. In such cases, the product of actual emissions and the official externality value would significantly overstate the ``effective'' externality adjustment actually used in the planning process. The Department is considering how, if at all, offset policies in the application of ``official'' externality values in the resource planning process bear on the relevance of these values to the setting of appliance standards, where offset opportunities would not be available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issue 6: The role of damage assessments implicit in official decisions, such as the setting of ambient air quality standards on damage estimates used in the appliance standards analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal agencies have the statutory responsibility to establish standards that reflect their assessment of damages from environmental externalities. For example, EPA is required to set primary ambient air quality standards at levels that protect the public health, including the health of sensitive populations, with an adequate margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the one hand, the Department could rely on existing standards in determining that emissions that do not contribute to a standards violation do not impact human health in any way. Such reliance would not, of course, preclude the finding of other types of environmental externalities, such as ecosystem or crop damages, for emissions that do not contribute to standards violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, the Department, recognizing that appliance standards promulgated today will have their primary effect five to ten years into the future, and that processes for setting environmental standards often engender significant lags, might wish to consider studies pointing to adverse health effects at concentrations below currently applicable standards in assessing health damages. How the Department could decide which evidence is credible and relevant without duplicating the review process for setting environmental standards, which is clearly infeasible in terms of resource requirements, is an open issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Utility Pricing and Incremental Externality Values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 7: The impact of the utility sector pricing practices on the use of externality adders in the appliance standards analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State utility regulatory commissions, motivated by the historical natural monopoly features of electric and natural gas production, transportation, and distribution systems (although production systems are now increasingly seen as allowing for competition), generally set regulated prices for electricity based on embedded rather than marginal cost. Based on its present understanding, the Department believes that the relationship between price and marginal cost can have a major bearing on the application of externality values in setting appliance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some background is helpful. In the absence of externalities, the theoretical economic conditions for social welfare maximization are met when price equals marginal cost (a pricing condition enforced by competition in perfectly competitive industries) and each consumer sets demand to equate this marginal cost with his/her own marginal private benefit (or marginal utility). With externalities, this private market solution diverges from the necessary conditions for a social optimum because external costs imposed on others are not reflected in decision-making. An appropriate externality tax or adder can move private decision-making towards the social optimum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within this context, consideration of the effects of a gap between price and marginal cost on the size of incremental externality values is straightforward. Suppose, for example, that the price charged to end-users exceeds the marginal private cost of producing and delivering electricity (or natural gas) to them. Then, in terms of private decision-making, the positive gap by which price exceeds marginal cost would have the same effect as a tax in reducing electricity consumption (and, implicitly, the emissions and the environmental externalities associated with production to meet incremental demand).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe yesterday held political meetings with Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, President  'Ezer Weizman, and Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu. In his  meetings with the Israeli leaders, Juppe expressed France's  intention to strengthen bilateral relations and also discussed  the peace process. [passage omitted]    Juppe stressed in his meeting with Rabin the tightening of  defense ties between the two countries. He said that the visit  by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard next month "would  spur cooperation in the fields of research, development, and  technology. There are many contingency plans, and the time has  come to look to air them out, and begin to consider their  implementation." Prior to Leotard's visit, the director of  France's defense procurement agency (DGA) will arrive in Israel.    Peres, who fathered the defense ties with France when they  peaked in the '50's, welcomed France's intention to renew the  security dialogue "which was severed for many years." Juppe  also expressed support for setting up a political-strategic  dialogue in joint Foreign Ministry working groups. [passage  omitted]    Peres told his guest that Israel will not compromise in the  talks with the Palestinians on issues linked to the security of  its citizens, and that the latest terrorist acts only sharpen  the need to be more careful about the security aspects of the  agreement. Referring to the Syrian track, Peres said that he  returned less optimistic from his trip to the United States.  "It is our feeling that the Syrian president did not hand down  new guidelines to the head of his delegation to the Washington  talks," Peres said.    Juppe agreed with Peres that the Syrians need to make more  progress in the negotiations. He said that France's message to  his Arab interlocutors is clear: encourage progress in the  negotiations. "France is leading the efforts to expand economic  aid to the territories and the entire region," Juppe said, and  stressed that his country attaches a great deal of importance to  the multilateral track and will continue to play a leading role  there. Peres expressed satisfaction with the French  contribution to the multilaterals and said that the private  sector must be encouraged to join the inter-government activity.  [passage omitted]    [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 15 February in a page 2 report  by Moti Bassok, Dan Avidan, and Mikhal Sela' adds that "Juppe  yesterday noted that France expanded its financial aid to the  Palestinians. The scope of the permanent aid via the EC is 20  percent of the EC's total aid to the Palestinians. In addition,  France helps public institutions and volunteer organizations.  Last year total direct French aid to the Palestinians reached  12 million francs, or $ 2.5 million. France last year also  handed out 18 million francs to the UN Relief and Works Agency.]</p>

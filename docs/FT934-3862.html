			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Disposal losses hit Dobson Park Losses on the disposal of businesses cut pre-tax profits at Dobson Park Industries, the mining equipment and industrial electronics group, from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.2m in the year to October 2. The group, which merged its mining equipment arm with a rival to survive the UK coal crisis, said it remained positive about the medium to long-term future of the business. Mr Alan Kaye, executive chairman, said that 'In the light of difficult trading conditions and the collapse in the scale of British Coal's activity, a satisfactory performance has been achieved overall.' Operating income fell from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 8.75m. Under FRS 3, the pre-tax profits were reduced by a charge of Pounds 4.6m on the sale of two businesses, Power Tools and Revere Aerospace, which included Pounds 1.5m of previously written off goodwill. From January, Dobson Park combined its mining equipment division with Meco International, a 1989 buy-out from the division of Dowty Group, in a joint venture called Longwall International. In the period to October 2, it made sales of Pounds 169m, just under 20 per cent of which went overseas. Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supplied all of British Coal's hydraulic roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry coal away from the face. Profits from mining equipment comprised Pounds 1.15m from the group's own activities prior to the merger and Pounds 3.33m from its 50 per share in Longwall. The group has since lifted its stake in Longwall to 59 per cent. Markets in the industrial electronics division continued to be tough, with operating profits down from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.9m. However, Mr Kaye said the sale of Revere Aerospace and Power Tools had removed businesses which had become peripheral to the group's strategy. Two recent acquisitions, PressTech Controls - which makes colour register controls for the printing industry - and TEC vibration monitoring equipment, would further strengthen the division. Earnings per share fell from 5.52p to 1.42p under FRS 3, and to 4.65p before the exceptional disposal costs. The final dividend of 2.55p (3.85p) is cut in line with the interim to give a total of 3.75p (5.75p), a reduction of 35 per cent. COMMENT These are respectable figures, given the speed of the demise of British Coal. As well as cutting costs at the Longwall joint venture, Dobson Park has strengthened its underperforming electronics division by disposal and making potentially useful infill acquisitions. Given the strength of Longwall's position in overseas markets, the group should benefit from its reduced cost base next year. The shares, down 4p to 85p, are on a prospective multiple of 15.8. They are unlikely to advance much until the electronics division performs better, but they are underpinned at current levels by a premium prospective yield of 6 per cent.</p>

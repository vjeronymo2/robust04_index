			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Japan rebels admit to higher earnings THE rebels who brought down Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party are either more honest or better investors than than their political peers. They admitted yesterday to earning almost 50 per cent more than the party average last year when Japanese MPs disclosed their incomes for the first time. The 44 pro-reform rebels, who formed the Japan Renewal Party, are apparently better cushioned for the tough limits on political donations that would be part of their reform package. The JRP members admitted to earning an average Y50.4m (Dollars 471,000) last year, well above the all party average of Y30.9m and the Y34.8m of their former LDP colleagues. Japanese politicians receive an annual allowance of Y20.6m, and the extra money comes from interest, dividends, corporate retainers or asset sales. But the figures announced yesterday do not include funds that publicity-shy politicians have channelled through private companies, relatives or even their young children. There are at least 81 Japanese politicians who have confessed to being poor managers of their funds - they claim that the only income received last year was the Y20.6m in parliamentary pay, and not a yen more in dividends, interest received or appearance fees. The figures prompted JRP members to explain that the difference in their earnings was a measure of their honesty, but the large gap was an embarrassment. Japan Communist party members were at the bottom of the pile, claiming that their average income was Y21.4m, while the socialist party members were better heeled at Y24.1m Members of most parties were still nervous yesterday that Japanese prosecutors would strike again before a general election on July 18, and were also concerned that the construction industry has been frightened away from political donations. The prosecutors arrested a well-known regional mayor on Tuesday for allegedly taking bribes from construction companies. Prosecutors said executives from four leading construction companies admitted to giving Y100m to the mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, but denied that the money was a bribe. Among the officials in custody is a vice-president from Shimizu, the largest general contractor, whose president, Mr Harusuke Imamura, resigned yesterday from a post at the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations. Mr Imamura had been chairman of a committee on decentralisation, and apparently tendered his resignation as a mark of shame at his company's implication in the scandal. The Keidanren, the country's most important business organisation, immediately accepted the resignation. The construction ministry said the four companies, Hazama, Nishimatsu Construction, Mitsui Construction, and Shimizu, will be forbidden from tendering for ministry-controlled contracts for between two and four months, while 20 local governments have also imposed bans on the companies. Prosecutors say the four companies provided funds to Mayor Ishii in an attempt to break into the public works market in northern Japan.</p>

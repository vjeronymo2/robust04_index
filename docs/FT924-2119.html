			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Anti-cartel penalties tightened by Tokyo THE Japanese government has toughened the criminal penalties for the formation of cartels, following pressure from the US and recommendations from the Fair Trade Commission, the country's anti-monopoly body. Meanwhile, a separate advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) yesterday recommended that the government increase protection for intellectual property rights by toughening fines and redefining products eligible for protection. Japanese anti-monopoly legislation had made no distinction between a cartel violation by an individual and a company, and had kept fines for the two at the same level. But an amendment to the legislation provides for a distinction and for far tougher penalties on companies. Under the new legislation, Japanese companies violating the criminal provisions of the law will be subject to a maximum fine of Y100m (Pounds 526,000), up from Y5m. The changes follow demands made by the US government at the bilateral Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Japanese to open machine tool plant A NEW Japanese assault on an important sector of the European machinery market is officially launched tomorrow from the unlikely venue of a refurbished factory in Salisbury. Within sight of the cathedral spire, Kitagawa, the world's largest producer of power chucks for machine tools, has joined forces with Mr Tertius Threipland, a British entrepreneur, to begin manufacturing chucks in Europe for the first time. The move could increase the competitive pressures on the five big European producers, of which the 600 Group's Pratt Burnerd is the best known in the UK. Many producers have been hit badly by recession. Mr Threipland is chairman and managing director of Kitagawa Europe, a partnership with the Japanese parent company, which for 10 years has been distributing Kitagawa products into European markets. The partners are switching to manufacturing in Europe because of long-term growth prospects and, said Mr Threipland, because the 1992 single market reforms might make it difficult to import chucks from Japan. He said: 'We hope we will now be more acceptable in Germany, which has been the most nationalistic about machinery and accessories, particularly on conspicuous products like chucks.' Mr Threipland, who for years has wanted to own a UK chuck manufacturer, admitted: 'We had to fight quite hard to convince the Japanese to choose the UK rather than Belgium and Germany.' The UK was chosen because of labour costs, availability of technology and skills, and the fact that the European sales headquarters was already in Salisbury. The factory is one of the few opened recently in Europe in the machine tool sector. In spite of the recession in the UK, Mr Threipland hopes it will be running at two-thirds capacity by early autumn, producing 200 chucks a month  -of which 70 per cent will be for export. The factory now employs six people, but as the product range is expanded in the next five years the workforce should reach 40 to 45. The total investment is expected to reach Pounds 5m by then. Japanese companies rarely enter manufacturing joint ventures with individual entrepreneurs overseas, although associations are more common between the big Japanese trading houses and foreigners. There will be no Japanese-style company anthems, but Mr Threipland did have the builders and decorators working at Japanese speeds over Christmas to get the factory ready. It was completed on New Year's Day.</p>

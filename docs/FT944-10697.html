			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries higher after strong auction US Treasury prices edged higher yesterday after a relatively strong auction of three-year notes demonstrated solid demand for new paper. Activity was moderate as traders awaited news on US elections and a producer price report due on Thursday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  7/16 at 93 1/16 yielding 8.114 per cent and the two-year note up  1/16 at 99 23/32 , to yield 7.011 per cent. Early in the day prices were steady on trader fears of low demand for the medium-term notes, but by midday prices had climbed moderately as sentiment turned positive ahead of the 1pm auction. Analysts expect a 0.1 per cent rise in the producer price index for October. A bigger increase could trigger fears of a large or early interest rate increase by the Fed. The markets watched for election news but with little consensus on their impact. Mr Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities in New York, said markets could be buoyed if Republicans make significant gains in both houses of the legislature. Also overshadowing markets was the increase in interest rates widely expected from next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. European government bonds ended another calm session slightly firmer, supported by buoyant German bunds and firmer US Treasuries. However, volume has dwindled sharply and traders said investor flows were few and far between. 'A lot of people have in effect shut their books for the year,' said one analyst. German bunds recouped early losses to end nearly  1/2 point higher, underpinned by firm demand for the first tranche of the government's latest 10-year issue. Although demand for the paper was said to be subdued, dealers reported keen interest from several banks, some of which were buying bonds to cover short positions they had established prior to the sale. The Bundesbank allotted DM3bn of the 7.5 per cent paper to the federal bond consortium at 99.75, yielding 7.54 per cent. A further DM3bn to DM4bn of the bonds are expected to be sold at today's auction; together with the Bundesbank's market tending allotment, the issue is expected to total DM10bn. Earlier in the day, bunds were depressed by news of a larger than expected drop in the October jobless rate, but shrugged off a small upward revision in the September M3 money supply growth rate. The December bund future on DTB closed at 89.41, up 0.41. UK gilts rose on the back of firmer European and US bonds, with little in the way of news or capital flows to drive prices. 'Until the FOMC meeting (on November 15), it's likely to remain pretty trendless,' said one dealer. After that, market participants will turn their attention to the Budget on November 29. 'We often have a slight bull run up to the Budget because everyone hopes they'll do the right thing,' he added. The December long gilt futures contract rose by  13/32 to 101 3/32 . Swedish bonds clawed back some of their recent sharp losses, with the yield on the 11-year benchmark falling by 8 basis points to 11.57 per cent. However, the market is likely to remain jittery and volatile ahead of Sunday's referendum on European Union membership.</p>

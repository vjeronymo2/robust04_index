			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nick Nuttall report: "Cash Cut Forces Britain To Abandon </F> Space Project"]    [Text] Budget cutbacks have forced Britain to pull out of  a European venture to develop a 21st-century space plane. The  country's most celebrated rocket designer is so angry and  disillusioned that he is poised to take his expertise overseas.    Alan Bond, the inventor of the revolutionary air breathing  engines for Hotol (Horizontal Take Off and Landing), Britain's  first -- abandoned -- space plane project, has been struggling  for three years to raise the cash needed to develop a new plane,  Skylon. He had pinned his hopes on Britain's participation in a  European programme named FESTIP (Future European Space  Transportation Investigations Programme).    FESTIP is to review the technology for space launchers and,  in about two years, recommend which should be developed for the  21st century.    Skylon would take off and land on a runway. Its new Sabre  engines are designed to work in air and space and to cut the  trip from London to Sydney to an hour.    But spending cuts by the Department of Trade and Industry  have left Britain's dwindling space budget too small to join  Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Spain in FESTIP, it was  disclosed yesterday. A spokesman for the British National Space  Centre in London said the overall budget to the European Space  Agency [ESA] had been cut from 124 million pounds to 114 million  pounds. "The space budget is already committed so we would be  looking at an extra spend which we are not going to get."    Germany, which has a space plane design called Sanger, has  put up 8 million pounds despite budgetary pressures.    Mr Bond, whose attempts to develop the engines for British  Aerospace's [BAe] Hotol space plane were frustrated when the  Ministry of Defence classified the patents, said yesterday that  the Government was yet again throwing away a world lead in  technology. "It is a disaster. Among the whole of Europe we are  the only country without a space plane programme and we bloody  well started it all," he said.    Private financiers in Britain had told him that without  government backing they were not prepared to fund the  development of Skylon. Mr Bond, 49, said he was now planning to  go overseas with Reaction Engines, the company he founded with  two former members of the Hotol team. Among those showing  interest were the Japanese.    Mr Bond, whose firm is based at Stanford in the Vale,  Oxfordshire, said: "We, including British Aerospace, have a  technological lead, but the head of the British National Space  Centre and ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry  simply do not care."    He said British Aerospace Space Systems in Stevenage,  Hertfordshire, which had also hoped to join the ESA programme  with a revised version of Hotol, had spent millions of pounds of  its own and taxpayers' money.    Paul Down, business development director at BAe, said  yesterday: "We have gathered a vast amount of expertise working  with Rolls-Royce and Alan Bond and we have been working with the  Russians and Deutsche Aerospace.... We will be distressed  beyond measure if we are not able to play our part."    Derek Davis, director general of the British National Space  Centre, said yesterday: "My heart goes out to Mr Bond...we are  trying to find ways which would allow these companies to get  involved."    Britain's participation in FESTIP seemed assured last year,  30 years after it pulled out of the Blue Streak project.    Edward Leigh, the former industry minister responsible for  space, believed Britain could not be left behind. About 3  million pounds over three years was believed to be enough to  assure British entry into FESTIP and the involvement of Skylon  and the revised Hotol.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Hard left unlikely to enter race The Campaign Group of leftwing Labour MPs is expected to reject calls to enter a candidate in the battle to succeed John Smith as party leader. The 34-strong group will decide tomorrow whether to nominate a candidate to carry the hard-left banner or to throw its weight behind one of three mainstream left candidates. Leading members say the group was chastened by its experiences in the 1992 election, when it endorsed Mr Ken Livingstone for leader and Mr Bernie Grant for deputy leader. Both failed to muster sufficient nominations from MPs to get on to the ballot, forcing members to switch their support to soft-left candidates. This time the group has a choice of three potential mainstream left candidates: Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman, and Mr Robin Cook, trade and industry spokesman. Leading members said that there would be substantial support for Mrs Beckett, who won the deputy leadership on a joint left-right ticket with Mr Smith and is widely regarded to have performed capably. Mrs Beckett is thought unlikely to run for the leadership because of her lack of support on the centre and right of the parliamentary party, and her low profile among constituency and trade union activists. Mr Prescott has substantial support on the left, but is regarded with suspicion by many Campaign members because of his strong support for changes in Labour's rules which reduced the influence of trade unions. Mr Cook is also tainted in the eyes of many leftwingers because of his support for the purge of extremists carried out in the mid and late 1980s by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader. However, Campaign Group opinion is believed to be gathering behind Mr Cook because of his formidable reputation in the Commons and his close links with the unions. Support for Mr Cook is also strengthening among soft-left MPs concerned about the pace of the bandwagon forming for Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, whose power base is on the right of the party. Many would prefer to support Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, but fear that Mr Blair will emerge as the unstoppable sole candidate of the centre-right.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA recognizes that all shellfish-producing States have laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that require the tagging of shellfish. This proposal is intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support those laws, not supersede them. The proposed tagging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that untagged shellfish come from safe waters. Illegal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvesting of molluscan shellfish from contaminated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unclassified waters is known to occur (Ref. 7, p. 331). It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also known that illegally harvested shellfish find their way into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial channels. States and FDA find untagged or improperly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tagged shellfish during their inspections of shellfish processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the cooperative program (Refs. 101 through 109). FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently lacks a basis for taking action against untagged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish (Ref. 110). Proposed &sect;1240.60 will provide a basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, State tagging requirements and sanctions are not uniform,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the sanctions provided under some State laws have little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterrent effect (Refs. 102, 103, and 109). The establishment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Federal sanction will provide illegal harvesters with sure knowledge that if their catch enters interstate commerce and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comes to the attention of FDA, it will be destroyed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If &sect;1240.60(b) is adopted, as a practical matter, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification will begin at the harvesting site. FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 to require that the first handler of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> live molluscan shellfish, be it the licensed harvester, licensed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquaculturist, or certified shellfish shipper, affix a tag to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each container of shellfish. The tag will then provide the means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for processors to ensure that the shellfish that they buy is from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly classified water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the tag will provide all information that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to trace the product to its source, e.g., date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest, location of harvest, quantity and type of shellfish, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvester's name and identification number assigned by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish control authority. The product traceability that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results will enhance epidemiological investigations in the event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of shellfish-borne illness. It will also facilitate prompt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedial actions necessary to reestablish public health controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The safety concerns about shucked molluscan shellfish are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially the same as those discussed above for in-shell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molluscan shellfish. Because shucked shellfish are packaged in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container that can be labeled, the agency is proposing to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;1240.60(c) that for these shellfish, a label may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substituted that bears information equivalent to that found on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tag. Another reason for allowing labeling in lieu of a tag  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the fact that one bag of unshucked molluscan shellfish bearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single tag can typically be processed into more than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container of shucked molluscan shellfish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second measure that FDA is proposing is based on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience with the NSSP and the ISSC. FDA has tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the system for protecting the safety of shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be significantly strengthened if the agency were to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that certain limited steps be taken as part of the processing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish that are intended for interstate commerce. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that these measures, like the proposed tagging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, will serve to strengthen the Federal-State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperative program as well as the shellfish safety programs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the States and countries that participate in NSSP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the pathogens in shellfish, such as the Norwalk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virus, are virtually undetectable. Moreover, from a technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and practical perspective, end product testing cannot be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing of shellfish to ensure that they are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with one of the myriad of possible domestic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial, and agricultural contaminants that have been found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish harvesting areas. Therefore, State classification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing waters is a necessary first step to ensure the safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish. These classifications, as detailed in NSSP, address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all actual and potential pollutants in deciding whether an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is suitable for harvesting (Ref. 90, pp. c&hyph;5 and c&hyph;6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing in &sect;123.28(a) that each processor of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish have an HACCP plan that ensures that the molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish that it processes come only from areas that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified by a shellfish control authority as satisfactory for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvesting. As noted above, the safety of molluscan shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumed raw or partly cooked is predicated on the cleanliness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the growing area waters from which they are obtained. Ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that shellfish come from properly classified growing areas is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where shellfish safety begins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;123.28(b), processors are to process only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish that originate from growing waters that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved for harvesting by a shellfish control authority as shown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by product tags or labels with specific information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes that they were harvested from appropriate waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing this requirement under both section 361 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHS Act, to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 402(a)(1), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the act to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the food does not contain any added substances that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> render it injurious to health and is not prepared, packed, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held under insanitary conditions whereby it may be rendered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injurious to health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This paragraph (3) does not apply to aerosol coating products that are sold, supplied, or offered for sale by any person to retail outlets in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section prohibiting the application of aerosol coating products containing volatile organic compounds in excess of the limits specified in the Table of Standards shall not apply to any noncommercial application of aerosol coating products purchased prior to June 30, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Administrative requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Most restrictive limit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If anywhere on the container of any aerosol coating product listed in the Table of Standards, or on any sticker or label affixed thereto, or in any sales or advertising literature, any representation is made that the product may be used as, or is suitable for use as a product for which a lower VOC standard is specified, then the lowest applicable VOC standard shall apply. However, notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if an aerosol coating product is subject to both a general coating limit and a specialty coating limit, as listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the product meets all the criteria of the applicable specialty coating category as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then the specialty coating limit shall take precedence over the general coating limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Labeling Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each manufacturer of an aerosol coating product subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall clearly display the following information on each product manufactured 90 days or more after the effective date of this article:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The maximum VOC content of the product as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, expressed as a percentage by weight;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The aerosol coating category as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or an abbreviation of the coating category; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The day, month, and year on which the product was manufactured, or a code indicating such date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a manufacturer uses a code indicating the date of manufacture or an abbreviation of the coating category as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, on any aerosol coating product subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an explanation of the code or abbreviation must be filed with USEPA prior to the use of the code or abbreviation. The VOC content displayed may be calculated using product formulation data, or may be determined using the test method specified in paragraph (f) of this section.

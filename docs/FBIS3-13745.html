This was stated by Foreign Secretary  Shaharyar Khan while addressing a function in Lahore last night.  He categorically stated that Pakistan has not withdrawn its  resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human Rights Commission and  has agreed only to defer the voting on the resolution, which is  still effective and can be taken up at any time.    Appreciating the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO's]  support on the Kashmir issue, the foreign secretary said the ICO  has unanimously approved resolutions on Kashmir five times in  the past. These resolutions have greatly helped to generate  sympathies for the Kashmiri people, who are waging a struggle to  achieve their right of self-determination.    Shaharyar Khan said India cannot renege on its promise to  allow a visit of a mission comprised of envoys from Islamic  countries to assess the repression committed in occupied  Kashmir. He disclosed that Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's special emissary is arriving in Islamabad  today to discuss this particular issue. He said India's  acceptance of this proposal is on record.</p>

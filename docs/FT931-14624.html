			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Swiss join telecom partnership Swiss PTT Telecom is to become a full equity partner in a recently-established joint venture between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands and Televerket of Sweden which provides data transmission services to European-based multinational companies, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. The Swiss will own a third of Unisource, the joint venture company, as will PTT Telecom and Televerket, which launched the company as a 50/50 partnership in June. By joining forces in Unisource, the three national telecommunication companies aim to compete as equals with Eunetcom, a joint venture between Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telecom and France Telecom, as well as with British Telecom's Syncordia operation. In June, Unisource signed up Sprint, the US telecommunications carrier, to provide global links outside Europe for its customers. Unisource is also looking for a carrier partner in south-east Asia.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scotland's salmon farmers lift output 25% THE SCOTTISH salmon farming industry, which last year suffered from low prices and experienced several bankruptcies, increased its output during the year by 25 per cent to 40,600 tonnes of salmon. However production this year is expected to be static or decline by up to 7 per cent. The scale of the production increase, revealed by the Scottish Office, surprised farmers gathered in Glasgow for the annual Scottish fish farm conference and exhibition. The salmon farmers were also digesting last week's announcement by Unilever, the UK-Dutch food and consumer products group, that it wants to sell its subsidiary Marine Harvest, the largest salmon producer in Scotland, accounting for nearly a quarter of production. Salmon prices were low last year mainly because of over-production and dumping in the EC market by Norway, which produces four times as much as Scotland. Because salmon farming operates with a three-year production cycle, farmers cannot adjust production to market conditions. Last November the EC imposed a minimum price on imports from Norway, and Norway took steps to reduce its surplus. Aquastar, a seafood subsidiary of British Petroleum, agreed to dispose of 32,000 tonnes of frozen salmon in markets outside the EC, Japan and the US. With both Norway and Scotland reducing the number of smolts (young salmon) being transferred to cages in the sea for maturing, salmon prices are expected to recover over the next year. Mr Donald MacRae of TSB Bank Scotland told the conference that whereas in 1991 world supply of farmed salmon had outrun demand by 44,000 tonnes, this year there would be a shortfall of 13,000 tonnes, rising to 64,000 tonnes by 1995. The announcement of the sale of Marine Harvest surprised many people in the Scottish fish farming industry. The company was a pioneer of salmon farming in Scotland and Unilever's decision to pull out made some farmers question whether the industry had a good long-term future. Mr David McCarthy, Marine Harvest's chairman, said that Unilever was selling the company along with other agribusiness interests to concentrate on core activities. Marine Harvest lost Pounds 15m in 1990 but its financial performance improved sharply last year with lower fish mortality and improved environmental management.</p>

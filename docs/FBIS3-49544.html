			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Ladislav </F> Zak; place and date not given: "Fear of Russia"]    [Text] [Zak] Do you believe that the situation in Russia  represents a certain danger for our region? Are there any  concerns about developments there?    [Zieleniec] Of course there exist concerns about  developments  in Russia or, to be precise, in the entire territory of the  former USSR, and not only in our region. They are shared with us  by all of Europe, indeed by the entire world. Let us realize  that it is a power armed with a nuclear arsenal, a state in  which new democratic arrangements are being introduced only with  difficulties. There are no democratic traditions in Russia.  Traditions are very important phenomena. Russia is struggling  against tremendous internal problems, the problems of the  minorities within the country, and the large number of Russian  minorities outside its territory. This country has experienced  70 years of communism, and we, who lived under it for 40 years,  know what a tremendous burden it is, how difficult it is to  implement reforms, from economic to legal ones. For a long time  to come, developments in Russia will continue to be a source of  uncertainty on the one hand, and a subject of interest and  desire for stabilization on the other--not only to us but to the  entire world.    [Zak] To what degree can Russia's taking exception to NATO's  eastward expansion affect the decisionmaking of the West on this  matter?    [Zieleniec] We should consider these matters with some  restraint because of the present postelectoral situation in  Russia. Regarding the alliance associations of the Czech  Republic, we should clearly define our goal and go directly  after it. After all, it is not possible to indefinitely prolong  a situation where countries that have always been part of  European history--such as our republic--are to live on the side  of the, albeit collapsed but still existent, curtain drawn by  Stalin. Therefore, I believe that our integration into the  family of West European countries, including institutional  integration--that is, also into NATO--is unavoidable. In the  long term, any endeavors to derive a solution for European  stability solely from developments in Russia will prove wrong.  Developments in Russia will certainly be very complex and  dynamic, and our integration is a matter so incontestable that  it has to happen sooner or later--including membership in the  relevant organizations.    [Zak] Would it not be more pragmatic in this situation to  coordinate our efforts with those of Poland, Hungary, and,  possibly, Slovakia?    [Zieleniec] I believe that this is the case. We have  identical interests and say similar things. It is a matter of  course.    [Zak] You mentioned the postelectoral situation in Russia.  Do  you believe that the "shriek" of the Russian side regarding the  expansion of NATO eastward has something precisely to do with  the internal political situation, or do the external power  interests of Russia still exist? Is there danger of this  situation coming to a head--that is, that we would play "second  fiddle" in talks that will take place mostly between NATO and  Russia--that is, "about us without us?"    [Zieleniec] Russia undoubtedly has its interests and  articulates them. The West must have its interests, too, and,  just the same, we have ours. I believe that, from this point of  view, the space in which we are located together with Poland,  Slovakia, and Hungary should be outside Russia's sphere of  operations--and clearly within the West's sphere of influence.  It is apparent that there are attempts to cooperate with Russia  and that they are appropriate. There is no point, and it would  not be in anyone's interest, in starting new hostilities, when  they are not necessary. This does not necessarily imply anything  about the future shape of West Europe or its institutional  umbrella. The attempts on the part of NATO to get along with  Russia certainly do not banish us from Europe.    [Zak] What is the concept of our foreign policy eastward  with  respect to the present situation in Russia?    [Zieleniec] Developments in Russia following the elections  remain for us a great unknown. Nevertheless, our policy from  this vantage point is clear. The territory of the former USSR,  and Russia in particular, is for us a country of traditional  contacts and business interests, and we are trying to be very  active in this type of cooperation. On the other hand, we always  emphasize that these relations must be based on equality, and  our political orientation, our orientation in terms of future  integration, is tied to the fate of West Europe. Nevertheless, I  would like to point out that general laws of geometry cannot be  applied in politics: If you turn to face someone, it does not  mean that you are turning your back on someone else. It simply  is not so.    [Zak] Could you comment on the statements by some Russian  politicians that, if a NATO expansion eastward occurs, we will  automatically become the target of Russian nuclear weapons?    [Zieleniec] Nowadays, nuclear arms are pointed at all kinds  of targets; it is simply two sides of the same coin. If,  however, we want to participate in the protection of the values  of democracy, individual freedom, and a prosperous market  economy, we have to expect that someone will not like it.  Nevertheless, I do not see any reason why a willingness to  protect these values evokes in Russia contemplation about arms.    [Zak] What about the statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev about  the isolation of Russia and concerns of the so-called ordinary  Russian citizens about the possible expansion of NATO? Do you  not feel as if this originated in the vocabulary of the old-time  communist ideologists?    [Zieleniec] I do not know. Russia has always thought very  geopolitically. The problem of isolation is well known in Russia  because it has been discussed there probably throughout the  entire existence of that country. Developments in Russia have  always coincided with the clash of two trends--a pro-Western one  and a national one leading to closing oneself. There is nothing  left but to wish for ourselves and Russia that democracy  prevails and that cooperation among all of the countries of  Europe, including Russia, be as close as possible.    [Zak] Let us look even more closely toward our borders--at  Ukraine. Although it has ratified the START 1 Treaty on the  nonproliferation of nuclear arms, the overall outcome is rather  awkward. Is there also a threat from the Ukrainian side?    [Zieleniec] No. Ukraine's problems are more or less  eastern-oriented. They are the problems of a new state that has  emerged from the womb of the USSR. I believe that this has more  to do with the general nonproliferation of nuclear arms than a  real threat to our region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Party of the Democratic Left Does Not </F> Interfere in Disputes Within the Social Democratic Party in  Slovakia; There Has Never Been Talk of Merger"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]  approaches the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS] with  respect, treating it as a partner party. It has never had the  ambition to interfere in its internal affairs. This was stated  by SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik in response to the  statement issued by SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby. Ftacnik  said that there did not exist a single SDL document or working  paper that would talk about a merger with the SDSS.    On the other hand, in the document entitled "Draft Concept  of  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Course of Action  in the Preelection Period in the Foreign Policy Sphere," it is  stated on page 7, under item 6.5: "Can a merger of the HZDS with  the Social Democratic Party be considered in the future?" SDSS  Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby should therefore turn his attention  in another direction, Milan Ftacnik noted.    The SDL statement goes on to say: "We know that the  left-wing  coalition of the SDL, the SDSS, the Farmers Movement, and the  Green Party in Slovakia [SZS] is a thorn in the flesh of certain  circles in the HZDS, which has found itself in international  political isolation and remains without a clear-cut profile.  The question arises whether this voice from within the SDSS is  not all too reminiscent of the departure of a small group from  the SZS, which had also rejected a democratically drafted and  approved coalition agreement in the name of the preservation of  the party's authenticity and objections to the SDL and started  to establish a new party and simultaneously send out signals to  the HZDS.    The game of breaking up the [HZDS's] most serious political  and electoral competitor, the Left Choice coalition, apparently  continues. It bears testimony to the nervousness and lack of  self-confidence of those who organize it from behind the scenes.</p>

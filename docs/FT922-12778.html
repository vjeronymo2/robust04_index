			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Annual pay rises remain above 7% INCREASES IN pay are not falling as fast as employers and the government have been hoping, according to the latest figures from the Confederation of British Industry and the Department of Employment. The Department of Employment is expected tomorrow to announce a slight drop in the rise in underlying average earnings for February but this will not be enough to push the annualised figure beneath 7 per cent. Average earnings rising at more than 3 percentage points above inflation will be a disappointment to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, who is also expected to announce a further large increase in unemployment tomorrow. She will take some comfort from the fact that the latest Manpower survey of employment prospects shows a post-election surge in optimism. There are also some positive signals in the latest Confederation of British Industry pay databank figures, which show an increase in manufacturing pay freezes in the first quarter to one in six of all settlements. However, according to the CBI, average settlements in manufacturing have risen slightly in the first quarter to 4.3 per cent compared with 4.2 per cent in the last quarter of last year. Productivity growth has fallen to 3.8 per cent from 5 per cent in the last quarter of 1991. Unit labour costs in manufacturing are rising at about 4.7 per cent, which the CBI says is in line with Japan and Germany. Settlements in the service sector were averaging 6 per cent in the second half of last year, down from 7.1 per cent in the first half. The government's average earnings index is slower to reflect the recession and falling inflation because it takes into account all pay decisions over the past 12 months. But some analysts have been waiting since the summer for the annualised average earnings figure to fall beneath 7 per cent for the first time since the mid-1960s. The pay of company executives continues to rise slightly faster than that of other employees but the gap appears to be narrowing, according to the latest survey by the business information group Noble Lowndes.

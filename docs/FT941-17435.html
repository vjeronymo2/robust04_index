			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Golds were softer in Johannesburg in response to a generally lacklustre bullion price, but industrials pushed higher in generally quiet conditions as the earlier dampening effects of the strong financial rand disappeared. The golds index dipped 10 to 2,154, industrials added 23 at 5,596 and the overall index put on 16 at 4,909. Anglos rose R2.50 to R223, Barlows collected 75 cents at R55.50 and Iscor firmed 3 cents to R2.47. Dries was R1.25 lower at R55.25.</p>

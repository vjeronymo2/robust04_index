			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Kim Boldokhonov] </F>   [Text) Ulaanbaatar, 28 Apr -- Setting foot on Mongolian  ground, I express deep respect for the friendly people of  Mongolia, Li Peng stated today at Bayant-Uhaa airport. The  premier of the PRC State Council has arrived in Ulaan Baatar on  an official visit at the invitation of Puntsaqiyn Jasray, head  of the Mongolian Government.    Over the last two years China and Mongolia have been  actively  developing friendly relations and cooperation which corresponds  not only to the national interests of each country, but also  assists in strengthening peace and stability in the Asian  Pacific ocean region, the welcoming message notes.    During the visit, talks are to take place between the head  of  the Chinese Government and Puntsaqiyn Jasray, there are to be  meetings with Natsaqiyn Bagabandi, chairman of the Great Hural,  and with Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat.    At the outcome of the visit, a treaty is to be signed on  friendly relations and cooperation between Mongolia and China,  as well as a number of other bilateral documents.    The development of friendly relations with China has been  and  will be in the future one of the priorities in our country's  foreign policy, Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsaqiyn Jasray  stated today at a dinner in honor of Li Peng, the PRC State  Council premier, who has arrived in Ulaanbaatar on a visit. The  treaty on friendly relations and cooperation, which will be  signed tomorrow, the head of the Mongolian Government said,  "will open a fresh page in the history of our bilateral ties."    "We are certain that we have made the correct choice",  Jasray  emphasized, expressing gratitude to China for its support for  Mongolia in surmounting the difficulties of the transitional  period and its provision of interest-free credit and  humanitarian assistance.    Despite the fact that in the 45 years since diplomatic  relations were established, China and Mongolia have experienced  "zigzags" in their relations, Li Peng said, recent times have  been characterized by constant contacts between the leaders of  the two countries and an expansion of ties. The present level  of Chinese-Mongolian relations, he stressed, "has not been  easily achieved, and we shall guard and develop them." The  bilateral treaty, he said, will provide an impetus for further  development of cooperation and will open up yet broader  prospects for long-term joint actions.    The Chinese people, the PRC State Council premier said, is  speeding up the process of renewal and implementation of an open  economic policy, since a stably developing China contributes to  strengthening the cause of peace and Asia's prosperity.</p>

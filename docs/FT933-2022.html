			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Asda Property A SUBSTANTIAL cut in interest charges from Pounds 6.24m to Pounds 2.88m helped Asda Property Holdings to raise pre-tax profits by 61 per cent to Pounds 2.47m in the first half of 1993, against Pounds 1.53m last time. Earnings per share more than doubled to 2.6p (1.1p), while the interim dividend has been stepped up from 0.65p to 0.7p on capital increased by July's Pounds 16.3m rights issue. Mr Manny Davidson, chairman, said that acquisitions of high-yielding commercial property over the past two years had to date only partially utilised the proceeds from the sale of residential and other low-yielding assets. Turnover fell from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 11.2m; rental income came to Pounds 5.82m (Pounds 7.12m) and should improve in the second half as the full contribution from the recent acquisition to the company's investment portfolio began to flow through, Mr Davidson said. The company said it has bought 30 predominantly freehold, retail properties for Pounds 7.8m, the shops being located in various town centres including Aberdeen, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Salisbury and Shrewsbury. The portfolio currently produces an income of about Pounds 1m per annum.</p>

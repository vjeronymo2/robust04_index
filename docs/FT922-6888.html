			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / European corps units to remain separate FRANCE and Germany have agreed that their European defence corps, to be set up by President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl tomorrow, will consist of separate national units under a joint command. Germany has rejected a French proposal to assign troops fully to the corps in peacetime, insisting that they remain 'nationally assigned' just as they are in Nato, Bonn officials said yesterday. The corps is nonetheless seen as an important move in creating a European defence identity, within Nato and complementary to it, but also capable of being used in non-Nato operations within and outside the territory of the alliance. The corps will be set up 'in the perspective of European union', and put under the umbrella of the nine-nation Western European Union. It is clear, however, that the German troops in the corps may not be able to participate in all its potential operations because of the constitutional restriction on combat missions outside the Nato area. Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, believes it will be possible to agree on a change in the constitution allowing use of German troops in United Nations peace-keeping operations, without geographical restriction, by the end of the year. But he admits it could be 10 years before they take part in other activities. The Franco-German agreement provides for three precise uses of the corps: the common defence of the Nato allies, the maintenance and restoration of peace, and humanitarian missions. A planning staff will be set up in July, and the corps should come into existence in 1995, with a headquarters in Strasbourg. From the German point of view, a major benefit will be in bringing the French troops in the corps openly under the Nato umbrella for the defence of the allies. Europe's new muddle army, Page 20</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: Shaw and friends entertain in Ontario THE SHAW Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, began in 1962 in the Assembly Rooms of the Court House with eight week-end performances of Don Juan in Hell and Candida. Thirty-one years later it has three theatres and runs from April to November. The Festival's mandate is the plays of Bernard Shaw and his contemporaries, which is not as restrictive as may at first seem, since he was born in 1856 and did not die until 1950. The present season (artistic director: Christopher Newton) includes three Shaws; plays by Henry Arthur Jones, Harley Granville Barker, Carl Sternheim, Noel Coward; a Broadway musical; and a famous thriller. The major talking point has been Neil Munro's production of Saint Joan, designed by Cameron Porteus. The 100 Years War is brought into the 20th century with jets, jeeps, searchlights, automatic weapons and computers. Nobody wears medieval dress until the Epilogue. The ethnic cleansing prologue with its reference to Bosnia was unnecessary, the telephone conversations artificial, the paper-shredder distracting and I was irritated that so much dialogue was spoken behind Porteus's monolithic pillars. The scenes with the Dauphin do not work at all in modern dress. The Earl of Warwick pressing the Bishop of Beauvais to burn Joan should have worked: unfortunately, it is staged too far back, under the huge wing of an enormous bomber, and the argument plays a subordinate role to the sound of machine gun fire and bombs dropping. The trial, conducted by Barry MacGregor's excellent Inquisitor and acted with the houselights up, works. The proceedings become a committee hearing, with the court seated in front of microphones. Joan (Mary Haney) sits with her back to the audience, her weary, bewildered, intelligent face seen in huge close-up on the banked television monitors either side of the stage. Neil Munro also directs an elegiac production of Harley Granville Barker's The Marrying of Ann Leete, written in 1899 when he was 22, which has had only two productions in England. The subject matter is class distinction, politics, social rebellion and the role of women in society in the late 18th century. Ann (Ann Baggley), observing the unhappy marriage of her sister (Seanna McKenna, a beautiful performance), refuses to be a political pawn and proposes to the gardener. The fragmentary scenes and half-heard conversations in the garden at night are brilliantly orchestrated. The acting of the whole company is a joy and Yvonne Sauroil's garden, designed for the round, is charming. I had no idea how funny Carl Sternheim's The Unmentionables could be until I saw director Paul Lampert's very accessible update (written with Kate Sullivan) which transfers the satire at the expense of the petit bourgeoisie in Berlin in 1911 to suburban America in the 1950s. The action, directed at a fast pace, is punctuated by commercial jingles, which can be enjoyed either as social comment on consumerism or as nostalgia. A civil servant's wife's knickers fall down in the street during a civic parade. Shortly afterwards two men turn up seeking lodgings and her favours. The only person, however, to have any sex is the pragmatic husband (Norman Browning, hilarious), a belligerent philistine, who beds his wife's best friend. William Vickers as a hypochondriac barber and Peter Millard as a French diplomat are very funny as the lodgers. 'I am a church bell,' says the latter. 'My rope hangs limp. give it a tug.' Sauroil's set, all vinyl kitsch in ghastly yellows and pinks, matches the vulgarity of the action. It takes a sophisticated audience these days to accept so naive and working class an entertainment as Victorian melodrama. Henry Arthur Jones's The Silver King tells a sentimental story of crime, suffering, repentance and redemption. It is a measure of Christopher Newton's respect for the genre that the audience is not encourage to boo the villain (Barry MacGregor, first rate) nor cheer the hero (Stuart Hughes) until the final scene. Designer Leslie Franklish erects a vast scaffolding and the production draws on Dore, Frith, Dickens and images of the Industrial Revolution. Newton also gauges the comedy, farce and pathos of Shaw's Candida perfectly; but Noel Coward's Blythe Spirit needed a ghost less vulgar, more ethereal. The Festival has the excellent policy of putting on a Shavian one-acter at mid-day, an idea which out own National theatre might copy and extend to other playwrights. The jokes at the expense of English imperialism in The Man of Destiny go down extremely well with the Canadian/American audience. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the Jule Styne and Leo Robin musical, based on Anita Loos's best selling novel and Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None are aimed strictly at the tourist market (and why not?) and have been playing to full houses. The strength of the Shaw Festival is that it caters for both the serious theatregoer and the coach parties.</p>

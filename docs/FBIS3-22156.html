An electric fan will suck in polluted air from the road  level  through a two- to three-meter-wide vent, which leads the air  about one meter underground.    Once there, the air passes through four layers of so-called  ``geotextile,'' a filter-like fabric that absorbs the  cancer-causing diesel exhaust particles (dep).    Earth bacteria will deplete the remaining nitrooxides into  harmless nitrogen and oxygen, both air components, when the air  penetrates through the soil on its way back to the surface.    The prefecture has earmarked 40 million yen for the pilot  project in its budget for fiscal 1994, which starts 1 April.  The system will be set up at a road with a traffic volume of  more than 20,000 vehicles per day, the officials said.    Despite some success in reducing greenhouse gases, including  nitrooxides, thanks to the broad use of catalyzer cars, eight of  105 survey stations in Osaka have said they will not be able to  reach nitrodioxide targets of below 0.06 ppm (parts per million)  by the turn of the century.</p>

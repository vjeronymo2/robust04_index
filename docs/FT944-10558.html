			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Summit light spills over on to East Timor: Indonesia is braced for world attention on its annexed territory On All Souls Day at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the East Timor capital of Dili last week, people paid tribute, in the Roman Catholic tradition, to their deceased family and friends. Near the chapel a large group gathered and, led by a local priest, remembered up to 200 independence demonstrators who were massacred there by Indonesian soldiers three years ago. Further recollections of the massacre, official admission of which was slow to emerge at the time, are the sort of thing the Indonesian government hopes will not take the gloss off its hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit next week. President Suharto's government, notoriously sensitive about its annexation of the former Portuguese colony it invaded in 1975, is hoping to win new international respect from the summit, due to be attended by representatives of 17 governments. However, US President Bill Clinton and others will be under pressure to raise human rights issues at the summit, and at least some attention is bound to be focused on East Timor. East Timor was abandoned by its colonial administrators in 1975 when the region was plunged into civil war. Indonesia invaded because, the government claims, the civil war in the territory, which borders Indonesian West Timor, 'threatened seriously to disrupt the national development and reconstruction efforts in which Indonesia was engaged'. East Timor was declared Indonesia's 27th province in 1976, defying resolutions passed by the United Nations which does not recognise Jakarta's sovereignty over the territory. Sensitive to foreign criticism, Indonesian officials are keen to point out that the region receives more government development funds, per head, than any other. Under Portuguese rule the region's infrastructure and facilities were negligible. Today there are schools, a university, roads, bridges, health clinics, telecommunications facilities and electricity. Water supply is still a problem. However, says an East Timorese professional, 'we never cried for development. We cried for freedom.' Freedom is not on offer - a referendum is ruled out - but the Indonesian government has taken some steps to find a solution. Mr Ali Alatas, foreign minister, met earlier this year in New York, under United Nations auspices, with the leader-in-exile of the Fretilin independence group, Mr Ramos Horta, and with Mr Abilio Araujo, another former leader-in-exile who was ousted from the exiled movement by opponents last year. More recently President Suharto announced he would meet Mr Araujo although they would not discuss the status of the territory. There has also been talk of granting autonomy or special status to East Timor but it is not clear what this means and statements have been non-committal. East Timorese are quick to point out that the north Sumatran province of Aceh and the sultanate of Yogjakarta in central Java are also accorded special status, but that this has not made any difference to the way the regions are governed. Meanwhile, the military makes clear it has no plans to leave. 'If we leave there will be more conflict,' says East Timor's military commander, Col Kiki Syahnakri. However, he claims the number of armed guerrillas is dwindling - there are only 188 poorly-equipped Fretilin fighters left in the mountains, he says. One East Timorese official says rape and murder by the military and police are daily occurrences in many parts of the region. Many of these cases, he says, go unreported and the perpetrators are not brought to trial. 'We are really suffering here,' he says. Clashes between mainly Moslem Indonesians, who are given incentives to move to East Timor, and Roman Catholic East Timorese are common. Recently two army officers were found guilty by a military court of desecrating the sacrament in a Catholic church and discharged. The animosity is made worse by rising unemployment. The East Timor Provincial Capital Investment Co-ordinating Board says there were 16,308 unemployed people in the province in August 1993, but independent sources say the figure is much higher. There are complaints that all the best jobs go to outsiders. East Timorese say that they have little control over their region's economy. The plantation and processing of coffee, the main cash crop, is dominated by the military although a monopoly on production was lifted earlier this year. Indonesian rule has increased the level of distrust among the population. Plain-clothed intelligence officers are ubiquitous. 'I don't even know whether my brother or sister is spying on me,' says an East Timorese professional who complains that Indonesian rule has sowed an atmosphere of fear among the population. In the absence of a referendum, and with a continuing large military presence in East Timor, Indonesia's rule in the region will continue to attract criticism from the international community. The Apec summit next week is likely to be seen by some as an occasion for that criticism to be loudly voiced.</p>

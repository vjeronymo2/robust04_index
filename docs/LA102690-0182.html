			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 BLACKS KILLED AS VIOLENCE ERUPTS NEAR CAPE TOWN  </P> <P> Seven blacks were killed, at least one by police, and 45 people were injured  Thursday when simmering tension in a black township near Cape Town erupted in  violence.  </P> <P> Police opened fire repeatedly during the day as crowds of up to 10,000 blacks  gathered illegally in demonstrations demanding the resignation of Mali Hoza,  the black township mayor of Khayelitsha.  </P> <P> Supporters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, the main black  opposition group, accused Hoza of corruption and of siding with President F. W.  de Klerk's white minority government.  </P> <P> Tension has been high in Khayelitsha since last week's slaying of Momsa  Mapongwana, wife of an anti-apartheid leader in the township 20 miles east of  Cape Town.  </P> <P> Police said the violence broke out shortly before midnight Wednesday when an  explosion started a fire at the town council building.  </P> <P> Firefighters extinguished the blaze, but police said township residents then  began hurling stones at police officers, who fired back with tear gas, rubber  bullets and birdshot.  </P></p>

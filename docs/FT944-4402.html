			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hozelock at Pounds 7m after interest charges fall Increased demand for hoses and sprinklers, courtesy of the UK's hot summer, helped lift pre-tax profits at Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer, by 85 per cent in its first year since coming to the market. The result for the 53 weeks to October 1 of Pounds 7m (Pounds 3.8m), was struck on turnover 20 per cent ahead at Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 32.3m). Operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 7m (Pounds 5.1m). Interest payable fell to Pounds 222,000; last year's figure of Pounds 1.35m included charges relating to the 1990 management buy-out structure. Operating margins increased from 15.9 per cent to 18.2 per cent as a result of productivity improvements and tighter costs control. Capital expenditure over the year reached Pounds 10m, most of which related to the construction of Midpoint Park, the company's new Pounds 7.9m factory in Birmingham, which began operating in July. City analysts reconsidered their profits forecasts to around Pounds 6.75m in August after Hozelock's trading statement announced strong summer sales following a disappointing spring. 'We have come in on the right side (of the forecasts),' said Mr David Codling, chief executive. Strong progress was recorded in the watering products and new aquatics division, which specialises in decorative ponds. Around 40 per cent of the UK's watering products are estimated to be in hose storage systems. However, with only 28 per cent household penetration compared to 48 per cent in France and 64 per cent in Germany, Hozelock believes there is room for development. Year on year growth in watering products was 36 per cent. Mr Codling said his primary goal was further progress in Europe, while development in Australasia and Africa remained a long-term aim. Earnings per share were 20.2p (12.7p). A final dividend of 5.05p is recommended, giving a total of 7.35p for the year.</p>

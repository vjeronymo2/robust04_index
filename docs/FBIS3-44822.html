Officials  said the low inflation rate came about despite a 4.6 percent  price hike recorded in December. The rise was the highest  recorded in a single month over the last 14 months and was  caused mainly by sharp increases in vegetable prices. Officials  attributed 1993's low inflation to four main factors: first,  the absence of major typhoons, which kept fruit and vegetable  prices stable throughout the year; second, the marginal rise in  wages and rents; third, the declining world oil prices; and  fourth, prices of industrial raw materials remain low.  Officials predicted that prices would remain stable this year,  citing the lowering of import tariffs in preparation for  Taipei's admission into the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade, or GATT.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dunton hit by property provisions Property provisions of Pounds 250,000 pushed Dunton Group, the brick manufacturer and civil engineer, deeper into the red with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 852,000 for the six months to November 30, against Pounds 252,000 last time. Mr Clive Travers, chairman, said the board considered it prudent to make the provisions in the light of the continuing weak demand for commercial property. The outcome was also affected by infrastructure costs at the joint venture at Barton-Le-Clay, and the cost of relocating its storage business to larger premises, neither of which will be repeated in the current year. Interest charges took Pounds 694,000 (Pounds 751,000) and with no tax (same) losses per share increased from 0.54p to 1.73p.</p>

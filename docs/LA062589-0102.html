			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE IN A $96 TICKET THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO 15-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST  </P> <P> Since I seem to have created a furor of backlash with my letter (June 11)  regarding my 15-year-old who got the $96 bicycle ticket, I would appreciate the  opportunity of responding.  </P> <P> First, in the interest of brevity, I did not accurately portray the actual  incident in my original letter. Contrary to the impression it evidently  conveyed, and which The Times' accompanying illustration reinforced, my son did  not ignore a stop sign and go zooming out into an intersection. He was making a  right-hand turn. What he did was slow, check the traffic (none was in the  vicinity, so no, he did not fail to yield the right of way to another vehicle)  and then continue on around the corner without coming to a complete stop. In  Irvine, this means that at no time did his tires leave the bike lane. (It also  means that the chance of his becoming a "lifeless body" due to this action were  slim to none.)  </P> <P> Mr. Hermon (letters June 18) fondly reminisces that in Colorado the kids would  be hauled to the station house and upon apologizing to the officer and  promising not to do it again, the ticket wuld "disappear." My son did apologize  to the officer, on the spot of his own volition. But apparently justice is not  served in the same way as in Colorado. The officer went ahead and ticketed him  anyway.  </P> <P> Let's talk about bicycles and traffic laws. Every kid who learns to ride a  two-wheeler becomes a bike rider. I wonder how many of these children know what  the California vehicle code requires? Since they are not required to pass a  test and be licensed, as are vehicle drivers, how many of them do you think  read the manual? I think most rely on basic common-sense safety precautions,  such as don't cross against the red, use crosswalks, look both ways, which  would leave them open to a great many offenses committed out of ignorance.  </P> <P> We did not go to court to try to "get out of" the charge, or assert that my son  was not guilty. What we did do was go to assert that the penalty was not  equitable to the crime. Would anyone feel it just if the fine had been $200?  $400? How about $1,000? If you agree to the inequity of any of these, then you  agree to what I asserted. Mainly, that there comes a point -- somewhere -- when  the fine ceases to be appropriate to the offense. Where that point comes  depends, I suppose, on your financial frame of reference.  </P> <P> To those who wrote, $96 may not be a lot of money, I don't know how many  15-year-olds can pull this amount out of their pockets, but I know ours can't.  And we, who still cannot afford to buy the most modest home here, can't either.  </P> <P> The point is, are the courts now operating under the theory that the bigger the  fine, the better-learned the lesson? If the real purpose here, or in any ticket  issued to a child, is indeed concern for his safety, wouldn't a far more  effective measure be to require his attendance at a bicycle safety class?  </P> <P> What message am I giving my son? Hopefully, that the law in this country is  just. That the penalties dealt are appropriate to the offenses committed. And  that if you're issued a bicycle ticket and charged a fine, it's because the  officer is truly concerned about your safety -- not because the city needs to  pay for the new City Hall.  </P> <P> JOANNE THOMAS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

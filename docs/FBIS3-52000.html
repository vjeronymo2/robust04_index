			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bolivia and Brazil today signed a new bilateral  agreement. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim arrived in  our country to sign it.    It should be recalled that Bolivia and Brazil signed a  partial agreement in 1983. The new agreement not only grants  preferential tariffs -- which involve reduced taxes on imports  -- but also provides for business cooperation and the exchange  of commercial information.    [Begin Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar recording]  It proves the fruitful talks and exchange of viewpoints that we  maintained during an active day with Foreign Minister Amorim.  [end recording]    There are two very important points in the joint communique.  For example, Bolivia and Brazil reaffirmed their predisposition  to make efforts so that the agreements between Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] countries and Bolivia -- aiming at allowing  Bolivia's full participation -- will be given priority within  the regional process.    As for Bolivian-Brazilian integration in the energy field,  the two ministers reiterated the importance and priority that  the governments of Brazil and Bolivia have attached to the  natural gas purchase contract signed by Petrobras [Brazilian  Petroleum Corporation] and Bolivian Government Oil Deposits.    [Begin Amorim recording] At this meeting I obviously could  not discuss technical details because this must be done by the  Petrobras people. But I believe the important thing is the  political reaffirmation of our determination to develop this  project, which is important for Bolivia and also very important  for Brazil. [end recording]    This was the conclusion of the official visit paid by  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who thanked Bolivian  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar for the expressions of  appreciation and friendship extended to him.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Conrad losses reach Pounds 1.48m Conrad, the Manchester-based sports, leisure and consultancy group, has agreed to pay Pounds 1m in cash and shares for Inter Research, a specialist human resource consultancy. The group also reported a widening of losses from Pounds 297,000 to Pounds 1.48m pre-tax for the half year to end-June after taking account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 527,000. Turnover totalled Pounds 770,000 (Pounds 2.82m) and losses per share emerged at 3.26p compared with 1.01p. At the December 31 year-end, the pre-tax deficit stood at a restated Pounds 638,000. The company has changed its year-end to June 30 to 'more sensibly fit' its trading pattern. Initial consideration for the acquisition of Pounds 400,000 will be satisfied via the issue of 7m new shares and Pounds 50,000 cash. The Pounds 600,000 balance is dependent on performance. Conrad is also proposing to raise about Pounds 410,000 net by the placing of 12.5m new shares at 4p, of which the directors have undertaken to subscribe to 1.8m. Mr Rodney Walker, chairman, said that for the first time since 1988 'the group as a whole is trading profitably and ahead of budget.' He was confident that Conrad would return to profit in the current year.</p>

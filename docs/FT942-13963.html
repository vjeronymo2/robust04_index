			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / People: Three heads picked for Roscos The names of three key people involved in the privatisation of British Rail were announced yesterday in the shape of the managing directors of the companies which will lease rolling stock to the train operators. The three rolling stock leasing companies or Roscos will acquire a mix of BR locomotives, carriages and wagons and lease them to the operating companies. If the train operators want to renew their fleets they would probably lease them through one of the roscos. Management buy-out teams and other potential bidders for BR franchises have been waiting for details of the Roscos for several months. The April 1 launch date for BR privatisation came and went without any further information emerging. Questions on the likely cost of leasing to the train operating companies have still to be answered but the announcement of managing directors marks an important step forward. Tony Roche, 50, a railman with 30 years' experience and a former deputy managing director of Network SouthEast, has been appointed managing director of the Eversholt Train Leasing Company, which is based in London. Roche, who has worked on the mechanical engineering side of BR, has played a key role in creating the Roscos. His two fellow mds both have a background in the equipment rental and leasing sectors. Brian Hassell, chief executive for the past two years of Motability Finance, which leases cars to the disabled, assumes command at London-based Angel Train Contracts in June. Hassell is a past chairman of the Finance and Leasing Association. Sandy Anderson, managing director of TIP Trailer Rental for the past six years, takes over at Sheffield-based Porterbrook Leasing Company in July. Before joining TIP 12 years ago he was a terminal manager for Freightliner, BR's container handling subsidiary.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pearson sales The move by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to concentrate on its media interests and demerge Royal Doulton, its fine china division, and Camco, its oilfield equipment and services arm, was well received in the stock market. Even the sale yesterday afternoon by Mr Rupert Murdoch of 16.48m Pearson shares, via a placing by Goldman Sachs, failed to hold back the share price, which rose 27 to 467p. Royal Doulton will be listed on the London market later this year, while a majority interest in Camco will be offered in New York next year. Although the demerger move took analysts by surprise, it was welcomed by market watchers, who are increasingly keen on moves by conglomerates to streamline assets. The fact that Mr Murdoch's shares were absorbed without difficulty at 464p was viewed as a sign that there was a healthy appetite for Pearson stock. Trading in Pearson shares took the price to a day's high of 484p, before easing back to the closing level. Turnover came to 39m shares. The implications of Pearson's plans brought sympathetic demand for Reed International, which moved ahead 11 to 657p.</p>

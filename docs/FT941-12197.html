			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Adams calls for end to armed conflict: Sinn Fein chief opens US visit with peace forecast Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said in New York last night he was convinced that young republicans now growing up in Ireland would experience peace. 'We have to produce a demilitarised nation,' he added at Kennedy airport immediately after arriving from Dublin. 'I want to see an end to all armed conflict in Ireland,' he continued at a press conference. 'The Irish and British people deserve peace.' Asked if the IRA supported a ceasefire, Mr Adams said: 'I don't speak for the IRA; I speak for Sinn Fein.' But he added: 'The largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the British army, followed by the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed.' Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace process. 'They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful country.' Speaking on CNN television last night, Mr Adams reiterated his support for a peaceful solution to the problems in Northern Ireland. He said: 'I want to see the gun taken out of Irish politics. The gun was brought into our affairs by the British. I want to see the IRA disbanded and the British army disbanded. 'I have had the courage to call on the IRA to take part in a demilitarised Northern Ireland.' Mr Adams is in the US for 48 hours for a conference about Northern Ireland organised by an independent think-tank. His visit was made possible when President Bill Clinton decided to grant him a visa, lifting a 20-year ban. The decision to grant the visa was met with outrage by Ulster unionists who warned that the Sinn Fein leader would exploit the visit for propaganda purposes. But it was given a cautious welcome by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the visit was acceptable if it helped bring closer the prospect of peace. Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, and representatives of the Alliance party are also expected to attend today's conference in the US. Unionists said the decision meant the US had relinquished any right to act as an intermediary in any efforts to bring peace to the province.</p>

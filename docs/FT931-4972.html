			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Engineering halts decline in orders ORDER BOOKS of engineering companies in the West Midlands, the traditional heart of the industry, have stopped shrinking over the past three months and, for the first time since last May, the proportion of companies reporting increased demand is higher than those reporting lower demand. The latest survey of business trends, covering 470 companies, carried out by the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands and published yesterday, showed that in February 36 per cent of companies experienced an improvement in the level of domestic orders and 49 per cent an improvement in export orders. With 45 per cent of companies expecting total orders to increase over the next three months, Mr David Botterill, the chief executive of EEF West Midlands, said there were 'emerging signs of recovery'. Although 40 per cent of companies are expecting higher utilisation of their capacity over the next quarter, there is little sign of higher capital spending and the employment prospects remain bleak. Only 14 per cent of companies expect to take on more people, although Mr Botterill expected a slowdown in the rate of job losses. Such a slowdown has already started. Birmingham City Council recently noted that although unemployment totals in the city had risen for 31 successive months, 'the increase has fallen from an average of 17,500 in the year to January 1992 to 6,000 in the year to January 1993'.</p>

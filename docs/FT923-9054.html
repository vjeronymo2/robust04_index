			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Malaysian airline seeks MDollars 700m in rights issue MALAYSIA Airlines System (MAS), the partially privatised Malaysian state airline, yesterday announced its one-for-one rights issue, set for the end of 1992, which is designed to raise more than MDollars 700m (USDollars 281.1m) and double its share capital. At the same time, MAS forecast pre-tax profits of MDollars 372m for the year to March 1993, against pre-tax profits of MDollars 119m a year earlier. MAS is confident of the success of the rights issue, one of the biggest on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. It says five substantial shareholders, including Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, and the Brunei Investment Agency, have asked for their full entitlement of shares. At the end of June, MAS agreed a Dollars 170m syndicated loan facility with 27 international banks to fund partly its acquisition programme. MAS is in the middle of a big aircraft acquisition programme and needs the additional capital to prevent further borrowings. It is due to take delivery of 72 aircraft over the next five years, replacing leased jets which make up about half of its fleet.</p>

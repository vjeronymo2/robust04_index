			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Depositor protection plan CUSTOMERS of British banks may soon enjoy protection on 90 per cent of their bank deposits - instead of the present 75 per cent - under proposed legislation from Brussels. The British Bankers' Association said the protection would apply to up to Pounds 11,900 (Ecu16,000) of savings compared with Pounds 20,000 offered by the existing UK depositor protection scheme, which will continue to operate alongside the EC scheme. The association said this would mean a depositor getting back a maximum of Pounds 10,714 (Ecu15,000) if their bank failed. Customers of building societies in the UK already enjoy protection on 90 per cent of their deposits up to Pounds 20,000. Banks within the European Community are close to agreement on the main points of a deposit guarantee schemes directive which would impose minimum standards of depositor protection. The talks ran into temporary difficulties when banks in Germany and Italy tried to hold out for 100 per cent depositor protection. British banks oppose total protection as they believe it would encourage imprudent behaviour among both investors and banks and make much stricter government regulation of the banking system necessary. Though no text of the proposed directive has yet been drawn up, the BBA expects that it will be completed in the second half of this year during the British presidency of the EC.</p>

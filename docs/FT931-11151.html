			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Wilson writes to Mexican government over disputed contract Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson has written to the Mexican government over the disputed contract for Mexico's air traffic control system, writes Damian Fraser. The Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) contract was won by Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy, but IBM, Westinghouse and Raytheon's Canadian subsidiary have all protested about the way the procedure was handled. Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation, which examines irregularities in government spending, is expected to report on the complaints later this week.</p>

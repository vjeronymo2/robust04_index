			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (12): Big surge of interest - Foreign investment in China THE gold rush of foreign investors into China has taken on enormous proportions this year. According to official figures, actual investment in foreign-funded projects during the first nine months of the year exceeded Dollars 15bn. In the same period, the Beijing government approved 62,789 projects involving foreign participation, with a contracted value of more than Dollars 83bn, a 171 per cent increase on the first nine months of last year. The figures so far this year compared with agreements signed in 1992 worth a total of Dollars 68.5bn, and actual foreign funds flowing into the country of Dollars 11bn, more than double the totals for 1991. Such statistics have to be treated with caution. Equity from the Chinese side is often included in the value of projects, exaggerating the size of the apparent inflow. Some investment comes from inside China but is directed through offshore companies to win tax advantages. Many agreements will not be put into effect. Nevertheless, interest from abroad is easily visible to anybody visiting China's leading cities. One western diplomat says: 'We get hundreds of faxes from companies saying 'we're sending our top corporate team'.' The ventures which the latest visitors will eventually negotiate will spread investment well beyond the dynamic, but increasingly clogged and expensive, coastal regions. Ethnic Chinese business from outside China - from Hong Kong, Taiwan, south-east Asia and the US - dominates the flow of foreign capital into China. Though most ventures have been in light industry and concentrated in the south - representing a shift in the manufacturing workforce from other Asian countries into China to take advantage of cheaper labour - Asian-funded projects are growing in scale. Most of the region's ethnic Chinese captains of industry, such as Hong Kong's Mr Li Ka Shing, Indonesia's Mr Liem Sioe Liong, and Malaysia's Mr Robert Kuok Hock Nien, are pouring money into huge projects. Singapore is planning to build whole cities in China. However, most significant western and Japanese companies also recognised long ago the potential offered by China's reforms and growth, and have set about establishing ventures. Those that were there first are finding that they have a growing number of different operations in China and are seeking better ways to co-ordinate them. Shanghai, where foreign investment has lagged and infrastructure is poor, is likely to benefit as the ambitious Pudong development area takes shape. The overall tendency is likely to be towards bigger projects and concentration of investment in industrial parks where special efforts are made to improve infrastructure. Meanwhile, indirect investment is growing through listings of Chinese companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as in Hong Kong, New York and most recently Sydney. A plethora of 'China funds' - mostly investing a small proportion of their money in China itself - have sprung up to cash in on feverish investor interest. However, because of the nascent state of Chinese stock markets and of the country's company law and accounting methods, direct participation in Chinese business will remain dominant form of foreign investment for years to come. China's priorities for new investment focus increasingly on improving infrastructure, particularly power and transport. The government has seized upon the build-operate-transfer formula, which has been used to a limited extent in the south, as an attractive means of bringing in foreign capital to big projects. However, western companies are cautious since the BOT formula means having assurances about revenue streams in areas where price controls still exist. The pressing need for China's industry is technology. Most joint ventures involve a form of technology transfer which means that the foreign investor is taking a risk in a country where there are worries about intellectual property rights. However, the government has taken steps to protect copyright as well as to give fairer treatment to foreign-funded enterprises. Mr Miao Fuchun, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, says: 'Our general objective is to create a fair competitive environment according to the principle of the market economy. To ensure this, we must give equal treatment in such areas as taxation, tax rates, exchange rates, transport, communications and work procedures.' Improvement of the legal framework and greater transparency of regulations are important in bring Chinese practices close to international standards, Mr Miao says. Nevertheless, China remains a very difficult environment in which to operate. Companies feel they must be involved in China's boom, but find that ventures take years of frustrating negotiations absorbing a great deal of management time, and that problems often arise once ventures have started up. A commercial attache at one western embassy says his message to arriving businessmen is: 'For goodness sake be careful, and why weren't you here yesterday?'</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Stumbling on the stubble Oh no - yet more adverts of perfectly contoured male clones, all with skin smoother than a baby's bottom. Yes, it's another new razor from Gillette, inventor of the original twin-bladed disposable razor. Remember that? The one which boasted: 'The first blade shaves you close, the second blade shaves you closer still.' Most people wondered: if the first blade was so good, why have the second? What the media really wanted to see when the new Gillette SensorExcel was displayed in the US this week was Ron Rossi, Gillette's north America president, sporting a mite of lavatory paper stuck to a nastily nicked chin. No chance. Instead hacks were served up marketing hype, such as the new razor's rubber microfins, which stretch the skin and make it stand to attention for the cutting. Yawn. SensorExcel costs 15 per cent more than any other throwaway plastic razor. For that, we expect aftershave lotion chucked in too.</p>

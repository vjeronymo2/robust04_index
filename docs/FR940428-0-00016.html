			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Columbia suggests that the Commission exempt from filing all regular employees in the holding company whose expenses do not exceed $30,000 per year. By its terms, however, section 12(i) does not appear to permit a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission therefore declines to adopt this suggestion.

Summary of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, regarding the amendment to rule 7. The Analysis explains that the amendment is intended to expand the exemption from regulation for companies that are primarily engaged in nonutility businesses. The Analysis describes the present regulatory framework under which a company operating public-utility facilities must obtain a Commission order declaring it not to be an electric or gas utility company, unless the gross sales of electric energy, or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail by means of the facilities owned or operated by such company, did not exceed $100,000 during the previous calendar year. The exemption by order is not available for companies that own but do not operate such facilities. The amendment would increase the dollar sales allowable under the exemption to $5 million. The Analysis states that several significant alternatives to the amendment were considered, including continuing to grant exemptions by order on a case-by-case basis, but concludes that the amendment provides the least impact on, or cost to, small businesses. A copy of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained from Brian P. Spires, at Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other rule and form amendments will not affect any small entities as defined in rule 110. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the amended rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Commission did not receive any comments with respect to the Chairman's certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Cost/Benefit of Proposed Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments will decrease regulatory compliance costs for companies in a registered holding company system. In fiscal year 1993, for example, the amendments would have eliminated the need for 22 applications and approximately 545 forms, and would have reduced the regulatory burden associated with an additional 86 applications, for an estimated savings of more than 4,114 hours per year. Moreover, the amendments would have reduced by approximately 1,576 hours the staff time associated with reviewing and analyzing these applications. The only cost to the companies complying with the amended rules will be the cost of reporting on Form U5S the information required by rule 40(a)(5). It is estimated that no more than one-half hour will be required to complete the additional information required by the change to Form U5S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

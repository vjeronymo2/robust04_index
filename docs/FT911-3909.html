			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (30): Systems that shed fresh light on information - Geographic Information, 'the biggest step forward since the map' COMPUTER-based geographic information systems seem set to take their place among those developments which will embody the information age. They are described by the government as 'the biggest step forward in the handling of geographic information since the invention of the map'. The systems facilitate the display and manipulation of data among such established users as the large utilities and national and local government - organisations that have traditionally made extensive use of paper maps - and are increasingly recognised as an accurate and effective marketing tool by a variety of commercial organisations. GIS, essentially systems which allow the analysis of stored information on a geographic basis, consist of both graphic and alphanumeric data. Automated mapping provides pictorial representation of maps and plans using precise numerical information, while text-based data covering any number of factors such as cabling, sewers, parks, schools, types of housing and so forth are combined to facilitate analysis and planning. The main benefits of their use, according to the Chorley Committee of Enquiry set up by the Department of the Environment in 1987 to investigate the handling of geographic information, include fast and easy access to large volumes of data; the ability to analyse spatial characteristics of data and to search for particular characteristics or features in a given area; to link or merge one data set with another; and to produce flexible forms of output such as maps, graphs and summary statistics tailored to meet particular needs. Mr Glenn Carver, a GIS consultant with information management company CMG, comments that access to data and its proper management are important elements in the successful use of GIS. 'A well managed GIS in a local authority could, for instance, hold all the data for the various departments, updating and distributing information to each department as changes were made. So, a map referenced by, say, a postcode could be called up on screen, and depending on the information required, be marked differently. 'Thus the housing department could ask for all empty council property to be displayed, highways for all traffic light systems, and social services for all registered child-minders,' he says. Such systems, however, require an enormous effort of data input, and Mr Carver notes that from the initial decision to develop a GIS, to final implementation, normally takes between five and eight years. 'It is a massive undertaking, you certainly can't just dip your toe into GIS. But we are talking about the complete integration of information within an organisation. It is vital for users to think and plan strategically, and it is part of our job to help them do so.' The extent of the undertaking may have slowed the progress of GIS and until recently confined its use to governments and utilities, but the technology is being increasingly recognised as a powerful commercial tool, enabling companies more tightly to target groups of people as potential customers for specific projects and services. Retailers, such as Gateway Stores have recognised how GIS can help support decisions about store location, while sectors such as the oil industry look to GIS to improve transport, distribution and work scheduling decisions. A number of systems providers and consultants are active in the market in this country, these include McDonnell Douglas, the leading aerospace company whose information systems division recently announced its Spatial Modelling System, which, according to Mr Barrie Laver, who is director of the company's Applied Graphics Group, puts paid to the long-standing gripe of academics that GIS is merely an adjunct to computer aided design. 'Spatial database systems are distinguished by their ability to link graphics and text, thus creating smart graphics which provide a visual window into the administrative database,' he says. Pinpoint Analysis, another company active in geographic information systems, provides demographic and geographic information which, the company claims, when combined with clients' internal information will ensure more effective targeting and delivery of products and services. Pinpoint is among the leading suppliers of highly detailed digital address and road data for use in GIS and has built up a wide range of databases including a market-specific classification system geared to the financial services market, and a profiling system which analyses UK neighbourhoods into marketing-oriented categories. In keeping with the increasingly high profile of personal computers, Pinpoint offers Geopin, a geodemographic information system which runs on a desktop computer and was developed specifically to meet the needs of marketers. Mr Martin Higgings, a GIS consultant with Pinpoint, explains that the system was designed for users who are not computing experts, but who are increasingly aware of the relevance of geographic information systems to their business and so require the facility to perform complex analyses with the help of simple pull-down menus. The PC version of Geopin can be extended into a networked system and a compatible mainframe version is also available. The technology for GIS is well and truly in place, but it is the data needed to make it work which, as well as requiring a considerable time effort, may not always be easily available. The Chorley report noted, for example, that 'information needs to be seen as a corporate resource and be more widely shared between departments and organisations', adding that 'the full potential of geographic information systems will only be secured by co-ordinating the interests of the widely dispersed community of users.'</p>

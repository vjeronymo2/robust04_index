			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF  </P> <P> MEGAMISTAKES  </P> <P> Forecasting and the Myth of  </P> <P> Rapid Technological Change  </P> <P> by Steven P. Schnaars  </P> <P> (Free Press: $19.95)  </P> <P>  A 500-kilowatt nuclear power plant, maintained by regular passenger flights  from Earth, starts operating on the moon in 1980. Vertical takeoff aircraft  become as common as luxury cars by 1977. By 1984, newspapers are printed on  home fax machines and by 1990, intelligent robot soldiers do most of the  fighting. While as inaccurate as a Buck Rogers space opera, these predictions  are actually from an ambitious TRW forecast in 1966 which consulted 27 top  scientists about the products of the future that held the "vastest  opportunities for business growth." Steven Schnaars, a marketing professor at  New York's City University, delights in presenting these "mega-mistakes" as  examples of how corporate soothsayers, mesmerized by the space program and  space shows such as "Star Trek," became smitten with scientific-sounding  marketing tools such as the "Delphi Technique," forgetting basic marketing laws  in the process.  </P> <P> Criticizing the elegant math models employed by forecasters for scouring the  past "in search of obscure patterns" and "projecting glorious futures from the  skimpiest of data," Schnaars recommends methods such as "scenario analysis,"  which encourage insight and creativity while requiring forecasters to indicate  how you will get from here to there, "not just what it will look like when you  arrive." Scenario analysis is the best way to interpret those special  "confluences of social and cultural trends" that open up lucrative markets,  Schnaars writes, pointing to the way Phillip Morris tobacco maintained sales in  the 1960s by creating the "You've come a long way, baby" slogan, which  anticipated growth in the women's movement.  </P> <P> Schnaars isn't entirely fair to forecasters such as those at TRW, for some bad  investments which he attributes to poor cost analysis (such as vertical  take-off planes) actually failed because of technological problems that can't  be anticipated by his classic marketing methods. Overall, though, this is an  insightful, cautionary book, contending that consumers are not likely to change  their marketing habits overnight, however impressive an innovation might be.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BORDERLAND  </P> <P> Origins of the American  </P> <P> Suburb, 1820-1939  </P> <P> by John R. Stilgoe  </P> <P> (Yale: $35)  </P> <P>  Depicting the Pony Express, Great Frontier and covered wagons as symbols of a  courageous, enterprising era, American history books now take considerable  pride in the fact that our nation conquered a continent in a century. The  "conquerors" themselves hardly basked in the glow of admiration, however, for  as this unusual social history suggests, many 19th and early 20th Century  writers viewed the retreat from Eastern cities as a virtual abandonment of  European civilization. "Americans teach their children that the come-outers  sought religious freedom, safety from tyranny, refuge from military  conscription, and above all, the opportunity to better themselves and their  children," writes John Stilgoe, a landscape historian at Harvard. "Of the other  point of view, the one still presented around tavern and cantina tables across  Europe, schoolbooks and national mythology speak nothing." Were the early  settlers "lazy, cowardly or quitters?" Did the movement into "backwoods America  turn the European into a barbarian," as Lewis Mumford wrote?  </P> <P> Fortunately, Stilgoe is less interested in ponderously answering these  questions than in quietly reflecting on how early attitudes toward suburb and  city reflected our nation's changing conceptions of the good and civilized  life. From ancient times until the early 18th Century, Stilgoe writes, suburbs  referred to inhabited land immediately below hilltop walled towns. "Dependent,  forlorn and prey to brigands and attacking armies," suburbanites craved  security and order and struggled to gain entrance into the city. Now, of  course, as "urban downtowns . . . screech in their shabbiness," suburban life  has become a dream of happiness that inspires many urban dwellers "to work, to  save, to get out of cities they perceive as chaotic, inimical to childhood joy,  unnaturally paced, incredibly polluted, and just too crowded." Explaining this  change, Stilgoe surveys an impressively wide range of social and cultural  trends, from cholera epidemics in overcrowded cities to world war: At a time  when the enemy no longer charged up the hill, but attacked from the sky, dense  urban areas suddenly seemed frighteningly fragile.  </P> <P> What's most striking about "Borderland" is how representative these early  suburban settlers are of today's Americans. As Stilgoe writes, the borderland  landscape endures as "a sort of attic in the national superstructure, a place  of calm, a place of older things, a height to visit when downstairs all is  commotion, all noisy busyness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE GOOD NEIGHBOR  </P> <P> How the United States Wrote  </P> <P> the History of Central  </P> <P> America and the Caribbean  </P> <P> by George Black  </P> <P> (Pantheon: $9.95)  </P> <P>  One might well question the utility of the many books published in recent  years about America's interventions in the affairs of its southern neighbors,  for these books tend to reach those who know the most about the region.  Meanwhile, the majority of Americans remain happily oblivious: In a New York  Times-CBS News poll conducted after Oliver North's appearance before the 1987  Congressional Iran-Contra hearings, only 32% of respondents could locate  Nicaragua as part of Central or Latin America; 48% either had no idea or placed  it near countries such as Iran and Iraq. And yet, while books about Latin  America cannot hope to reach this apathetic majority, a few, such as George  Black's concise and convincing "The Good Neighbor," can do more than preach to  the converted. Eschewing liberal rhetoric, creating a balanced, compelling  narrative and supporting his assertions with quotes from Reagan Administration  officials, Black is likely to attract readers who are uninformed less out of  apathy than a deep skepticism toward those lugging ideological baggage.  </P> <P> While the subtitle suggests that this is primarily a study of how the Reagan  Administration manipulated the news, "The Good Neighbor" is in essence a  concise, well-informed revisionist history that illustrates how successive  administrations have been careless with the facts. What keeps "The Good  Neighbor" from being yet another rag-tag collection of Reagan era gaffes is  Black's focus on how conservative propagandists have played on deeply-rooted  American fears. Black's psychoanalytic approach will offend some readers for  its implicit condescension and its tendency to dismiss some legitimate security  concerns, such as anxiety about the Cuban missile crisis, as irrational  "fears." Black's liberal perspective also colors his prose at times; he  criticizes the networks for covering the 1982 El Salvadoran elections, for  example, while castigating them for not covering the 1984 elections in  Nicaragua. Overall, though, Black has composed an impressivelly well-informed  overview of how emotional rather than strategic considerations have governed  U.S. policy toward its southern neighbors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FORBIDDEN TERRITORY  </P> <P> The Memoirs of Juan Goytisolo  </P> <P> 1931-1956  </P> <P> (North Point Press: $18.95)  </P> <P>  What makes Juan Goytisolo so intriguing is his constant striving to avoid the  conventional. For Goytisolo, becoming a creature of custom rather than an  "authentic individual" means more than losing the creative spark. He sees the  day-to-day routines that attempt to seduce us all as a kind of spiritual  extinction and writes out of a "determination to fight tooth and claw against  oblivion . . . to capture the precious gift of life." Goytisolo's rebellion  against convention grew intense as he matured in Barcelona in a family that  cheered the arrival of Franco even though Goytisolo's mother had been killed by  a Nationalist bomb in 1936. Goytisolo describes his escape from "tribal norms .  . . that disguised the truth" in these pages, but while he now lives in Paris,  it is clear that he remains, by careful choice, in a limbo between cultures. It  is the same limbo reflected in Goytisolo's surrealistic novels, from "Count  Julian," whose Spanish narrator dreams of a new Muslim invasion of his  homeland, to "Landscapes After the Battle," whose narrator lives in a Paris  district, where blond Turks brush shoulders with Portuguese concierges and  Jewish merchants from North Africa.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Fresh bid for EU opt-out will hit disabled The government is seeking to withdraw its support for a European Union scheme to assist the disabled. Money for the scheme was voted into next year's EU budget by the Council of Ministers last July, but the Department of Health is now taking legal advice as to whether it is bound by the decision. The move comes hard on the heels of last month's decision by Mr Michael Portillo, the employment minister, to withdraw government departments from the priority suppliers scheme to help disabled workers. Mr Portillo argued that EU rules on public procurement prohibited discriminating in favour of the disabled in the award of government contracts, although the European Commission in Brussels insists this is not the intention of the law. The latest instance, revealed yesterday by Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour spokesman on social affairs at the European Parliament, concerns a scheme called Handynet. This is an EU-wide database providing information on equipment and services intended to help the disabled live independently. It comes under the Helios programme, which has been voted Ecu25m (Pounds 19.7m) from the EU budget for the next three years, of which Handynet would get some Ecu4.2m. But in a letter to disabled people's organisations, the Department of Health on September 27 said that junior health minister Mr Gerry Malone 'has advised officials that he remains to be convinced about the value of Handynet and has requested information about how the DoH can withdraw its support'. The letter continues: 'Officials have asked solicitors for their view as to whether under the terms of the original Council (of Ministers) decision, the DoH can legally withdraw its support.' Savings would amount to the Pounds 300,000 administrative costs of the scheme, but the letter - signed by Ms Glynis Philips of the department's health care administration - warns that 'any saving would not necessarily be ploughed back into disabled people's projects'. An official at the Department of Health last night confirmed that the review was to have been completed by yesterday, ahead of a meeting of the social affairs working group involving state officials in Brussels next week. He said the department had 'great difficulty' finding anybody in the UK who said Handynet was a good thing. But he added that 'if solicitors say we can't withdraw, then that's the end of the matter'. Mr McMahon said: 'We have established that yet another British opt-out would not end the Europe-wide scheme at this stage, but simply deprive British disabled people of its benefits.'</p>

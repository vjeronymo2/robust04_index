			<p>BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs -- ahead of his scheduled visit to  Greece -- today received Pavlos Apostolidis, director of the  Greek Foreign Ministry Political Relations Office, and the  Zagreb-based head of the EC monitoring mission, Greek Ambassador  Constantin Yerocostopoulos [names as heard]. The meeting was  also attended by Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader.    Granic informed his guests about the course of the  implementation of the cease-fire agreement between the Croatian  authorities and the local Serbs living in UN protected areas,  and announced that negotiations would resume next week.  Speaking about the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Granic  stressed the importance of the establishment of a total  cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the resumption of peace  talks. He said that the Serb side should immediately join the  talks and that the European Union should be more efficient.    Granic and Sanader also spoke about preparations for the  reconstruction of Croatia, for which it is necessary to obtain  economic aid, particularly from the European Union, as Croatia  is a European country and wishes to join its political and  economic trends.    Granic and his guests agreed that relations between Croatia  and Greece are good, and that the visit by the Croatian foreign  minister to Greece will contribute to their future bilateral  cooperation.</p>

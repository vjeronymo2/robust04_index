The Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reported on 27 April  that the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe issued an  opinion on 26 April that clears the way for the prosecution of  individuals for the public utterance or publication of the  "Auschwitz lie," the denial of the systematic murder of Jews in  the concentration camps of the Third Reich. The case was brought  by the Munich-Upper Bavaria district organization of the NPD  (National Party of Germany) against Munich officials who had  granted the party a permit for a public meeting only on the  condition that no speaker utter a denial of the Holocaust. The  Court's First Chamber, presided over by Constitutional Court  President Roman Herzog, ruled that the "Auschwitz lie" is a  palpably false assertion and a serious denigration of the  reputation of both the actual victims and Jews still living in  Germany. The Court thus ruled that it is not covered by freedom  of speech, and is punishable under law. In contrast, in an  opinion on a second case issued at the same time, the court  ruled that banning a book in which the author denies German  guilt for the outbreak of World War II would be unconstitutional  and that the author's exposition of his historical thesis is  protected under freedom of speech.    This pair of decisions came only days after the Federal  Supreme Court (BGH) had issued a written opinion substantiating  its decision--announced on 15 March--overturning the public  incitement conviction of NPD national chairman Guenter Deckert  for spreading the "Auschwitz lie," and returning the case to the  lower court for retrial. Since the BGH decision in the Deckert  case had created the impression in some quarters that the  "Auschwitz lie" was no longer punishable under law, as reported  by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on 27 April, the Federal Constitutional  Court, evidently in response, acted "unusually quickly" to issue  its own unanimous opinion to the contrary.    Commenting on the BGH decision in the Deckert case, Ursula  Knapp in the Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU of 12  April described the current period as one in which no day passes  without "anti-Jewish attacks," and anti-Semitism has again  become a "topic" in Germany. In this atmosphere, if the federal  judges were to hold to their view "that the `Auschwitz lie' in  itself, without further evidence of neo-Nazi sentiment, can no  longer be forbidden as public incitement, there would be dire  consequences." In an indictment of the FRG political and legal  establishment for having "prepared" the ground for the growth of  right-wing extremism, Martin Winter, in the FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU of 7 April, took aim at federal judges and other  justice authorities: "Federal judges who cannot recognize public  incitement in the Auschwitz lie make themselves just as culpable  as protectors of the constitution, police officers, prosecutors,  and judges who have long treated right-wing extremist  perpetrators of violence with amazing leniency."  <H5>  No Acquittal </H5>   Following the Federal Constitutional Court's decision,  Joachim Kaeppner, in a signed page-one editorial in the Hamburg  weekly DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT of 29 April, defended  the Federal Supreme Court judges, who had "never" meant their  decision to be interpreted as an "acquittal" of the "Auschwitz  lie," and cited the satisfaction of Ignatz Bubis, chairman of  the Central Council of Jews in Germany, with the Constitutional  Court's unambiguous ruling which ensures that "there can never  be an acquittal of the `Auschwitz lie.'" Thus, the "much  maligned" judicial authorities, he asserted, "are proving  themselves capable of putting up a fight against the right."  Rudolf Wassermann, commenting in the Hamburg daily DIE WELT of  28 April, also welcomed the Constitutional Court's militant  response to those who would deny the horrors of Nazism: "With  the decision, Karlsruhe has knocked a weapon out of the hands of  extremists on the far-right wing of the political spectrum." In  a broader sense, since the deniers of the Holocaust "are  betraying" the principles on which the Federal Republic was  founded, "this state should be a militant democracy which  defends itself when antidemocrats want to break loose."  <H5>  Two Lies </H5>   Viewing the Court's seemingly divergent opinions on the  "Auschwitz lie" and the "war guilt lie," the SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, in an editorial on 27 April, posed the question: "How  should a state which has been damaged throughout the world due  to the neo-Nazis react to such propaganda nonsense?" In both  cases the "basic rule of a free democracy," that each person  should be able to say freely what he or she thinks, should  apply, but with the proviso that "the right of freedom of speech  gives no unlimited right to lies and insults." Christian  Semler, in a signed editorial in the 27 April edition of the  Berlin daily DIE TAGESZEITUNG, also welcomed the Constitutional  Court's placing of limits on the freedom of public expression of  opinion as it applies in the case of the "Auschwitz lie." With  its decision, he writes, "the Constitutional Court has not so  much broken new ground, as newly staked out the boundaries on  familiar territory." At a time when even the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution has "no criteria for right-wing  extremism in Germany," Hans Schueler wrote in the Hamburg weekly  DIE ZEIT of 29 April, "how good it is, therefore, that the  Karlsruhe constitutional judges at least, with two decisions,  have now let us know what's what, so that voters may preserve  their basic democratic attitude and at the same time protect  themselves from deviations toward the extreme Right." However,  while the Karlsruhe court has cleared the way for convictions on  the charge of public incitement in cases involving the  "Auschwitz lie," the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU pointed out in a 27  April editorial: "How the criminal court judges will handle  these directives, how they will rule in individual cases, does  not of course fall within the purview of the guardians of the  constitution." Reacting positively to the suggestion of former  Constitutional Court judge Ernst Mahrenholz that the laender  appoint special prosecutors to speed up prosecution in the  mounting cases of right-extremist criminality, including the  "Auschwitz lie," the Bonn weekly RHEINISCHER MERKUR  editorialized in its 29 April edition: "Only swift punishment  is a deterrent and creates respect for the law which tramples  right-extremist criminals under foot. Immediate action is  called for. Also and especially because in 1994 we are in an  election year."  <H5>  Criminalization Debated </H5>   The federal court decisions have also sparked a debate over  whether the penal code should be amended to specifically  criminalize the "Auschwitz lie." In a page-one editorial in the  Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 7 April, Eckhard  Fuhr opposed the intention of the SPD, shared by Federal Justice  Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, to quickly close  the perceived legal loophole ostensibly permitting the  dissemination of the "Auschwitz lie" in the wake of the initial  announcement of the Federal Supreme Court's decision in the  Deckert case: "If the genocide against the Jews is not to become  a dark, tabu-reinforced myth in the public consciousness, but is  rather to remain an object of living and tormenting remembrance,  then the penal code should be left alone. The recognition of  truth cannot be forced." Also addressing renewed efforts--such  a proposal had been made in the early 1980's--"to stiffen the  threats of the penal code against disputing or minimizing of  National Socialist acts of violence against the Jews," Friedrich  Karl Fromme, editor for domestic politics and coordination, in a  later page-one editorial in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 27  April, reached a similar conclusion: "Historical truth cannot  be established by the penal code; that ill befits a state  committed to liberality, as painful or embarrassing as it may be  in any particular case." According to Goetz Aly, commenting in  the 19 April edition of DIE TAGESZEITUNG, more important than an  amendment of the penal code is the development of a "democratic  consensus" including the historical fact of Auschwitz as an  integral part: "For if one advocates the punishment of those  who assert an `Auschwitz lie,' then for that purpose not a  scientific, but rather a democratic agreement is necessary.  With the use of Auschwitz as a political-moral all-purpose  weapon, as chiefly representatives of the left and left-liberal  milieu treat it, such a consensus is made more difficult." In  response to the views published by Fuhr and Aly, SPD (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) Deputy Chairman Herta  Daeubler-Gmelin, in DIE TAGESZEITUNG of 2 May, forcefully  advocated making the denial and minimization of the Holocaust  punishable under law: "No, this concerns us all. Here it is  essential, also by means of precisely targeted penal code  prohibitions, to set limits which underline and safeguard the  sociopolitical proscription of such conduct." DIE TAGESZEITUNG  of 29 April reported that both the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens  have introduced draft laws in the Bundestag that would  criminalize the "Auschwitz lie."</p>

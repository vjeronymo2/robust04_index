			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE AU PAIR OPTION;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY IS THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG EUROPEANS WITH A CARING  TOUCH  </P> <P> When Anita Madsen and her friend, Tina Harboe, walked into Kokomos, a  Chippendales-style club in Irvine, they bumped into a dozen other young Danish  women -- all au pairs like themselves.  </P> <P> "It was amazing," said Madsen, a 21-year-old from the village of Hjorring.  "Denmark is such a small country and they all seem to be here."  </P> <P> And it's true. Orange County, with the state's second-highest population of  children, is also one of the most sought-after destinations for college-age  Scandinavians and other Europeans who choose the life of the au pair, loosely  translated from French as "on par" or "equal with."  </P> <P> These young men and women seek a break from their college studies, taking a  year off to study American culture firsthand: fast food and freeways, malls and  movies. In exchange for lodging, a little pocket money and weekends off,  they'll baby-sit the kids and do a bit of dusting.  </P> <P> It's impossible to know exactly just how many au pairs are in the United  States, since most entered the country on tourist visas and are working here  illegally.  </P> <P> But unlike most of their Scandinavian sisters, Madsen and Harboe are different:  They're legally here, brought in through a fledgling cultural-exchange program  administered by the U.S. Information Agency.  </P> <P> Under USIA program rules, host families pay an up-front cost of about $3,000,  which includes air fare, orientation and $300 toward education -- au pairs must  take some type of academic class once they're here. Au pairs also get a  tax-free stipend of $100 a week.  </P> <P> When Madsen and Harboe arrived in the United States last summer, visas in hand,  they were part of a platoon-load of newly arrived au pairs. When greeters from  their sponsoring agency dealt out the domestic airline tickets, they were the  only ones in their groups headed for Southern California.  </P> <P> "I had always wanted to come here," said 19-year-old Harboe. "We didn't have  any say in where we would go -- I just got lucky."  </P> <P> Madsen, who came in June, and Harboe, who arrived a month later, were part of  the first classes flown in by the Laguna Beach-based EurAuPair, a nonprofit  foundation operated by the American Scandinavian Student Exchange.  </P> <P> Operated out of a converted apartment that overlooks Main Beach, EurAuPair is  one of only eight groups authorized by the USIA to bring au pairs into the  United States and the only one in Southern California.  </P> <P> And while Los Angeles and its suburbs are the favored destinations, the area is  behind its sophisticated Eastern sisters of New York and Boston in the demand  for au pairs.  </P> <P> "It's relatively new here," said Tammy Fisher, western regional director for  EurAuPair, which placed 500 au pairs by year's end. While the nonprofit  organization has placed au pairs in 30 cities throughout the United States,  only 40 were in Southern California.  </P> <P> "Every one back East knows about au pairs," she said. "But it's not as true  here. We could use lots more families -- especially Southern California  families."  </P> <P> While Joanna Cappelle of El Toro was thumbing through the Saddleback Valley  News last spring, Anita Madsen was a junior college student back in Hjorring,  mulling her career ambitions.  </P> <P> For Cappelle, something in the newspaper just clicked. It was an ad for  EurAuPair, and it offered a better solution than after-school programs for her  two children, Diana, 6, and David, 11.  </P> <P> For Madsen, something clicked in a conversation with her neighbor. The best way  to enhance her chances for a job in international banking, the neighbor  suggested, was to get practical experience using English.  </P> <P> What got them together was Foreign Operations Appropriation Bill 2757. Passed  in September 1988, the bill greatly expanded what had been a two-year  experimental program administered by two East Coast agencies.  </P> <P> The new program increased the number of agencies to eight, and each of these  nonprofit groups is permitted to bring in as many as 2,840 au pairs annually on  J-1 cultural exchange visas.  </P> <P> "I had always wanted an au pair, but I just couldn't hire an illegal," said  Cappelle, a native of Australia. "I would never exploit someone like that."  </P> <P> "I didn't want to come over illegally," said Madsen, who knows countless other  Danish girls who used trans-Atlantic neighborhood "networks" to hook up with  American families as illegal au pairs. Others had told her exactly what to do  to get through the sometimes-tough U.S. immigration. "Have a round-trip ticket  and pack a letter in your suitcase from your 'Auntie.' And never tell them  you're going to work -- say you're a tourist," recited Madsen. A few years ago,  Madsen was a high school exchange student in Upstate New York, and entering the  United States on false pretenses just didn't appeal to her.  </P> <P> "When I heard about EurAuPair, I filled out an application. It was perfect."  </P> <P> Anita's three-page application was on the top of the pile for Don and Joanna  Cappelle. They liked her letter, her age (at 21 she's older than most), her  previous child-care experience and the smiling face that beamed out of the  color snapshots.  </P> <P> The chemistry has worked. "I just love this family," says Madsen. And the  family loves her. An eight-foot-long "Welcome" banner graces Anita's  second-floor bedroom. On her bedside desk sits a handmade pine name plaque -- a  gift from woodwork hobbyist Don.  </P> <P> Mornings at the tree-shaded Cappelle home are Anita's. While the kids are in  school, Anita takes a stationary spin on the Lifecycle or a swim at the nearby  Sun and Sail Club. After doing some grocery shopping or light housework,  Anita's real work begins. It's 2:30, school is out, and Anita is off and  running in the family's blue Volvo.  </P> <P> If it's Monday, it's science class for David. Wednesday is tennis. Tuesdays and  Thursdays are soccer practice for Diana. Friday is ballet.  </P> <P> At night, Madsen shares dinner with the family, then settles down to the  television (she likes "Cosby" and "L.A. Law") and does a little knitting.  </P> <P> Weekends are for sightseeing. Harboe and Madsen load up the Volvo and they're  off -- to Disneyland (twice), the beach (also twice), Sea World and to Marilyn  Monroe's grave. Both felt a twinge of homesickness when they drove to Solvang  -- the Danish immigrant village in the Santa Ynez Mountains. "It was wonderful  to walk down Copenhagen Drive and see the Danish flag," said Madsen, who used  the trip to buy a little piece of home -- 10 packs of SorBits, a Danish chewing  gum.  </P> <P> The employers of Harboe and Madsen say that the girls were answers to their  prayers, but not all such matches are heavenly -- on either side of the  equation.  </P> <P> "I have a friend who's here (illegally) who is very unhappy," Harboe said. "She  just sits in her room -- there's no one to talk to. But if we have a problem,  we just call Vince."  </P> <P> Vince O'Hanlon of Dana Point wears a beeper -- and not just because he's a  mortgage banker.  </P> <P> O'Hanlon is one of several volunteer community counselors for EurAuPair. And as  such, he is part Dad, part Dutch uncle to a dozen or so au pairs.  </P> <P> In the illegal world of au pairs, horror stories abound. One family made their  au pair sleep in the garage. Another paid only $35 a week. Then there are the  au pairs who see living in the United States as one big vacation -- cruising  the bars every night until midnight. Or storming out, bags packed at 9 a.m. on  a Monday morning, leaving the parents in a sitter panic.  </P> <P> But the legal programs are designed to minimize those problems with screening  and orientation for both parent and au pair.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of expectations on both sides," Fisher said. "The au pair  expects a 'Leave It to Beaver' family and it doesn't always turn out that way."  </P> <P> Before the young women (98% are women) even come over, O'Hanlon interviews the  prospective host family. He sizes up their finances, their homes -- au pairs  must have a separate bedroom -- and general suitability. According to Fisher,  EurAuPair's typical Orange County applicant is an affluent two-career couple  from South Orange County with one or two young children.  </P> <P> European care-givers appeal to them, Fisher says, because of their cultural and  educational backgrounds and English proficiency. Some even hope that the au  pair will teach their children a foreign language. "They can even choose the  country," Fisher said.  </P> <P> In Europe, prospective au pairs are also screened. All must be between 18 and  25, speak English, have the equivalent of a high school diploma, some  child-care experience and a driver's license. They also put down a $500 deposit  as a good-faith guarantee that they'll give a year's commitment to the program.  </P> <P> During their orientation programs in the United States, "we tell them what to  expect. And other (au pairs) are there to talk about their experiences,"  O'Hanlon said.  </P> <P> Problems inevitably occur when the au pair must bend to fit into the family  fold.  </P> <P> "The No. 1 problem is getting the children's trust. It just takes a while to  adjust," says O'Hanlon. Another is homesickness.  </P> <P> To help the au pairs get to know each other, O'Hanlon circulates a telephone  list. He also makes frequent 'hi-how-are-you' phone checks. But domestic crises  can blow up in a hurry -- and for the desperate au pair or family -- there's  always O'Hanlon's beeper.  </P> <P> Fisher estimates that 15% of placements don't work out. EurAuPair tries to find  another host family, but if it can't, the au pair must return home -- as was  the case of the program's only male applicant, a young German man who had lived  with an Irvine family for a few unhappy weeks.  </P> <P> The USIA rules also call for reciprocity -- each organization that brings in  Europeans must also seek out young Americans who want to serve as au pairs  abroad. EurAuPair has fewer than a dozen applications on file, and as of now,  no European families who want them.  </P> <P> "Why would they want to hire an American?" says Fisher. "They can get other  European girls so much cheaper -- they only pay $40 a week." But Fisher remains  hopeful that placements can be made in Germany, France or Sweden, where a  weaker dollar and other factors combine to make the transAtlantic plane-fare  tab and $100 weekly stipend more affordable.  </P> <P> Sharon and Michael Schneider of North Tustin aren't quite sure what they'll do  next August when their contract calls for Tina Harboe to go home.  </P> <P> Tina's main role is to look after kindergarten-age Miriam, but she acts as an  older sister and helper to the family's two teen-agers.  </P> <P> Tina is the third au pair for the Schneiders. The two previous ones were  illegal Belgian girls found through an ad in a Belgian newspaper. But, says  Michael, "Tina is by far the best."  </P> <P> "She's become a member of the family. I had three daughters, but now I have  four."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agencies That Sponsor Au Pairs  </P> <P> Under the federal cultural exchange program administered by the U.S.  Information Agency, these eight agencies are permitted to sponsor up to 2,840  au pairs each.  </P> <P> EurAuPair  </P> <P> 250 N.

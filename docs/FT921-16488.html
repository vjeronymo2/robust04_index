			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Price stability, Shakespeare and the life of the gold standard Sir, Walter Eltis ('Sound money - a Dutch treat', December 30) reminds us of the price stability achieved by Britain under the Gold Standard from 1711 to 1931. He does not, however, tell the whole story. For one thing, price stability preceded establishment of the gold standard by at least a century. The crisis of 1695 which Eltis describes was an interruption to monetary stability just like the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars a century later or the world wars this century. In Shakespeare's Henry IV, part 1, written (probably) in 1597 when the inflation of the 16th century had ended, Falstaff incurs the following bill for refreshments at the Boar's Head tavern: 'Item, a capon, 2s 2d; Item, sauce, 4d; Item, sack, two gallons, 5s 8d; Item, anchovies and sack after supper, 2s 6d; Item, bread, a halfpenny'. Even ignoring the fact that a halfpenny of bread was meant as a joke ('O monstrous] but one halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack]'), these numbers would have been familiar to London office workers in the mid-1950s, when the cost of a standard restaurant lunch was 5 shillings. Second, in the 19th century the monetary expansion required by economic growth would never have come about if money stocks had been tied to the availability of gold reserves. What saved the day was financial innovation in the form of banking development which allowed continuous diminution in the ratio of gold to national money supply. The gold standard was an excellent institution, but its long preservation was as much a result of price stability as a cause of it. Peter M. Oppenheimer, Christ Church, Oxon OX1 1DP</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Afghan rebels have closed a critical supply route between the capital of Kabul  and the war-battered eastern city of Jalalabad, a guerrilla group said in  Islamabad, Pakistan. About 1,000 fighters overran four government posts along  the 75-mile road near Sarobi, 30 miles east of the capital, said Masoud  Khalili, a spokesman for the powerful Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla faction.  Earlier this year, Jalalabad was the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting in  the rebels' 11-year war to topple successive Communist regimes. However, the  rebels failed to capture the city.  </P></p>

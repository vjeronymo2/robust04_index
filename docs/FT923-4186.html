			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADERS IN the derivatives market reported a volatile but uneventful start to the new trading account, in which early gains were reversed later in the session due to lack of activity, writes Joel Kibazo. The September future contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened tentatively at 2,377, but then climbed with only a brief pause to reach 2,396 as independent traders moved to close short positions. Sentiment was also boosted by weekend comment from the Bundesbank president that a rise in German interest rates was unlikely at the moment. September traded in a tight range of 2,390 to 2,395 before drifting lower at lunch time. With Wall Street shut for a public holiday, there was little to hold the interest of traders and the contract continued to decline, setting a day's low of 2,373 towards the finish. A small rally just before the close helped September end off the bottom at 2,378, and with the estimated fair value premium to cash now calculated at parity, the contract finished 6 points ahead of the underlying cash market. Turnover was poor at 5,990 lots. Traded options were dull, total volume reaching only 20,456 contracts. . United Biscuits, with 1,780 lots dealt, was the busiest stock option.</p>

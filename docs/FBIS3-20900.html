Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure </H5>   Industrial research is an important element for a  competitive, modern industry; it combines knowledge of basic  research with the requirements of industrial production.  Industrial research is therefore an essential part of the  technological innovation capability in the economy.    The industrial research infrastructure in the united Germany  today faces a double challenge:    Challenge 1: Industrial research needs a technical and  functional adjustment to the altered tasks; this is a result of  the progressive technological development and altered dynamic of  the world market, which further reinforce the pressure for  innovation in industry. First, new subject concentrations are  emerging in research and technology, to which the industrial  research establishments and government R&amp;D funding measures  must  react. Second, it is becoming clear that industrial research  institutions today, more than before, must be understood as  active intermediaries in networks of various industrial partners  and research establishments, and that in so doing basic research  and application development must cooperate more closely than  before--in local as well as globalized industrial connections.    Challenge 2: Simultaneously, an internal German adjustment  of  capacity and structure is necessary. As a result of the change  in systems, industrial research in the new laender has lost its  customers almost completely and is in total upheaval, and  largely in dissolution as well. The sharp economic decline of  the global economy, which now has also reached western German  industry, further led to reduced utilization of western German  industrial research as well. Despite the already completed  downsizing in eastern Germany, the declining demand is today  faced with a relatively large overall German supply potential  for industrial research that lacks industrial contracts. To this  is added a structural problem: Both research systems contributed  similar strengths and weaknesses; today a heated, cutthroat  competition is under way, in which eastern German suppliers are  clearly finding poorer starting conditions.    In order to assure an overall German industrial landscape  that is aimed at the future, is innovation-oriented and benefits  industrial competitiveness, two urgent tasks must be mastered at  the same time:        -  In the short term: The creation of improved competitive  conditions for the remaining industrial research establishments  in eastern Germany--assuming that an approximately equal  distribution between old and new laender is politically intended.    -  In the medium term: A stocktaking, specific adjustment and  further development of the entire German industrial research  landscape.       The following part of the research report called "Industrial  Research Establishments in the FRG With Special Consideration of  Structural Adjustments in the New Laender" is meant as a  contribution to the discussion of requirements for political  action in this field. In the following the outlined discussions  will be shown as having several steps.    The argumentation rests on results of the studies, carried  out jointly by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology  and Innovation Research (ISI) and the Institute for Economic  Research Halle (IWH) in 1991/92 on this subject, which are  documented in the other sections of the research report, and on  assessments of newer results of innovation research.  <H3>  2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New  Political Efforts </H3>   A debate on the future of industrial research in Germany  must  take the following aspects into account:        -  Support for research and technology is a long-term  investment and does not help overcome the current economic  crisis.    -  New technological concentrations and the increasing  interlinking of technologies will mark industrial research  services in the future.    -  New functions of technical research and industrial innovation  are developing.    -  Regions need a mix of industrial research at the "middle"  level  of technology and a "wide range."    -  Industrial research in eastern Germany needs preferential  treatment in order to have a chance to adjust to the double  structural change.    -  A stocktaking and specific restructuring of the  entire German industrial research landscape is  necessary.       These aspects can only be briefly commented on in the  following. A systematic analysis and the design of future  structures for industrial research in Germany will require  significantly greater efforts than were possible within the  framework of this underlying study.  <H3>  Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term  Investment and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis </H3>   The discussions outlined here for the support of research  and  technology are not suitable for helping to overcome the double  crisis of the German economy in the early 1990s, which consists  of the basic adjustment crisis of eastern German industry and  the current economic slump in the western German economy.    Strengthening the technological innovation capability of  industry is a permanent task, whose results become effective  only in the medium and long term. Planning horizons for  stabilization, reorganization and expansion of the industrial  research infrastructure must therefore have a perspective of at  least five to ten years. The buildup of the existing  infrastructure in the old laender took place over three decades  before it reached its present size, and the establishments were  able to assume their present functions in the scientific and  industrial innovation system.    For the infrastructure plans for industrial research in the  area of the new laender today this means--after an urgent,  initial guarantee of a minimum potential in the upheaval phase  of 1989/72, as was shown by the fate of many "research  companies"--that the foreseeable requirements must be the  determining ones at the end of our decade and in transition to  the next millennium. These requirements cannot be exactly  specified in advance, however, partly because the positions of  the German economy in the world market in five years and later  are uncertain, and partly because technological developments  cannot be adequately assessed. However, we can indicate a few  elements in the foreseeable shifts in concentration and altered  function of industrial research in the coming years.  <H3>  New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing  Interlinking </H3>   In the last few years the question of the potential  development of science and technology is again being discussed  and studied in leading industrial nations, above all in the  United States and in Japan, as well as in Europe and in other  OECD nations. A whole series of studies on evaluating the  so-called critical technology fields for the medium-term future  have now been published. They contain more or less extensive  lists of technologies (for example the Commerce Department of  the United States: "Emerging Technology: An Appraisal of the  Technical and Economic Possibilities," 1990; "Report of the  National Committee for Critical Technology" of the United  States, 1991; Ministry of Economics of the Netherlands:  "Experiment in Technology Forecasting," 1991; Economic Planning  Agency, Japan: "Technology and Products in the Year 2010," 1992;  Science and Technology Agency, Japan: "Future Technology in  Japan," 1992). Such studies were produced with the general  objective of being able to concentrate research activities and  government followup measures to those areas of technology, where  a decisive influence on the future problem-solving capability of  the national economies in question is addressed. Such studies  are also under way in Germany at this time (one with medium-term  and one with long-term perspectives), which have not yet been  concluded, however.    What information regarding the innovation process from  medium  and long-term perspectives, and thus for the tasks of industrial  research, can be obtained from such studies, and what  bottlenecks can be perceived? This is, of course a prognostic  and synthetic question, to which there is no ultimate answer,  founded on data.    In general terms, the innovation cycle can be sketched as  that of "intelligent" technology. The universally cheap resource  of petroleum in the postwar era is replaced by the universally  cheap resource of the "chip."    In the discussion of bottlenecks, greater attention must be  paid to the demand factors. Technology monitoring (and sometimes  also technology policy) is tempted to limit itself to the  description and consideration of the potential supply of natural  science technology solutions and the institutions which offer  them. Which technology and which research infrastructure will be  important in the future depends to a great extent on the  anticipated social, ecological and economic problem pressure,  from which important demands on the science and technology of  the future are formulated.    For the purpose of clear arrangement and description, it is  possible to distinguish those fields of technology, which in all  corresponding foreign studies are regarded as essential for the  future innovation capability (a new assessment by the ISI and  the project sponsor, the Federal Ministry for Research and  Technology [BMFT], undertaken at the request of the BMFT, will  soon appear):        -  Advanced materials,    -  manufacturing and production technologies,    -  information technology and electronics,    -  biotechnology,    -  and, above all, technologies in their respective overlapping  areas, such as microsystem technology, nanotechnology, molecular  electronics.       Technology at the beginning of the 21st Century cannot be  divided according to conventional aspects, however; this applies  particularly to application areas. Applications such as future  telecommunications result from progress in both microelectronics  and photonics and are not conceivable without contributions from  software development. This cooperation by technologies is not  basically new, but is spreading more and more and now requires  consequences for the research, technology and innovation  policies. It must be studied whether the research infrastructure  (including the industrial one) and the existing research  administration in Germany must be adapted to the objectively  existing interlinking.  <H3>  New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial  Innovation Develop </H3>   The OECD recently stressed (as a result of its  "Technology/Economy Program") the altered role of industrial  research in the industrialized nations: As an "intermediary  body," it will in the future not only provide the transfer of  knowledge from research to industrial application, but must also  feed back the requirements of industry to basic and  long-term-oriented research. Beyond that, it will have to meet  the--seemingly paradoxical--double challenge of being  increasingly active "on the spot" in local technology-oriented  networks as well as cooperate in "globalized" technology  development contexts ("techno-globalism"), since the production  of knowledge and innovations more and more frequently takes  place in international connections.    This is the result of a structural change for technological  innovations, which now no longer takes place in "new" technology  fields (such as modern biotechnology), but on a broad front, and  to which the industrial and industrially applied research in the  new laender must also submit (see also Box 1). Michael Gibbons  of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) spectacularly called  this supplementation, observed by many innovation researchers,  of the innovation process by a second mode the "transition from  mode 1 to mode 2 of the knowledge production:" Mode 1 describes  a more traditional, "linear," discipline-bound, primarily  internal (within a company or research institute) manner of  producing technological innovation through "applied" research  and development (which in certain fields will continue to be of  importance); mode 2 describes a new form of science-based  innovation processes, which overcomes the conventional  separation of pure and applied research. Elements of the new  form of science production are:        -  Research in connection with application and application  development with feedback to the research base,    -  production of "transdisciplinary" knowledge,    -  heterogeneous form of activities and participating actors,    -  variety of organizational and institutional forms,    -  immediate industrial utilization of the possibilities of new  technical facilities and equipment in research,    -  greater demands for quality and efficiency control.       To begin with, these are very general conclusions, which  need  more precise analysis and specification for individual fields of  technology, research institutions and various industries. It is  certain, however, that a view, organization and promotion of  industrial research that is largely oriented toward traditional  divisions of industrial branches, such as dominates traditional  "joint industrial research," will no longer do justice to the  interconnected character and "transdisciplinary quality" of  increasingly science-linked innovation processes.  <H3>  Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial  Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary. </H3>   In a market for industrial research in Germany, which is  overcrowded in some fields and which furthermore is marked by a  decrease in research contracts from the economy and restrained  government support for industrial research, it is particularly  difficult for these establishments and enterprises in the new  laender to become permanently established: In view of the  extremely unfavorable starting conditions (interrupted relations  with former industrial partners, the lack of capital, uncertain  property conditions, obsolete facilities, the danger of losing  qualified personnel) they regard themselves as exposed to a  fierce, cutthroat competition, although in part they are highly  efficient and willing to achieve.    A future-oriented market strategy includes market analyses  and operating systems, sufficient investments and long-term  business strategies, particularly innovation and technology  strategies. It is precisely in these areas that eastern German  enterprises have major shortcomings. Short-term survival  strategies (such as low-price policies) do not create any  prospects. What is decisive is the correct positioning of one's  own work with respect to the demands of technological  innovations in industry--right now these are undergoing a  radical process of change: World-market-capable products from a  high-price economy such as the German (and other western  European ones) will be even more technology-intensive in the  future than in the past. The "technological intensity" of the  products today increasingly also includes intelligent  interconnection of technologies of very different origin; at the  same time, more and more often knowledge from basic scientific  research flows directly into the development process for new  products (or methods).    The growing "interlinking of technology" and  "science-basing"  creates new challenges for industrial research and development;  small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, thus end up under  pressure to adjust and are looking for support. Industrial  research establishments can provide help here and thus find a  market, if they meet the following demands:        -  Technological interconnection. Intelligent  products require the combination of the most varied  technologies; industrial research must visibly be able to  practice interface management.    -  Interdisciplinary cooperation. More than before,  representatives of various disciplines in the engineering  sciences, the natural sciences and technology management must be  ready for and capable of cooperating.    -  Network orientation. One enterprise is increasingly  less able to offer all the know-how about technology-intensive  products: Formal and informal cooperation between various  partners (companies, research facilities, engineering bureaus,  etc.) in technology networks becomes more important.    -  Simultaneous regional and global orientation.  Industry-related research needs strong roots in the regional  research and industrial environment, but in the respective field  of expertise it must maintain active connections with leading  worldwide developments, for instance through international  research cooperations.   <H3>    Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle'  Level of Technology and a `Wide Range.' </H3>   The conclusions in the preceding step do not make regional  potentials in industrial research at the "middle" technological  level, which are frequently based more on the traditional,  "linear," model, superfluous. Practical experience proves--and  many innovation and regional research studies confirm--that they  continue to form a stabilizing element in modern industrial  structures, whose backbone are active, company-internal R&amp;D  potentials.    In the old laender such capacities have been built up over  decades with massive use of public funding from the Federal  Government and the laender; many of these research  establishments today form the foundation for continued  development toward "science-based" technological innovations.    Which "mix" of industrial research establishments from  various fields of technology and with varying technological  "range" is regionally or nationally necessary? It would take a  great deal of expense systematically to compare, quantitatively  and qualitatively, the existing infrastructure of industrial  research in the old laender with the establishments in existence  right now in eastern Germany, in order to draw conclusions for  planning decisions; this expense could not be justified in the  framework of the analyses undertaken for this report.    But just a glance at the industrial research infrastructure  "mix" of an old land, which is very active in this respect,  makes it clear how large the gap is that yawns between the  situation there and the conditions in the new laender (see Box  2). The desire to build such an infrastructure from scratch in  each of the eastern German laender would take an extraordinary  effort.  <H3>  Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example:  Baden-Wuerttemberg </H3>   The beginnings of government support for industrial research  in the region of the Land of Baden-Wuerttemberg go back far into  the 19th Century. Today, the land (9.6 million inhabitants)  counts the following among its industrial research  establishments:        -  13 Fraunhofer Society institutes,    -  10 joint industrial research institutes,    -  Eight contract research facilities at universities,    -  Two large research establishments,    -  about 100 transfer establishments of the Steinbeis Foundation  (usually) at technical colleges.       These facilities are financed by research income (contract  research, research funding) and by institutional funding from  the Federal Government and the land (in proportions varying  according to the institution).    The Fraunhofer Society institutes in Baden-Wuerttemberg  (1,500 employees) work in the following fields of work, among  others: Information technology, production automation, biomethod  technology, energy technology, construction technology, sensor  technology, materials. The budget of the Baden-Wuerttemberg  institutes was DM 300 million in 1989, approximately one-third  of which was financed on the basis of industrial cooperations.    Divided by industry, the joint industrial research  establishments operate in the following fields: textile and  process technology, clothing industry, textile chemistry,  chemical fibers, tanning, pigments/paints, industrial glass,  precision mechanics/watch technology, microtechnology, fine  metals/metal chemistry, synthetics. The budget volume for these  establishments was DM 46 million in 1989, DM 14 million of which  were based on industrial cooperations.    The contract research institutes at the universities ("An  institutes"), which have only been around for a few years in  this form, are active in the following sectors:  microelectronics, information science, natural sciences-medical  research, laser technology in medicine, application-oriented  knowledge processing, solar energy and hydrogen research,  manufacturing technology. In 1989 the budget for these  institutes was DM 49 million, DM 18 million of which came from  cooperations with the business sector.    The large research establishments (Stuttgart Research Center  of the Aerospace Research Institute, DLR, in the fields of  materials, construction methods, energetics, and Karlsruhe  Nuclear Research Center, KfK, in the fields of environmental  technology, materials research, handling technology, microsystem  technology, nuclear technology), earned about DM 30 million in  income in 1989 through industrial cooperations (with a total  budget of DM 780 million). In connection with the shrinking  institutional support for these establishments from the federal  government, they will make efforts over the next few years to  expand their share of the contract research market.    The technical advisory services and transfer centers of the  Steinbeis Foundation (founded in 1971), in the which professors  and graduates from technical colleges in the region offer  technological advice and development projects in the fields of  flexible automation and production technology, process  technology, electronics/microelectronics, software engineering  and CAD/CAM, in 1989 earned more than 90 percent of their DM 65  million budget from industrial cooperations.  <H3>  Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential  Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double  Structural Change </H3>   The collapse of industrial research in the new laender has  already taken on dramatic proportions. Of the approximately  75,000 researchers active in industry at the beginning of 1990,  at the present time--as reported by representative surveys at  the beginning of October 1992--no more than 15,000 are left in  the new laender. The number of industrial researchers in the new  laender, compared to the old laender, has thus reached a ratio  of 1:15. While in the old laender there are seven researchers  for every 100 industry employees, in the new laender there is  only one. In addition, it must be taken into account that of the  remaining R&amp;D employees one in three works in a job creation  position.    So far, it has not been possible to halt the decline of  R&amp;D  potentials. An extensive inquiry among privatized research  establishments and privatized enterprises gave the result that,  from the end of 1991 until April 1992, a 25 percent decrease in  R&amp;D potential took place, and these companies feared an  additional decrease by mid-1993 by up to 60 percent. In Trust  Agency enterprises, as well, a more rapid drop in R&amp;D  employees  than in general employees is taking place, as confirmed by  reports from the Trust Agency itself.    About half of all industrial R&amp;D employees in the new  laender  are still working in Trust Agency enterprises. Although the  Trust Agency is trying to enforce preservation of the R&amp;D  potential when selling the companies, increasingly more buyers  of industrial enterprises are refusing to take over R&amp;D  employees. The number of enterprises which function as "extended  workbenches" for their mother companies, is growing.    The present development in industrial research runs counter  to the desirable industrial buildup in the new laender. Where  there is a lack of creative research there is also a lack of  innovation, and where no innovations are being brought out there  will also be little investment. Successful innovations presume  immaterial investments and result in material replacement,  rationalization, and expansion investments. For that reason  R&amp;D  must not be regarded as a labor policy task, but as a necessary  investment for the future.    Although basically an original task for the economy, the  federal government and the laender agree that in view of the  extent and the special problems of structural change in the  economy in the new laender, the process of restructuring and  reorganization and expansion of efficient R&amp;D potentials  must be  accompanied by subsidies over a longer period through government  measures. In this sense many attempts at economic and technology  policy are being made to promote the innovation capability of  eastern German enterprises. The BMWi [Federal Ministry for  Economics] and the BMFT are making a large amount of funding  available. But it is still not clear whether these subsidies  will also be available in the medium term (three to five years)  as a prerequisite for self-supporting reconstruction in the new  laender.    In the future it will primarily be the laender which must  bear special responsibility in this process. A glance at the  abundance of existing subsidy measures being offered by the  governments in the old laender (see Box 3) makes it clear how  much eastern Germany still needs to catch up, although the  governments in the new laender are apparently becoming active in  this field, as was documented at another place in this study.    A research landscape is soon destroyed. Rebuilding it is  many  times more expensive than keeping it. For this reason it is  proposed        -  that research potentials be supported on site for a  longer, but defined period of time. The research establishments  need fundamental or basic financing (decreasing), since only a  minor part of the overall costs can be financed from project  support;    -  that a gradually decreasing financial subsidy be assumed for  the next three to five years for the enterprises still under  Trust Agency management. Limiting the subsidy to enterprises  with fewer than 1,000 employees is here counterproductive for  maintaining the R&amp;D potentials.    -  that the subsidy rate in certain cases be increased to 80  percent for enterprises, which due to their limited financial  opportunities cannot generate the required 50 percent of their  own funding and for that reason cannot claim any subsidies;    -  that equal starting conditions be created for eastern German  industrial, independent, research establishments by conveying  ownership of the movable goods as well as property needed for  the business. In addition, cancellation of old debts and  liquidation loans is indispensable.    -  that the support of contract research from west to east (AWO)  be expanded. Utilization of eastern German industrial research  by companies in the processing industries in the old laender has  been less than satisfactory until now. With exactly DM 50  million (as of August 1992), one can only speak of a beginning  of support in awarding contracts to researchers in the new  laender. Measured by the annual amounts given away by  enterprises in the old laender to external research  establishments, the above amount, at not quite one percent, is  very low;    -  that the equality of eastern German R&amp;D facilities in  competing  for the granting of contracts be assured. To that end, more  eastern German scientists should also sit on expert panels.   <H3>    Box 3: Research and Technology Support Activities by the Old  Laender (according to the BDI [Federal Association of German  Industry] Handbook of Research and Innovation Support in 1992) </H3>   Baden-Wuerttemberg        -  Economic support program--Focus on Technology Support    -  The law on subsidizing medium-sized enterprises    -  Technology consulting       Bavaria        -  Technology consulting program    -  Innovation support program    -  Support for economic research    -  Introduction to technology program    -  Medium-sized enterprise credit program    -  Program to support rational energy use    -  Environmental technology support program    -  New Materials research program       Berlin        -  Industrial technology development    -  Innovation fund    -  Science-related technology research    -  Support of R&amp;D in small and medium-sized enterprises    -  Technology consulting    -  Innovation assistant       Bremen        -  Joint R&amp;D program    -  R&amp;D project program    -  Innovation assistant    -  Technical consulting service    -  Medium-sized industry support program    -  Work experience in innovation    -  Acquisition cost subsidy program    -  Researchers in Industry program    -  Support for information and communications technologies       Hamburg        -  Projects in the field of industrial research    -  Innovation promotion program    -  Media and communications technology support program    -  Management assistant    -  Support of R&amp;D projects in the field of artificial  intelligence       Hesse        -  Technology and innovation consulting    -  Rational and nonpolluting energy use    -  Environmental technology program       Lower Saxony        -  Support of R&amp;D projects in the field of product and  process innovation    -  Inventor support    -  Technology consulting    -  Innovation assistant       North Rhine-Westphalia        -  Technology Program Economy    -  Technology consulting    -  Technology Program Energy    -  Technology Program Metallic Materials    -  Future technologies program    -  Innovation assistant    -  Euro-assistant    -  Work experience in innovation       Rhineland-Palatinate        -  Support for economic research    -  Innovation support program    -  Technology consulting    -  Technology introduction program    -  Personnel transfer program, innovation assistant       Saarland        -  Research and technology program    -  Technology consulting    -  Innovation support    -  Innovation assistant       Schleswig-Holstein        -  Support for product innovations    -  Support for special consulting    -  Support for inventions    -  Support for innovation cooperations    -  Support for market analyses and technology studies    -  Introduction of new environmental technologies    -  Support for economic research, development and technology  transfer   <H3>    Stocktaking and Specific Restructuring of the Entire German  Industrial Research Landscape </H3>   In the old FRG a relatively differentiated system of  industrial research had developed since the 1960s; important  elements are the institutes for joint industrial research, the  Fraunhofer Society institutes, the universities, the technical  colleges and increasingly the major research establishments. In  the former GDR industrial research was organized completely  differently, but it also had--something which is crucial  here--comparatively high-quality research resources, above all  in human capital.    Today, more than two years after the German unification, the  all-German industrial research is facing a challenge with  respect to volume: The uncontrolled decline of industrial  production in the new laender is accompanied by a continued  cutback in industrial research in eastern Germany. The sharp  economic slump in the global economy, which has now reached the  western German industry as well, also causes a shrinking demand  for the services of western Germany industrial research.    To this is added a structural problem: A comparison of  technological specialization models in eastern and western  Germany for the year immediately before the unification shows  that both research systems demonstrate similar strengths and  weaknesses, so that there were scarcely any positive  complementary effects. On the contrary; a violent cutthroat  competition began, in which eastern German workers clearly had  the inferior starting conditions.    What could have happened even at the time of the German  unification must take place now: The entire German industrial  research infrastructure should be subjected to a thorough  stocktaking        -  on the demand side, meaning with a view to the  foreseeable (as well as desirable with respect to industrial  policy) industrial demand for research work,    -  on the supply side, meaning with a view to existing and  development-capable potentials,    -  institutionally, meaning with a view to proven or obsolete  financing, organization and cooperation models,  respectively.       Since this has already in part been done as regards the  eastern German infrastructure, this challenge applies  particularly to the western German system. It should be  connected with the attempt to describe the entire German market  for research and development services in terms of quantity as  well (see Box 4).    Several reasons argue in favor of such a revision:        -  Until now there has been no sufficiently detailed, in  terms of quantity and quality, and at the same time clear  picture of the entire German infrastructure of industrial  research, but such an overview represents an indispensable  foundation for planning and decisions in research and innovation  policy.    -  There are accumulating indications that the spending for  research and technology development in Germany is stagnating or  even declining. The public research budgets have grown  disproportionately with the German unification, that is to say,  in relative terms they have shrunk. Research spending by the  economic sector hardly grew in real terms in the last three  years--after high growth rates in the 1980s--and the number of  employed research personnel in the old laender from 1989 to 1991  dropped by 2.9 percent a year (according to the Expert Report on  Economic Statistics 1992). Under these conditions there is also  a stagnation of external R&amp;D spending by enterprises--and  hence  the field of action for industrial research.    -  The system of government actors is fragmented; there is a  lack  of coordination between department politics and of a clear  division of duties between regional, national and European  R&amp;D  policies.    -  There are scarcely any long-term and strategically designed  guidelines, either in industry or in research and technology  policy.    -  The mobility between the subsystems of the research system  (for  example between industrial research, economic research, academic  operation) and in international connections is insufficient.    -  The politically offered incentive systems are now no longer  sufficiently capable of adjustment or creative; it is felt that  their concepts are no longer specific enough.       In the event the proposed extensive stocktaking of the  business-oriented research system should finally lead to a  reorganization, several factors are unavoidable:        -  A restructuring of industrial research must take place  with a view to the position and opportunities of German industry  in the world market. In so doing, one must balance which  weaknesses in the technological performance profile can  realistically be overcome by the industry and by government  support for industrial research, and which market sectors will  remain unconquerable.    -  The existing industrial structures and industrial  concentrations in eastern and western Germany, insofar as they  are competitive or harbor strong potential for future success,  must be treated as constants in the decision about research  infrastructures.    -  The restructuring must treat German industrial research as a  part of the larger infrastructure of the European Community and  also with a view to Central and Eastern Europe.       It is of basic importance here that the state cannot  "execute" this restructuring process but should primarily  moderate and, during recognizable bottlenecks, provide support  through institutional funding for necessary research facilities  and time-limited subsidy programs.  <H3>  Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and  Development in the Old Laender </H3>   An exact description of the market for R&amp;D services  creates  difficulties in several respects, which are mentioned elsewhere  (see PROGNOS/ISI: "R&amp;D Cooperations by Small and Medium-Sized  Enterprises, Basel/Karlsruhe, 1991). Including the new laender  makes little sense, since the corresponding data are still  incomplete and the dynamic of negative change continues to be  strong (See Expert Report on Economic Statistics: "Research and  Development in the Economy, Results and Assessments 1991-92").    The data available for the old laender show stagnation,  after  impressive growth in research spending in the economy in the  1980s and an absolutely and relatively significant growth in  external research tasks since the beginning of the 1990s. This  is undoubtedly a reflection of the slowdown in economic growth.  Experience in innovation research ("interlocking technologies,"  "science-linking") allows for the assumption, however, that the  proportion of external R&amp;D spending (about 10 percent)  reached  today will no longer decrease but perhaps might even grow.    More precise analyses here show that the predominant part of  external company spending flows not to government-supported  research infrastructures but to other companies--a clear  indication of the interconnection of industrial technology! As  is well known, the entry into the R&amp;D market is made easier  for  government-supported institutions through programs which offer  financial support for cooperation between industry and science.    Under these framework conditions it cannot be anticipated  that eastern German establishments should rapidly be able to  capture, on their own, an appreciable share of the all-German  R&amp;D market.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage gloom for the self-employed / A look at the limited options available AS MORTGAGE lenders sit poised waiting for a housing market recovery, the self-employed and those whose earnings are not regular are finding it no easier than before to get a loan. Lenders who had their fingers burnt in the credit-happy 1980s are understandably more cautious. The weak housing market has hit their own mortgage books, while the recession has made them extra careful about the prospects for those who run their own business or depend on commission income. Ian Darby, of mortgage broker John Charcol, believes the clampdown could have gone too far. 'A gradual process which started two years ago is now reaching its peak,' he said. 'It is a very tough market for the self-employed.' Some types of lending are no longer obtainable - including 'non-status' loans, where lenders were prepared to grant up to 65 per cent of a home's cost without references. These mortgages, regarded now as the most irresponsible of all, disappeared in the mid-'80s. 'Self-certification' loans have diminished, too. These involved applicants putting up a large deposit - usually 25 or 30 per cent of the loan - and giving details of their income or spending. The lender would not normally seek to verify income but would want to see a previous credit reference. While variants on this type of loan remain available, they are sparse and mostly from centralised lenders. For self-employed applicants, the standard minimum demand from the large building societies is to see three years' fully-audited accounts. 'That time scale gives them time to become established, and indicates to us the income they are taking from the business,' said the Halifax building society, Britain's biggest lender. 'We would expect a regular income from the business by the third year - that is what we are interested in.' The Halifax will consider giving a loan to those whose business has been running for three years but can produce accounts for only two. It will not accept those working on commission. But Alliance &amp; Leicester says that if the commission is regular, it will consider a maximum loan based on half the annual commission earnings. Abbey National, the second-largest lender, says it wants proof the self-employed can afford to make regular payments. It also requires three years' audited accounts, but says there is flexibility in cases where the company has been formed because of a split. Abbey adds: 'We take a view on the business too, - we look for signs of how robust it is.' Ian McKenna, of mortgage broker Blyth McKenna, says some people may find that the bank handling their business deals might consider providing a mortgage on more flexible terms than the societies. And some of the centralised lenders - which fund their businesses through the wholesale markets instead of deposits - may be willing to give loans on less rigorous terms than the societies. Centrebank, a division of Bank of Scotland, has a 'special status' loan for those with a minimum deposit of 30 per cent. Applicants state the nature of their employment and the bank will take up a previous lender's reference (although first-time buyers will also be considered) and a bank reference. It would not usually want confirmation of income. The application fee is Pounds 200. Self-employed people wanting more than 70 per cent of the purchase price need to provide a letter from an accountant stating their income for the previous three years, and a set of the past year's accounts. Capital Home Loans, the UK mortgage arm of Credit Foncier de France, does not ask for detailed accounts although it will contact the accountant to verify the details supplied by the self-employed person - who must have been in business for at least three years. The maximum proportion lent will be 75 per cent of the value of the house, up to Pounds 150,000. Re-mortgages also are considered, to a maximum of 70 per cent of the value. The completion fee is Pounds 175 and the mortgage-holder pays a quarter percentage point above the present standard variable rate of 7.95 per cent. But first-time buyers are not eligible. Earlier this month, Prudential launched a mortgage for the self-employed. It requires a letter from the accountant confirming that the business has been trading for 12 months and that the applicant can afford the payments. The loan is for a maximum of 75 per cent of the purchase price and there is an arrangement fee of Pounds 250. While the interest rate is 9.8 per cent, the Pru says this is due to come down soon. The Bank of Ireland and UCB also accept self-employed people on flexible terms. However, the choice in the market is not wide. McKenna blames the problem generally on 'a knee-jerk reaction to what has gone on in previous years when lenders generally abused the non-status facility in order to gain market share.' He adds: 'Those picking up the tab now are the good customers in the self-employed market.'</p>

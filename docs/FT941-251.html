			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / PLO leaders deny activists opened fire first PLO leaders in Gaza emphatically denied yesterday that the six Fatah activists shot dead by Israeli undercover troops in the Jeblaya refugee camp on Monday night had opened fire first on the soldiers, and Israeli military officials appeared to backtrack on their earlier claims that the soldiers had come under fire. The military officials, having initially claimed their troops opened fire on the uniformed Fatah activists only after being shot at themselves, revised their account, saying only that since the Fatah men were armed, the soldiers feared for their lives. The Gaza killings triggered a furious backlash in the occupied territories, with at least one Palestinian killed and more than 50 injured.</p>

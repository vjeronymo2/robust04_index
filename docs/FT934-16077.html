			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Plans set to simplify NHS management structure PLANS TO reshape the central management structure of the National Health Service will be announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, next month. A simplification of the higher levels of NHS management could lead to substantial job losses in regional health authorities and the service's Leeds-based management executive. Mrs Bottomley told the Conservative conference yesterday that her proposals would reduce the number of health authorities. 'They will both simplify and clarify structures, and provide more resources for patient care.' Since the summer ministers have been considering the report of the functions and manpower review, a committee set up to look at the service's higher-level management needs following the market-based 1991 NHS reforms. The committee's report presented a range of options. But ministers appear to favour reducing the 14 English regional health authorities to about eight. These would be amalgamated with regional outposts of the management executive which have, since 1991, liaised with trust hospitals. A subsequent stage of the restructuring exercise could lead to the abolition of regional authorities as separate statutory bodies. Slimming down the central management structure would offer Mrs Bottomley the immediate advantage of being able to divert funds into clinical services at a time of severe public spending constraints. Supporters of the market-based philosophy behind the NHS reforms believe a smaller central structure would increase the freedom of trust hospitals and district purchasing authorities. But the abolition of regional authorities would be challenged by campaigners for greater democratic accountability in the NHS. Regional authorities' non-executive members, while not elected, are chosen to reflect community interests. Mrs Bottomley announced yesterday that a further 99 NHS trusts will become operational next April, bringing to 389 the number of hospitals, community and ambulance services run directly by their local managements. By April, trusts will be responsible for more than 90 per cent of hospital and community health service revenue. Mrs Bottomley will make decisions on a further 44 trust applications later this year. Mrs Bottomley said trust status - which removes hospitals from the control of district health authorities - had benefited patients. Waiting times had been reduced, and 116 patients were being treated compared to 100 before the switch to trust status. Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said the health secretary had recognised in her conference speech that there had been a substantial increase in NHS productivity, but this had not been matched by the necessary increase in resources.</p>

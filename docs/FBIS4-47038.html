			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Semenova: "Power or No Power?"] </F>   [Text] The first day of the work of the third session of  the oblast soviet proceeded in a situation of  self-definition--of the status and character of the new  representative organ and the style of its interaction with the  oblast administration.    The debates began in the first hour of work with a  discussion  of an organizational question--on election of the soviet's  deputy chairman. A candidate for this post was actually  nominated at the last session. It was A.A. Kiselnikova, who was  nominated as an alternate in the election of the chairman. But  this time she was not even considered. Soviet chairman A.P.  Sychev presented another candidacy for the deputies'  consideration--that of V.Ya. Karpov--and he suggested that it be  included on the list for a secret vote. The deputies know  Vladimir Yakovlevich well, as they say, from the positive side,  and no ill-considered questions arose regarding this. Slight  confusion was caused by something else--the "list" consisting of  one candidate, when we had already become accustomed to a choice  in elections. But nobody considered this significant in and of  itself. One is one, and if you need to have another  one--nominate him. There were no nominations. And perhaps  everything would have proceeded calmly to the secret voting  booths had V. Karpov not succumbed to the temptation to give a  political speech. His role in the soviet leadership is  organizational, something like that of the leader of the  apparatus, as Deputy K. Komarov observed. And this dictates the  demand for a particular qualities in the candidate--the ability  to work with all the deputies, regardless of their political  image.    A rapid-fire discussion followed. Deputy N. Krasnikov  "reminded" Karpov of his position when discussing the question  of the Agreement on Social Accord, which was not supported by  the majority of the soviet, and expressed the doubt that a  deputy who did not agree could organize harmonious work.    Nikolay Grigoryevich expressed the desire that the soviet  not  be an arena for political battle but an organ of common sense,  since all the deputies had come to the soviet to work on oblast  problems.    A.G. Chastikin supported his colleague in this by saying--I  became a deputy only to finally put an end to the conflicts with  Moscow. I do not think that every individual should have to have  a position or be able to defend it.    Deputies I.A. Lyuzenkov and V.Ye. Kuznetsov spoke in the  same  spirit.    V.Ya. Karpov was elected to the post of deputy chairman of  the soviet by an absolute majority of votes.    To an outside observer another organizational point was  discussed too long and too heatedly--the structure of the  apparatus of the oblast soviet. It seemed to me that the fire of  passions was kindled by the soviet chairman himself.  Meticulously discussing all kinds of shifting of figures from  one committee to another and hinting at self-sacrificing  readiness to reduce the apparatus which was not exactly bloated  in the first place, to shatter the life of a typist or a  consultant. It was as though Sychev were inviting the deputies  to work with him on the staff roster. But the deputies were too  sluggish in getting into the argument and without any enthusiasm  voted for the reduction that was actually proposed by Sychev  himself.    They debated how best to use the funds allotted for the  organization of deputy activity--to hire staff assistants for  deputies or to distribute these funds so that the deputy could  pay for his own one-time assistance within their limits. There  is no big difference here.    Deputy A. Kiselnikov somewhat "tore apart" the discussion of  the estimated expenditures of the oblast soviet. He was put on  his guard by the fact that the salaries of apparatus  functionaries were very modest; the chairman's, for example, is  little more than 300,000. But they actually receive much larger  amounts. There is a system of various increments, including  bonuses for intensiveness of work, material aid, etc.    But in spite of their wishes the deputies were unable to  find  a great deal of excess in the actions of the soviet  apparatus--they approved the estimate of expenditures.    There was a more fundamental discussion which lasted both  days of the session--about jurisdiction and cooperation between  the oblast soviet and the oblast administration.    In general Novosibirsk leaders, to their credit, have never  become involved in dividing up power. They have calmly adopted  the doctrine of separation of powers, dividing up responsibility  without grievances. State organs at the regional level have  hardly any rights at all. But it was not by their will that the  situation changed. The new normative acts, above all the  Constitution, without formally abolishing political slogans,  including those about separation of powers, actually  restructured the state mechanism, concentrating power and  distribution functions actually in the hands of one branch--the  executive.    But what about popular rule? Write it off as a grimace of  socialism? Nothing will be written off. It is simply that this  concept in the political lexicon has unobtrusively been replaced  by a more amorphous one--power not of the people but of  representatives of the people. Let this representative power  express its interests, but it shall have no active levers of  power.    But, paradoxical as it may be, at the same time the status  of  regional representative organs has become greater. Now the  soviet's decisions of a legal, normative nature are being  adopted in the form of oblast laws that are mandatory for  execution, including by the oblast administration.    To be sure, the mechanism for this kind of abiding by the  law  is fairly complicated. In particular, the laws adopted by the  soviet at the session are leafed through and okayed for  publication, and thus for enactment, by the head of the oblast  administration. But not as an official but as a state organ  (analogous to the president).    Certain points of the Regulations of the Oblast Soviet which  were discussed at the session turned out to be vulnerable. This  document was certainly not for internal use. The chairman of the  committee on legislation and interaction with organs of local  self-government, V.Ye. Kuznetsov, defended the regulatory act he  submitted for the consideration of the soviet. His cautious  reaction to the active participation in the discussion of the  document by the first deputy chief of the of administration,  V.N. Kiselev, aggravated the situation to a certain degree.  Kuznetsov perceived all of Kiselev's attempts to check one or  another point of the document against the legal base as a  attempt on the part of the administration to patronize the  soviet.    But Kiselev zealously defended the independence of the  administration. The wording "to hear the report from the  administration" evoked an immediate reaction: "name the  document." Unfortunately, the oversight functions of the oblast  soviet today are confirmed by only one law--"On the Kray and  Oblast Soviet and the Kray and Oblast Administration," adopted  back in pre-October times.    It is difficult to understand why V. Kiselev had such a hard  time with the word "report," especially to the people's  representatives. For behind each deputy stand about 40,000  voters. And certain of them have the population of more than one  rayon behind them.    The debates with the administration represented by the first  deputy chief continued even during the item-by-item reading of  the Law "On Supporting the Activity of the Deputy of Novosibirsk  Oblast" and they became even more heated upon the adoption of  the Law on Legislative Activity in Novosibirsk Oblast. Oblast  Procurator V. Tokarev, who often spoke as if in a duet with  Kiselev, also reacted very strongly to the second document.    "I do not want the soviet to put itself in a ridiculous  position," Kiselev explained his rash reaction.    But this could also be perceived as an attempt to distance  himself from the soviet, assigning it a strictly advisory role  in joint activity on oblast problems.    But all the passions surrounding power become less  respectable and petty when it comes to the budget. What is power  without money? Illusion! In order to receive anything at all it  is necessary to invest at least something. Before dividing it is  necessary to multiply. Or at least save up. Money arises out of  the production of goods and services. And in the past two years  production has had a steady tendency toward decline. Hence the  reduction of receipts into the revenue side of the budget. After  all, most of the receipts are from taxes, and from  enterprises--profit tax. And although unnatural savings from  reducing production have unnatural qualities of a reverse  dependency of the volume of production and profit (the lesser  the volume, the higher the profit), the absolute amount of  profit still decreases. And costs increase. The classical items  remain and the exclusively modern, as it were, costs "of keeping  body and soul together" are constantly growing. For both the  producer and the consumer.    In the draft budget submitted by the oblast administration  for the consideration of the deputies one can see titanic  efforts to reduce the budget deficit. The administration was  able to take advantage of the rights granted to it for flexible  use of the local taxation mechanism and submitted for the  consideration of the soviet the oblast statute "On Rates of Tax  on Profit and Tax on Property of Enterprises and Organizations  and the State Duty on Registration of Enterprises With Foreign  Investments." The oblast soviet approved this statute and gave  its okay to further work in this area, in particular, for the  development of differentiated taxation and the granting of tax  exemptions in keeping with the priority areas of the development  of the oblast economy.    And the oblast priorities are apparent from the picture of  expenditures that was presented.    The oblast budget is to receive a total of only R970.461  billion in 1994. This includes transfers from the republic  budget. The expenditure side is balanced with the revenue side.    The following opinion was expressed at the session: Perhaps  it is not worth it to live within our means and we should  include all our real needs in the budget. That is, show the  deficit in such a way as to complain to the federal authorities.  Perhaps then they will bring our per capita consumption up to  the average. After all, today all budget expenditures on one  person of Novosibirsk amount to barely half of what a person  from Omsk receives, and they cannot even be compared to what  they get in Kemerovo.    Our serious politicians from the oblast soviet decided not  to  play those cheap games and to conduct themselves in a  businesslike manner: to spend what they get.    The administration proposed a system of priorities for  budget  expenditures. Fully in keeping with the amendments to the  economic policy and common sense, it suggested supporting the  producer with any form of property. And of the producers the  agrarians should be rescued first of all.    In the draft budget proposed by the administration it was  suggested that funds be especially allotted for advance sale of  gain from the new harvest and support of animal husbandry so  that in the future it would have strength enough to be revived.  It was suggested that a subsidy of R100 billion be used for  these purposes.    Speaking at the session, the chairman of the Committee on  Land Questions and Agrarian Policy, Deputy A.A. Stepanov,  doubted the feasibility of giving priority to the agrarian  sector, seeing in the draft budget further deterioration of the  economic and particularly the financial situation of the rural  commodity producer.    If the consolidated 1993 budget envisioned for agriculture  13.4 percent of the overall expenditure side, in 1994 it was  only 6.5 percent. On the whole, the expenditure side of the  budget, taking inflation into account, increased 5.5-fold, and  subsidies for the production of animal husbandry  products--1.6-fold.    Stepanov's arguments were knocked down by representatives of  the administration, who found other figures for  comparison--based on the real production volume, which had  dropped sharply in agriculture during the year.    But the remark was so out of the context of reality that  nobody even bothered to object to Melnikov.    The next heated point of the discussion was the allotment of  8 billion from the budget for private entrepreneurship. The  deputies had not forgotten the first series of economic acts for  support of private business, as a result of which state funds  were simply squandered through private pockets. And this is why  now the deputies demanded information about the existence of a  program for private entrepreneurship.    One can understand why the deputies were so meticulous in  discussing forthcoming expenditures. As with wisdom: The  administration was reminded of what it had "forgotten" and thus  shortchanged many areas. Including culture, education, etc.    After which followed V. Kiselev's explanation that in nature  there are always two kinds of budgets: the budget of development  and the budget of current maintenance. And for several years now  we have been working exclusively on a budget for survival.    But not having an opportunity to work for development, we  are  curtailing the possibilities of survival as well.</p>

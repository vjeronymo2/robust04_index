			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> SIGLER PARK AREA ENJOYS RENAISSANCE  </P> <P> People who live near Sigler Park once feared the place, with its crime,  vandalism and gangs. The gang problems became so severe that in 1986, the city  canceled all organized recreation activities there.  </P> <P> Now, thanks to the efforts of the city and a group of neighbors, Sigler Park  has rebounded. Police say crime is down, a once-serious graffiti problem has  been nearly eradicated and the city has brought back the park's recreation  program.  </P> <P> "Sigler Park is not as much of a concern to police as it once was," said  Officer Mitch Waller, assistant to Police Chief James Cook. "The gang that once  frequented the area does not congregate at the park any more. While gang crime  is increasing in the city, it has decreased in the Sigler Park area."  </P> <P> This is a far cry from the climate of Feb. 25, 1979, when a 24-year-old man was  shot to death as he walked through Sigler Park. In 1988, two former gang  members from the area were later convicted of the slaying, said Westminster  Police Detective Michael Proctor. That same year, the neighborhood around the  park was rocked by the death of 18-year-old Frank Martinez, who was shot by  police in the back yard of his home during a scuffle at a birthday party.  </P> <P> Most of the hostility directed toward the police in the aftermath of that  shooting appears to have faded.  </P> <P> "What we're finding in the Sigler Park area is that in our contact with the  citizens, we have a better rapport," Waller said.  </P> <P> Much of the transformation is being credited to a neighborhood organization  called Manos Unidas, which means United Hands in Spanish. The group was  originally formed to provide support to Martinez's family after his death, said  Vera Palomino, who founded the group with her husband, Jay.  </P> <P> The group has since widened its focus and successfully lobbied the city to  begin an evening recreation program for teens. Group members have coordinated  cleanup drives at the park and have raised money for scholarships and  excursions for local youths.  </P> <P> As a result of their work, the Palominos will be honored March 25 by the Orange  County Human Relations Commission for "fostering mutual understanding and  respect among people."  </P> <P> "People got tired of reading about how bad Sigler Park was with gangs," Vera  Palomino said. "It had gotten to the point where the bad kids had taken over  the park and no one would take a stand. It's just a very few who give the park  a bad name. What we're trying to do is give the park a better name."  </P> <P> City Manager Jerry Kenny said the city is trying to help by repaving streets,  installing a sidewalk around the park and making improvements to the restroom  and barbecue areas. New playground equipment is due in about a year.  </P> <P> "We're trying to show the people out there that we care," Kenny said. "The  people who live around there have been instrumental in making it a better area  and have been working with the city to get the work done."  </P> <P> Now, on most weekday afternoons, the park off Olive Street near Westminster  Boulevard is filled with children. Recreation leader Sandy Martinez said the  program is important to them because many come from low-income families.  </P> <P> "A lot of these kids are waiting for us each day," she said. "They don't have  many toys to play with at home."  </P> <P> While Martinez and co-worker Christina Hoffman organize afternoon activities  such as sports and arts and crafts for children under 13, John Rey Adame  operates the teen program on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.  </P> <P> The program has been temporarily suspended because Adame was in a car accident  last month. He is scheduled to return March 21 and resume his "rap sessions"  and racquetball, handball and basketball tournaments.  </P> <P> "The older kids were being neglected as far as having organized activities at  the park," Palomino said. "From what we see and hear, John Rey has made a big  difference. You don't see graffiti like you used to and you don't see the older  men in their 20s drinking beer at the park and leaving behind their bottles. I  think word has gotten around that Sigler Park isn't the place to do that kind  of thing any more." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

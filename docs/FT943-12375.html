			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Russian rocket engines for India Russia has agreed to sell seven cryogenic rocket engines to India, in spite of US objections, an Indian government minister said yesterday. Mr Raghunandan Lal, minister of state for external affairs, told parliament in New Delhi that the rocket engines would not be accompanied by a transfer of technical data. Mr Lal's assurances contrast with the claims by Indian scientists last year that drawings and other technical specifications had been acquired from Russia. The US had protested that the deal, worth about Dollars 250m (Pounds 160m), violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, which seeks to halt the spread of rocket technology, particularly to the developing world. Russia, initially adamant that it would go ahead, then suspended the deal. Mr Lal said the deal stipulated the delivery of four rocket engines now and three later. Cryogenic rockets are powered by low-temperature fuels such as liquid hydrogen and oxygen. India, a key non-communist ally of the former Soviet Union, is widely believed to be a nuclear threshold power, currently engaged in the production of its own nuclear delivery system.</p>

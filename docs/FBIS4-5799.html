			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe, an influential figure in the top opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), on Thursday reaffirmed his  strong interest in succeeding outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    "I'm watching whether (the ruling coalition parties) will be  able to adjust their policies while sticking to the coalition  framework," Watanabe told reporters.    He also said he wanted to appeal to the people to rescue the  country from difficulties, and said party or faction ambitions  should be put aside to this end.    On possible talks with LDP President Yohei Kono, who has  vowed to run in the premiership race in the Diet as the party's  candidate, Watanabe reacted reluctantly, saying "now is not the  time to meet with him."    Watanabe's bid to become prime minister has brought the LDP  to the verge of a major split, political sources said.    Watanabe's faction, which is beefing up its campaign to  promote their leader as a successor to Hosokawa, meanwhile has  rallied some 50 House of Representatives lawmakers of the LDP,  including 36 of its 45 faction members, behind Watanabe, faction  sources said.    The faction, the fourth largest among the LDP's five  factions, is aiming to collect signatures from some 100 LDP  members of the powerful lower house, supporting a call for  faction members to back Watanabe, they said.    The leading opposition party holds 219 seats in the  511-member lower chamber.    Shinseito and Komeito, two of the key parties in the ruling  coalition, once deemed Watanabe as the leader of a possible new  coalition grouping, because of his political savvy and  influence, political sources said.    Although Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads Shinseito,  has emerged as the most likely successor to Hosokawa, the seven  ruling coalition parties remain divided over the process by  which a new premier will be selected.    Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday over  financial  improprieties.</p>

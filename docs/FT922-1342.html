			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / New Spanish foreign minister MR Javier Solana was named as Spain's new foreign minister yesterday, taking over from Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, who stepped down because of ill health after holding the post for seven years, Reuter reports from Madrid. Mr Solana, 49, who is considered a close associate of the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, had been education minister since 1988. He takes over foreign affairs only days before a European Community summit in Lisbon, amid uncertainty over plans for EC political and economic union in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.</p>

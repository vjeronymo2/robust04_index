			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BARNETT WILL REMAIN COACH AT TRABUCO HILLS  </P> <P> Jim Barnett, football coach at Trabuco Hills High School, said Monday that he  has turned down an offer to coach football at Big Sky High School in Missoula,  Mont.  </P> <P> Barnett, who has been coach at Trabuco Hills since the school opened in 1985,  was offered a contract by Big Sky last week after his hiring was approved by  the district school board.  </P> <P> "I had an opportunity, but it would have meant giving up everything I had  worked for here," Barnett said. "Montana is where I grew up and I wanted to try  coaching up there. But I have a lot of support from the parents at Trabuco  Hills and it would be tough leaving the kids."  </P> <P> Barnett has guided the Mustangs to consecutive Southern Section championships.  The Mustangs beat Orange for the Division VII championship last fall and  defeated Woodbridge for the Desert-Mountain Conference title in 1988. CHRIS  FOSTER  </P></p>

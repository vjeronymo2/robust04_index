The plea for overseas help came as Coal Industry Minister  Wang Senhao outlined the major new plans in Beijing yesterday.    The plans include an 800-kilometre pipeline for liquefied  coal [slurry], which will be built with funds and technology  from the United States, Wang said.    A feasibility study for the pipeline--linking Mengxian in  the  coal-rich province of Shanxi to Weifang in Shandong Province--is  being done jointly by Chinese and Americans.    The project is expected to help reduce pollution and improve  coal combustion efficiency, Wang said.    To date, the industry has spent more than $4 billion from  countries such as Japan, the United States, France and Sweden.    And Wang said more Sino-foreign coal-mining joint ventures  will be established.    The industry dug 1.14 billion tons of coal in 1993, 25.5  million tons more than in the previous year.    Production this year is expected to be 1.16 billion tons,  but  Wang predicted the national economy in the year 2000 will need  1.4 billion tons a year.    So the industry will build more efficient mines in the next  seven years, he said.    In 1993, 14.3 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) was used to dig  16  mines, capable of producing 11.2 million tons of coal.    This year, 18 mines able to produce 32 million tons a year  will go into operation.    Wang said the coal industry will welcome investments from  other sectors like railways, power generators, metallurgy and  chemicals.    Chinese coal mines, which used to fulfill limited State  quotas, will now be allowed to launch power plants and build  railways, the minister said.    More than 75 percent of China's energy comes from coal and  hundreds of millions of tons are carried across the provinces  by train, adding to the rail bottleneck.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Contracted Business Services (1): Recession's silver lining - Rather than damaging the business support services sector, the recession may have given it a boost. More companies are concentrating on core businesses, contracting out other operations for a better use of capital and personnel INSOLVENCY specialists, it seems, are not the only breed of business to flourish during recession. The drive within companies to improve efficiency and cut costs without compromising quality has given fresh impetus to a fast-developing sector of the economy. Call it contracted business services, facilities management or outsourcing, the process by which companies hive off non-core activities to outside specialists is one which was already set to become an everyday part of the vocabulary of modern management. Pre-recession forecasts suggested that the total business support services sector in Britain could be worth Pounds 80bn a year by the year 2000, roughly twice the present estimated level. Leading players in the business support sector claim that the tough economic situation has concentrated corporate minds to their advantage. Increasingly, companies are tending to concentrate on the business they know best - 'sticking to their knitting' as one management guru has described it - while stepping up the search for greater cost-efficiencies. The resulting, gradual change in management culture, combined with the opening up of new public sector markets for the support services companies, has produced a contra-cyclical increase in their business. Mr Peter Davies, commercial director of BET Contract Services, one of the UK's largest business contracting operations, says conditions are 'absolutely booming' as growing numbers of companies wake up to the benefits of utilising professionally managed external support services. Serco, the international task management contractor, says the recession has led directly to more companies contracting out elements of their business and reports the winning of contracts from big-name clients such as Marks and Spencer, British Aerospace and British Steel. Drake &amp; Scull Technical Services, the business support arm of Drake &amp; Scull Engineering, recently reached agreement with British Airways to maintain all the airline's buildings, facilities and specialist equipment at Heathrow and Gatwick airports for 10 years. The deal is thought to be one of the largest 'total provider' contracts yet signed in the UK. The potential for facilities management in particular, the area of activity most directly associated with the care and control of physical assets, has recently been highlighted in a study by the Building Services Research and Information Association. BSRIA identified significant prospects for facilities management but concluded that the UK market was still at an early stage in its development. It added: 'The potential is obviously vast. With a typical contract value of between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 2m, if only 1 per cent of the 30,000 large industrial, retail and commercial sites in the UK take out a facilities management contract, the market would be worth Pounds 300m in the private sector alone.' The growing importance of facilities management is also reflected in the decision of the Confederation of British Industry to join with the Association of Facilities Managers in organising a three-day conference in London which starts next Tuesday. Unlike most trade shows, the event has doubled in size since last year. As the support services sector grows, so its parameters are expanding. A study conducted by the Henley Centre for Forecasting on behalf of Rank Xerox Business Services, one of the many recent newcomers to the sector, concluded that the phenomena of contracting out security, cleaning and catering will extend to other areas, requiring more highly-skilled managerial capabilities. There is plenty of evidence that the broadening process is already well under way. A service that was initially property-oriented now extends to most aspects of personnel management, through legal and accounting services to marketing, sales, distribution and information technology systems. Also, there will be new markets to conquer. The recent sea-change in political thinking has already opened up local government contracts to the disciplines of private sector competition and the process is gathering pace. The government has now also published its proposals for exposing central government organisations to the same process. Departments will be expected to set annual targets for putting new areas of activity out to tender and to publish progress reports. The new regime has been put to the test and the Treasury says average cost savings of 25 per cent have already been achieved. Savings from contracting out will be ploughed back into improving services. There will added opportunities still further afield. The European Commission has produced single market proposals for the procurement of 28 identified services by central, regional and local governments throughout the community. The result will be to open up to competition the market for the supply of many business support services. The logistic difficulties of providing business support services at locations around Europe, however, will be immense, making it likely that those companies wishing to exploit the opportunities offered by the single market will consider expansion by acquisition or joint venture. The process will be a two-way affair. So why are increasing numbers of companies entrusting critical but peripheral elements of their operations to outside experts? Mr John Kerry, head of outsourcing at Ernst &amp; Young, the management consultants, lists a number of reasons. They include pressures on costs, skills shortages, variable workload patterns and 'management stretch' - spreading management across areas not well understood and, therefore, not effectively managed. Mr Kerry also cites some reasons why companies have resisted the trend. They may be suspicious of permitting access to outsiders or doubt the ability of contractors to deliver services as required. Another obstacle may be an internal culture which prevents executives from objectively considering why they assume responsibilities that have no impact on their business performance. According to Mr Kerry, the benefits for corporate converts can be enormous. The process can lead to redefinition and better control over services - even if they are not always contracted out - and can relieve management of daily responsibility for potentially disruptive and possibly complex support services. Costs can be reduced, although this is not always the case. A more useful result may be greater control of those costs incurred. Used extensively, outsourcing can transform the cost base of a business and substantially reduce the capital investment required for buildings and equipment. But the process can present major risks unless handled carefully. An overlap of responsibilities between client and contractor can lead to wasted contract work and fractious relationships. Contracts must always be well defined to ensure that there are no misunderstandings over requirements while any contracting out programme predicated on the reduction of marginal costs must be accompanied by an aggressive strategy intended to recover them. One wider concern centres on the calibre of the new entrants in the contracted services market. Contractors which have traditionally provided only a single support function to companies are expanding their service portfolios but some doubts exist as to their ability to manage multi-service packages. BET's Mr Davies says: 'Lots of organisations are coming out of the woodwork, claiming they can provide the full package of support services. While they can subcontract the services they do not have in-house, many simply lack the management skills required and there is a risk they will give the sector a bad name.' Professional management is the key to contracting out, according to Mr Lionel Prodgers, chairman of Facilities and Property Management, one of the new generation of business support specialists which has introduced an award scheme to promote standards of service. FPM operates on an independent, 'front-desk management' basis, installing its own managers within the buildings of clients to be responsible for the provision of all services required. Contractors are constantly monitored to ensure they maintain high standards. Mr Prodgers says: 'Inefficiencies in the provision of services are often brought about by office politics, with individual empires jealously guarded against intrusion from other parts of the business. Managers are more likely to cede some of their responsibilities to an independent contractor than to someone else inside the organisation.' Contracting out, of course, may not always be the answer. A company may be too small or too large, supplier bids may be uncompetitive or the risks of having to change back to internal systems may be regarded as too great. It could be, of course, that everything already runs very smoothly. And as Mr Kerry of Ernst &amp; Young puts it: 'If it ain't broke - don't fix it.'</p>

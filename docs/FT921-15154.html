			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Terrorists exploit the gaps in mainland defences: The difficulties of countering the bombers' ever changing tactics THE IRA bomb attack in Whitehall yesterday has again highlighted the difficulties faced by the security forces in countering one of the best-organised and determined terrorist organisations in the world. It was the latest incident in a long-running IRA campaign on the mainland and in Northern Ireland that has deliberately avoided following a set pattern. IRA tactics during the past 18 months have included firebombing shops, disrupting railway lines and shooting military personnel, in addition to the continual threat to any 'legitimate political target' - anyone considered to be working for the British state. One security expert with extensive experience of dealing with IRA terrorism conceded last night: 'London is proving very difficult to defend because the IRA has so many targets and a variety of methods of attack.' From the IRA's perspective, yesterday's bomb was another coup. While requiring some preparatory reconnaissance of the area, the small bomb in a briefcase is the type of device that will barely have strained the organisation's military resources. Yet it prompted political reaction and media coverage quite out of proportion to the limited physical damage caused. While political reaction continues to be focused on condemnation of the IRA and calls for increased security, yesterday's bombing has again raised questions about the effectiveness of current security measures, and whether the IRA can be militarily neutralised. Since the IRA's last intrusion into Whitehall - the mortar attack on Downing Street 11 months ago - traffic controls have been introduced, video cameras have been installed in government buildings, and windows and doors have been reinforced against bomb attacks. These measures have been taken against a background of repeated police appeals for increased public vigilance and a continuing undercover security operation. Such efforts may have reduced the risk of political assassinations and large-scale injury to civilians, but they did not stop an IRA terrorist cell yesterday identifying significant security gaps: The bomb was found only because of a warning by the IRA which named the small street where it had been planted. Mr John Major, the prime minister, left nearby Downing Street after the warning had been received but before the bomb had been located. The bomb exploded before the surrounding area had been fully cleared or the device tackled by bomb disposal experts. Anti-terrorist squad chiefs believe the IRA mainland campaign involves no more than six terrorists, probably travelling to and from Northern Ireland or the Irish Republic. But these assessments have not been translated into any public breakthrough in terms of arrests. Home Office figures show that 85 individuals were detained on the mainland in connection with terrorism related to Northern Ireland in the first nine months of last year, but only one was charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Security experts say that police on the mainland are too stretched in numbers and cash terms to attempt blanket protection over a far more densely populated area than Northern Ireland. Even if the resources were available, both the government and opposition believe that Northern Ireland-type security measures, involving the police and the military, would be politically unacceptable. A meeting yesterday between Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, and leaders of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party appears to have made further progress towards re-starting 'round-table' talks on the province's political future, Ralph Atkins writes. Yesterday's meeting was staged by using a video conferencing link, with Mr Brooke in London and SDLP leaders in Belfast.</p>

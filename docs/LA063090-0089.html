			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'UNCOMPROMISING' REVIEW OF CONCERT BY VERLAINE, SHAWN HITS THE RIGHT NOTES  </P> <P> I commend you for your insightful review of the Tom Verlaine and Shawn Colvin  concert ("Verlaine's Acoustic Set Lacks Electricity" by Mike Boehm, June 14). I  agree with much of what you said in that piece, and in fact I had discussed  many of the same points with my wife after departing that night.  </P> <P> (We were among the select few who stuck around after the eccentricity became  too overwhelming for most of the crowd.)  </P> <P> It was a fascinating concert, pairing as it did two quite dissimilar performers  who nevertheless helped in their respective performances to demonstrate how  powerful a solo concert can be and how much it partakes of theater as well as  musical presentation. I do think Colvin deserved a bit more coverage in the  review, although I couldn't agree more with your comments about how much richer  and more compelling she sounded live than on record. Hers was a very satisfying  performance, and it was complemented nicely by the more ragged and unnerving  performance Verlaine gave.  </P> <P> Anyway, I'm glad to see such a thoughtful and uncompromising review of such a  rewarding concert. As a semi-retired reviewer myself, I can appreciate the  insights and the good writing even more. I wish there were more of us around  who like such music and enjoy articulating our responses in some way. I don't  get out to live concerts much anymore, but I definitely treasure an evening  like the one Verlaine and Colvin supplied. Keep up the good work.  </P> <P> TIM JAHNS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Strategy change at Do It All A new business strategy for Do It All, the DIY chain owned jointly by Boots and WH Smith, is due to be announced before Boots reveals its interim results on November 4. Options under discussion include sales of stores, or closures, or an acceleration of plans to 're-vamp' existing stores by refitting them so that products are grouped according to different DIY projects. Boots and WH Smith have also been in discussions with possible buyers for the company, although a spokesman for Boots asserted that reports that 'parcels of stores' had been marketed to other retailers were untrue. In August, WH Smith, which owns 50 per cent, said its share of Do It All's losses for the year to May was Pounds 14.3m, with sales down 7.3 per cent.</p>

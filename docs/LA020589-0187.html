			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S VERY INVIGORATING AT PARK CITY FESTIVAL  </P> <P> This year's United States Film Festival, whose final showings in the ski town  of Park City, Utah, wound down last Sunday, had a bracing effect that went far  beyond the single-digit temperatures or the nosebleed altitude. While a panel  of film maker-critics wrangled before an SRO crowd about whether "independents  have lost their social conscience," and decided, "well, sort of," the news  thundering down was an exhilarating "no!"  </P> <P> Social conscience also means the ability to challenge, and the best of these  films were challenges, tackling traditions, expectations, our social and  sometimes our political fabric, even our memories. This time, however, there  was the feeling that independent no longer only meant "worthy" and "good for  you," but films that were sexy, life-affirming and seeable, as well as about  something.  </P> <P> By the close of the festival, as audiences packed in to see the dramatic and  documentary competition winners -- "True Love," a shrewdly observed comedy  about young love and (gulp) marriage, Bronx style, and "For All Mankind," a  documentary that made unified art from the NASA footage of our moon voyages and  landing -- it was clear that 1989 marked a turning point.  </P> <P> The fine stuff is a trickle, still, not a torrent; but there is the sense of  something exciting going on, of serious themes beneath the appealing exteriors.  </P> <P> Increasingly since Robert Redford's Sundance Institute took a hand in the  proceedings in 1980, the U.S. Film Festival is an event that Hollywood watches  with an eagle eye and attends in force. When Paul Mazursky, emcee of the awards  ceremony, cracked that as a conservationist, Redford, was shocked by the deal  memos littering the ski slopes, it was barely an exaggeration. The rush by  agents, distributors, even publicists to press their cards on debuting  writer/director Steven Soderbergh, standing on the snow-banked street after the  tumultuous response to his brilliant feature, "sex, lies and videotape", was  almost parodic.  </P> <P> If a film-making presence hung over the festival, it was the devilish, mocking,  magnificent one of John Cassavetes, Regrettably, he was absent, yet you would  swear not, after watching Michael Ventura's programming of all of his films as  a writer-director and crucial examples of his acting performances. If you'd  grown up with Cassavetes' films, the chance to revisit so much wild, insistent  love was irresistible. To some of the younger film makers and filmgoers who had  only heard of "Shadows" or "Faces," it was cataclysmic. Frankly, it wreaked  havoc with good intentions and a tight schedule. Hooking into Cassavetes's  dangerous, glittering confrontations, watching him shred every bit of the  fabric of pretense or politeness was ruinously unfair to any ordinary film with  the bad luck to follow him.  </P> <P> If it could be said that any film here connects directly into the Cassavetes  vein, it is Soderbergh's "sex, lies and videotape," a delicate, tension-ridden  and sexually charged investigation of contemporary romantic dysfunction. To be  sure, Soderbergh's visuals are more elegant, his writing is more controlled,  less the gasping, jagged American Realspeech of "Minnie and Moskowitz" or  "Husbands" but he's no less relentless, and his intentions -- to peer behind  the careful facade to some unsettling truths beneath -- are a match for  Cassavetes' own, as is his quartet of actors.  </P> <P> You could pick up information on the real lot of the independent today from  some of the production histories: The four years it took, for example, to  assemble "The Lodz Ghetto," correctly described as an existential horror story  of the quarter-million inhabitants of that Polish city, of whom 800 survived to  the end of World War II. The film makers used tiny archival photographs as well  as a cache of Nazi color footage, blew them up, combined them with muted color  footage shot in contemporary Poland and letters from within the ghetto and  orchestrated everything into a soaring whole that makes the still move and  absorbs us into the daily lives of this slowly disintegrating community.  Setting off the impeccable work of director Alan Edelson and co-director/editor  Kathryn Taverna is a phenomenal "musical" score by Wendy Blackstone who has  created an aural portrait so detailed and so inventive that the film seems  three-dimensional.  </P> <P> On the other end of the production spectrum, there was the wild story behind  another of the festival's triumphs, "Gingerale Afternoon," which had a  gestation period of three weeks from the time producer Susan Shapiro saw Gina  Wendkos' play at the Cast Theater in Hollywood to the day director Rafal  Zielinski began shooting. What lent the affair its particular urgency was the  fact that Dana Andersen, who plays the trailer-court heroine sunning in a  bikini for most of the picture, was approaching her ninth month of pregnancy.  The entire film was shot in 10 days; Andersen worked three of them before she  delivered her 9-pound, 9-ounce son, and four days a month later.  </P> <P> Astonishingly, there is no rushed feeling to the film, a rasping, touching,  enormously sensual triangle about a husband (John M. Jackson), unmanned by  long-term unemployment and dubious about impending fatherhood; his wife,  nagging, worried and loving by turns; and his bubble-gum-voiced teen-aged  mistress (Yeardly Smith). This was a production to shop from: Picking up on a  skillful, soulful director (Zielinski), an inspired cinematographer (Yuri  Neyman, of "Liquid Sky" and "D.O.A"), on bluesman Willie Dixon's great,  integral songs, or on Wendkos' screenplay, substantially let-out from its play  form.  </P> <P> Again and again, you found serious themes, deliberately made watchable and in  some cases, irresistible. "Powwow Highway" (set to open here shortly) was one  of those. Actually, it mixes the question of political activism with a  spiritual quest by a pair of contemporary Cheyenne Indians, but the theme is  floated on the lightly ironic touch of new director Jonathan Wacks ("Repo  Man's" co-producer), the glowing camera work of Toyomichi Kurita (who shot  "Trouble in Mind" for Alan Rudolph) and the extraordinary presence of Toronto  theater actor Gary Farmer. In truth, the mammoth Farmer is possibly the most  sweetly endearing screen presence since E.T., (no disrespect intended to a  living, breathing, non-manipulated actor).  </P> <P> Not everything was roses in the programming, however. "Heathers," a blatantly  cynical, supposed black comedy about teen-age suicide, made with technical  skill and absolutely no point of view, became the subject of furious debates.  No amount of production sheen or acting skill seemed excuse enough for the  film's scabrous morality or its unprincipled viciousness. (Interestingly  enough, while other films scrambled for a distributor, this one came equipped  with one: New World Pictures.)  </P> <P> Hardly equal in terms of venality, but disturbingly manipulative was "Let's Get  Lost," Bruce Weber's portrait of the great jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. Certainly  the film maker's exploitation of the drug-wracked Baker had the wholehearted  cooperation of Baker himself, who had no hesitation about spinning his stories  one more time or of driving up Pacific Coast Highway, draped in friendly young  models. Gorgeous as ex-fashion photographer Weber makes his images, this is a  soulless film, with scant respect for the people involved or even for the  soaring line of Baker's music.  </P> <P> But there were antidotes to such bitter aftertastes: "84 Charlie Mopic," a  terrifyingly personal portrait about an Army reconnaissance unit in Vietnam,  told through the lenses of a military cameraman and in the heartfelt  recollection of writer-director-Vietnam vet Patrick Duncan.  </P> <P> Also, Jeffrey Noyes Scher's "Prisoners of Inertia," a languidly hilarious tour  of a certain Sunday in Manhattan, experienced by a hip pair of newlyweds,  marvelously played by Amanda Plummer and Christopher Rich.  </P> <P> Michael Hoffman's enticingly beautiful fable, now titled "Some Girls," about  three beautiful young sisters and the suitor who caroms among them may wander a  little off-track, but it has so much that is off-beat and special to it,  including Andre Gregory's performance as their father and Lila Kedrova's as  their grandmother, that it survives as a delightful memory. And "Who Killed  Vincent Chin," by Christine Choy and Renee Tajima, which goes into the tensions  behind the baseball-bat killing of a young Chinese-American by a pair of  laid-off Detroit auto workers, is complex, many-leveled and troubling, not the  sort of film whose hard realities can be shaken off.  </P> <P> Or, to end on a note of triumph and idealism, there is "John Huston," the  magnificent portrait of an artist, film maker, lover, husband, raconteur and  father, by director Frank Martin.  </P> <P> John Huston, John Cassavetes and the discoveries that were here for the finding  are enough to solace the movie-loving soul for more than a while. Let's see how  long they take to reach a parched audience.  </P></p>

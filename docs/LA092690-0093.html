			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDIES LINK DEPRESSION TO SMOKING  </P> <P> People who have experienced depression are especially vulnerable to nicotine  addiction and have a particularly hard time quitting smoking, according to new  research that suggests that many people use smoking as a form of  "self-medication" against anxiety and pain.  </P> <P> The findings are considered important because of the dire health consequences  of smoking and the difficulties of stopping. They suggest that, for some  people, it may be unrealistic to expect to quit without first being treated for  depression.  </P> <P> "This is probably the best evidence yet that certain people are more  susceptible to drug addiction than others," said Dr. Alexander H. Glassman of  Columbia University, an author of one of two studies published today in the  Journal of the American Medical Assn. "It certainly raises the question: Is  this going to be true for other drugs?"  </P> <P> The reasons behind what Glassman called this "chronic and pernicious  interrelationship" are not yet clear.  </P> <P> Because nicotine is a stimulant, researchers suspect that some smokers use it  to fend off the anxiety and discontent that characterize depression. Over time,  those feelings may come to trigger cravings for nicotine because it has  alleviated them in the past.  </P> <P> Similarly, the anxiety that accompanies nicotine withdrawal may be more severe  among depressed ex-smokers and more likely to drive them back to cigarettes.  Researchers say some depression-prone people have been driven back into  depression by an attempt to quit smoking.  </P> <P> Another possible explanation is that some factors, such as low self-esteem, may  predispose people to both depression and smoking. Or, there may be a genetic  factor that can lead to both depression and smoking, some researchers suggest.  </P> <P> "I think there are a lot of people who stop (smoking) easily and look down on  the person who can't, as though they are a weaker kind of human being,"  Glassman said. " . . . I think (this finding) says it's something biological,  not a moral issue."  </P> <P> Glassman and others pointed out that, as social pressure to stop smoking mounts  and those who are capable of quitting do so, the pool of persistent smokers  will increasingly consist of people with a history of depression or vulnerable  to depression.  </P> <P> Because women, among other groups, are especially prone to depression in the  United States, nicotine may become an increasingly female addiction, Glassman  said. He said the balance is already shifting, and women have been less  successful than men in quitting smoking.  </P> <P> One of the two new studies, by researchers at the federal Centers for Disease  Control, is based on data collected in a general health and nutrition survey of  randomly selected people. The researchers explored smoking habits and  self-reported symptoms of depression.  </P> <P> They found that people whose symptoms amounted to a clinical diagnosis of  depression were significantly more likely than others to be current smokers.  Similarly, they were significantly less likely to have successfully quit.  </P> <P> The other study is based on a mental health survey of randomly selected people.  The researchers found that people who had experienced major depressive  disorder, or severe depression, were twice as likely as others to be, or to  have been, regular smokers.  </P> <P> Researchers said it would be premature to prescribe anti-depressants for people  who have difficulty quitting smoking. But Glassman said he is currently  studying the possibility and "it really looks like it's going to work."  </P></p>

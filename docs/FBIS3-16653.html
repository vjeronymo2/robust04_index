Not one of  the versions proposed Wednesday morning was passed. In fact,  two approaches were considered: The first included a political  assessment of the situation which has taken shape in the country  and which was noted in the president's message itself; the  second without a political preamble, consisted exclusively of  the decree section which speaks of proposals to the Russian  Federation Government for overcoming the socioeconomic crisis in  the country and of the Duma's plans in the same area. The first  version was insisted on by the Communists, the Agrarians, "New  Regional Policy," and the "Russian Path" deputies' group. The  second version was insisted on by "Russia's Choice" and the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord.    The distribution of votes which has taken shape in all the  principal ballots is such that none of the sides can count on a  "clear victory." But preliminary accords are still  proliferating in the sessions.    It is, in general, not difficult to calculate why. The  political preamble is essentially perceived as an "indictment"  of those who have supported and implemented the reforms in  Russia over the past two years. It is also clear that "Russia's  Choice" will never agree to the prospect of the revival of  "state management of a mixed economy."    If we read through both texts carefully, then, with the  exception of the aforementioned preamble, we will not find many  differences between them. Except that there is an appendix to  the "political" version with an approximate list of laws of  paramount state importance. Among the 22 draft laws the law "On  State Policy in the Sphere of Defense and the Country's  Security" is placed seventh in terms of significance.    The litigant sides will most likely have to make a  compromise  in the very near future. If only because the document itself --  the decree on the Russian Federation president's message -- will  hardly be of great applied significance. The deputies  themselves said as much. It turns out that the lower chamber of  the Federal Assembly is still continuing to expend its energy on  exclusively political debates and is not able to switch to a  concrete list of the laws which the country is awaiting with  enviable patience.</p>

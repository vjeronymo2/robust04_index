			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  has stressed that relations with the United States are currently  "the best they have ever been." He said Argentina "is showing  its potential to the world."    Menem recalled that bilateral relations had run into "an  infinite number" of problems, just as they do with other  important nations, but stressed that beginning with his  government, "an immediate decision was made to change course by  implementing more realistic policies at both the national and  international levels." Menem said this last night while opening  American Week at the Pacifico Mall in Buenos Aires. U.S.  Ambassador James Cheek participated in the ceremony.    The chief of state reiterated that Argentina must be "among  the top 10 countries in the world because it has the necessary  natural and human resources." He emphasized, "We must not forget  that after having been among the world's top 10 countries some  40 years ago, we slid to 100th position in 1989." He stated: "It  has been difficult to overcome the innumerable obstacles that  hampered Argentina's escape from stagnation, frustration, and  involution."    The president stressed that "an enormous apparatus that  sought to frustrate had been mounted" in the country,  "converting it into a nation of favor trading and privileges  because the state dominated and did everything unsatisfactorily."    Defending his state reform policy, Menem highlighted the  fact  that "after five years, Argentina has moved from 100th place to  16th place among the economic powers." He said, "Argentina must  once again be among the top 10."    Menem admitted that "not everything is right" in the  country.  He justified this saying that other stagnated nations "needed  decades to revert the situation while we took just 5 years."  Menem said, "No matter who governs, by the end of the century we  will be much better off if we continue on this course."    The chief of state indicated that enhancing the current  policy "is the best proposal for the current stage and for  advancing against the scourges that affect us and the rest of  humanity."    Menem defined these "scourges" as "poverty, drug  trafficking,  terrorism, and crime, which actively grow through new methods."  He said: "The proposal for new laws and a more coherent  relationship among all nations is the best answer to these  scourges which undermine our best foundation: An organized  society."    More than 40 recognized U.S. enterprises are participating  in  the event. The opening ceremony took place in the center of the  mall where a 12.5-meter model of the Statue of Liberty, which is  located in New York harbor, has been erected.</p>

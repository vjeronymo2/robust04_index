			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cider activity A profits warning from Merrydown sent the cider group's shares tumbling 54 to 159p. It also prompted speculation that another drinks group might be tempted into a bid move. Merrydown blamed a downturn in sales to the wholesale market. Analysts, who had been expecting a doubling of profits to around Pounds 3.5m, pulled back to the Pounds 400,000 mark. Although initially hit by the news, the other two listed cider groups recovered as some market investors decided that the problems were specific to Merrydown. Taunton finished 7 adrift at 162p, while HP Bulmer declined 5 to 449p. The regional electricity companies (recs) remained under heavy downside pressure. Dealers said worries about a potential 40 per cent hit on pre-tax profits after the distribution review, expected sometime in July, was behind the slide in the share prices. On the plus side for the recs, however, were hints that there could be news later this month of the sell-off of the recs' shareholdings in the National Grid. These range from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. The biggest losses in the sector were recorded by Manweb, which dropped 31 to 744p, and London and Norweb, down 27 apiece to 636p and 699p. Broker recommendations ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures from British Aerospace helped the shares bounce 5 to 531p, putting it among a handful of Footsie stocks that moved against the poor market trend. The group is expected to report a loss because of the inclusion of a Pounds 250m provision, but substantial improvement is expected in the underlying performance. Strauss Turnbull reiterated its buy recommendation, as did NatWest Securities. Sentiment was further boosted by reports that BAe would soon announce a Pounds 50m property sale, and news that airline Cathay Pacific had firmed up an order for six aircraft from Airbus Industrie, in which BAe has a 20 per cent stake. Anglo-Dutch food giant Unilever slipped ahead of full-year figures due today, on concern that these might contain hefty restructuring charges. Speculation has focused on the company's US detergents business, which operates in a highly competitive market, and in which Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's arch rival, has already disclosed substantial provisions. Analysts' forecasts for today's profits figures from Unilever range from Pounds 2.250bn to Pounds 2.325bn. The shares ended 7 off at 1199p. Shares in Thorn EMI approached their all-time high ahead of today's third-quarter results as NatWest Securities drew investors' attention to the group's multi-media potential. In the light of several recent deals in the sector, the most recent being the Dollars 10bn Paramount deal in the US, the broker believes Thorn to be undervalued. Mr Jason Holden, sector analyst at NatWest, said: 'Thorn's music interests offer prime access to the rapid growth of 'superhighways' in the new multi-media era. The market has underestimated the potential for a rerating.' The stock gained 9 at 1138p. Chemicals leader ICI fell 14 to 760p as a number of analysts repeated their unenthusiastic views on the company ahead of full-year figures expected on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson has the stock as a sell and anticipates fourth-quarter profits of Pounds 65m to give an annual figure of Pounds 305m. NatWest Securities, James Capel and Hoare Govett are similarly gloomy. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo firmed 2 to 681p against the trend as the closure of the US market, where most of the sellers are congregated, gave the bulls a chance. SmithKline Beecham 'A' held steady at 406p ahead of today's full-year figures. Hoare Govett's forecast of Pounds 1.22bn is at the high end of the range, but Lehman Brothers, the US house, cut its estimate to Pounds 1.18n from Pounds 1.21bn because of what it considers disappointing third-quarter sales. Wellcome failed to respond to positive reports on its anti-Aids treatment. A federally financed study found that AZT dramatically reduced the transmission of the Aids virus from infected mothers to their newborns, a US newspaper reported. However, Wellcome receded 13 to 643p. In a sagging property sector, Land Securities retreated 17 to 723p amid talk of one broker cutting its net asset value forecasts. British Land fared slightly better, off 4 at 428p, as it announced a deal to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope, the indebted developer. The news lifted Stanhope 14 to 42p as hopes rose that its refinancing discussions with its banks might be boosted by its British Land link. One of the market's leading agency brokers was said to have tried unsuccessfully to place a block of 2m Royal Insurance shares in the market at 310p. Royal lost 8 at 306p. BT was weakened by a sell note published by Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French-owned stockbroker, which forecast a slowing down of the rate of dividend growth. CLL said cost-cutting measures at BT 'will be insufficient to offset the assault on revenues'. BT shares declined 7 1/2 to 441 1/2 p and the 'new' stock 8 to 323p. The oil and gas sectors braced themselves for two sets of crucial results this week with British Gas and Shell both reporting on Thursday. Action in the stock market concentrated on BP and Shell, with international funds said to have been switching out of Shell and into BP. The latter have fallen sharply against the FT-Actuaries All-Share index recently and also against Shell. BP closed 2 1/2 up at 363 1/2 p on turnover of 7.1m. Shell fell 8 1/2 to 720 1/2 p on 2.2m traded. The market range of current cost net income for Shell is said to range from Pounds 740m to Pounds 990m.</p>

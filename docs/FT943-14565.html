			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / HK pension plan is aimed at a maturing society: Colony's government wants to provide for growing number of over-65s The words 'welfare state' and 'Hong Kong' have always seemed to be at odds, given the colony's free-wheeling capitalist image. But when on Tuesday the government outlined plans for a comprehensive old-age pension scheme, some in the colony began to wonder whether a society whose state provisions had always stopped at the basics of housing, health and education was now about to be taken a benefit too far. The consultation paper issued for comment drew a strongly negative response from business leaders and their representatives in the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), which may eventually be called on to turn the proposal into law. China, which would have to approve any scheme through the Joint Liaison Group before the government can proceed, gave conflicting signals. Hong Kong's aged residents currently rely on a fragmentary system of old age allowances and invalidity benefits. The scheme would provide those over 65 years of age with a pension of HKDollars 2,300 (Pounds 193) a month, index-linked to the rate of inflation. In all, 3 per cent of Hong Kong's annual wage bill will be collected and transferred to a specially established fund that will be isolated so that all of it would be dedicated to pension payments and administration of the scheme. Employees would contribute 1.5 per cent of their pre-tax income and employers would make a matching contribution. The pension would be means-tested at first - to exclude those with assets, other than the family home, in excess of HKDollars 2m - but after 10 years would become a universal benefit. All employees would make contributions from the outset. The government's defence of its initiative - which will be subject to a three-month consultation exercise - is that Hong Kong is becoming a mature economy and that there is growing community pressure for a state pension. People over the age of 65 will double as a percentage of Hong Kong's population to 18.5 per cent by 2056. 'There is a need to fund a growing number of poor, old people in Hong Kong, especially with the decline of the extended family in recent years,' said one official. 'It will not be up and running for 18 months to two years so we will have to consult closely with China; they will have to administer it.' Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, yesterday delivered a blistering attack on the plans. Having done nothing about pensions for 150 years, Britain had 'suddenly raised such a ridiculous and imaginary idea' just three years away from the 1997 transfer of sovereignty, the paper commented. It was unclear, however, if this represented Beijing's authoritative response to the plan. Mr Tam Yiu-chung, a leading pro-Beijing politician in LegCo, said he supported the plan, which was made available to Beijing officials last week. Unions also lent their support to the plans. The pro-business Liberal party said it opposed the scheme in principle, but hedged its position until it had 'consulted' more widely. The immediate reaction from businessmen was to warn that employers were likely to recoup the costs of contributions through higher prices. The pension would be paid only to those who are permanent residents of Hong Kong; yet contributions will have to be paid by all who work in the colony, including expatriates . The provision of a state pension has always been opposed by the colony's strongly pro-business elites which have seen it as symbolising creeping 'welfare-ism'. Although more than 50 per cent of Hong Kong's population lives in public housing and enjoys subsidised health care and free schooling, there is no provision for unemployment benefit, and other forms of income support are primitive. In the mid-1980s a proposal for a Singapore-style, compulsory savings central provident fund (CPF) was killed off, with prominent businessmen siding with the government. It resurfaced two years ago when China and leading Hong Kong business figures united to push the idea. Beijing is very keen on the CPF, to which it attributes much of Singapore's economic success, and plans to experiment with one in Shanghai. The Hong Kong government, however, rejected a CPF and a mandatory privately-run retirement scheme because both would take too long to produce returns to contributors. By contrast, the pension scheme now being proposed would be operational from day one by virtue of a HKDollars 15bn contribution from the government. The proposed pension would be index-linked to inflation rather than earnings. The government estimates that in 2056 earnings related indexation would be HKDollars 145.5bn (in 1994 prices) more than inflation-related. The government has rejected suggestions that the introduction of a pension would be the beginning of a first-world type welfare state in Hong Kong. It said that under its scheme, pension payments would amount to about 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with an average of 15 per cent of GDP for total welfare payments in west European countries.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories angry at committee ruling THE GOVERNMENT last night ran the gauntlet of bitter criticism from some of its most senior backbenchers as it succeeded in excluding its bete noire Mr Nicholas Winterton from membership of the parliamentary select committees which monitor its affairs. After a noisy and bad-tempered debate, an amendment that would have reinstated Mr Winterton, the Tory MP for Macclesfield, as a member of the health select committee which he chaired until the election was defeated by 63 votes (147-210). His exclusion followed a ruling by government business managers to the effect that no Conservative MP could serve on a committee for more than three consecutive parliaments. The ruling also hit Sir John Wheeler, the scrupulously loyal Conservative MP for Westminster North who had been a member of the home affairs select committee since its inception in 1979. An amendment effectively permitting Sir John's exclusion was carried by the narrower margin of 21 votes (160-139). An angry Mr Winterton took his revenge by accusing the government of 'an arrogance that can lead to dictatorship.' 'An independent view and freedom of speech is being gradually squeezed out in this House,' he said. He was supported in his clear resentment of the government's elaborate efforts to check parliament's right to scrutinise the executive both by Sir John and Mr Terence Higgins, former Tory chairman of the Treasury and civil service select committee. Sir John likened the three-term rule to the experience of stepping on a piece of bubble gum - 'tacky, sticky and lingers long after the event.' Mr Higgins claimed that the rule had been 'invented at the last moment in order justify a particular series of selection.' In a direct attack on Sir Marcus Fox, the Tory MP widely credited with masterminding the government's tactics, Mr Higgins said there was 'no such rule' about the time an MP could serve. Sir Marcus's rule was also condemned by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security select committee in the last parliament, who said it would 'deskill' the committee system. Opening the debate, Sir Marcus, chairman of the committee of selection, sought amid much heckling to justify the decision to exclude long-serving committee members. 'There are many good reasons why we should say that 13 years is long enough,' he said.</p>

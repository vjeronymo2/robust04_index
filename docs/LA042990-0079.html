			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD: REDRAWING THE ART MUSEUM VISITOR PROFILE  </P> <P> Q &amp; A: Art and Attendance  </P> <P> New art patrons of the next decade and how Southern California museums will  attract them is the focus of "Drawing Audiences," a half-hour KCET documentary  that will air Friday at 9 p.m. on Channel 28 (with repeats Saturday at 5 p.m.  and May 7 at 7:30 p.m.). In making the documentary -- which includes  discussions with museum directors such as Earl A. (Rusty) Powell of the L.A.  County Museum of Art and John Walsh of the J. Paul Getty Museum -- producers  found that 89% of current Southland museum supporters are older than 56 and  that 93% of all L.A. museum visitors are Anglo. To gain some insight into local  museums' strategies for changing these statistics, Art World talked with  Celeste Durant, executive producer of "Drawing Audiences."  </P> <P> Question: What does it mean to Los Angeles' museums to have visitors that are  predominantly white and older than 56?  </P> <P> Answer: If the museums are going to continue to be a vital part of the  community . . . it's going to be critical for them to attract (an ethnically)  diverse audience. Especially if they're going to engage patronage as well as  attendance, they've got to engage the people that are living here. Also, to  have a future audience, you have to attract younger people. you have to let  them know that art is a vital part of their lives.  </P> <P> Q: What do you see as the factors that have shaped this current audience?  </P> <P> A: It's been historical. It was the way that Los Angeles developed -- the  people that brought art and were concerned about art were predominantly white.  And it's continued that way, even though other people now live here.  </P> <P> Q: Who are the new audiences that the museums are trying to reach, and what are  they doing to attract them?  </P> <P> A: From the interviews that we did, especially in terms of the Getty, they're  really looking to attract a younger audience. One of their biggest programs is  a special program geared toward parents and children learning about art  together. They're really trying to get to them and teach them about art while  they're young. If you get to school children while they're young, you're going  to have a more multi-ethnic base. Also, they're doing interactive exhibits . .  . and taped presentations making the whole world of art more accessible. That  way they will encourage people who like art but aren't particularly well versed  in it, to go (to a museum) -- and to go more than once, to begin to integrate  art into their lives.  </P> <P> Q: What kind of problems do you think the museums will face in reaching this  audience?  </P> <P> A: A good part of it will just be reaching out to the communities that they  want to encourage. For instance, the Getty is doing advertising geared toward  the Hispanic community. Another approach they're going to have to take is to  increase the ethnic nature of their collections and their exhibits.  </P> <P> Q: Through what you've seen in putting together this documentary, can Los  Angeles' museums survive if they continue to attract only the audiences they  now have?  </P> <P> A: They're really going to have to attract a younger audience. The audiences  that they've been attracting are getting increasingly older, so they're not  going to be there (in the future). (And as far as attracting a more ethnically  diverse audience), it's essential, because the Anglo community is becoming the  minority community. They'll have to attract (ethnically diverse) communities to  tap both the interest and the financial support they need.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> The J. Paul Getty Museum's recent purchase of "Irises" isn't the only Southern  California contribution to the Vincent van Gogh centennial. The Norton Simon  Museum has mounted its own tribute with "Vincent Van Gogh: Painter, Printmaker,  and Collector," which will be on display through the end of the year.  </P> <P> "It's certainly a rare opportunity to see the work of a great artist from his  early years to his later flowering -- especially in the United States," said  curator Lanier Graham.  </P> <P> Featured in the exhibition are six of Van Gogh's paintings, including  "spectacularly colored late ones" such as "The Mulberry Tree" (1889) and  "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" (1890), as well as "some of the dark early ones"  including "Head of a Peasant Woman in a White Bonnet "(1885) which depicts Sien  de Groot, a woman who later appears in the artist's famous "Potato Eaters"  (1885).  </P> <P> But Graham noted that the exhibition -- which includes a drawing, an etching  and one of the artist's last letters -- does not end with Van Gogh's own works.  Also featured are four Hiroshige prints and a painting by Adolphe Monticelli  that were collected by Van Gogh.  </P> <P> "We added these to add some insight and understanding of his work," Graham  said, noting that Monticelli was "the only painter Van Gogh himself ever  collected," and that the exhibition explores "the relationship between the  (Hiroshige) prints and (Van Gogh's) own paintings."  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERHEARD  </P> <P> "Oh my god, they look like aliens! I wouldn't want to come in here after dark  -- I'd have nightmares all night long!" said a college-aged woman with long  dark hair speaking to her blue-jean clad friend while looking at paintings in  the L.A. County Museum of Art's "Francis Bacon" retrospective during its final  days on view.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> A cast steel sculpture formed of materials from the ruins of last October's San  Francisco earthquake is included in "Oakland's Artists '90," which runs through  July 1 at the Oakland Museum.  </P> <P> "This piece is in tribute to my community of West Oakland. . . . I wanted to  celebrate the living, my neighbors who risked their lives to help those trapped  on the Cypress structure," said sculptor Bruce Beasley of his "The Pillars of  Cypress," which is made of scrap from the demolished Nimitz freeway Cypress  Street overpass.  </P> <P> Beasley, who himself worked a 10-hour volunteer shift to help shore up the  overpass' remaining pillars, said he hauled away "a few hundred pounds of the  mangled steel" for use in his 52-inch tall sculpture.  </P> <P> The annual Awards in the Visual Arts program is alive and well despite all the  hoopla over last year's inclusion of Andres Serrano's controversial work "Piss  Christ." This year's AVA exhibition -- which features 10 artists from across  the country -- premiere's Saturday at the New Orleans Museum of Art, where it  will be on view through July 1.  </P> <P> The AVA winners, who will receive $15,000 each, include Santa Barbara-based  conceptual sculptor Ann Hamilton (who currently has a show at the La Jolla  Museum of Contemporary Art) and Oakland-based painter Raymond Saunders. Other  winners are Mike Glier of Hoosick Falls, N.Y. and Randy Twaddle of Houston,  both of whom do drawings; photographers Lorna Simpson of Brooklyn and Sally  Mann of Lexington, Va.; and sculptors Lisa Hoke of New York, Martin Emmanuel of  Atlanta, Tony Tasset of Chicago and Malcolm Cochran of Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> The AVA program, which is administered by the Southeastern Center for  Contemporary Art (SECCA) in Winston-Salem, N.C., aims at bringing recognition  to talented artists early on in their careers and to affirm that serious,  accomplished art can be created anywhere an artist chooses to live and work.  </P> <P> After the New Orleans Museum of Art, the show will travel to SECCA (Aug. 4-Oct.  7), Harvard University's Arthur M. Sackler Museum (Nov. 23-Jan. 13, 1991), and  New York's BMW Gallery (April 1991-September 1991).  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEBUTS  </P> <P> Austrian artist Eva Schlegel makes her Los Angeles debut at Shoshana Wayne  Gallery with a show of abstract paintings on plaster and photographs  silk-screened on glass. Schlegel lives and works in Vienna and has exhibited  extensively in Europe. Her show opens Saturday.  </P> <P> Also opening Saturday is the first one-man show in Los Angeles by Nayland  Blake. Blake's work, "Punch Agonistes," deals with issues of sexual repression,  expression and deviation, as well as dominant cultural myths of the 19th and  20th centuries. Blake was recently included in the San Francisco Museum of  Modern Art's "New Work: A New Generation."  </P> <P> French painter Philippe Judlin makes his West Coast debut at Feingarten  Galleries through May 30. Judlin is part of a young movement in France that  derives its inspiration from l'Art Brut, which shares an awareness of  non-academic sources of art such as tribal, native and folk.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> Fifteen important American works that will be auctioned in New York May 23 by  Christie's auctioneers will be on view Monday from 11:30 a.m.-4 p.m. at the  Beverly Hills Hotel. Among the works, which are estimated to bring a total of  more than $8 million, are paintings by Thomas Eakins and Alfred Bierstadt.  Information: (213) 933-1200.  </P> <P> "Visible Voices," a program of 15 films and videos by local African-American,  Asian-Pacific-American and Chicano artists, will be shown Saturday at the Los  Angeles Photography Center, 412 S. Park View St. The free screening begins at 7  p.m. Information: (213) 738-7665.  </P></p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Observer: Peace offering Nice to see Britain's chief of the defence staff, Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, elected to Nato's top military post. A year ago, he opened a public speech with such an arrestingly offensive introduction that Observer quoted it, commenting that it deserved a prize. Next morning, war clouds seemed to gather when a clipped accent on the telephone identified itself as belonging to the field marshal's principal aide. But it turned out that all the chief wanted was 'to know if he's getting a real prize'. Springing to the salute, Observer dispatched a bottle of malt.</p>

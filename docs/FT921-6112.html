			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Bonn likely to add conditions to joining Emu THE German parliament is expected to impose conditions on the country's eventual membership of European economic and monetary union (Emu), when it ratifies the Maastricht treaties later this year. Both chambers of parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, plan to demand the right to 'take stock' of Emu again in 1996, before moving to a single currency and monetary union under phase three of the transition. Monetary officials closely involved in the Emu negotiations say it is planned that parliament should attach its own resolutions to ratification, to ensure that a future German government would accept no dilution of the country's commitment to monetary and price stability. The parliament would demand a report from the government before the start of phase three, in either 1997 or 1999, to ensure those resolutions had been fulfilled. The officials say there is no question of Germany seeking a back-door way of opting out of economic and monetary union. The aim is rather to ensure that the economic convergence criteria for membership, laid down at Maastricht, are enforced equally strictly throughout the Community. The move is seen as a way of reassuring a sceptical German public that the move to a single currency and monetary union is not going to endanger their national economy. At the same time it would restrict the government's room for manoeuvre in accepting any dilution of the convergence criteria under political pressure from other EC member states. That would be welcomed both in the German Bundesbank and the Ministry of Finance, but not necessarily in the Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Ministry. The German parliamentary debate on Maastricht, due to begin about April, is regarded with growing trepidation by high-level government officials. They fear that the ratification process could be linked to a whole range of EC-related grievances, as well as inner-German politics. Most of all they fear the looming battle between the 16 federal states and the central government for future control of the EC policy-making process. Until now, the parliamentary criticism of Maastricht has focused on the weakness of the treaty on political union as inadequate compensation for German acceptance of Emu. However the public concern, reflected in opinion polls and articulated in popular newspapers is now focused more on the loss of the D-Mark in Emu. The monetary officials suggest that if other EC members failed to display sufficient determination in combatting inflation and controlling their public spending, the German government would be able to refer to the parliamentary resolutions to persuade them to fall into line. They could also justify a German decision not to go ahead with the project on the grounds that aspiring partner countries were not eligible.</p>

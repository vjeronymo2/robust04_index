			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Gardening: Beating pests the natural way - Arthur Hellyer discovers a friendly way of dealing with unwelcome visitors A GREAT deal of natural biological control of insect pests goes on in the garden quite naturally and without any particular help from the gardener, except the obvious one of avoiding the use of chemical or other treatments that might be harmful to the beneficial organisms. This is now well understood, and the great reduction in the usage of garden chemicals is partly due to the desire to preserve 'friendly' creatures - such as ladybird larvae and lacewing flies - that are valuable scavengers in the garden. What is not so well known is that some methods of biological control actually involve deliberately introducing organisms to the garden or greenhouse. One of the oldest of these is the white fly parasite, Encarsia formosa, a tiny wasp which lays its eggs in the white fly scales that are attached to the leaves of infested plants, sometimes in great numbers. The encarsia eggs hatch into larvae which devour the scales, so preventing more adult white flies appearing from them. This parasite is not a native of Britain and must be artificially introduced to the greenhouse in which there are white fly infested plants. This is usually done by hanging up leaves that bear white fly scales already infested with encarsia and leaving them to develop into adult wasps, which will then carry on the good work. In winter, due to lack of warmth and also of white fly scales to keep larvae fed, this parasite usually dies out and has to be reintroduced the following year. Of course, a parasite of any kind is dependant on its prey for its own survival and so can never eliminate a pest altogether but, hopefully, it can restrict it to tolerable levels. A second predator that has been used with considerable success to control the greenhouse red spider mites is called Pytoseiulus persimilis. It is itself a mite, though of a different kind - one might say one that lives on meat rather than on vegetables. Both the adult stage of this mite and the nymph devour adult nymphs and eggs of the greenhouse red spider mite. Again, if they do it too successfully, they will automatically destroy themselves since they have no other food supply. More recently, a third predator has been added to this list of organisms that can be used to control pests. This is a minute nematode - what gardeners often refer to as an eelworm. Some are quite large but this one, which feeds on the grubs of the vine weevil, is too small to be seen with the naked eye. Unlike the other two predators this one is native to Britain but is not present everywhere and most likely will have to be introduced. The method of introduction is quite different. The nematodes are despatched in a moist, inert carrier and on arrival are mixed with water and applied as a drench to the soil that is infested with vine weevil larvae. These nematodes are as exclusive as encarsia and pytoseiulus in their feeding habits and present no hazard to any other organism, including human beings and their pets. This parasite is marketed as Nemasys by Defender, a company that can supply other predators and parasites. The address is P0 Box 131, Ashford, Kent TN25 5TQ. Defender is a branch of Biological Pest Control, which supplies growers throughout the UK and Europe. Both the adults and the grubs of the vine weevil damage vines and many other plants. The weevil eats the edges of leaves, giving them an unsightly, notched appearance, but the damage done by the larvae is much more serious, though largely unseen. They work underground, gnawing away at roots, and they attack many other plants beside grape vines. This pest has been on the increase since the withdrawal of effective soil insecticides and so the introduction of the parasitic nematode is a real step forward. It needs a temperature of above 14'C to be fully active. It is effective outdoors until the end of September and under glass for a much longer period, even throughout the winter if there is adequate heating. With most methods of biological control it is advisable to supplement the treatment with chemical control in certain circumstances. Thus, with white fly one could use a pyrethrum spray or aerosol to reduce the number of white flies before introducing encarsia formosa, but there should be an interval of about seven days before the parasite is introduced. The adult vine weevils are not directly attacked by the parasitic nematode but can be reduced in numbers with a spray of gamma HCH or pirimiphos methyl. An excellent leaflet on these matters has been prepared by ICI Garden Products and should be available at most garden shops or direct from ICI, Dept. FF, Fernhurst, Haslemere, Surrey, GU27 3JE.

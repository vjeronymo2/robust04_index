			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (12): Out of the shadows at last - The ingenuity and ability of Russian entrepreneurs THERE is a little district in Moscow, not far from the prison where the leaders of the August putsch are held, where the names celebrate the huge plant in the midst of it: there are electrozavodskaya, or electric factory streets and lanes, an electric factory metro station and so on. The original plant works still, though there are now three different state enterprises instead of the previous one turning out heavy electrical equipment - transformers, generators and switchgear. In its shade is a smaller building, which encloses sterile rooms in which white-coated technicians produce quartz crystals, oscillators and microchips, together with calculators, fax machines and telephone handsets. The smaller plant is called Fonon International: its juxtaposition with its neighbour emphasises the point made by Mr Dmitri Nikitin, Fonon's president  -this is that 'when the 80 per cent of the economy which made industrial goods, largely for the military, begins to collapse, the 20 per cent which makes for the consumer, begins to be set free.' Fonon International works in the sector now freeing itself from the shadow of the giants: as the first declines towards collapse, his grows and flourishes. He is an example of what is happening, here and there: an industrial restructuring, forced by government policy, carried out by entrepreneurs, taking him from the state sector into private business. 'One day I sat down to count how many organisations - of the party, the state, the enterprise, the local authorities - could interfere with my decisions. There were 45.' He also noted that while there were highly skilled people available, 'we had no experience of quality mass production.' The company has identified growth markets - of which remote-controlled television sets, not produced until last year, was a significant one. Fonon's quartz crystal oscillator is the technical basis of this industry, and helped explain the enormous explosion in its sales from Rbs26m in 1990 to Rbs1.2bn last year. The company is determinedly Russian: Mr Nikitin and his colleagues insist that in the high tech area, equipment and know-how is available which rivals the leading edge anywhere else in the world - 'the educational level is even higher,' he says. His specifications for production machinery have been produced for him in military industrial plants desperate for new orders: his engineers are all Soviet-trained: the good-looking calculators which now come off his lines at the rate of 50,000 a month have some foreign components and casings, but were Russian-designed. As the official economy contracts sharply, his company is growing wildly. The main expansion this year and next will not, he says, be electronics, but in the wholesale business, trading under the name of Roditi Moscow and run by Mr Vladimir Krysolov, a former physicist. Mr Nikitin believes that the immediate future will see a drop in retail sales, as people struggle to exist under a high-price regime: but this will be accompanied by a boom in goods for the new shops and businesses and restructured enterprises. Thus he is importing, besides food and textiles, office equipment and furniture, and computers. The company has set up a distribution network with affiliates around the country: it has even developed a credit card for its customers, who are store and business managers. The operations of Roditi show the ingenuity and ability to take risks needed for the Russian entrepreneur. The company has just signed a deal with Moscow to import 5,000 tonnes of meat for the city: the price set by the Moscow authorities was so low that Roditi must make up a difference amounting Rbs100m between the (hard currency) purchase price and the (rouble) selling price. Why do it? 'Because, in return, we would get a licence from Moscow to sell nickel: and the profits from that would make up for the subsidy we paid on the meat.' He pauses, then adds: 'This is risky. We've delivered the meat, but we still have to get the licence. If someone changes his mind, or the person himself changes jobs, then it could all be gone.' In the manner of Russian companies, he has branched into areas quite different from the core business. Fonon has a company, Yarestavratsia, in the ancient city of Yaroslavl, near Moscow, with around 1,000 employees, which specialises in restoration - both of ancient Russian monuments and churches and of modern western hotels. It is now just beginning a small air-cargo operation. Mr Nikitin and his fellows are young enough still - in their 30s or 40s: with a training which they are putting to use, but with the ability to learn the ways of business. 'This is the most difficult area for us. But I think that Russian people are very intelligent and also resourceful: they had to think of so many ways round obstacles that business does not present any problems in principle. But of course they need experience. In three or four years time, Russian businessmen will be an international force.'</p>

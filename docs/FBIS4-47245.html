			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict: "Measures To </F> Increase Social Protection of the Population and Financial  Stabilization of the Economy"]    [Text] The increase in inflation and the decline in  production have led in recent times to a lowering of the living  standard of society and have exerted a negative influence on the  financial state of the republic. This has been connected to a  decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and  credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the  unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate  structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit  of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency  market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation  of the program of market transformations and bringing about a  growth of socioeconomic tension.    To increase social protection of the population and ensure  financial stabilization of the economy I resolve:    1. To establish as of 1 June 1994 minimum remuneration at  2,000 manat a month.    2. To appoint as of 1 June 1994 for social and nonworking  retirees, students of day courses at higher educational  institutions, and trainees of technical schools and  vocational-technical schools monetary compensation amounting to  1,500 manat, and for families with a per capita monthly income  of less than the minimum wage times two, monetary compensation  amounting to 750 manat a month per child 16 years of age and  under. These sums of compensation shall be paid from the  resources of the republic budget.    To consider lapsed in this connection the Republic of  Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 "Payment of  Compensation to Nonworking Retirees" and clause two of Republic  of Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993  "Supplementary Measures in the Field of Regulation of the Price  of Bread and Bakery Products and Increased Social Protection for  the Needy Strata of the Populace."    3.

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Lynk ousted as UDM President MR ROY LYNK, the Nottinghamshire miners' leader who strongly backed government privatisation plans for the coal industry, has been ousted as president of the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, David Goodhart writes. He was convincingly defeated by Mr Neil Greatrex, the UDM's Nottinghamshire area president. Mr Greatrex is expected to take a more sceptical view of privatisation. Mr Greatrex won 2,326 votes to Mr Lynk's 1,586. The union has about 15,000 members. Mr Greatrex recently called for a general strike against the pit closures.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOVIES;  </P> <P> SUMMER HITS: THE SEEDS OF VIDEO'S SPRING;  </P> <P> 'YOU WANT TO TIME IT SO YOUR SUMMER HITS ARE ON THE VIDEO SHELVES WHEN THERE IS  THE GREATEST DEMAND'  </P> <P> 'When the causes of the Decline of Western Civilization are finally writ,"  wrote Daily Variety four years ago, "Hollywood will surely have to answer why  it turned one of man's most significant art forms over to the  self-gratification of high-schoolers."  </P> <P> Variety, the daily diary of the Hollywood dream, was essentially chastising its  own readers for pandering to adolescent tastes with films that were low in  protein and high in saturated fats. Movies, especially summer movies, were  feeding young minds a diet of graphic gore, repetitious science fiction and  voyeuristic sex comedies.  </P> <P> All in all, Hollywood seemed intent on disproving the notion that youngsters  today are smarter than ever.  </P> <P> However, in making its doomsday prognosis, Variety made one questionable  assumption -- that commercial film-making is a significant art form -- and  overlooked a couple of related trends. Although Hollywood would be the last to  know, American demographics were skewing older. The pool of easy-to-please  teen-age consumers was shrinking while adults of all ages were returning en  masse to movies via their handy videocassette recorders.  </P> <P> "Video renters have always been a little older (than moviegoers)," says Meir  Hed, co-owner of the Videotheque chain of video stores in Los Angeles. "They  would wait for movies to come out, and watch them at home. They rediscovered  the pleasure of movies through video, watching films that weren't chopped up  and interrupted by commercials. That got them going back to movies."  </P> <P> Teen-agers are still a dominant force in the market -- witness the lineup of  "no-brainer" sequels coming out this summer -- but the video after-market has  dramatically altered the makeup of the industry's consumer base and has  prompted a basic change in the quality and variety of films being made.  </P> <P> Five years ago, the major studios were almost exclusively the manufacturers of  teen-age toys. Adult-theme movies were left to independent film makers and  boutique distributors, and summers were virtually conceded to people who were  still growing up.  </P> <P> Pick a summer early in this decade and you'll have trouble finding a film that  didn't include lasers, slit throats or giddy shower scenes. In 1983,  Avco-Embassy was modestly rewarded for releasing Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and  Alexander" during the summer, and a year later, Universal dropped John Huston's  "Under the Volcano" off at a few theaters.  </P> <P> It wasn't until 1985, however, when another Huston film proved to the industry  that a good adult-theme movie could do good business during the summer.  "Prizzi's Honor," a sophisticated gangster comedy that also beat the odds  against early releases getting Oscar nominations, grossed nearly $25 million.  </P> <P> Hector Babenco's "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" and John Boorman's "The Emerald  Forest" also did well that summer, and the onus on adult-oriented summer films  was lifted. Last summer, there were more than a dozen certifiably "smart"  pictures playing in theaters and a couple of them -- "A Fish Called Wanda" and  "Bull Durham" -- did some smart business for their distributors.  </P> <P> Some of the other films released last summer, unthinkable choices three or four  years earlier, were "Married to the Mob," "Tucker," "The Last Temptation of  Christ," "Eight Men Out," "Clean and Sober," "Crossing Delancey" and "Midnight  Run."  </P> <P> Most of those films were R-rated, and those that weren't were clearly not meant  to appeal to kids. The distributors, driven by market forces that didn't exist  10 years ago, were supplying two essential demands. They were providing movies  for adults who go to theaters year-round, and they were putting into the  pipeline titles that would be released on video the following winter and  spring, when demand is greatest in that market.  </P> <P> "We have to very careful in terms of scheduling (films for theatrical  release)," says Robert Klingensmith, president of Paramount Pictures' very  successful video division. "The video market has strong and weak seasons, too,  and you want to time it so your summer hits are on the video shelves when there  is the greatest demand."  </P> <P> Art Murphy, who watches industry trends for Variety, says that the film  business remains a hits-driven business and that the year's biggest hits still  emerge during summer, when 40% of the $4-billion theatrical grosses are  accounted for.  </P> <P> "The films that you read about as having huge video sales, most of them are  summer releases," Murphy says. "Films that are big in theaters are big in every  other market."  </P> <P> "E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial" proves the point. Steven Spielberg's sentimental  tale about a boy and his pal from outer space became the most popular film in  history when it was released in the summer of 1982. Last Christmas, when it  finally made it to the video stores, it claimed the crown in that arena, too.  MCA-Universal pumped 15 million taped copies of the movie into the video market  with a retail price tag of $29.95. (Universal and Spielberg's Amblin  Entertainment reportedly each got $5 per tape, or $75 million each from the  sale.)  </P> <P> We've come a long way from the days, not all that long ago, when the American  studios released films in theaters here and abroad, milked them in second-run  houses and drive-ins, then waited seven years for a handsome payoff for network  airings on TV. The formula now is American and foreign theatrical releases,  followed from six to nine months later by a video release, followed a few  months later by a pay-cable release, followed a year or so later -- if anybody  cares -- by release on commercial TV.  </P> <P> The Video Revolution has happened so fast that even those in the eye of the  storm have had trouble predicting its course.  </P> <P> Klingensmith, who has been involved in video from its inception in the late  '70s, says the most optimistic video analyst didn't dream that video would be  where it is today.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago, someone asked me where I thought it was headed," Klingensmith  recalls, "and I said that by 1985, there will be nine or 10 million VCR homes,  and a film may do $10 million in sales. At Paramount, we've had 25 movies do  better than that."  </P> <P> The fact sheet on video, 1989:  </P> <P>  -- There are 50 million households with VCRs.  </P> <P>  -- The video industry now buys about $3 billion worth of videos from  distributors each year and grosses an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion from  rentals and retail sales.  </P> <P>  -- The film industry makes more money from its sales of films on videocassette  than it does from domestic box-office rentals (about $2 billion a year).  </P> <P>  -- There are more video stores in America than theater screens (about 30,000  to about 23,000), and when you include supermarkets, bookstores and other  businesses dabbling in video rentals, there are more than 50,000 outlets.  </P> <P> With most of those stores stocking more than 1,000 titles and carrying  virtually every new major studio release, profitable sales are assured for all  but the most stupendous flops. And even those find their way onto video shelves  in some number (you'll note there is always a copy of "Ishtar" and "Leonard  Part VI" available).  </P> <P> Industry analysts say the surest trend ahead is the demise of the mom-and-pop  video stores. Eventually, they predict, the video business -- sales and rentals  -- will be dominated by five or six super chains, which themselves may become  the targets of conglomerate entertainment takeovers.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the video market is having a major say in the kinds of movies  the film industry turns out. It is true, as Art Murphy said, that the biggest  hits in theaters become the biggest hits on video, but the ratio of their  success, compared to less popular theatrical releases, is not as great. A hit  movie that grosses $150 million at the box office will return about half that  amount to the distributor in film rentals, and guarantee the distributor of a  video sale that may net a third as much, or $25 million. Meanwhile, many films  that gross less than $20 million in theaters ($10 million or less in film  rentals) go on to earn much more in video.  </P> <P> That is why certain adult-theme films that would have been persona non grata  from the summer schedule a few years ago are now routinely included.  </P> <P> Paramount, the studio with perhaps the best summer batting average of the last  decade, released two films last summer -- "Presidio" and "Tucker" -- that made  more money from video sales than from ticket sales.  </P> <P> "These films did not light up box office magic," Klingensmith concedes, "but  they are going to be terrific for us on video. 'Tucker' got exceptional reviews  and some Academy Award nominations and the want-to-see on it is tremendous."  </P> <P> Klingensmith estimated that Paramount would sell more than a quarter of a  million "Tucker" tapes. The film brought in film-rental receipts of about $12  million, Klingensmith said, while the tape sale figured to bring in close to  $15 million. He said "Presidio" will net about $13 million from video, compared  to the $9 million it is estimated to have earned from rentals to theaters.  </P> <P> "Blockbusters in theaters are never as big in video," Klingensmith said.  "They're strong, and they're the leaders, but it is those 50 to 70 mid-range  theatrical films that do exceptionally well in video."  </P> <P> Even small films now have a chance of being a reasonably big hit on video.  Movies like "Blue Velvet" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" with  controversial themes that made them newsworthy far beyond their commercial  successes are bound to be hot in video stores going one-on-one with the  consumers who didn't have the time or the opportunity to see them in theaters.  </P> <P> According to video-industry analysts, the video appetite for films is six times  as great as that for first-run features. A person who sees one first-run  feature a month is considered a frequent moviegoer. The average video consumer  rents six movies a month.  </P> <P> "There is an appetite for every family that owns a VCR," says one video  distributor. "It's like the plant in 'Little Shop of Horrors,' saying, 'Feed  me.' We're trying to make sure it's fed."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A  CLASSIC).;  </P> <P> *** TANITA TIKARAM "THE SWEET KEEPER" REPRISE  </P> <P> Only 20, Tikaram has written two good chapters now on how to be young,  sensitive and deep without sounding arch, prissy and cloying. A lot of the  credit belongs to co-producers Peter an Hooke and Rod Argent, whose musical  pedigrees (Van Morrison, Zombies/Argent) are even more interesting than  Tikaram's exotic Asian-British background.  </P> <P> The producers etch appropriate, distinctive markings into nearly every song --  a fetching Celtic fiddle, somber flute and strings, some humid trumpet or  evocative bottleneck guitar.  </P> <P> These colorations are vital, because Tikaram's vocal range is narrow, and her  songs tend toward sameness of tone. With singing that emphasizes exploratory  phrasings and adventurous shifts of intensity, she does a lot to overcome these  limitations. For example, Tikaram is able to try on different accents -- a  Jamaican lilt or an Irish brogue -- and sound expressive rather than affected  (Natalie Merchant should ask her how she does it).  </P> <P> The songs on "The Sweet Keeper" are impressionistic, but never pointless.  Unlike her predominantly world-weary debut, "Ancient Heart," this album conveys  a low-key exuberance. Tikaram's songs about lovers and family never minimize  how cloudy emotional weather can be, but that only makes her more believable  when she sings about wanting to seek out the sun streaks in between.

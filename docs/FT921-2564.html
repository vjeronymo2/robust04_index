			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Former Red Army in crisis ANOTHER warning of disintegration in the former Soviet army was delivered yesterday by Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief-of-staff of the armed forces, now under the collective control of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Speaking to the armed forces daily newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Samsonov said the army was facing widespread desertions and evasions of the draft in the face of rising ethnic struggles, especially in the Caucasus. 'The situation has arisen where we can no longer defend ourselves. There is no one left. There are units in which officers have to stand guard. It is shameful,' he said. Concern over the rising dissatisfaction in the army has prompted the Russian government to create a Russian Defence Ministry, charged with preparing the ground for a Russian army. However, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, stressed to parliamentary deputies yesterday that the CIS remains 'an issue of geoplitical and strategic priority for Russia'. Confusion over the future of the armed forces, and their weaponry, was underlined yesterday when Mr Yeltsin said Ukraine had backed down on its threat to retain possession of tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, while Ukrainian officials said they knew nothing of a change of policy. Mr Yeltsin told deputies he had been assured by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, that the missiles would be returned by July 1 as planned. A Nato spokesman was quoted as saying Ukraine had pledged to do so. Last week, Mr Kravchuk announced he would halt the transport of the missiles because of instability in Russia.</p>

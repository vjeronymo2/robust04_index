			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Knowing where you stand with buses - Worth Watching Bus passengers in the West Midlands will be the first in the UK to benefit from an information system which uses satellite technology to inform travellers when the next bus will arrive. Centro, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, has placed a Pounds 1.2m contract with a consortium led by ICL Enterprises to develop a pilot system to operate on two bus routes from the summer of 1994. The buses will carry equipment to enable them to calculate their position within 30 yards, using the global positioning system navigational satellites. The bus then sends this information back to base by radio. By sampling the position of the bus every 30 seconds and combining this with knowledge of the route held on the central computer, software algorithms can calculate when the bus will arrive at each stop. This information will be displayed on electronic screens at the bus stops. Centro: UK, 021 200 2787.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking everything into account - What your bank manager really wants to know It has been a fraught half hour for the four directors of Pristine Pools. They have been trying to persuade the bank manager to agree to a Pounds 70,000 overdraft to help their pool cleaning business get off the ground. Among their difficulties are the limited funds - just Pounds 20,000  - they can put up as share capital and uncertainty surrounding two large local authority contracts they hope to win. It has not been an easy session. The bank manager has questioned the directors closely on their backgrounds and was reluctant to lend without security in the form of personal guarantees. Fortunately for the four, the questioning formed part of a training course entitled Survive your Bank Manager, run by the Hertfordshire Training and Enterprise Council*. If it had been a real interview, it seems unlikely that they would have raised the money. In the debriefing session, the 'bank manager' said she was annoyed by the argumentative approach of one member of the Pristine team, adding: 'They presented their credentials well, but after that they fell apart a bit'. With the banks taking an increasingly tough line on lending to small firms in the present recession, knowing how to get on with your bank manager and how to put a convincing case for funds is crucial. It is clear that some of the 20 participants on the course have problems understanding their real-life bank manager. 'They put you on the spot,' says Sarah Maidment, director of Harvee Engineering of St Albans. 'They ask you why you haven't brought in certain information when you didn't know they wanted it.' 'The rules have changed,' comments Oliver Shannon of the High Barnet-based Printing Company. 'You find yourself second-guessing them.' The morning session starts with a look at the question of gearing - the participants are surprised at how, apparently, small changes in interest rates can radically alter an investor's return from a particular investment  -before moving on to the crucial area of cash flow forecasts. These are not difficult to prepare but will be one of the key documents a bank manager will expect to see. Companies which fail frequently do so after a very good year's trading, warns Peter Phillips, a former chief accountant with British Coal and presenter of the course. 'Fast growing companies often run out of cash. They do not realise that cash and profits are not the same thing.' Businesses frequently run into problems because they do not collect on time the money which is owing to them - turnover shoots up but the business is still short of cash to pay wages - but there are other transactions which will affect a businesses cash flow without showing up on its profit and loss (p and l) account. Buying an expensive item of equipment will have an immediate impact on the cash available in the business but the p and l will only record the amount by which that equipment is depreciated in any year. Similarly, the p and l will not take into account spending on stock but only the amount used up, which may be smaller. As part of the Pristine Pools exercise, course participants draw up a 12-month cash flow forecast so as to calculate the size of the loan they will need to ask for. This brings home the implications of a large customer making them wait two months for payment. A cash flow forecast is a crucial part of any approach to a bank manager, but forms only one of the criteria by which you will be judged, Phillips explains. Bank managers will normally base their discussion with you on the Campari mnemonic or a similar system. Campari stands for: CHARACTER Bank managers are expected to take into account the stability of your personal life and how long you have been a customer. ABILITY Do you have a successful track record in business and is it relevant to the business you now want to set up? The banks are not renowned for taking a positive view of previous failures. MARGIN The rate of interest will reflect the manager's view of the risk. PURPOSE The bank will obviously want to know what the loan is for. The manager may have burned his fingers in a particular sector, such as property, or regional office may have set down exclusions. AMOUNT The bank will probably not want to lend more than the sum you are putting into the business, but it is also not in its interest for you to start up with too little finance. REPAYMENT Will you meet sales forecasts and achieve a large enough margin to repay the loan? INSURANCE The bank will usually want security even if its other criteria have been met. This may be fixed against a specific asset or floating against all the assets of the business. You will probably have to explain these issues to the bank manager but include them in more detail in a written business plan. This should include projections for sales - broken down by customer and market - as well as cash flow and profit forecasts. Increasingly, bank managers are looking at financial criteria at the expense of the possibly more subjective elements in Campari-style analysis, Phillips explains. At the heart of their analysis are certain financial ratios. Phillips suggests three key figures: The acid test. This measures your ability to pay your creditors. Divide debtors and cash by your current liabilities. A result of 1 or more indicates the business has enough cash to pay its outstanding bills. Interest cover. This indicates whether you can repay the interest on loans. Divide profits before tax and interest by the interest due. Bankers do not usually like this number to fall below 2. Return on capital employed. Divide profits before tax and interest by shareholders funds and loans and multiply the answer by 100 per cent. The figure arrived at should not, over the long term, fall below what could be earned if you left the money on deposit or what you pay in interest. When the course participants return for their second session with Pristine Pools the simple cash flow forecast has become a more extensive business plan with details of pricing and promotion policies and forecasts for cash flow, profits and balance sheets. They put a convincing case to the bank manager who offers to provide what has now become an Pounds 80,000 overdraft at 5 per cent above base rate. However, this appears rather expensive to the directors of Pristine Pools, who have a potential corporate backer in the wings, so they retire to think about the bank manager's offer. Life may have become tough for the small company seeking business but it has not got any easier for the bank manager either. *Hertforshire Training and Enterprise Council, New Barnes Mill, Cottonmill Lane, Sopwell, St Albans, Herts AL1 2HA.

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: GE Capital to buy part of Avis Europe GE CAPITAL, the main financial services arm of General Electric, has reinforced its expansion in Europe with an agreement in principle to buy the vehicle leasing and fleet management business of Avis Europe, the car rental company. The business being sold is Avis Lease, and GE Capital will acquire the right to use this name. The operation has assets of around Dollars 900m and some 120,000 vehicles in 14 European countries. GE Capital declined to say how much it was paying. Mr Alun Cathcart, chairman of Avis Europe, said its leasing business had seen significant growth rates over the past five years and was expected to enjoy similar expansion over the next several years. However, a company of Avis Europe's size could not handle its likely requirements for future asset finance. Avis Europe, the continent's market leader in car rental, is a private business owned 65 per cent by Lease International Belgium, 26 per cent by General Motors of the US and 11 per cent by Avis Inc of the US. GE Capital, the second largest non-bank financial services company in the US, has been gradually expanding into Europe - primarily the UK - over the past two years via acquisitions. It has bought private label credit card businesses from Burton and House of Fraser and a consumer car finance business from Barclays Bank. However, this is the first European venture by GE Capital Fleet Services, the largest corporate fleet management business in North America, with more than 500,000 vehicles under lease or service management. Ms Teresa LeGrand, president of GE Capital Fleet Services, said the combination of the two companies would create the foundation for a global vehicle leasing network. Avis Lease employs around 1,000 people and its largest operations are in Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. Mr Cathcart said it had a good record of profits and in recent years had seen fleet growth of 15 to 20 per cent in some markets. Avis Europe was floated off from Avis Inc, its US parent, in a public offering in London in 1986 but was taken private again in 1989.</p>

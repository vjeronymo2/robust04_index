			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Clash over SIB proposals for new regulatory body A ROW has broken out between UK banks and the Securities and Investments Board, regulator of the financial services industry, over SIB's recent suggestion that it may need to acquire new powers to force individual financial organisations to join specific self-regulatory organisations. SIB has said that if banks continue to refuse to join a proposed new SRO for the retail financial services industry, called the Personal Investment Authority, it may need to ask the government for powers to 'define the scope of SROs', or decide the membership of each SRO. These powers would enable it to force the banks to join the PIA. However, in a letter to SIB, the British Bankers' Association, the banks' trade association, argues that giving such powers to SIB would mean 'the end of the SROs in their present form'. The letter continues: 'The SIB would ultimately find itself as the sole authority, with the SRO boards evolv-ing into advisory boards relating to divisions of the SIB.' However, SIB is understood to be unimpressed by this argument that the nature of the UK regulatory system would change radically. It feels the banks have failed to provide any evidence for this view. The banks are also likely to be disappointed in their interpretation of recent remarks by Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for financial services regulation. They interpreted remarks he made last week as ruling out new primary legislation for the reform of financial services regulation and that, therefore, he would not be giving powers to SIB to define SROs' scope. It is believed, however, that he is prepared to contemplate legislation if the banks will not join the PIA of their own accord. Earlier this month the banks' concerns about joining the PIA were eased slightly when Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, told the PIA that its regulatory standards must be tougher than it had originally been planning.</p>

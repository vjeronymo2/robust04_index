			<p>BFN     [Text] Liberia's new justice minister, Councillor Laveli  Supuwood, has called on fighters to turn in their arms and work  toward enhancing the peace process. Minister Supuwood was  speaking yesterday at the Executive Mansion following the  commissioning of he and three other NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia] nominees confirmed yesterday by the  Transitional Assembly. He said Liberians should not be deprived  of their peace and freedom of movement only to satisfy a handful  of people. Minister Supuwood also called on the international  community, friendly governments, and the business community to  recognize the Liberian National Transitional Government, saying  it is the legitimate government of the people of Liberia.</p>

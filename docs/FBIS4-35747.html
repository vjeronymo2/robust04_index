			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on  3 June carries a 200-word report by Roni Shaqed and David Regev  stating: "Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leaders in the  territories and outside are discussing the possibility of  turning the movement into a political party to operate -- during  the first stage -- in the Gaza and Jericho autonomy area.    "By adopting this approach Hamas wants to preserve its  political power and become an element which will participate in  elections to institutions and organizations -- including the  self-rule bodies.    "Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of Hamas' leaders in the Gaza  Strip, has confirmed that his movement is examining the  possibility of turning into a political party similar to other  political parties in the territories, including Fatah. He noted  that the establishment of a party does not change the movement's  thinking or strategy, but rather constitutes a way to advance  its cause among the public."    A 600-word report by Yosi Torpstein on page A10 of HA'ARETZ  on 3 June says that "Hamas and the Democratic Front may join  Fatah in establishing a temporary municipal council in Nabulus.  In a meeting this week attended by all organizations and  institutions in Nabulus, Hamas made its agreement conditional  upon support of all the political forces in the city and  preparations for elections to be held in the near future."    The report adds that "the contacts toward the establishment  of a municipal council are directed by attorney Ghassan  al-Shak'ah, who was appointed by 'Arafat and who enjoys the  support of most Fatah activists in Nabulus. Al-Shak'ah noted  that he intends to set up a committee for managing city affairs  in the next year -- after which elections are to be held,  according to al-Shak'ah. He noted that the municipal committee  will maintain contacts with the self- government authority in  Gaza and Jericho."    HA'ARETZ adds: "Sources in Nabulus explain that a municipal  council is necessary because international aid for municipal  development is conditional upon an authoritative local body  which will maintain contacts with donors. They added that most  political bodies in the city recognize the importance of  financial aid for municipal development, and that most of the  population supports this move."    An 800-word report by Yehuda Litani on page 8 of Tel Aviv  SHISHI in Hebrew on 3 June, however, accentuates the growing  tension between the Palestinian police and Hamas in the Gaza  Strip. The report says that "General Nasr Yusuf, the commander  of the Palestinian army and police forces in the Gaza Strip,  this week almost issued a sharp public warning to Hamas, but was  prevented from doing so at the last minute by Yasir 'Arafat."  The report notes that Gen. Yusuf and PLO officials in the strip  were angered by Hamas' execution of two suspected collaborators,  contrary to the orders issued by Gen. Yusuf immediately after he  entered the Gaza Strip.    The report goes on to say that "there is great tension  between the two organizations in the Gaza Strip, and according  to Palestinian sources in Gaza 'one match could ignite the  entire area.'" The sources add that any further Hamas activity  which is not coordinated with the PLO, and Gen. Yusuf in  particular, "could result in direct and violent confrontation  between the Palestinian Authority members and Hamas in the Gaza  Strip." In a meeting with Gaza journalists, Gen. Yusuf issued a  sharp warning to Hamas "not to undertake independent operations  which are not coordinated with official security elements." The  report adds that the tension between the organizations was  exacerbated by the detention of an Islamic Jihad activist  suspected of involvement in the murder of two Israeli soldiers  and by Gen. Yusuf's call on Hamas and Islamic Jihad to hand over  their weapons, a call which has been publicly defied by Hamas.    The reports ends: "Gen. Yusuf, who considers himself to be  the supreme commander of the Palestinian security forces in the  autonomy, regards Hamas rejection of his demands as a direct  challenge posed by the Islamic organizations and an attempt to  undermine his authority."</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> READER'S DIGEST TO PUBLISH FRENCH 'BUDGETS FAMILLE'  </P> <P> Reader's Digest Assn. Inc. said today it will launch a new monthly magazine in  France this fall as part of the publishing company's strategy to expand  operations overseas.  </P> <P> Budgets Famille (Family Budgets) will contain news, feature articles and tips  on topics ranging from savings and borrowing strategies to the best ways  families can budget for their children's education as well as leisure  activities like vacation," said Reader's Digest, the publisher of the most  widely read magazine in the world.  </P> <P> Budgets Famille, to debut on French newsstands in October, will target the 30-  to 45-year-old parents in upper- and middle-income families, the publisher  said.  </P> <P> Budgets Famille is Reader's Digest's first foreign start-up publication since  the company announced last year a plan to expand its operations overseas  through acquisitions and the launching of new special interest magazines.  </P> <P> "It is too early to disclose sales or advertisements projections for Budgets  Famille at this stage," said spokesman Bruce Trachtenberg. "But we are  confident the publication will meet the demand."  </P> <P> Henri Capdeville, managing director for the publishing group's French division,  noted that while there are a number of French business magazines focusing on  personal finances, none cover specific family issues. The French edition of  Reader's Digest, called Selection, has a monthly circulation of 1.1 million.  </P> <P> "We think Budgets Famille will provide an ideal target market for advertisers,"  Capdeville said.  </P></p>

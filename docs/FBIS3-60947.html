[passage omitted]    At a meeting with a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation  today, he reviewed the Tourism Ministry's future policy to  revive tourism in Egypt, especially from the United States as an  important tourism export market.    Speaking about Egypt's losses due to terrorism, he said  Egypt  has incurred losses at all levels. He added that these  incidents have sharply and directly deepened the tourism crisis  in Egypt. He noted that the number of tourists decreased from  3.2 million in 1992 to 2.2 million as of October in 1993.  Tourist nights decreased from about 20 million to around 13  million as of October 1993 and tourism revenues dropped from  $2.3 billion in 1992 to $1.1 billion as of October 1993. He  pointed out that these statistics are serious indications as to  the severity of the crisis. [passage omitted]</p>

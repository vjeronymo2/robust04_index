			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at the Los </F> Pinos Presidential Residence on 10 January -- recorded]    [Text] The Government of the Republic has the essential  duty of ensuring the validity of the state of law and the safety  of the citizens. Therefore, it is willing to undertake actions  to prevent the dynamics of the serious events that have taken  place in Chiapas State from leading to more confrontations.  This requires political decisions in favor of the nation, and  which are a recognition of what did not work properly.    In order to guarantee full adherence to the Constitution and  the law in the public decisions demanded under the  circumstances, and in order to open efficacious channels for  reconciliation and justice in Chiapas State, based on Article 82  of the Constitution, we have agreed to:    1. Appoint Dr. Jorge Carpizo as government secretary. His  mission will be to bear the responsibility of that office to  guarantee that all the decisions necessary to restore the  tranquility in Chiapas State as soon as possible, and maintain  it in the rest of the country, will be in strict accordance with  the law; and also to guarantee that the 1994 federal elections  will be carried out in strict accordance with our Constitution  and the new standing legislation.    This morning I accepted the resignation of Jose Patrocinio  Gonzalez Blanco-Garrido.    2. In light of the need to create a framework, an agenda,  and procedures for reconciliation of the conflict in Chiapas  State, while meeting with Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis, we discussed  his feelings about fulfilling this task. He said that as it is  such an important cause for the nation, his work would require  very broad flexibility for action in society and permanent  access to the highest level in the government.    As it is in fact a totally new topic, he will be the  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. He will  have the support of, and permanent access to the president of  the Republic.    On his part, he will seek to open spaces for society to  contribute to the reconciliation in Chiapas State, aside from  the general context. [sentence as heard]    Mr. Manuel Camacho, asked me to allow him to carry out that  duty without a salary and without creating any new government  organization.    3. Mr. Manuel Tello Macias, will be the foreign relations  secretary. Ambassador Tello Macias, a career diplomat, will  guide the foreign policy with firmness and prudence, based on  historic principles that shall always care for the national  sovereignty.    4. Mr. Diego Valadez will be the attorney general of the  Republic. Mr. Valadez, a well-known attorney, was until today  the attorney general of the Federal District. He has broad  experience in government duties and administration of justice.  His instructions are to fulfill and enforce the Constitution  and the laws, while maintaining the guidelines of conduct and  work that have been characteristic of this institution.    Mr. Rene Gonzalez de la Vega, will be the acting attorney  general of the Federal District.    I have sworn in all these public servants and they will  immediately assume their new duties.    With these guidelines and political decisions, the  government  of the Republic will strengthen the law and respect for human  rights, and open channels for conciliation without ceasing, at  any moment, to guarantee safety in Chiapas State.    The Mexican Army, with loyalty and patriotism spawned from  its historic roots and its popular origin, in fulfilling its  constitutional responsibility and in accordance with the policy  of the government of the Republic, will continue to guarantee  the safety of the citizens in Chiapas; and, together with the  proper authorities, will contribute to keeping individuals or  groups from seeking to disrupt, through violence, the  tranquility of the families and the harmony of the country.    Thank you very much.</p>

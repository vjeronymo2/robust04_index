Yesterday is the first day in which all state-owned grain  stores began providing an unlimited supply of grains and cooking  oil by lowering prices and hanging a prices plate. Early in the  morning that day, Secretary of the provincial party committee  Jiang Chunyun, and Deputy Secretary of the provincial party  committee and Vice Governor of the province Li Chunting were  accompanied by responsible comrades of the provincial level  departments concerned, on a trip to the provincial grains and  cereal oil group corporation listen to a briefing, discuss  measures, and make work arrangements for maintaining low prices  for grains and cooking oil. The entourage then went to the  grain and cereal oil foodstuffs center on Shengli Street to  inspect the sale and supply of grains and to extend cordial  regards to staff members and workers at the center. Jiang  Chunyun pointed out: Rapid efforts need to be made to keep down  the prices of grains and cooking oil and ensure market  stability. He said: Localities in the east and west of the  province incurred an overly large scale of price hikes in grains  and cooking oil since the last 10 days of November. Attaching  great importance to this, the provincial party committee and the  provincial people's government stabilized grain prices by  adopting effective measures in line with the spirit of  directives of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.  Thus, grain prices in some localities have begun to recede. He  said: Grain prices affect the whole situation and should be  lowered as soon as possible so that the price of grains and  other nonstaple foodstuffs are brought to a rational level by  resolutely implementing the important policy decisions made by  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, enhancing  leadership, adopting measures, and by successfully conducting  work.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: In order to enable the mass to clear  their minds of doubt and misgiving, we should enhance propaganda  and education to stabilize people's feelings and clearly tell  the masses that the grain supply is ensured by sufficient  storage of grain from this year's bumper harvests of grains and  oil-bearing seeds. Allocation of the supply of grains and  cooking oil, processing of grains, and promotion of sales in  grains and cooking oil should be done well. State-owned grain  centers should bring their major distributing role into play.  All of them should conduct their sales with the plate of  unified prices and at the lowered prices and provide unlimited  supply. Efforts should be made to ensure the grain supply for  large and medium-sized cities and disaster-plagued areas. The  grain supply for higher and secondary educational institutions  should be ensured along wholesale prices. Various departments  as well as industries and trades should actively make  contributions to stabilizing the grain prices and markets.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: A good job should be  realistically done to provide markets with a grain supply during  the Spring Festival. Commodity distributing departments and  enterprises on the commercial front should extensively open more  channels, organize the sources of goods to enter markets,  upgrade their service quality, and saturate the festive demands  of the people. They should render delivery services for remote  areas; the old, weak, sick, and disabled; households enjoying  the five guarantees; and the family members of martyrs and  servicemen.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: An especially good job should be  done in managing the livelihood of the masses in the  disaster-plagued areas and the staff members and workers of  enterprises suffering losses. Party committees and governments  at all levels should immediately conduct examination over their  living conditions and adopt every possible means to successfully  deal with their practical difficulties. Meanwhile, we should  launch a campaign of having rich households help. Wealthy areas  and money-making enterprises should give a helping hand to  disaster-plagued areas and fully express the superiority of  socialist systems under the leadership of Communist party.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: A good job should be done in  consolidating public security in a comprehensive way and  maintaining production safety so as to ensure the absence of  serious incidents concerning public security and production  safety during the Spring Festival and to ensure that the masses  feel safe. Efforts should be made to enrich the masses' festive  cultural life and a good job should be continuously done in  combating corruption and encouraging administrative honesty. We  should resolutely block various malpractices, such as hosting  banquets and presenting gifts with public funds as well as  indulging in extravagant eating and drinking. We should  saturate the demands set by the party in this regard with our  qualified work achievements.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial people's government, Jiang Chunyun extended festive  greetings to the cadres, staff members, and workers on the  province's grain front as well as to the people throughout the  province in handling the official work on the spot. He wished  the people across the province a happy new year and even greater  achievements in the new year.</p>

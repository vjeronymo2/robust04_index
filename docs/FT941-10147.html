			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Top job worries hit BAe Fears that British Aerospace may become rudderless following weekend reports of the chairman's impending departure exacted a toll on the stock. At the day's worst the shares were 23 cheaper at 542p, but came off the bottom in the afternoon to finish 16 down on balance at 549p. There was also talk that BAe would join forces with defence electronics group GEC to mount a counter-bid for helicopter company Westland Group, now under siege from GKN, which launched a Pounds 496m bid on Tuesday. Market watchers were largely dismissive of the talk, and one said: 'The problem is - which of the two bidders would own Westland?' Last weekend, BAe revived the idea of a strategic link with GEC to create a single UK defence contracting group. Yesterday's speculation left GEC trailing 6 at 344p. Shares in Westland jumped 23 to 330p after the board formally rejected the offer from GKN. Analysts predicted the predator would have to raise its 290p a share offer to win control of the helicopter group. The prospect of having to increase its bid saw shares in GKN relinquish 22 to 560p.</p>

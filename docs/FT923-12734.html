			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Painting each other in the worst possible hue - Kalon's bid for Manders has sparked off a battle in the paints industry KALON might mean 'beautiful' in ancient Greek, but to Mr Roger Akers, chief executive of Manders (Holdings), the paints, inks and property group, it is more likely to mean the opposite. The recent intrusion of Kalon Group into his life was at best 'bloody inconsiderate'. He had just started a Caribbean holiday when news of its hostile bid for Manders brought him straight back to the UK to fight for his company's independence. On the face of it, he and Mr Roy Amos, Manders' chairman, have something of an uphill struggle. Kalon, the Yorkshire-based paint maker, opened its 8-for-3 Pounds 91.5m paper offer with a blistering comparison of Manders' management record versus its own. By many measures from earnings growth to cash generation, the bidder has far out-performed its target. The man behind Kalon's performance, Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director since 1988, has reaped personal rewards. He was awarded a Pounds 745,300 bonus last year for Kalon's steep rise in earnings per share between 1989 and 1991. The companies have pursued sharply different tacks. While Kalon was stripping itself back to its core paint business, Manders spent Pounds 23m (net of disposals) in building up three areas - paints, inks and property. Some Pounds 14m went on buying the remaining leaseholds in the Mander Centre, an office and retail development in Wolverhampton, and about Pounds 4m refurbishing it. Paint manufacturing plants, often 30 to 40 years old, have been updated and productivity has 'shot up'; distribution and trade depots have been revamped, often moving to edge-of-town sites. Inks have been rationalised from nine factories to three. Acquisitions have made Manders the market leader in liquid inks for food packaging. Manders' 'long and expensive' modernisation is over, Mr Akers says, and the group is now poised to benefit. Kalon argues, though, that the strategy has over-stretched Manders' finances and management. It points out that Manders' earnings per share last year were lower than in any year since 1987, its borrowings rose to Pounds 33.3m from Pounds 13.4m in 1987, and pre-tax profits at Pounds 6.04m were less than 1988's Pounds 6.12m. Although Manders had been 'neglected until 1986' when Mr Akers arrived, 'it is more than just a paints company like Kalon', he says. Inks account for more than 40 per cent of turnover, and the Mander Centre is valued in Manders' 1991 accounts at Pounds 57.5m. Mr Akers questions the depth of Kalon. 'Imagine it as a navy with one battleship, and us as a navy with three cruisers,' he says. 'If they lose a ship, they are dead in the water - we can lose a cruiser and still have two left.' Kalon says it would sell the Mander Centre and has no particular plans for the inks division. What it really wants - and perhaps needs, to maintain its progress - is the paints side. It has emphasised that a combined group would gain from: the integration of four factories into three in paint production; of two factories into one in industrial coatings and of two head offices into one; from rationalised usage and stronger purchasing power in raw materials; from increased market share (the two companies, it says, have complementary strengths in trade and retail paints); and from an enlarged customer base in decorative sundries and wall coverings. Manders is relying on two defensive strategies. First, it is pushing - with cross-party, though mainly Labour, support - for the bid's referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. So far 62 MPs have signed a Commons motion. Kalon argues the takeover would only boost its market share from 16 per cent to 23 per cent of the whole decorative paints market, making it fourth behind ICI, Crown Berger and Akzo. But Manders says the merged group would have 75 per cent of the own-label market. Second, Manders acknowledges its profits have lagged behind the bidder's. But it says Kalon's were inflated by 'windfall' profits in 1990 and 1991 which boosted its share price and gave it the springboard to launch the paper bid. Manders ascribes Kalon's 57 per cent rise to Pounds 9.22m in 1991 to several factors: the decision of ICI, the market leader, to raise its paint prices by about 10 per cent, which boosted all paint prices; recession, which encouraged people to trade down to own-label paints; and the fall in the price of raw materials. Manders argues that the 'circumstances are unlikely to coincide again'. Kalon claims, though, that its ex-factory paint prices increased in the first quarter of 1992 despite the Paintmakers Association figures which show a 5 per cent fall. The own-label market is one key to the bid battle. Too late to gain from the windfall profits, Manders bought Windeck Paints, second only to Kalon in the sale of own-label paints to DIY chains, for Pounds 5.66m last December. Mr Akers says an 'unbacked' Windeck, with about 16 per cent of the own-label market, was 'no danger' to Kalon which controls 60 per cent. But under Manders, Windeck is a threat. He claims Kalon did not know Windeck was for sale, that it would only have acquired it to close it, and even suggests that Kalon's failure to buy Windeck led to the current bid. Mr Hennessy counters that Kalon did not buy Windeck because its paints did not comply with the BS5750 standard. Manders has improved the plant and applied for certification under the standard. Manders argues, moreover, that Kalon has underestimated the potential loss of busi-ness across own-label, trade and retail paints after inte-gration. It cites the fall in combined market share at Crown and Berger after they merged. While the two sides argue the toss about the outlook for paints, Manders shareholders are left with a straight choice. They can remain loyal to a management which says it can now produce profit growth across all its divisions. Or they can back a management trying to build a paints company that can compete in a rapidly consolidating market.</p>

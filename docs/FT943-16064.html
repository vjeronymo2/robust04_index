			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Airbus to form finance subsidiary Airbus Industrie, the European aerospace consortium, is expected to announce today the formation of an aircraft financing subsidiary, to be called Airbus Finance Corp. The new company will handle the financing of future Airbus sales, and AFC could eventually handle up to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of aircraft finance. Many airliner sales are via leases, with banks owning the aircraft and airlines holding long leases. Airbus Finance Corp will act as a middleman, helping to arrange the finance in whatever form the airline customer requires. It is intended that AFC should stand alone and eventually hold its own credit rating. Initially it will be led on a part-time basis by Mr Tony Rice, the treasurer of British Aerospace. Negotiations to open banking lines are expected to begin shortly, with the company becoming operational in the autumn. Creating the new subsidiary will allow Airbus greater flexibility in the financing packages it can offer customers. It will also cut down the financial commitments of the Airbus consortium members, enabling them to help guarantee the finance of more aircraft sales than hitherto. Because Airbus is not incorporated, each Airbus partner is jointly and severally liable for the financial risks run by the consortium. So, for example, if Dollars 100m of aircraft were leased directly from Airbus, each of the consortium members would be potentially liable for the Dollars 100m if the aircraft were returned. All four consortium members would thus have a contingent liability of Dollars 100m and would have to retain the financing capacity to meet that. Under the new finance company, the four Airbus partners will between them guarantee the financial risks of the subsidiary, which might typically amount to 20 per cent of finance provided. Each individual member would thus see its contingent financing needs fall from 100 per cent of the aircraft's value now to 5 per cent. Establishing AFC is also intended to help Airbus put its assessment of financing risks on a more scientific footing and allow the consortium to make more informed decisions about the risks of default when considering aircraft sales to airlines. The new structure is backed by all of the consortium members, but is based on the model developed by BAe to restructure its regional jet business. Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director who pioneered the development there, was closely involved in designing the new finance company. Currently about one-third of Airbus's aircraft are leased, with the rest being direct sales to airlines. However, many of the leased airliners are handled by external finance companies which have no recourse to Airbus.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEXAS;  </P> <P> JURY RULES AGAINST WOMAN IN PRIEST SUIT  </P> <P> A Houston jury refused to find the Roman Catholic Church negligent in a  $7-million suit filed by a woman who had had a two-year sexual relationship  with a priest.  </P> <P> Jurors deliberated just three hours before rejecting the claim of Debbie  McCorvey, 34, that the church was negligent in allowing Father Fernando Noe  Guzman to exploit her dependence on him as a counselor. McCorvey, a religion  teacher, claimed church officials were at fault for not making sure Guzman, 39,  received therapy after his alleged sexual involvement with a 13-year-old girl.  Church officials argued that McCorvey's relationship with Guzman was  consensual.  </P></p>

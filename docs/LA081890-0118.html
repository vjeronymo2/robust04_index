			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CAPITAL PLAN DENIAL ANGERS FARWEST CHIEF;  </P> <P> S&amp;LS: REGULATORS REJECTED THE AILING THRIFT'S PROPOSAL TO ADD ASSETS FROM  SUBSIDIARIES. THE TURNDOWN MAY PLACE IT ON THE VERGE OF INSOLVENCY.  </P> <P> The president of struggling FarWest Savings strongly objected Friday to federal  regulators' rejection of the thrift's capital plan, contending that the  regulators made a serious error in judgment.  </P> <P> The regulators' action could deprive the Newport Beach-based thrift of $60  million in capital and place it on the verge of insolvency.  </P> <P> FarWest President Charles Green said regulators erred in blocking the firm's  proposal to liquidate a subsidiary carrying its junk bonds and equity real  estate holdings and fold those assets into the institution.  </P> <P> The plan would allow the thrift to maintain its current capital base without  having to replace the $60 million. But regulators with the Office of Thrift  Supervision and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in San Francisco vetoed the  proposal. The regulators declined comment.  </P> <P> Industry sources said rejection of FarWest's plan -- filed with authorities  last December -- appears to be an effort by regulators to force a cash infusion  into the S&amp;L by FarWest's majority owners, the wealthy Belzberg brothers of  Canada.  </P> <P> A knowledgeable industry source said FarWest's plan, although submitted nearly  eight months ago, wasn't ruled on until after a July cutoff date became  effective for excluding certain subsidiary assets from a thrift's capital base.  </P> <P> The rejected plan, which FarWest is appealing to regulators in Washington,  promised to reduce the S&amp;L's assets to about $2.7 billion. It also called  for FarWest to sell off its huge portfolio of risky high-yield junk bonds and  bolster capital with a stock offering to shareholders of its parent, FarWest  Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> But a key ingredient in the plan called for FarWest to liquidate the subsidiary  holding its junk bonds and other assets, including direct real estate  investments. FarWest would then absorb those assets.  </P> <P> Last year's thrift bailout law prohibits S&amp;Ls from acquiring additional  junk bonds or direct real estate investments. It also requires institutions  already holding such assets to divest them by 1994. And, in a provision that  took effect last month, the bailout law also requires S&amp;Ls to set aside  reserves equal to 10% of a subsidiary's prohibited assets.  </P> <P> Because FarWest's subsidiary holds about $600 million worth of junk bonds and  other prohibited assets, the S&amp;L will be required to set up a $60-million  reserve if its appeal fails. And that would reduce its current capital level of  $37.7 million to negative $23 million, driving it into insolvency.  </P></p>

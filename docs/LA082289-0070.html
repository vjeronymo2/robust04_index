			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: IAAF COULD TAKE JOHNSON'S WORLD RECORD  </P> <P> The International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world  governing body, will discuss possible action that could strip Canada's Ben  Johnson of his world record in the 100-meter dash.  </P> <P> Johnson's mark of 9.83 seconds was set at the 1987 World Championships in Rome.  In 1988, at the Olympic Games in Seoul, he improved on the time by winning in  9.79.  </P> <P> At the Olympics, however, he tested positive for steroids, was stripped of his  gold medal and his world record time was disallowed. He since has testified  that he used steroids before the meet in Rome as well.  </P> <P> "We won't discuss the Johnson case specifically, but we will organize a plan to  fight doping in general," said Primo Nebiolo, president of the IAAF, pertaining  to the body's meeting in Barcelona, Spain, Sept. 5-6.  </P> <P> In a related development in Toronto, athletes, coaches and track officials all  share blame for Canada's humiliation over the Johnson scandal, said Rolf Lund,  chairman of the Ontario Track and Field Assn.  </P> <P> Speaking before a federal inquiry into drug use in amateur sports, Lund said:  "Any knowledgeable coach would have noticed the (physical) changes" in Johnson  and other top Canadian athletes, who testified at the inquiry that they took  banned substances for years.  </P></p>

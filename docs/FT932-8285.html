			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC seeks bigger set-aside A EUROPEAN Commission proposal to fix a 20 per cent rate for arable land permanently taken out of production must be approved by farm ministers by July 31, Commission officials said, Reuter reports from Brussels. Officials hope this can be done at the next farm council on May 24, allowing time to prepare for the implementation of the new rules. Governments and farmers, notably Danish, favour permanent set-aside, which is seen as simpler, easier to control, better for the environment and more acceptable to taxpayers. Ministers are expected to give guidelines rather than take quick decisions on a commission paper, approved yesterday, discussing the controversial set-aside scheme - a key element in last year's reforms to curb farm output. The commission paper was drafted in response to criticism from member states and farmer groups about the complexity of the scheme and desire to make it more beneficial to the environment. If farmers are allowed to combine permanent and rotational set-aside on the same farm the higher 20 per cent rate should apply, according to the commission paper. Farmers must set aside 15 per cent of arable land under a six-year rotational scheme adopted in last year's reforms.</p>

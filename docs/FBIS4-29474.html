			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has  basically confirmed the outline of its coalition blueprint which  the party has been working out in preparation for policy  consultations with the ruling coalition and other parties.  Among the main pillars of the blueprint are: 1) The coalition  should abide by agreements and memorandums signed at the time of  the inauguration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  administration; 2) regarding policies, as a rule, the coalition  should carry forward agreements reached at the time of the  inauguration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration,  which includes the revision and abolition of the consumption  tax; and 3) government affairs should be managed by a group of  representatives from each party, and final decisions should be  made via a meeting of party heads.    The party plans to finalize its blueprint after further  integrating party members' opinions, but the party is divided  over pending policy issues as well as which parties it plans to  join in a new coalition alliance. It also places the mass  resignation of the incumbent administration as a precondition to  its forming a new coalition. Therefore, there is no question  that rough sailing will be encountered regarding the SDPJ's  finalizing its coalition blueprint and subsequent policy  consultations with other parties.    In the blueprint, the SDPJ seeks to clarify what caused it  to  leave the coalition alliance as well as who is to be held  responsible. However, the party does not intend to demand the  resignation of those held responsible.</p>

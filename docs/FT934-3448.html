			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Pension review may affect 400,000: Study finds sales rules were not followed in four out of five cases Four out of five personal pensions sold to people transferring out of employers' schemes into private plans were taken out without agents seeking enough information to give proper advice, according to an independent study. Up to 400,000 people could be affected and several hundred million pounds in compensation in total may have to be paid by life insurers, banks and building societies. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, yesterday gave details of the SIB's pension transfer review announced last week. He spelt out how compensation would be handled and what measures would be taken to ensure that customers would not be sold unsuitable personal pensions in future. An advisory committee made up largely of chairmen of the relevant professional and trade associations, and chaired by former senior civil servant Sir Douglas Wass, will assist the SIB board. The pilot study, which points to widespread abuse in the sale of personal pensions, was commissioned from the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick. KPMG sought to assess how many people were at risk of disadvantage from having followed poor advice. The report is to be published before Christmas. It found that in 80 per cent of cases examined, sales agents had not properly complied with regulatory requirements for selling pensions in this way. If this reflects wider practice, some 400,000 cases could be re-opened with sales agents. Up to 500,000 individuals have transferred out of employers' schemes and into personal pensions. Many of these cases will have to be raised with the individual customers, to establish who might be worse off in retirement as a result of following poor advice. Mr Large acknowledged that people covered by the review who had already retired might be receiving less income than they were entitled to, but he emphasised that all those affected would be fully recompensed. 'Those who may have transferred their pension provision on the basis of wrong advice will not be harmed by waiting for reliable solutions to emerge,' he said. Ministers face particular embarrassment from the political emphasis that was placed on the benefit of taking out a personal pension in terms of flexibility. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, welcomed the latest move, but added: 'Should the further investigations now under way reveal that any clients have suffered financial loss as a result of bad advice, I have made it clear to SIB that the government expects effective remedies to be put in place promptly.' A steering group, made up of the heads of financial regulators and some professional bodies, will draw up remedies for the harm that has been done, and recommend measures to prevent future problems. One difficult area will be pensions sold on bad advice from independent financial advisers. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential, one of the largest pensions providers, said yesterday he was not responsible for any failure by independent advisers to give proper advice in selling a Prudential pension. The steering group will recommend new sales rules to the SIB board by the end of February. It will make recommendations on compensation by the end of June, and SIB will publish its intended course of action in July. Sales agents will be able to sell pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes under the existing regulations until new rules are set, but Mr Large warned that they must take extra care 'to give sound and full advice'.

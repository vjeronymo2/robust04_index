			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zaffar Mehmood Sheikh: "Nuclear Program Sold to </F> the United States"]    [Text] The government, after making excuses to the  opposition for one week, has decided to debate the nuclear  program in the National Assembly, and the opposition has been  satisfied. This is the fifth regular meeting of the present  session of the National Assembly after it was formed. It is the  first regular meeting being called at the request of the  opposition. According to the opposition, the purpose of the  session that began on 28 November was to open debate on nuclear  policy, but the government did not allow any discussion during  the first two days of the session. The opposition had staged a  walkout in protest. It was clear even on 28 November that the  government did not want to hold any debate before the internal  elections in December, and it succeeded in its goal. The  opposition objected to it strongly and caused a lot of  commotion. It walked out of the meetings held on 28 November and  1 December. The fact is that the opposition itself did not want  to hold the debate on the nuclear issue before the election, it  just wanted to gain some momentum which the law minister  provided very well. Interestingly, the only thing the PPP  [Pakistan People's Party] government did after it took office  was to let the nation know that the Taj Mahal of desires, the  dream of the atomic bomb or nuclear capability, had  disintegrated three years ago. There is no example of such an  insult to the desires of the people as was done by our rulers by  making deals with the United States over the nuclear program.  The governments of the PPP and the Muslim League have taken  turns in ruling the nation since 1995, and both are equally  guilty of selling the nuclear program to the United States. That  is why both the parties were scared that some "truths" might be  spilled during the debate in the assembly, and they suffered  losses. Still, the opposition or the Muslim League had to raise  the nuclear issue in the National Assembly because the PPP had  accused the Muslim League of the whole fiasco by saying that  "Nawaz Sharif sold the atomic bomb during his government." Now  the PPP also wants to get rid of the allegation that it was  alone in this crime. Anyhow, only time will tell what  discussions will take place and what facts will be brought to  light during the debate in the National Assembly. One thing is  clear, any more information than what has already been shared  will not come to light. Our government has sold the atomic bomb  to Senator Larry Pressler instead of selling it to Iran. There  are two important aspects of this deal. First, U.S. aid was  bought in exchange for the sale of the atomic bomb. Second, a  second hushed agreement was to help us get rid of the Kashmir  problem and to help rid our leaders of the nuclear problem. The  fact is that every Pakistani government was not in a position to  open up to the people over such important issues as the nuclear  program. Every government and every party has made some deal  with the United States over these issues, especially the nuclear  issue. That is why the former and the present ruling parties,  the Muslim League and the PPP, do not want to talk about it at  least until the internal elections. It should also be mentioned  is that it is good idea to discuss sensitive and important  issues in the Parliament. We should go a bit further and discuss  topics of national importance at the national level so that all  opinions are shared with the people and the people can feel  involved in formation of these policies. Unfortunately, however,  the atmosphere in the present Parliament is disgraceful.    It would be useless to expect any concrete results from this  exercise since this debate is taking place in an atmosphere of  doubt about our rulers. It would not be inappropriate to say  that those who will be talking loudly about it do not even have  the right information about this issue. Most of them did not  even know what the former chief of the Navy, Aslam Baig, got in  return for selling the nuclear program to the United States. No  one will be able to tell us if we have to sell the "atom" why  was it sold to the United States, and not to Iran. If nothing  else, some dignity could have been salvaged from this insult.  Anyhow, the situation has deteriorated so much and our social  system has fallen so low that no one is disturbed by this issue.  Whatever the United States wants is happening now, had happened,  and we are afraid will happen in the future.    Our rulers and leaders have dragged the people in the  streets  into every problem and every issue so many times that the people  have no faith in them nor do they have any energy left to be  insulted. Now the people of this nation will just watch this  drama of insults and embarrassments from afar. The rulers  sitting in the capital have begun to understand it because they  have seen the actual demonstration of this attitude during the  long marches. They are trying to take advantage of this attitude  now. By looking at the expression on the faces of the rulers,  sitting in the capital and ruling the 120 million people, and  their "bosses," we can tell without any mistake that they are  preparing the people for something else by telling them about  the death of the nuclear program at this time. What is that? We  cannot even imagine it. However, we will have an idea during the  next few days. The indications do not look good.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Tradition of give and take is swept away  -A virtual revolution in Canadian politics ONLY a full-blooded revolution could have matched the upheaval in Canadian politics caused by the general election on Monday. Canada's diverse cultures and regions have until now accommodated themselves within two or three national parties. The Liberals, the Progressive Conservatives and most recently the New Democrats have deep differences on economic and social policies. But they have shared a commitment to a united and stable country where each linguistic group and region gives a little and gets a little. That tradition will be severely tested in the new parliament. Only the Liberals, who swept to victory on Monday with 178 out of 295 seats, remain as a force dedicated to keeping the country in one piece through compromise rather than confrontation. The Conservatives and the New Democrats suffered such devastating setbacks that they have lost their status as official parties, losing some of their parliamentary privileges. Despite winning about one-seventh of the popular vote, the Tories' presence in the House of Commons has been slashed from 157 to two. The left-leaning NDP's representation has shrunk from 44 to 8. In their place will be two unashamedly regional groups: the Bloc Quebecois, which will form the official opposition, and the Reform party, the right-of-centre group based in western Canada. The Bloc's leader, Mr Lucien Bouchard, has given notice that he will use its substantial representation in Ottawa to further the cause of Quebec independence. In particular, the Bloc is likely to try to build support for its provincial wing, the Parti Quebecois, which faces a provincial election towards the end of next year. The separatists have promised to hold an independence referendum within a year, if the PQ comes to office. The 53 Reform party MPs, almost all of them from Alberta and British Columbia, could be among Mr Bouchard's most effective weapons in his struggle for independence. While Reform leader Mr Preston Manning insists that he wants to keep Canada in one piece, his conditions for 'renewing the federation' - in particular his insistence that Quebec be given exactly the same constitutional treatment as the other nine provinces - are totally unacceptable to Quebec. Reform also opposes official bilingualism. Whatever the party's official position, many of its supporters would shed no tears if Quebec went its own way. Containing these centrifugal forces will be one of the biggest challenges facing the new Liberal government under Mr Jean Chretien. However, few Canadian politicians are better suited to the task. Mr Chretien, aged 59, is a Quebecois but believes passionately in a united Canada. He is a veteran of almost every constitutional debate of the past three decades. Having entered parliament for the first time 30 years ago, Mr Chretien held almost every major portfolio under former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Mr Chretien has been widely reviled in Quebec in recent years for, among other things, opposing the 1987 Meech Lake accord, which would have given the province significant extra powers. But his ability to make a comeback was demonstrated by his unexpectedly large victory on Monday in his home constituency of Saint-Maurice in the eastern part of the province. There were other crumbs of consolation for federalists from the election result. One was that the Liberal landslide stretched across the country. The Liberals won seats in all 10 provinces, and Mr Chretien's cabinet is likely to reflect that diversity. Furthermore, one of the two Conservatives to retain their seats was Mr Jean Charest, the youthful deputy prime minister who was beaten by Ms Kim Campbell last June for the party leadership. Mr Charest is a bilingual and personable Quebecois who demonstrated during the leadership campaign that he also has a substantial following outside the province. It would be surprising if he did not play a leading role in the coming constitutional wrangle. Reform and BQ will be sending a large contingent of neophyte MPs to Ottawa. Reform's unity, in particular, will be tested by the contrast between Mr Manning's autocratic style, and the party platform's promise of looser parliamentary discipline and greater accountability by MPs to their constituents. However, the two parties have yet to prove that they are more than short-lived wonders likely to end up as fractious protest groups. Both owe much of their support to voters' deep-rooted desire for change after the tough years of Tory rule, rather than loyalty to their respective platforms. Their support may drift away once the economy picks up.</p>

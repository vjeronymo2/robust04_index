			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Netherlands acquisition strengthens IWP's core IWP, the Dublin-based industrial holding group, has announced the acquisition of Levendaal Beheer, a Dutch toiletries and household products manufacturer from PLA, a Netherlands Antilles company, in a cash and shares offer worth IPounds 51.2m (Pounds 48.8m). The deal is expected to boost turnover to about IPounds 150m and pre-tax profits by more than 50 per cent to about IPounds 20m in a full year. Mr Joe Moran, the executive chairman, said the acquisition 'is a very important one in terms of strengthening our customer base, product portfolio, increasing market share, and developing the group's strategy'. IWP has refocused its activities into two core areas: chemically-based household products and printed cartons and self-adhesive labels. Its main markets are the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. The acquisition will make the Netherlands an increasingly important profit centre for the group, which has three of its 18 companies there. The consideration will be satisfied by IPounds 31.8m in cash and IPounds 4.57m from the sale of a loan note. The vendor will also receive a dividend from Levendaal of IPounds 1.52mand IPounds 13.2m for its holding of preference shares in Levendaal, which are being sold to a syndicate of Dutch institutions. Mr Moran said that IWP intended to buy these shares at a rate of 25 per cent per year. There is also to be a placing of 1.35m ordinary shares in IWP at 315p raising IPounds 4.24m, to help finance the deal. In 1992 Levendaal reported turnover of Fl 111m (Pounds 40m) for pre-tax profits of Fl 15.3m. IWP said that the results for the first seven months of 1993, showing pre-tax profits of Fl 8.7m 'are ahead of the budget set by the management of Levendaal'. On completion of the acquisition, which has to be approved by an extraordinary meeting of IWP to be held on October 28, Mr Moran will join the board of Levendaal.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PSST -- YOU CAN READ THIS, BUT DON'T PASS IT ON;  </P> <P> COPYRIGHT: NEWSLETTERS ARE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH SUBSCRIBERS' MAKING FREE  PHOTOCOPIES OF THEIR PRICEY PERIODICALS. ONE CORPORATION JUST AGREED TO PAY A  $100,000 SETTLEMENT.  </P> <P> Don't even think about making a copy of this story to pass around the office.  </P> <P> In what may be the largest settlement of its kind, an unidentified major  corporation has agreed to pay more than $100,000 to an Arlington, Va.,  newsletter publisher for violating the publisher's copyright by circulating  photocopies of a newsletter to its employees.  </P> <P> The publisher, Washington Business Information Inc., declined Thursday to name  the offending company. Washington Business Information publishes 11  newsletters, including Product Safety Letter, Hazardous Materials  Transportation, Plastic Waste Strategies and Devices and Diagnostics Letter.  </P> <P> Washington Business Information also would not say which of its newsletters was  involved nor discuss the size of the settlement, citing a confidentiality  agreement included in the settlement. But the publisher said it had received a  sum in six figures, and others in the industry said they couldn't remember a  settlement that large in other, similar cases.  </P> <P> Photocopying is one of the banes of the newsletter industry. Subscribers  frequently attempt to evade subscription prices that can run hundreds of  dollars a year by buying a single subscription to a newsletter and making  dozens of photocopies.  </P> <P> "It's not unusual for major industrial companies or major law firms to take one  copy of a newsletter and make 30 or 40 copies of it and pass it around," said  David Swit, president of Washington Business Information.  </P> <P> "It's self-evident that a newsletter consisting of relatively few pages is  particularly vulnerable to unauthorized copying," said Arthur Scheiner, a  Washington attorney who has handled copyright-violation cases for some members  of the Washington area's huge community of newsletter publishers. "I'd guess  that it's rather frequently done."  </P> <P> Some publishers estimate that unauthorized copying cuts potential revenue by as  much as one-third. Most newsletters include warnings against copying, and some  publishers even offer rewards for information about illegal copying. Federal  law allows statutory damages of up to $100,000 and legal fees for unauthorized  copying, plus possible criminal liability.  </P> <P> "Copying of newsletters is possibly the largest problem in the newsletter  industry," said Albert Warren, founder and head of Warren Publishing, a  Washington newsletter publisher whose newsletters include Communications Daily.  Warren, who founded the Independent Newsletter Assn., a trade group, in part to  combat newsletter copying, is awaiting the outcome of a 5-year-old, $3-million  suit against the U.S. Telephone Assn. for alleged unauthorized copying of  Communications Daily.  </P> <P> As is common in many such cases, Washington Business Information was tipped off  to the violation by an employee of the company that was doing the copying. Swit  said the company was making "umpteen" copies rather than paying the  subscription price, which is $500 for the first copy and $250 for each  additional copy. Swit said his company negotiated a settlement without filing a  lawsuit.  </P> <P> Industry officials say most violations of copyright laws are settled, usually  with companies making cash payments and agreeing to buy additional  subscriptions. Warren said his company has entered into several hundred  thousand dollars worth of settlements over the years.  </P> <P> "It's astonishing what organizations will cheat that way," Swit said.  "Strangely, some of the most egregious violators of our copyright are lawyers."  </P></p>

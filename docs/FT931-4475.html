			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK wants G7 to aid Moscow BRITAIN yesterday stepped up the pressure for an early meeting of officials from the seven leading industrialised countries to see what help the Group of Seven nations can give Russia in its efforts to implement economic reform. After his meeting with President Mitterrand of France on Tuesday, President Clinton said G7 should 'mobilise' to offer help in Russia's economic reforms. British officials are in contact with their counterparts to try to arrange a meeting of senior officials or of ministers well before the G7 summit in Tokyo in July. They believe that a meeting at that level is preferable to one involving heads of government, where the outcome might be presentational rather than real. The fresh British efforts follow Prime Minister John Major's meeting with President Clinton last month, at which the two leaders agreed that G7 should become more actively engaged. British officials said that the worry about Russia, and in particular about the position of President Yeltsin, was reflected in the fact that it featured so high up the agenda when time for discussion was so limited.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Coming to the defence of gilts for pension funds Sir, John Plender ('Time to tilt the balance', February 9) is right to highlight the debate between equities and gilts for pension funds. Many pension funds are significantly more mature than 20 years ago and need a higher gilt exposure than is suggested by the typical fund. Furthermore, Mr Plender is right that fund managers as a group will change the asset distribution very slowly, paying more attention to what their competitors are doing rather than a fundamental assessment of the comparative values of different asset classes: a strong case for funds looking at their strategies on an individual basis. However, the case that Mr Plender seeks to build for gilts over equities seems to be a classic case of the smear campaign: if we throw enough mud at equities, some will stick. There are a number of points I would like to challenge. The article claims that falling dividend yields are bad news for pension funds as actuaries value equities on the basis of their income stream rather than their market value. This is indeed the generally accepted valuation procedure, but it is not affected by the dividend yield per se: the level of dividend is obtained by multiplying market value by dividend yield and a decline in one caused by an increase in the other is irrelevant. Real dividend growth may well have been negative from 1962 to 1982 but in this period equities returned 12.7 per cent a year against a cost of living increase of 9.5 per cent and a return on fixed interest stocks of 7.5 per cent a year. In reviewing the likely returns from equities, the article quotes 3 per cent a year as the 'century in/century out real return on risk-free bonds'. Where does this come from? There has been no 30-year period since 1945 when UK fixed interest stocks provided a real return of 3 per cent a year. Furthermore, there has been no 10-year period since 1945 when fixed interest has out-performed equities - not even the 10 years ending December 31 1974. There may well be a case for pension funds favouring gilts over equities, but it needs to be made on a clearer basis than a selective historical analysis and a misrepresentation of actuarial techniques.

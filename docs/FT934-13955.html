			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Profit-takers erode early gains in European sector EUROPEAN bond markets got off to a strong start this week, buoyed by hopes for near-term interest rate easing. However, most of the early gains were eroded by late profit-taking, leaving most markets to end little changed on the day. European yield curves have steepened in recent days as investors have begun to shift into shorter maturities in anticipation of imminent rate cuts. All eyes are on Germany, where the Bundesbank's next round of securities repurchase agreements is hoped to bring a small easing. The Bundesbank is expected to set two-week variable-rate repos today, and money market traders are anticipating a small drop in the minimum rate from last week's 6.70 per cent. While most dealers do not expect the Bundesbank's central bank council to lower key interest rates at its meeting on Thursday, there was some talk that lower-than-expected M3 money supply growth and the strength of the D-Mark could induce the central bank to cut its key 6.25 per cent discount rate sooner than expected. The December bund future hit a new high of 100.39 and closed at 100.23, up 0.07 point on the day. LONGER-dated UK gilts were dragged down by weakness in other markets, but the shorter maturities were underpinned by hopes for a near-term cut in the UK base rate to stimulate the economy. Investor activity was limited as most participants looked to today's gilt auction announcement. Most traders expect the Bank of England to announce Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.25bn five-year bonds as the new intermediate benchmark for 1994. FRENCH bond futures hit a new high in the morning but slipped after the Bank of France again left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. The December contract peaked at 123.74 but slipped back to 123.48, down 0.06 point on the day. ECU bonds had a strong day, with the Ecu contract on Matif gaining 0.22 point to 119.80. Ecu bonds have rallied sharply since last week's approval of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union by Germany's constitutional court. EUROPE's high-yielders put on another strong performance. The Spanish Bonos future in Madrid rose 0.30 point to 102.80, while the Italian BTP contract on Liffe fell 0.35 off its peak to end at 118.55, up 0.11 point. US Treasury prices eased sharply at the long end of the market as investors took some of the profits earned in last week's inflation-inspired rally. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 105 9/16 , yielding 5.848 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.824 per cent. Trading was quiet from the start as investors and traders set about consolidating the gains earned last Thursday and Friday after government figures were released showing inflation remained subdued in September. That consolidation involved some profit-taking, which contributed to the early declines at the long end. Some analysts said that a morning newspaper article claiming that several large well-known fund managers had gone short of bonds in anticipation of a market correction was also behind the losses, while others pointed to the decision by banking group Morgan Guaranty to cut its prime lending rate from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent as another contributing factor.</p>

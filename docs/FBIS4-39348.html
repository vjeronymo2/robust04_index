			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Russian State Duma the New Regional Policy  group is going to vote for the federal budget in the second  reading on condition the spending on defence is increased from  37 to 55 trillion rubles and subsidies to territories from 18 to  23 trillion. This was reported to Interfax on Monday by the head  of the group Vladimir Medvedev. The group of 64 deputies is the  second biggest in the lower house of parliament following  Russia's Choice. Most members of New Regional Policy supported  the federal budget during the first reading on May 11.    Yabloko group does not support the draft budget submitted by  the government on the whole because it does not reflect an  economic policy the country would need today. This was told to  Interfax by the head of the group Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. He said  his group voted against the budget in the first reading and it  would be strange, he said, if it changed its approach by the  second reading. Still Yavlinskiy said his group would support  certain amendments to the budget.    The Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 will support the  draft budget, if it does not exceed the deficit named during the  first reading. The leader of the group, former finance minister  Boris Fedorov told Interfax that his group would agree to  increase spending on defence research by no more than 3.5  trillion rubles as the budget committee suggests.    Russia's Choice did not meet on Tuesday and intends to  define  its attitude to the draft on Wednesday before the Duma session.    The heads and experts of the Communist, Agrarian and  Democratic factions intend to agree on a common stand during the  budget debate planned for Wednesday. This was reported to  Interfax by Yevgeniy Krasnitskiy (Communist). He said his group  will also insist on increasing the revenue by improving  tax-collecting as well as spending. It plans to support the  proposal of parliamentary committees for defence to increase  defence spending from 37 to 55 trillion. He denied claims that  Communists would vote against the budget. "The budget proposed  by the government is rotten, of course, but even a bad budget is  better than none", he said.    The leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and a considerable part of his faction will  evidently be absent from the Wednesday session because on  Tuesday they began a tour of Krasnodar region. However, on  Monday Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that economists from the  faction would take part in the discussion of amendments to the  budget. The lower house is go [as received] discuss some 300  amendments.    Yevgeniy Nikonov of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord  expressed the opinion that his faction would support the idea of  increasing budget spending.</p>

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has questioned  Obayashi Corp. officials, including a 66-year-old vice  president, and Sendai City officials on a voluntary basis, the  sources said.    Investigators believe the Osaka-based company gave 10  million  yen to Ishii, then Sendai mayor, in October 1992 after asking  him for favorable consideration in its bid for a 8.2 billion yen  project to construct a waste incineration plant, they said.    Ishii allegedly proposed to city officials that they  separate  the bids for the building and other parts of the plant in  response to the firm's request.    Obayashi Corp., Japan's fourth-largest construction firm,  wanted to contract only the building, but the bid was held in  June last year as one lump package in spite of Ishii's efforts,  they said.    The concern subcontracted part of the project from  Osaka-based plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp., which won the  contract for the whole project to build the Kuzuoka Waste  Incineration Plant, scheduled to be completed by September 1995.    No official of Obayashi Corp. has been arrested or charged  in  the current wave of bribery scandals involving mayors and  governors, in which officials of seven major construction firms  and a paper manufacturer have been indicted since last summer.    Ishii, 68, is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130  million yen in bribes from six general contractors including  Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu  Construction Co.</p>

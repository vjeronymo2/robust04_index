			<p>BFN     [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 16 KYODO -- A Myanmar  [Burma] military government leader made no reference to the fate  of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under  house arrest, during his meeting with a Japanese business  mission Thursday [16 June], mission members said.    Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, secretary of the ruling State Law and  Order Restoration Council, defended the house arrest of the  Nobel Peace Prize winner and brushed aside the concept of human  rights. "What are human rights as referred to by western people  are targeted to limited people," Nyunt was quoted as telling the  business delegation organized by the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren). July 5 will mark the fifth  anniversary of Suu Kyi's house arrest. Diplomatic sources in  Yangon said the military government plans to continue the arrest  beyond that date.    Nyunt told the Keidanren mission that his government will  make efforts to promote economic development and achieve  political stability before moving toward a nation under civilian  rule, mission members said.    Kazuo Haruna, chairman of Marubeni Corp. and head of the  45-member team, told Nyunt it is regrettable that Japan's  Official Development Assistance (ODA) has been suspended since  1988 and expressed hope that it will be resumed as soon as  possible, they said.    The mission, the largest Japanese delegation ever to visit  the country, is holding talks with Myanmar leaders on projects  including Myanmar's oil industry. The delegation is due to  depart the country Saturday.</p>

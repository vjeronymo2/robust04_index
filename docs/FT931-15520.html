			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Austrian right in row over foreigners MR Jorg Haider, leader of Austria's right-wing Freedom party (FPO), has launched a controversial anti-foreigner initiative with a harsh attack on the country's political establishment. In a weekend speech in Graz, capital of the province of Styria, Mr Haider attacked the broad coalition of politicians, church leaders, journalists, intellectuals and artists formed in recent weeks to thwart his drive for an anti-foreigner petition. Austrian voters will be able to sign the petition, which calls for stricter immigration laws and other measures directed against foreigners, in the week beginning January 23. Mr Haider is counting on as many as 1m signatures, about a fifth of Austria's electorate. But all the other main political parties, as well as the Austrian president, Mr Thomas Klestil, have appealed to the voters to ignore the petition, which they say is designed to incite hatred against immigrants. A broad anti-Haider platform, 'SOS Neighbour', has attracted wide support and is planning a demonstration against xenophobia to coincide with the start of Mr Haider's petition-signing week. The strongest opposition to the right-wing initiative has come from the Roman Catholic church. On Sunday, leaflets calling for tolerance and ethnic harmony were distributed to church-goers across Austria. The petition's success is seen as a test of Mr Haider's appeal. Less than 500,000 signatures would be a big setback.</p>

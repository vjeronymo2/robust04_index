			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (17): A short cut to domination - Profile: Swiss Bank Corporation SWISS BANK CORPORATION was not one of the first banks to enter the derivatives market. But in only a few years it has become one of the dominant forces in the market, with a derivatives capacity which covers the three main product lines of interest rates, foreign exchange and equities, and encompasses over-the-counter and exchange-traded business. In a poll taken by Risk magazine in September, SBC was named as one of three market leaders in the derivatives industry (the other two are Bankers Trust and J P Morgan). SBC took a short cut by buying a ready-made derivatives business, rather than trying to grow its own from a relatively small, in-house capability, or poaching teams from other firms. O'Connor Securities, a specialist options trading firm based in Chicago, possessed not only expertise but also the advanced technology required for such an operation. The move was based on a strong strategic view taken at board level. In 1989, SBC set down a long-term strategy, dubbed 'Vision 2000', which took the view that 'the capital markets of the 90s would be driven by derivatives and risk management products,' according to Mr Marcel Ospel, a member of the SBC executive board. 'This led SBC to explore with O'Connor, already a leading player in US derivative markets, the form a joint venture might take to exploit the coming boom in derivatives business worldwide.' A joint venture formed by SBC and O'Connor in 1990 was followed by a full merger of the two businesses in 1992, when SBC bought O'Connor. At the time of the joint venture, O'Connor was looking at three-or four potential partners and SBC had been considering buying a US investment bank to get into the US market, particularly on the corporate finance side. But these two rather unlikely bedfellows - a US proprietary trading firm and a Swiss bank - decided to brave the potential culture clash. O'Connor was a 'blue jeans and T-shirts firm with a flat level structure', said Ms Lesley Grant, a former O'Connor hand who now runs SBC's foreign exchange risk management advisory service worldwide. It had a very special niche - statistical arbitrage - which involves investing heavily in systems to have better models and data which can identify anomalies in the market. In particular, the ability to forecast volatility accurately - a key element of pricing in the options market - was a strength of O'Connor. O'Connor had been very successful first in trading options on the Chicago exchanges and then in the OTC market, but as the market became larger and more competitive its lack of a strong capital base became a restraint. A joint venture with First Chicago in foreign exchange options was dissolved due to lack of commitment on both sides. At the same time, SBC had started a critical examination of its whole capital markets business in the wake of the 1987 crash - and had found a number of weak points. One of these was options. 'There was a clear gap that had to be filled,' said Mr Simon Bunce, head of interest rate derivative sales. While there were tales of ructions during the joint venture period, the seams between SBC and O'Connor are no longer obvious. Staff say the success of the merger is due to the fact that it was driven by need on both sides, and there was little overlap. Although O'Connor staff were afraid of losing their special culture, the handling of the merger by senior staff on both sides helped. 'Of the 21 partners at O'Connor, all became managing directors of SBC: no-one took early retirement and went to partner heaven,' said Ms Grant. SBC took the approach of integrating its newfound derivatives capacity with other areas of business - probably more fraught with difficulty in the short term, but more effective in the long term. To bring this about, there has been a huge investment in education 'We pride ourselves on the quality of our derivatives education package which is run from Chicago and networked throughout the world,' said Mr Bunce. Unlike many other banks, SBC staff are sent on two- to three-week courses, their mobile phones confiscated to sever contact. The integration of cash and derivatives markets is most advanced in SBC's foreign exchange business, probably its strongest platform. SBC has trained its 170-strong foreign exchange sales team to price and structure their own options so that they are now an integrated cash and derivatives sales team. Other elements of the O'Connor legacy can be found in use of specialist analystic skills in areas such as risk management. Each book (foreign exchange, interest rate and equities) has a global risk manager, who measures the bank's exposure, and in each case that function is provided by a former O'Connor partner. There are still some areas of weakness. Although O'Connor brought equity derivatives expertise to the table, SBC's cash market business in equities has still not recovered from its disastrous 'big bang' takeover of UK stockbroker Savory, Milln. However, the bank now has a three-quarters formed traditional research and sales function with an industry thrust, in line with present trends. 'The O'Connor franchise in equity derivatives was already very strong,' said Mr Steve Smith, head of equity derivative sales, and has allowed SBC to develop innovative retail products, such as guaranteed return instruments, high-yield unit trusts and warrant issues. One example is SBC's innovative bond issues with 'knock-out' warrants for Benetton and Roche. SBC also produced an options package to protect Hongkong Land against a rise in the share price of Trafalgar House, when it took a 20 per cent stake in the UK property company last year. SBC's other main weakness is geographical. Unlike the US firms which are its principal competitors, it cannot claim to have a truly global reach. Its efforts to develop a strong base in the US are still at an early stage, and are hampered by its inability to merge operations because of the US Glass-Steagall law, which separates banking and securities business. One of the stated aims of Vision 2000 was to be among the world's 10 most profitable banks. Profitable, for banks, increasingly means return on equity: SBC's return on equity is around 10 per cent, rather than the 20 per cent returns shown by many US investment banks, which do not have the overheads of a clearing bank business. However, the capital markets and treasury division of SBC already makes a return on equity of more than 20 per cent. Its newfound derivatives strength has given the bank greater leverage across all its business areas. The last few years seem to have shown that the SBC planners got it right: derivatives have become the key strategic market in the 1990s and SBC is well positioned to take advantage of the growth of the market. 'You can develop so much when you have a machine that works,' said Mr Bunce.</p>

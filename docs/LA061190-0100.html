			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL;  </P> <P> SCHWABE HOPES HIS NEW OUTLOOK BRINGS ONE-WAY TICKET TO MAJORS  </P> <P> Mike Schwabe has a new attitude about his baseball career this season. Schwabe,  pitching for Detroit's triple-A team in Toledo, used to spend his time watching  the Tigers and worrying about his career.  </P> <P> But Schwabe, a 25-year-old right-hander, has a new outlook thanks to an  off-season marriage, a child, and almost two months in the major leagues last  summer.  </P> <P> "I used to look at baseball as playing, then going out afterwards and having  fun," he said. "Now I think of it more as a career than a job. I used to always  worry and watch what was happening to the Tigers. Now I realize I just have to  do my job and put up some numbers so at least I can get a chance in September  if nothing else."  </P> <P> Schwabe's biggest boost has been his versatility on the mound. He has been used  as a starter as well as a middle and closing reliever. He's maintained all  three roles since he pitched at Tustin High School in 1983. He pitched at  Rancho Santiago in 1985 and 1986 then went to Arizona State for a year before  being drafted by the Tigers and signing with the club.  </P> <P> "It's nothing new to me," Schwabe said of his roles. "Seems like I've always  done it."  </P> <P> Schwabe, 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, throws sidearm with a sinking fastball, a  slider and a forkball.  </P> <P> He has a 4-1 record with 3.04 earned-run average in 22 games this season. He  has made two starts, has two saves, and struck out 34 and walked 11 for  last-place Toledo.  </P> <P> He has come back from an arm injury he suffered during spring training that  kept him out a week. But Schwabe has completed his rehabilitation and is ready  to go.  </P> <P> "At first I didn't tell anyone I was hurt," Schwabe said. "Then it really  started to bother me. They asked me to pitch the other night and I figured I'd  fire it up and see how I feel. I had pretty good stuff but hurt the next  morning. Now I need about one more day and I'll be ready to go."  </P> <P> Last May, Schwabe was pitching for London, Ontario, the Tigers' double-A team,  when he was called up to Detroit.  </P> <P> His major league memories include playing in the first baseball game at the  Toronto SkyDome and leaping up against the famed 37-foot left-field fence known  as the "Green Monster" in Boston's Fenway Park.  </P> <P> He also remembers giving up home runs to Dave Parker, Chili Davis and Junior  Felix and spending about $2,000 to upgrade his wardrobe to fit in with the  Tigers' rules.  </P> <P> He had four starts in 13 games, finishing 2-4 with a 6.04 ERA.  </P> <P> But now he's in Toledo, trying to get the attention of the Tigers again.  </P> <P> "I'm not one of those big-prospect players," Schwabe said. "I don't throw hard  enough. We're all just waiting here but it's really not a bad place. Being a  Mud Hen in Toledo is almost like being a celebrity."  </P> <P> Trivia: Last week The Times reported that Marc Newfield of Marina High School  was the third Orange County high school player to be taken in the first round  since the draft started in 1965. Newfield was taken as the sixth pick overall  by the Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> Loara basketball Coach Jerry Halpin called and pointed out that The Times  missed one. Well, the fact is, we missed several. What other Orange County  players were drafted in the first round out of high school?  </P> <P> Still around: Back in 1986, Rancho Santiago College came within a game of  winning the state community college baseball title. These days, three other  members of the team besides Schwabe are still in the minors.  </P> <P> Chris Shiflett was another right-handed starter for Rancho Santiago. He pitched  for Tulsa, the Rangers' Class AA team.  </P> <P> Ruben Gonzalez, the Dons' first baseman in 1986, has made it out of Class-A  ball after three seasons. Gonzalez is playing for Williamsport, the Mariners'  Class-AA team in the Eastern League. Gonzalez won the triple crown last season  for San Bernardino in the California League.  </P> <P> Steve Scarsone, second baseman for the Dons in 1986, is playing shortstop for  the Phillies' Class-A team in Clearwater, Fla.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Halpin called about Steve Buechele of the Texas Rangers, the  former Servite High School standout, who was taken in the first round in 1979  by the Chicago White Sox.  </P> <P> Others on the list include Kennedy High School's Alan Bannister (Angels, 1969),  La Quinta's Brian Vernoy (Cubs, 1972), Servite's Dwayne Peltier (Pirates,  1972), and Santa Ana Valley's Garry Templeton (Cardinals, 1974), Sonora's Brian  Greer (Padres, 1977), and Ocean View's David Holdridge (Angels, 1987).  </P></p>

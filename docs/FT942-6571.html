			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Overgrazing damages heather moorland Overgrazing is damaging heather moorland across most of the uplands of England, says English Nature, the government's statutory adviser on nature conservation. Large amounts of heather moorland have been lost since the 1940s because of sheep grazing, a survey by scientists at English Nature has found. In Cumbria, about 36 per cent of upland heather had disappeared by the late 1980s. The same percentage of heather moorland was lost in the Northern Peak District between 1913 and 1979, most of it since the 1940s. While birds and rare plants are also affected, heather is a good test because it grows in a noticeably different way when overgrazed. The young heather plant spreads outwards, like a carpet, instead of growing upwards. If overgrazing persists in upland areas the whole heather coverage shrinks up the slopes of the hills. In more undulating country, it thins out and becomes more sparse. Ms Jayne Manley, agricultural ecologist with English Nature, said: 'With overgrazing, you move from a mix of grass, dwarf shrub and sedge to just grass and sedge. It's pretty boring to look at and doesn't provide many nutrients, so getting the mix right is good for us as well as the farmers.' The heaviest concentrations of grazing animals - deer, rabbits and wild ponies, as well as sheep and cattle - occur in Cumbria, the Pennines and south-west England.</p>

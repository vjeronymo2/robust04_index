			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Microsoft in interactive TV software project Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to establish itself as the leading software supplier for interactive broadband networks that will provide interactive television and home PC services, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The company yesterday announced an 'end-to-end software solution' for interactive TV, including distributed operating system software for connecting television set-top boxes and personal computers with a wide variety of services, plus media server software for delivering video on demand and a set of interactive system applications. The Microsoft software is to be tested in an interactive TV trial being staged next year in Seattle, Washington, by Tele-Communications, the largest US cable-TV operator. Microsoft announced agreements with other network operators, including Deutsche Telekom, Telstra of Australia and US West Communications, a regional US telephone company, which will also test the Microsoft technology.

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Tokyo share prices rally but spending tumbles TOKYO share prices rallied strongly as investor sentiment grew more positive towards government efforts to support the nation's beleaguered financial industry. The Nikkei average rose by 617.02 yesterday to close above the 15,000 level at 15,267.76. The upward momentum continued early today, with the Nikkei up another 350 points in late morning trade. The rally came despite fresh evidence that consumer spending is falling rapidly, raising serious questions about how soon the economy can recover its path of growth and help to restore corporate profits. Investors were encouraged by a statement from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, supporting the idea, currently under discussion, of banks forming a joint corporation to purchase land currently held as collateral for non-performing loans. The land would then be made available for sale to local and central government authorities, who would be expected to purchase it with funds provided in a supplementary budget being drawn up by the government. Reports yesterday suggested that the package would be ready for presentation at the end of the month. Although Mr Mieno said the central bank was not considering financial backing for the plan, investors interpreted his statement as evidence that the authorities were taking the financial markets' difficulties seriously and working in tandem to provide support. The Finance Ministry was also reported to be considering providing banks with tax incentives to take part in the rescue of heavily indebted non-bank financial institutions by, for example, lending money at below market rates. An official from the National Tax Administration Agency said the agency and the ministry were discussing 'whether to adopt a flexible approach to permit banks to set aside special loan loss reserves (that would not be taxed).' 'The authorities finally seem to be serious about providing a safety net for the banks,' said Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at SG Warburg Securities. 'If the authorities provide tax incentives for banks, it will help them speed up bad loan write-offs and undertake more positive support plans for ailing borrowers,' said Mr Nozomu Kunishige of Kleinwort Benson International. In April, the Ministry of Finance said loans by Japan's top 21 banks in arrears by six months or more in 1991-92 were worth between seven trillion (thousand billion) and eight trillion yen. Special loan loss reserves set aside by Japan's 11 big banks surged to Y835.9bn (Pounds 3.4bn) at the end of March, up from Y492.3bn a year earlier. Bad loans have been increasing as a result of the economic slowdown and stagnant property markets, analysts said. In spite of yesterday's big rise in the market, however, investors remained cautious. The rally was caused when investors who were betting on a decline in the market by selling short covered their positions by buying shares. There is still no rush of new money into the market and the economic news continues to be bleak. Average household spending in June declined by 3.2 per cent in real terms compared to June last year, according to a survey by the Management and Co-ordination Agency. Spending by wage-earning households declined by 3.4 per cent. For the second quarter of the year, average spending was off by 0.6 per cent. After adjustment for the increased number of households, Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, estimated that consumer spending would contribute nothing to second quarter economic growth. 'It is difficult to see how there will not be a significant negative GNP figure for the second quarter,' he said. GNP figures, which will influence the size of any government supplemental spending package, will be released next month. The unexpected drop in consumer spending will force the government to take strong measures to get the economy moving again. World stocks, Page 29</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- The bilingual names of  towns and villages, where at least one-fifth of residents are  ethnic Hungarians, could be introduced by an Interior Ministry  regulation, chairman of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement  Miklos Duray said today. Speaking at a press conference, he was  commenting on the rejection of the place name bill by the Slovak  Parliament on June 3.    Egyutteles deputies pointed to the statement made by Premier  Jozef Moravcik on Monday [6 June] that tomorrow coalition talks  would decide on the further fate of the "place name" bill. They  said that it is possible that a new deputies' bill could be  presented and discussed by parliament in June or July.    With the law rejected, one of Slovakia's commitments to the  Council of Europe still remains unfulfilled. Although the  government coalition, backed by ethnic Hungarian parties, has a  clear majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for the  bill, while 61 were against and six abstained. A single vote  was missing for the bill to be rejected. [as received] Two  Egyutteles deputies abstained from the vote, and one even voted  against.    Miklos Feher, one of the above three Hungarian deputies,  insisted that on the very day of the vote representatives of  ethnic Hungarian groups of deputies (those of Egyutteles and the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, MKDH, which have 9 and  5 members respectively in the 150-seat parliament) agreed on  behalf of their groups not to support the bill if a proposal by  an independent deputy that villages named after figures from  Slovak history be not allowed to bear Hungarian names was  accepted.    A law in such a compromise form would be "discriminatory and  anti-democratic", Feher said. The towns and villages in  southern Slovakia were named after significant Slovak figures  only after February 1948 (the communist putsch in  Czechoslovakia) and their present names are the expression of  "cruel re-Slovakisation", and have no historical ground, he  added. Feher stressed that the ethnic Hungarian deputies, who  had decided to back the bill, had changed their opinion "five  minutes before the vote".    Deputy Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, who had voted in favour of the  bill, said that not only Hungarian deputies were to be blamed  for the result of the vote. "The roots of the failure must be  sought in the government coalition," he said. Besides the  absence of twelve coalition deputies and the fact that three  coalition representatives did not support the bill, the negative  result was also due to the "unfulfilled promise by the  coalition", which failed to prevent the adoption of proposals  for changes deforming the initial government bill.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Heseltine rejects role as next Tory chairman Mr Michael Heseltine has dismissed suggestions from prominent Tory MPs that he should take over as Conservative party chairman after the government's expected defeats in local and European elections this summer. His determination to stay at the Department of Trade and Industry emerged as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, failed to dispel speculation that he and Mr Heseltine are preparing for a leadership contest later this year. Mr Clarke insisted during a series of interviews yesterday that he expected Mr John Major to lead the Conservatives into the general election due by 1997. That echoed Mr Major's public reaffirmation earlier this week of his determination to hold on to the premiership. But the chancellor, who said he was fed up with being quizzed about the leadership, again admitted his long-term ambitions to become prime minister. That and a couple of verbal slips suggesting that Mr Major's position was not entirely secure were seen at Westminster as evidence that Mr Clarke is anxious to keep open his options in the event of an early leadership crisis. Mr Heseltine has told close friends that he wants to remain in his present post when Mr Major unveils his expected cabinet reshuffle after the summer elections. He has not received any indication from 10 Downing Street that the prime minister will seek to move him. The speculation that Mr Major might ask Mr Heseltine to lead the Conservatives' campaign for the next general election has been fanned by intense suspicion on the right of the Tory party that he is positioning himself for a leadership bid. Prominent rightwing Tory MPs have been openly canvassing the idea that by making him party chairman Mr Major could ensure Mr Heseltine's loyalty if bad results in the local and European polls trigger a leadership crisis. Sir Norman Fowler, the present chairman, has already indicated his plan to stand down and the MPs have suggested that Mr Heseltine would find it impossible to turn down the job without appearing disloyal. But friends of Mr Heseltine have dismissed as nonsense any suggestion that he would pose a threat to the prime minister if he remained at the DTI. The trade and industry secretary has made it clear that he has always regarded his task of reshaping the government's approach to industry as one that would take at least three years and probably longer. Mr Heseltine's unwillingness to countenance a move leaves Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, as the clear favourite for the party chairmanship.</p>

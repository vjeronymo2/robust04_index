			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: More sax please - Jazz The curious sight and sound of the Pharoah Sanders Quartet is causing some excitement, as well as consternation, in its short tour of the UK. The American tenor saxophonist, who first came to prominence beside the late, great John Coltrane, has found something of a cult following among the jazz dance fraternity lately. As sometimes happens with the unconventional, and non-commercial, he is also undergoing critical re-appraisal by the purists, as torch bearer of what Coltrane began in the 1960s (he died in 1967). It was the Coltrane followers who played up the jazz boom of the late 1980s with their tough blowing, get-outta-may-way style, so appropriate for those restless times. During the same period Sanders, whose own harsh sheets of sound were confined to the West coast, was making records that would be snapped up (and sampled) for the dance floor in the l990s as interest in the new generation of saxophonists began to pall. Thus the prospect of Sanders' carved mahogany features and long white fringe of a beard, inscrutable behind dark glasses and scorching tenor, drew an interesting selection of the jazz listening public to this smoky little club  -from the middle aged hippies made good to the hep habitues of Camden Lock. Most would have felt a little shortchanged. For someone billed (inaccurately) as 'the greatest tenor saxophonist on this earth' in the promotional blather, Sanders could at least have devoted more time to the instrument. Wednesday's set opened with a lengthy percussion workshop from the quartet, employing talking drums and shakers, Sanders bellowing 'There will be peace and happiness' aggressively into the microphone. To a huge and approving rush from the audience, he then set about the sax with some exuberant and often hair-raising split reed technique. The effect is rather like cleaning your ears out with wire wool. But the excitement was shortlived. As the band - William Henderson (piano), Alex Blake (bass) and Sherman Ferguson (drums) - surged ahead enthusiastically, Sanders stepped out, returning occasionally to shout or shake and even beat his chest comically. Miserly rations of caustically liberating tenor technique illicited screams from the audience, as did some fleet and funky fret work from Blake, but the most plaintive voice of them all was the one begging for more sax. Instead, Sanders began to beat a large copper bowl with a mallet. As with the Sanders sound, so it is with the performance it seems. You have to take the rough with the smooth.

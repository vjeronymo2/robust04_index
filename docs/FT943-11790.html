			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Waiting for life to take a turn for the better - Alison Smith considers the prospects for a depressed sector of the insurance market The good and the bad news for the life assurance industry was encapsulated yesterday at the announcement of the first half results for Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group. The good news was set out by Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, who said that in the longer term, demographics and consumer perception of the limited extent of state provision in the future meant that there would be a revival in the pensions market. A low-inflation environment would also contribute to an active investment market. The more immediate bad news was underlined by Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, who said that sales were unlikely to grow in the short term because consumers were reluctant to make a commitment to long-term life assurance and recent publicity had undermined public confidence in the industry. The question for the whole life industry is how to get from where they are now to the brighter prospects some way away. Current difficulties were seen yesterday by the restructuring and reduction of the direct life and pensions sales force of Norwich Union. At the same time, the 40 per cent drop in new business at Black Horse Financial Services, the Lloyds Abbey Life 'bancassurer' which sells only to Lloyds Bank customers, offered a vivid illustration of how life has not improved since the poor figures for the industry as a whole in the first quarter were published by the Association of British Insurers in May. The ABI figures showed a sharp fall in the sale of single premium personal pensions and a 9 per cent drop in new annual premium income from life assurance and annuities to Pounds 378m, against Pounds 417m in the 1993 first quarter. Last week, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, reported that UK sales of single and annual premium life and pensions policies fell by almost one fifth in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1993. Refuge has reported a 30 per cent fall in sales of life products and pensions; Legal &amp; General has reported a fall of just over 16 per cent in UK sales of life and pensions new premium business to the end of June; Britannic Assurance has recorded a smaller drop. Insurers such as Sun Life, which yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in new business, are rare. The relationship between the life industry and its regulators has depressed business in two ways. First, there is the impact on the company itself. Programmes for re-assessing and re-training the sales force - whether voluntarily or compulsorily - means time not spent selling, even if the better-trained sales agents are eventually more productive. Similarly, the decision by some companies not to return yet to the sale of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes restricts the range of products they offer. There is also the more general question of the cost of meeting regulators' requirements. Mr Maran said yesterday that compliance costs were now seven or eight times the costs of compliance four or five years ago. Second, there is the impact on public confidence of the apparently endless run of publicity for life insurers which have failed to comply with regulators' requirements. The widespread concern about the possible mis-selling of pension transfers which erupted last December will cast a shadow over the industry for many months to come. There is some scope for blunting the effect of this by increasing sales of other products, but there are limits to this. For example, sales of single premium investment products this year have been affected by the volatility of the markets, and mortgage-related products have been hit by the fragility of the housing market recovery. More fundamentally, pension sales is an essential area of business. Mr Tom King, marketing general manager of Standard Life, says that pension business now accounts for 40 per cent of Standard Life's total business. 'It's a core business these days,' he says. Beyond pensions, more generalised damage has been inflicted by the publicity attracted for high street financial institutions such as Norwich Union, Nationwide and Barclays Life, which have taken remedial action after a visit from the regulators. Mr Peter Nowell, group chief actuary at Prudential, is not expecting a significant improvement in business until next year. Some in the industry would be more cautious than that, since no-one knows how the new regime for disclosing information about the product, including charges and costs, to the customer, will affect business. Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance analyst at Smith New Court, believes it will be a long time - probably 1996 - before new business figures show an upturn, but that does not stop him being reasonably confident about the quoted companies. 'In a horrid market, they are relatively well-placed. There are life offices a lot worse than they are,' he said.</p>

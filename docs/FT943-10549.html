			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Observer: Bluff Bob Horton Railtrack chairman Bob Horton really must be sensitive about the size of his Pounds 120,000 a year salary. How else do you explain his odd bet with signal workers' boss Jimmy Knapp on BBC radio's Today programme yesterday morning? Horton promised to give to charity the net difference between his salary and Knapp's, if it would help break the strike deadlock. Knapp earns Pounds 46,000, so this would mean that Horton would have to hand over Pounds 44,400. A friendly accountant at Touche Ross calculates that if Horton paid the Pounds 44,400 over as a net Gift Aid payment, the charity could reclaim tax of Pounds 14,800 leaving it with a total of Pounds 59,200. Horton would then receive tax relief at 15 per cent on Pounds 8,800 so the net cost to him would be Pounds 35,520. Sadly, Knapp declined to call Horton's bluff.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Mexico 'spending Dollars 30m' to boost Nafta in US MEXICO is to spend as much as Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.4m) on lobbying efforts by the end of this year, to try to ensure the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, according to the Centre for Public Integrity in Washington. 'Mexico has employed a veritable phalanx of Washington law firms, lobbyists, public relations companies and consultants,' said Mr Charles Lewis, executive director of the Centre, which draws about 10 per cent of its support from labour unions. Basing its conclusions on an eight-month analysis of Justice Department records, researchers found that 33 former US officials had been hired by Mexico to try to ensure the implementing legislation for Nafta gets congressional approval. Among those working for Mexico are former US trade representative Bill Brock and former analyst for the International Trade Commission Ruth Kurtz. The report is the latest snag in the Clinton administration's efforts to sell Nafta to Congress. Negotiations among the three governments on labour and environmental supplemental agreements are now stalled over a US proposal to allow trade sanctions against companies which demonstrate a pattern of failure to enforce environmental laws. However, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said this week he still expected to complete negotiations this summer. The most serious threat to Nafta may come from Mr Ross Perot, the former presidential candidate, whose 'infomercial' against the accord is due to run nationwide on television on Sunday night. Mr Perot's folksy presentations have done much to arouse fear that Nafta will draw jobs from the US to Mexico. While many Democrats are in open rebellion against Nafta, Republican senators and some business groups are threatening to oppose it if the president succeeds in negotiating strong side agreements. Union leaders, meanwhile, have given no sign that they will be satisfied by the proposed tripartite commission on labour standards, which the side pact would establish.</p>

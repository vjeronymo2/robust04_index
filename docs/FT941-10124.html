			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Russian call prompts urgent UN debate: Moscow wants security council to demilitarise Sarajevo The United Nations Security Council decided last night to hold an open debate on Bosnia today, after Russia pressed for an urgent session in the hope of averting Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. The UN move came as the Serbs around Sarajevo were already taking some steps to comply with western demands to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital. At the same time, however, a Bosnian Serb officer indicated that UN aid workers would be at risk if air strikes were launched against Serbs. Russia's UN ambassador played down concern that it was set on confrontation at the UN to try to block the air strikes threatened in the Nato ultimatum to the Serbs on Wednesday. Instead, he said, Moscow was intent on 'quieting down the situation' and wanted the Security Council to examine 'practical ways of demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the UN'. After consultations, the 15-member security council decided to hold a debate open to all 184 UN members, but with no decision, resolution or vote. This avoided any possibility of disagreement leading to a veto on UN action by any of the world powers. Moslem and non-aligned nations also called for a UN meeting, though they support air strikes and favour lifting the arms embargo on the Moslem-led Bosnian government. In Bosnia yesterday, Serb forces around Sarajevo allowed UN peacekeeping troops to move into six frontline zones as part of a plan to lift the siege of the Bosnian capital. But the ceasefire which started at midday was shattered late last night when three artillery shells and a heavy burst of machinegun fire struck the city. The firing came from the direction of one of the most fiercely contested and volatile frontline positions not yet handed over to UN peacekeepers. The deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army warned meanwhile that UN aid workers would have to remain at their posts if Nato launched threatened air strikes. But General Milan Gvero denied that the aid workers would be held hostage. In Geneva Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said during negotiations with Moslems and Croats that his forces would implement an agreement to withdraw their artillery from around Sarajevo and put the weapons under UN control. At the same meeting, the UN agreed to set up a special inquiry into last weekend's Sarajevo market massacre which led to the Nato ultimatum. The UN decision cleared the way for fresh peace talks between the warring Bosnian factions. The Serbs had threatened to walk out of the talks unless an inquiry was set up. The peace talks resume today. Nato's ultimatum requires the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery, mortars and tanks from a 20km zone around the centre of Sarajevo or place them under UN control within 10 days. It also calls on the Moslem-led Bosnian government to put its heavy weapons in the same exclusion zone under UN control.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading UNCERTAINTY over the outcome of the UK general election and the gloomy economic outlook led to heavy stock selling in the futures, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the March contract on the FT-SE started the session at 2,515, but selling by independent traders in the first few minutes sent the contract falling to 2,506. A brief squeeze sent it forward again to 2,520. However, a negative sentiment took hold after 9am and March came under strong selling pressure, leading the underlying cash market down. By early afternoon the contract was trading at 2,482, the low point of the day. In spite of some sporadic buying at the low levels just before the close, the March future finished at 2,489, down 63 from the previous session and at a four-point discount to the cash market. Turnover at over 10,000 lots was heavy. Further falls were recorded in the March contract in after-hours' trading, once again leading some dealers to expect a poor opening today. But others believe the falls in the last two days have been overdone. In the LTOM, turnover reached 27,733 lots. The Euro FT-SE option had 3,238 contracts traded. British Airways was the busiest stock option with a total of 876 lots dealt.</p>

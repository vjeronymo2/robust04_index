			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Jobs: As old as Solomon, but still a mystery - Efforts to define the activities that make up good management have made little useful headway WHAT have human beings been doing at least since Solomon's time 3,000 years ago, without having a precise idea of how they do it? (Those last 10 words will hopefully have ruled out any pretext for lewd responses.) The answer is something a lot of readers do for their near-living - to wit, managing. Solomon qualifies as a fellow practitioner by being on record as establishing elaborate trading systems as well as carrying through construction projects and moulding peace agreements. But although what he achieved shows that he must have been a manager, how he achieved it is a mystery. And the same goes for his successors today who, whatever their achievements, can rarely if ever give a clear explanation of the various skilled things they did to accomplish same. True, it's not something that often worries them. Being typically men and women of action, they are too concerned with getting results to bother their heads analysing exactly how they do so. The trouble is that, as many have sadly discovered in the latest recession, there is an important difference between them and their managerial ancestor of the 10th century BC. Compared with the likes of Solomon, they are far easier to throw out of their job and, though perhaps more likely to live to tell the tale, most will still need to earn the odd crust to sustain themselves while telling it. For managers who have suffered that fate, getting re-employed has probably never been harder. To judge by reports from redundancy counsellors as well as victims, with companies scrapping whole layers of management, recruiters aren't much impressed by career resumes listing posts held in organisational hierarchies, numbers of underlings and the like. Unless you're well connected or otherwise lucky, such evidence that you're a manager is no longer enough to win a new job. You must also be able to convey to employers how you can manage so as to justify your pay in their particular outfit. Alas, the chances of a successful outcome are not improved by the fact that few companies themselves have a better than hazy idea of the detailed things their managers actually do - as distinct from those they're theoretically supposed to, at any rate. There is admittedly no shortage of knowledge about the latter. Indeed prescriptions abound, the only problem being that they do not always correspond with managerial work's complex reality. Take for instance the formula, still taught in business schools, which was laid down about 75 years ago by the French mining engineer Henri Fayol. The essential activities of management, he declared, are planning, organising, commanding, co-ordinating and controlling - and there's no doubt that management can be thought of as compartmented in that way. Whether it helps practitioners, however, is another issue. For one thing, it doesn't shed much light on how to do the five things it cites. So my own suspicion is that managers probably receive no more practical help from being taught Fayol's formula than Moliere's bourgeois gentilhomme gained from learning that ever since his babyhood he had been talking prose. In more recent years, of course, such prescriptions have become a lot longer, particularly with the past decade's vogue for dividing managerial work into so-called competencies (sometimes spelt 'competences'). Hence it is too soon to judge the extent to which the elaborated versions are of use. Even so, I at least doubt the sense of the more grandiose schemes to take management as a whole, wherever it's done, and split it into competencies ranked in importance, which can be tested for the award of certificates. As for the more modest efforts limited to management in just a single company, albeit often big and widely diversified, time alone will tell. The only forecast I would venture is that the outcomes will hinge on the methods by which the competencies are identified. If they're top-down assemblages, formulated by senior executives with or without the aid of research by external consultancies, my bet is that they will do more harm than good. But even bottom-up versions based on inquiries reaching down to the ranks immediately above the shopfloor, won't necessarily be any better. The key factor is probably how the inquiries are conducted. All such exercises are prone to well known faults, including the tendency of prejudices on the part of those putting the questions to influence the replies and the way they are interpreted. Such observer-bias would look to be a particular danger in defining competencies - not least because managers, being sharply attuned political animals, are apt to respond in ways they think will be approved rather than with what they really think. Fortunately, psychologists and the like have devised methods which reduce such dangers, one example having the drab title of Repertory Grid. First developed by an American called George Kelly in the 1930s, it is based on his 'personal construct' theory. The idea is that from birth we piece together individual frameworks which determine how we see the world, each framework consisting of a set of yardsticks - or constructs - for judging what we experience. As an illustration, legend has it that a certain British foreman had only one real construct for judging men. Those who wore polished black shoes with laces were good; those who didn't were evil. And although most people have a great many more constructs, each works in the same way by deciding whether things are importantly similar to one another, or different. Moreover, while the whole set will be exclusive to us individually, some of the particular yardsticks will also be used by other people. The method seeks out the constructs with little observer-bias because Grid consultants ask no leading questions. They just write words on cards - say, 'you' on one card, 'me' on a second, and 'the gatepost' on another - then put the trio before you and ask in which way you think any two of them resemble each other while differing from the third. There's no limit on how many stimulus words - known as 'elements' - can be used, but they are always compared in threes, a pair against a singleton. One psychologist using Grid to clarify what makes for effective management is Fay Fransella of the Centre for Personal Construct Psychology in London. She begins by getting top executives to name a sample of managers they think good and another sample they think otherwise. Then, without letting any of them know which group they're in, she runs them individually through the process using a common set of elements. The result is a number of shared constructs on which the two groups significantly differ. For instance, a recent company study threw up three such constructs. One was the extent to which the managers were able to stand back from the task-at-hand, and review their work in the context of the whole business. Next came the importance set on being always available to subordinates for consultation. The third was the emphasis put on understanding the jobs done by subordinates, so as to be able to control them closely. 'The way the sheep differed from the goats wasn't always as everyone might expect,' says Dr Fransella. 'Certainly, it was the effective group who stood back and reviewed a lot. But they didn't let their staff consult them about anything any time, as distinct from by appointment. And they weren't much concerned to understand the details of the jobs done below them. 'It was the poorer group who knew the nitty-gritty and made themselves always available. That's probably why they didn't have time for standing back and reviewing.'</p>

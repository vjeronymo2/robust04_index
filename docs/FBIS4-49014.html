			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] China has urged the U.S. Government to abide by the  1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  At a weekly press conference on Thursday [28 April], Chinese  Foreign Ministry's Wu Jianmin made the statement in response to  the U.S. adoption of a new legislation.    The modified Murkowski Amendment was adopted ten days ago by  the joint conference of the U.S. Senate and the House of  Representatives. The document asserts that the Taiwan Relations  Act takes primacy over the 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique in  which the two governments pledged to resolve the issue of U.S.  arms sales to Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin  criticized the American legislation, saying its essence negates  the bilateral communique. Wu Jianmin said the modified  amendment not only undermines the relations between the two  countries, but sets up obstacles to the reunification of China's  Mainland and Taiwan. He urged the U.S. Government to abide by  the guiding principle governing bilateral ties and take  immediate measures to keep Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm.    On another issue concerning the U.S., spokesman Wu Jianmin  expressed opposition to a reported meeting between President  Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama. Wu Jianmin said Dalai is not  only a religious leader, but a political exile. And for a long  time, he has engaged in activities aiming to split China.  Therefore, the spokesman concluded any official meeting with  the Dalai Lama is an act of support for a separatist attempt and  amounts to an interference in China's domestic affairs.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also dismissed the  linkage between the MFN [most-favored nation] status and China's  nuclear tests. Reports say some American legislators have  warned that China's continued nuclear testing will do no good to  the likelihood of the U.S. extending its tariff privileges. The  spokesman said: among the world's five nuclear states, China has  conducted the smallest number of nuclear tests, which account  for only four percent of U.S. testing.    Finally, Wu Jianmin described the report that China has sent  an additional 30,000 troops to Tibet and deployed them along the  border with India as a sheer fabrication. Wu Jianmin said such  a report has an ulterior motive. He said China and India signed  an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility last  year and have begun to negotiate on troop reduction along the  line of actual control    For China Radio International, I am (Li Peiquan).</p>

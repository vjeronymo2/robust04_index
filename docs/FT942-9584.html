			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: How essential is Sainsbury? - The Bottom Line Sainsbury, according to its advertisement campaign, is 'essential for the essentials'. But after months of gloom surrounding the grocery market, investors may be wondering whether its shares are still an essential holding. Its detailed but complex results statement on Wednesday made the answer to that question little clearer. The halving of reported pre-tax profits from Pounds 732.8m to Pounds 368.8m was misleading, as much of it was accounted for by accounting changes. A one-off write-down on property values knocked Pounds 341.5m off the bottom line, and a new, recurring depreciation charge on buildings a further Pounds 38.7m - after Sainsbury bowed to pressure from investors to take a more realistic attitude to property values and depreciation. A reorganisation of head office and distribution functions, involving 650 job losses, cost another Pounds 28m. Without the charges, pre-tax profits would have risen to Pounds 777m (although that includes a Pounds 7m profit on property sales), which beat Sainsbury's downbeat prediction in January of only a 'small' rise. Nevertheless, the increase lagged well behind the double-digit percentage increases Sainsbury had turned in every year for the previous decade. The problem was not with Sainsbury's other retail businesses - Homebase, the DIY chain, Shaw's, the US supermarket group, and the Savacentre hypermarkets. The slow-down was in the core supermarket chain - which still accounts for almost 80 per cent of group sales and more than 80 per cent of its operating profits. The supermarkets' operating profits rose only 2.3 per cent in spite of a 7.1 per cent sales increase. That was the result of several factors. One was that food price inflation averaged a 25-year low of 1.5 per cent. Inflation is, in many ways, the retailer's friend, as it means the value of stock rises between the time it is bought and re-sold to customers, boosting the profit margin. The main factor was the intense price competition that forced Sainsbury to cut prices on 300 own-label lines in its so-called 'essentials' campaign. The competition was sparked by the growth of a new breed of cut-price discount chains and moves to lower pricing by rivals such as Asda and Gateway; and, some would suggest, the growing surplus of floorspace in the grocery market. The campaign knocked 0.4 percentage points off Sainsbury's gross margin - which had been rising steadily. The crucial question is whether margins will continue to fall. David Sainsbury, chairman, insisted they had stabilised. He said the industry had gone through a one-off repositioning on margins, akin to that in 1977, when there was a similar upsurge in discounter activity and Tesco launched a price-cutting operation. Others disagree. Graeme Bowler, chief executive of the UK's largest food discounter Kwik Save, warned the day before Sainsbury's results that intense pressures on price were here to stay. Whether or not margins continue to decline, the food market will be tough, and growth opportunities for Sainsbury's core superstore chain limited. The group is, however, conducting the most wide-ranging review of its superstore operations for many years, and says likely cost savings are Pounds 65m a year. There may be other reasons to hold on to the shares. Sainsbury is shifting the focus of expansion on to its other businesses. Moreover, the company said on Wednesday it would look at other opportunities in the US. If it does not make a further acquisition there, then with capital spending expected to fall slightly, Sainsbury's highly cash-generative nature may create scope for increasing the dividend. In a difficult market, Sainsbury is further down the road in terms of diversification and efficiency than its biggest rivals, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway. As to whether Sainsbury's shares are worth buying, on a price/earnings ratio which is a 12 per cent discount to the market they are becoming attractive. Any further weakness, and they might once again start to look essential.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhou Xiang (5297 5046): "Increasing Numbers of </F> Teachers, Owed Back Wages, Leave Their Profession"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] On 23 December 1992 GUANGMING  RIBAO gave front-wage headline treatment to an article entitled  "Save the Teachers, Save the Children." According to the  article, Yilong County in Sichuan, the hometown of  Commander-in-Chief Zhu De [2612 1795], was seven months behind  in its payment to more than 7,000 teachers who were owed a total  of 7 million yuan, forcing them to survive on help from friends  and relatives. Japan's ASAHI SHIMBUN picked up the story and  spread it around the world in a report entitled "China Would  Rather Build Factories than Schools." People overseas were  shocked while everybody at home from top to bottom was stunned.  Has it occurred to anybody that what is happening in Yilong  County is also taking place in more than half of China to  varying extents? This hot topic shook up every social quarter.  Descriptions of the teachers' plight prove that these belated  news stories are absolutely no fabrication.    -- According to surveys by Hebei on the province's 130  counties and municipalities, 75 of them have fallen behind in  their wage payment to teachers, owing the latter 79.2 million  yuan in all.    -- As of 19 May 1993, almost 80,000 teachers in 9  municipalities, 24 counties (prefectures), and 465 townships in  Liaoning Province were owed 78.51 million yuan in back wages.  Many people have not received a single paycheck several months  in a row.    -- Of the 83 counties in Guangxi Autonomous Region, 70 have  not been paying their teachers on time. The amount of unpaid  wages exceeded 80 million yuan between last year and the first  half of this year and reached almost 100 million yuan if you go  back several years.    In one province teachers were owed a whopping 44.51 million  yuan in unpaid wages. At one point they did not receive a single  dime for a record 6 months. Owing to wage adjustments and  because they were given more senior-level responsibilities, some  teachers were due to receive wage increases retroactively.  However, the actual payment has been delayed, in some cases as  long as six years. Province-wide, 18,000 public-school teachers  have been affected by the late payments, each owed more than  1,800 yuan on average. Also owed back wages are 25,000  private-school teachers, each owed about 472 yuan in subsidies  on the average.    Nationwide, elementary and high school teachers are owed 1.4  billion yuan in back wages. Never before in the history of the  PRC has the nation owed so many teachers so much money for so  long with such serious effects. The legitimate rights and  interests of teachers have been severely violated and the  prestige of the party and the government has eroded. Among the  12 major professions in society, wages in the teaching  profession are already the second lowest. The profession cannot  even keep its ninth ranking.    Meanwhile, according to reports in ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO,  administrative units above the county level nationwide had  approved the spending of 14.5 billion yuan to purchase small  cars by the first half of 1993. In Sichuan, they gave a villa  valued at 1 million yuan to a movie actor as a gift but have  fallen behind in their payment of teachers' wages, owing the  latter almost 100 million yuan. Liaoning has spent as much as  1.3 billion yuan to buy sedans but keeps falling into arrears  when it comes to paying its teachers. [passage omitted]    Where have the educational funds gone? Where have the  teachers' wages gone? Year after year education makes its way to  the top of every government's agenda. Year after year people's  congresses at all levels boost educational spending in the  budget. Year after year education and teachers find themselves  in dire financial straits. [passage omitted]    LIAOWANG, the weekly magazine, devoted its fourth issue this  year to a special report on this topic. Comrade Yang Chunmao  [2799 2504 5399], personnel chief of the State Education  Commission, expressed deep concern about the loss of teachers  nationwide in a piece titled "The Foundation of Basic Education  Is Being Undermined." One cause of concern is the rising number  of teachers leaving the profession each year, the overwhelming  majority of them under 45 years of age. Of the 2,300 teachers in  Shanghai who left the profession in 1993, 1,600, or 69 percent,  were younger than 35 years old. A high 86.3 percent of the  teachers in Tianjin who switched jobs were under 40 years of  age. The second concern is that the problem tends to hit some  areas and schools particularly hard. For the areas and schools  affected, the result is nothing short of catastrophic. The  exodus of teachers en masse is only part of the problem. Equally  serious are the destabilizing effects their departure has on the  ranks of the teaching profession. When the teaching force is  demoralized, building up its ranks in the future becomes a  daunting task.    When teachers' training institutions of all types have  trouble recruiting students, the quality of basic education will  suffer directly. As they say, "Without the skin, what can the  hair cling to?"    Nationwide the demand for elementary and high school  teachers  generally shows an upward trend. In contrast teachers' training  institutions, which produce teachers, are in decline in both  their strength and their scale of development. In 1992, a banner  year for institutions of higher education of all types,  recruitments by general teachers' training colleges fell from  296,400 a year ago to 276,100. Recruitments by teachers'  training secondary schools also slipped, from 299,300 to  278,900, including the large number of students recruited by  teachers' training schools who do not major in education.    Under State Education Commission regulations, elementary and  high school teachers must possess the appropriate academic  qualifications. Specifically, senior high school teachers must  be graduates of teachers' training colleges who have majored in  education, while teachers at the junior high school and  elementary school levels must be college graduates and graduates  of special secondary schools, respectively. A teacher who  entered the profession having gone through neither of these two  routes is considered unqualified. However, he can qualify by  passing an examination and earning a certificate. According to  knowledgeable individuals in the teachers' training office under  the State Education Commission, there were 8.66 million  elementary and high school teachers in China as of late 1992. On  average 53.7 percent of senior high school teachers were  qualified, as were 60.2 percent of junior high school teachers  and 90.6 percent of elementary school teachers. The average pass  rate among elementary and high school teachers was 68.2 percent.  In addition, the fact that knowledge becomes obsolete and  teaching methods go out of date, along with other ills, is  increasingly affecting the quality of the targets of education  and widening the gap between education and practical needs.    President Zhang Yiwei [1728 0001 0251] of Petroleum  University appealed to society at large to make investment in  education a top priority. He said, "Our educational spending to  date has not even reached the level of middle-ranking developing  nations. These days people say that since we are trying to put  together a market economy, inevitably education would take a  beating. The fact of the matter is that the more we want a  market economy, the greater the need to take education  seriously. Certainly education itself needs to be reformed, but  that will take time. Everything else can be imported; the only  thing that cannot be imported is the quality of the people. We  can only work to nurture it on this piece of land. This is such  a basic point. If we ignore education, the result will be a  poorly educated populace, which in turn will have adverse  effects on material construction. Modernization is impossible  without a high-caliber people."    People have always found this "besieged city" phenomenon  most  puzzling. Everybody knows that intellectuals have meager  financial resources. Yet every parent works his guts out to  provide an education for his children, hoping that they would  grow up to be intellectuals. The individual householder may be  awash in banknotes, but he pledges to his soul he would send his  son to college.    Don't you feel that this is historical progress of sorts, a  road history must travel?    Who will be the teachers in 21st-century China? In a certain  sense, China's prosperity today and its rise or fall tomorrow  ride on the answer. [passage omitted]</p>

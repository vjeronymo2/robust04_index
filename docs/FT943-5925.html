			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: IAF In its first set of results since gaining a listing through its reversal into Greyfriars Investment Company, IAF Group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.61m for the nine months to end-June. The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 2.02m for the previous 12 month period and was achieved on turnover of Pounds 6.81m, against Pounds 7.81m. IAF adopted the June year end at the time of the take-over. Basic earnings per share emerged at 2.41p (1.86p), or 2.37p (1.87p) fully diluted. Following the loss of its investment trust status, the company was left with a large adverse balance on the capital reserve account. It proposes to present resolutions at the forthcoming AGM to reorganise the share capital and reserves to correct this position. Conditional upon these resolutions being passed, the directors propose to pay a nominal dividend of 0.1p.</p>

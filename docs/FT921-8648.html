			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / PLO condemns Israeli raid as 'state terrorism' An adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, said Israeli raids into south Lebanon on Sunday were 'state terrorism' and showed the Jewish state was not committed to the Middle East peace process, Reuter reports from Tunis. Bassam Abu Sharif, quoted by the Tunisian state news agency TAP, said: 'The crimes committed daily by the Israeli government in south Lebanon prove that it is not serious in the Middle East peace process and is pursuing its expansionist plans.' 'Israeli repression and state terrorism can lead only to further hostility,' Abu Sharif added.</p>

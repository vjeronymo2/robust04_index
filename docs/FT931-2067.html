			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Turkish Kurd peace hopes rise Turkish Kurds marked the Nowrouz spring festival with only minor outbreaks of unrest yesterday, keeping alive peace hopes raised by a guerrilla ceasefire, Reuter reports from Cizre. A 15-year-old youth, one of six civilians wounded by bullets when police broke up an unauthorised demonstration by Kurds in the southern industrial city of Adana, died of his wounds, a police official in the city told Reuter. A child was injured and 200 people were detained in Adana, according to the police chief. But there was no repeat of last year's Nowrouz bloodbath in which about 100 people died, most of them civilians. Tanks, armoured cars and sharpshooters kept a tight grip on the south-eastern towns of Cizre and Silopi. There were few signs of trouble from Kurdistan Workers' Party guerrillas, whose leader has called a unilateral 26-day ceasefire.</p>

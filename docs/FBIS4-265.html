			<p>BFN     [Text] No concrete results were achieved in Lusaka, Zambia,  today. Things are moving slowly and the delegations to the  peace talks continue to examine the document presented by the  mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral  process. UN Alioune Blondin Beye met with negotiating teams  from the government and the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] before leaving for Geneva for a  meeting on Angola with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. Our  correspondent Pedro Manuel reports:    [Manuel] Alioune Blondin Beye has not yet left Lusaka for  Geneva. He is still expected to do so this evening. During the  day Alioune Blondin Beye held some working meetings with the  heads of negotiating teams from the government and UNITA. The  parties are presently debating the document presented by the  mediators and observers on the conclusion of the electoral  process -- that is, general and specific principles.    The negotiators are also discussing, although not in depth,  issues connected with local and legislative elections. The  fundamental issue, however, is the holding of the second round  of presidential elections. The date of these elections will  only be announced after the creation of what a source described  as material and psychological conditions -- that is, the  establishment of complete peace. It will be the United Nations  to announce the existence the preconditions for a second round  of presidential elections.    According to one source, the UNITA team proposes changes in  some aspects of the electoral law. UNITA says the voting  bulletins must be more informative and more acceptable. It also  proposes changes in the organization and operation of the  National Electoral Council [CNE] and calls for an active UN  participation in the conclusion of the electoral process. The  following question remains, however: Who is going to hold the  second round of presidential elections? Will it be the CNE or  the United Nations? The reply will be obtained after the  conclusion of debates on the issue.    All the same it seems as if the discussions on the  conclusion  of the electoral process are on the right track. There are few  differences. According to our source, after a possible  cease-fire a lot of time may be needed to hold the second round  of presidential elections [words indistinct] government organs  must operate normally, with the inclusion of some UNITA elements.    On the country's administration, despite all the secrecy, it  is being said that it is no longer a very difficult issue.  According to a negotiator, every effort is being made to ensure  that the peace talks conclude in April. It is true, however,  that differences still remain.</p>

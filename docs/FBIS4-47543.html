Kozlov; UDC 577.112.5]    [Abstract] A solution of dry P. vitale catalase  and 0.2 n NaOH was separated through dialysis in 0.1 n  NH4HCO3 overnight at 8C. Miles  (England) staphylococcus proteinase was added to the dialyzate,  which was then allowed to stand for 6 h at 37C. The  resulting sediment was centrifuged off, and the process liquid  lyophilized. A total of 38 peptides were isolated through gel  filtration on a Pharmacia (Sweden) G-50 sephadex, ion-exchange  chromatography using Toyo-Soda (Japan) DEAE resin and Filtrak  (Germany) FN-17 paper, and high-voltage electrophoresis using  Filtrak (Germany) FN-17 paper. The amino-acid composition was  determined with an AAA-339 analyzer made in the Czech Republic.  Dansylation was used for N-end analysis. The peptides contained  a total of 578 amino acids constituting 83% of the  catalase's  peptide chain, which has 670 amino acid residues according to  x-ray crystallography data.

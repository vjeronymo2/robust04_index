			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US wheat acreage cut US FARMERS have this year reduced the acreage planted with winter wheat at a time when US stocks are their lowest in almost two decades. A US Department of Agriculture report, released late on Friday, said farmers had reported planting wheat on 50.2m acres, down from 51m last winter. Mr Barry Jenkins, vice president, communications, of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said farmers made their growing decision from August to October, when wheat prices were low, and it seemed they could do better planting soyabeans or maize in the spring. Furthermore, the USDA reduced the acreage reduction programme for wheat from 15 per cent to 5 per cent, a move that could have boosted production and sent prices down even further. Since then, the effects of poor weather last summer has been pushing prices up.</p>

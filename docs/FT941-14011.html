			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Lending boosts money supply A post-Budget pick-up in private-sector lending boosted the broad measure of the money supply last month and confirmed that the trend in borrowing is firmly upwards. Bank of England figures showed that sterling lending by banks and building societies to the private sector - M4 lending - was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 4.1bn last month compared with Pounds 0.55bn in Nov-ember. This took the year-on-year growth rate of M4 lending - a good indicator of consumer and company confidence - to 3.6 per cent from 3 per cent in the year to November. The broad money supply measure, M4, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent last month compared with the previous month, a much stronger rise than expected. It was up 5.5 per cent in the year to last month, the highest growth rate since August 1992. It compared with 4.9 per cent in November. Analysts said the acceleration in the M4 growth rate almost certainly represented a bounce back from the very depressed November lending figure, but nonetheless reflected a gradual upwards trend. Most of the growth was concentrated in the company sector with personal-sector borrowing still relatively depressed. Figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed that lending by the UK's main banking groups last month was lower than in November, but above the average of the previous six months. Lending by the nine banking groups - which covers only a proportion of the overall M4 bank and building society sector - rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.42bn in December compared with November's rise of Pounds 2.13bn. Lord Inchyra, BBA director-general, said that in spite of the slowdown last month, the longer-term trend in lending showed a definite advance from its low point a year ago.</p>

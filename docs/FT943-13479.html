			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan tumbles 3% as political crisis deepens It was a day of strong contrasts among the equity markets on the Continent, with Italy and Paris heading in opposite dir-ections. MILAN was unnerved by the deepening political morass, and the Comit index, under additional pressure from a number of companies trading ex-dividend, fell 21.43, or 3 per cent, to 689.69. The market was marked sharply lower early in the session, in line with the bond and currency markets, before steadying later in the day. Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan commented that growing tensions between the coalition partners over plans to curtail magistrates' powers had raised doubts about the future of the government. 'Developments over the weekend have made it hard to see how they are going to bolt the coalition back together again,' he said. More immediately, it begged questions about whether budget details, due on Thursday, would be ready on time. The political uncertainty also took a toll on foreign investor confidence. Daiwa Europe, which had maintained an overweight position, noted in its latest strategy review that the Comit index had risen by 131 per cent in the 20 months to May, before the subsequent retrenchment 'restored a very attractive level of potential appreciation for the end of this year, though we recognise that political and economic setbacks could cause corrections along the way'. The weekend's developments left Mr Roger Monson, chief equity strategist, reviewing the banking and securities house's stance on Milan yesterday, and while he said that the market was one to be avoided in the short term, he maintained his positive view in the mid to long term. Selling was broadly based, with Montedison down L27 to L1,435. Stet, trading ex-dividend, lost L130 to L5,350 and Generali fell L290 to L41,200, ex-dividend. PARIS enjoyed a strong performance on the first day of trading following the long weekend break. Supported by bonds, the CAC-40 index added 50.54, or 2.6 per cent, to break through the 2,000 level for the first time since mid-June, at 2,025.13. The equity market has long been in the doldrums and has fallen steeply since the start of the year. Analysts had been expecting a return to higher levels for some time, given the strength of the underlying economy. Kleinwort Benson, in returning its recommendation to neutral from underweight, said at the end of last week that the strongest case for the market at present was one of momentum. 'Earnings growth is strong, with disappointments unlikely. Investors are much less overweight in French equities then they were and in many cases underweight . . . most importantly, sentiment is currently weak and it is difficult to see what would make it deteriorate any further. France has underperformed for too long.' FRANKFURT pushed forward in official hours and then accelerated some more in the post-bourse, the Dax index closing the latter with an advance of 13.42 to 2,116.96. Merck Finck said yesterday that with the US currency remaining the key to movements in the equity market, it did not expect a rally until later in the summer, and from lower levels than at present. Consequently it said that it was maintaining a defensive strategy, was remaining cautious on cyclicals, with the exception of chemicals, and had reduced the utilities sector from overweight to neutral. By contrast it was raising its weighting of construction stocks from neutral to overweight, based on an improvement in the sector. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the gains of last week and strength seen elsewhere on the Continent and the AEX index firmed 1.52 to 393.61. The publishing sector was one of the main beneficiaries of the day, with the Fl 3.00 gain in Elsevier, one of the index's heavyweights, to Fl 164.30 helping to push overall sentiment higher. However, the publishing group's stock remains down more than 10 per cent from its level seen at the start of the year. ZURICH remained under pressure from Roche, and the SMI index fell 20.2 through support at the 2,500 level to finish at 2,494.7. Roche certificates gave up another SFr170 to SFr5,260 in further response to last week's disappointing first-half sales figures. Other chemicals were also easier. Sandoz registered shares lost SFr10 to SFr647, although its own first-half figures were in line with most expectations. Insurers bucked the weaker trend on a positive view for the sector's outlook. Swiss Re certificates rose SFr13 to SFr555 and Winterthur put on SFr14 to SFr710 after the company confirmed a report that it expected double-figure profits growth this year. Banks were little changed as investors positioned themselves for half-year reports next month. MADRID turned firmer as bonds recovered, although late profit-taking took prices off best levels. The general index rose 2.16 to 304.95. Repsol put on Pta70 at Pta4,020, and Sevillana added PTa19 at Pta683 as 17.9m shares were placed at Pta680 each in what was described as an internal adjustment. STOCKHOLM moved higher although turnover was reported as being below average. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 13.7 to 1,430.9. A number of factors contributed to the recovery of share prices, dealers said: a further decline in domestic interest rates, gains on neighbouring markets and optimism ahead of first-half earnings figures from Swedish companies. Turnover came to SKr1.36bn. WARSAW rebounded 6.3 per cent, overcoming Thursday's 5.9 per cent tumble and returning to the winning ways of the previous seven sessions. The Wig index rose 658.2 to 11,065.3, although the rise prompted warnings that the high pace of recent gains, if sustained for long, could provoke another round of profit-taking. Turnover rose 35 per cent to 1,400bn zlotys. Universal rose 9.5 per cent to 218,000 zlotys.

She held it with the participation of first  secretaries from the party committee of various military  subdistricts across the province and responsible persons from  the armed forces committees at all levels. In his speech Sun  Weiben stressed: Party committees at all levels, particularly  the first secretary of military subdistrict party committees,  should foster, under the new situation, the concept of  enhancing the party's control over the armed forces and never  weakening the party's control in this regard. They should also  concentrate on the concept of achieving harmonious development  between the construction of national defense reserve forces and  economic construction. The construction of militia and reserve  forces should be put on the daily schedule of local party  committees as well as into the overall construction plan at the  prefecture-city level and into the system in which the first  secretary holds responsibility for the construction in this  regard during his tenure. Party committees at all levels should  ensure the assignment of various duties of the armed forces work  to responsible personnel and exercise strong leadership over the  work.    Attending the meeting were leading personnel from the party,  government, and Army organs, including Shao Qihui, Tian  Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yu Jingchang, and Wang  Guiqin.    Party committees at all levels throughout the province and  armed forces departments have enhanced the party's leadership  over the armed forces in the past two years. They have done this  by closely following the center of economic construction. Thus,  the province's construction of national defense reserve forces  has developed overall and the sense of national defense for the  broad masses of cadres and the personnel of militia and reserve  forces has been obviously improved. The armed forces units at  grass-roots levels have remained stable thanks to conducting  reforms among the systems. The construction of leading bodies  for the people's armed forces departments and that of cadres'  contingents have been strengthened. The average age of cadres  in charge of the armed forces work has shown a four-year  decrease over the past and their structure of specialized  knowledge has been greater improved. The organizational  construction of militia and reserve forces among key localities  has been further implemented. The quality of military training  and administrative work undertaken by the militia and reserve  forces throughout the province has been upgraded. 90 percent of  counties, county-level cities, and districts have realized their  training of reserve forces in their neighboring military bases.  The qualified rate of trainees has reached more than 98  percent. Meanwhile, various localities have upheld the  principle of using the armed forces and training armed forces in  the course of reform and construction and having the personnel  of militia and reserve forces play an important role in building  the two civilizations. Since the campaign of "scientific and  technological winter", one million personnel of militia and  reserve forces throughout the province have attended the  training classes on technologies suitable to rural areas. These  classes have turned out 200,000 graduates, talented personnel  who have done a lot in developing the commodity economy in rural  areas. During the campaign of "supporting the poor and helping  the difficult", 70 percent of poor households under the support  and assistance of militiamen, and farms run by the people's  liberation army units stationed in the province, have dealt with  the problems of dressing warmly and eating their well. 32  percent of them have gotten on the road to riches. Various  localities have the militia and reserve forces in the activities  of combating floods and dealing with emergencies, taming large  rivers, building water conservancy works, and fulfilling tasks  for building the state key projects in the province. These  localities have also pioneered a new road: Integrating the  development of productive forces with the upgrade of fighting  capability. While safeguarding social peace, the personnel of  militia and reserve forces across the province coordinated with  the public security departments in cracking down on 213 serious  and appalling criminal cases and capturing 4,365 criminal  elements this year.    In his speech Sun Weiben also emphatically pointed out:  Efforts should be made to enhance the party's control over the  armed forces and to have the first secretary assume the  important responsibility in the work. A good job must be done  in carrying out political construction among the militia and  reserve forces and persistently applying the socialist theory of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of these armed forces.  Efforts should be made to have education on missions, and fine  tradition among the personnel of militia and reserve forces; to  maintain the correct work orientation of militia and reserve  forces; and to ensure that these forces are always under the  absolute leadership of the party. Meanwhile, party committees  at all levels, in particular the first secretary, should  continuously enhance their self study; go deep into reality in  order to carry out investigation and study; explore the  characteristics and laws of the armed forces under the new  situation. Attention should be paid to the role of the armed  forces departments in being a "staff organ", being good at  coordinating with departments concerned, to commonly and jointly  managing, persistently implementing the regulations and systems  that have been proven effective in enforcement, and  realistically upgrading the capability and level of leadership  over the armed forces work.    During the meeting Yu Jingchang, member of the provincial  party standing committee and political commissar of the  provincial military district, delivered a report entitled "By  Meeting the New Situation of `Two Changes', We Should Improve  the Quality of the Province's Work in Building Militia and  Reserve Forces to a New Level".</p>

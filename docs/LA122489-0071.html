			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCRIMINATION  </P> <P> "Please teach us that discrimination is unacceptable. . . ." An honest and  meaningful plea from Jordan Marsh, the president of the University of  Wisconsin's senior class ("Wisconsin University Faculty Votes to Expel ROTC  Program," Part A, Dec. 5). Marsh's plea reflects the prayers of all of us who  demand the end of bigotry and of the bashing of our lesbian and gay children.  </P> <P> The University of Wisconsin faculty added its petition to that of the students  and urged that the Board of Regents expel the ROTC, thus translating into  action the widespread feeling on campus that our military's "longstanding ban  on gay and lesbian participation in the ROTC and other programs . . . " is  unacceptable.  </P> <P> Marsh's plea to his teachers underscores a truth that must be confronted by all  of us who are responsible for our children's well-being. If we expect them to  experience the end of persecution, the end of a second class-citizenry, the end  of people-to-people violence, we must teach "to bigotry, no sanction." We must  teach our children that differences are interesting, not inciting; that  disagreements should motivate discussion, not discrimination; that  misunderstandings must be clarified, not cemented into our culture.  </P> <P> AGNES G. HERMAN  </P> <P> Lake San Marcos  </P></p>

In this bellicose outburst, he said it is "important to make  combat preparations" to attack the DPRK and "possibility of war  cannot be ruled out".    This is an exasperating remark that could be uttered by none  other than a trigger-happy element intending to push the  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.    All the more serious is the fact that, as Woolsey said, "the  President issued this instruction."    We cannot but take a very serious note of the fact that U.S.  President Clinton "ordered combat preparations" inwardly, not  long after he threatened that any one who "venture an attack  will have to pay dearly for it," obviously hinting at the DPRK,  when he was announcing results of the U.S.-South Korea "summit  talks" some time ago.    Such remarks of the U.S. authorities are a crude breach of  the DPRK-USA joint statement and perfidy against the dialogue  partner. It cannot be construed otherwise than an act to block  the third round of DPRK-USA talks.    The recent powder-reeking, bellicose outbursts of the U.S.  authorities suggest that their clamour about "preconditions" is  motivated by a sinister political intention. This makes us  wonder whether the United States truly seeks a negotiated  solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula or  persistently pursues a hostile policy for stifling the DPRK.    The United States which has deployed many nuclear weapons in  South Korea and is constantly presenting a nuclear threat to the  DPRK, is now crying that the "possibility of war cannot be ruled  out", provoking it which has neither intention nor capacity to  develop nuclear weapons. This is really a shameless act  reminding us of a thief crying "stop thief!"    If the United States intends to bring the DPRK into  submission in league with Japan and South Korea by means of  pressure, "sanctions" and force of arms through the  "international cooperation system," it is a big mistake.    No coercion and threat can solve anything.    The United States must discard the old conception of  confrontation of the cold war era and promptly stop the foolish  moves to contain the DPRK with strength.    It must act properly, knowing well of its dialogue partner.</p>

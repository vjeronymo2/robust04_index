			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tagalog </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has  strongly criticized the continued operation of the Alex Boncayao  Brigade [ABB] in Metro Manila. According to Gregorio Rosal,  alias Comrade Roger, head of the CPP Information Bureau, this  liquidation squad was dismantled and disarmed in December last  year. He reiterated that the current ABB is illegal and is not  recognized by the hierarchy of the CPP-NPA [New People's Army].  It is allegedly supported by the breakaway group of the Metro  Manila-Rizal Regional Committee under the leadership of Felimon  Lagman, alias Carlos Forte. The ABB was recently involved in  the robbery of a truck loaded with rice in Binondo, Manila.</p>

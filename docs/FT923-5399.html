			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (6): Where they earn it - Chemnitz THE CITY of Chemnitz had the dubious distinction under the East German communist regime of being renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt - a move quickly reversed when the political tide turned. Yet the communist philosopher's huge stone head still dominates the city centre and there are no plans to remove it. In spite of the unfortunate associations with the past, the city is keeping Marx as an inhabitant. His presence has nothing to do with any links between Marx and Chemnitz, Saxony's third largest city with nearly 300,000 people. The only connection is that Chemnitz has long been an industrial centre - it was known as Germany's Manchester - with a strong working class tradition. People there like to repeat that 'Chemnitz is where the money is earned, Leipzig where it is traded and Dresden where it is spent.' Chemnitz lacks the attractions of the other two. It was badly bombed in the last war, rebuilt on grim utilitarian lines and is now struggling to readjust itself as its industry suffers in the transition to the free market. From the heyday of silver mining in the nearby Erzgebirge ('ore hills') in the Middle Ages, through the textile boom of the 19th century, to engineering and cars in the modern industrial era, Chemnitz has been at the centre of economic development in Germany and Europe. 'Chemnitz was the cradle of the machine tool industry in Germany,' says Mr Matthias Weissbeck, manager of Niles-Simmons, a lathe manufacturer bought by a US concern (and thus with a relatively secure future). The company was able to keep near the forefront of technical development under the old regime, mainly because it sold as much as a third of its products to the west. Today it employs about 250 people and hopes to move up to 400. To slash costs, it has cut staff; it buys more parts from outside instead of making everything itself, as was common under the former regime. In those days it employed 1,600. The same process is taking place at Heckert, a name well known in the industry but clouded by uncertainty. Heckert, which makes machine centres and milling machines, has cut jobs from 4,300 to 500 and is slimming down its product range and size to a profitable level. 'Heckert was the flagship of the East German machine tool industry,' says Mr Wolfgang Sittig, joint managing director. The company is far from enjoying that role in a united Germany. Now that the Russian market, which took 80 per cent of sales, has collapsed, Heckert has to make its way in the west, where the industry is in hard times and potential buyers are thin on the ground. Yet the mood is determinedly optimistic. 'It is costing us a lot of sweat, but we think we will survive,' says Mr Manfred Friedrich, Heckert's other joint manager. The survival mentality is strong in Chemnitz. New business parks are planned and improvements to the infrastructure under way. But the economic turmoil is tremendous, with only around a fifth of the jobs from the old GDR remaining. This is especially true of sectors such as textiles where low-cost foreign competition is intense. New jobs are not being created fast enough and half the working population is jobless or in job-creation and training programmes. There are positive signs. Some are economic, such as the robust commitment of Mr Jakob Langenauer, a Swiss businessman, to the textile machinery company, Chemnitzer Webmaschinenbau, which he now heads after his imagination was captured by the fall of the Berlin Wall. 'Confidence is the most important thing in competing with western companies. People here are well educated, intelligent, and ready to work together,' he says. In December of this year, the reopening of the restored Opera House at Chemnitz should help confidence along. It was here, for the first time. that Wagner's Parsifal was performed outside Bayreuth. For those with the patience to sit through it, Parsifal will again be staged in Chemnitz this year.</p>

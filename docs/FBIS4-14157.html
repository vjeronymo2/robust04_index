			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Spotlight on the News" </F> program]    [Text] At the conclusion of his visit to Baghdad, Rolf  Ekeus said the question of lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq  is a political decision. This is not the first time the head of  the UN Special Commission has made such a declaration. For some  time, Mr. Ekeus has been talking about matters that go beyond  the technical aspects of arms, disarmament, and other issues  related to weapons of mass destruction. When weapons-related  issues were still pending between Iraq and the Special  Commission, particularly questions pertaining to ways of  implementing relevant UN Security Council resolution, Ekeus and  other UN officials emphasized in their statements the need for  Iraq to respect the resolutions of the international legitimacy,  particularly the UN Security Council resolutions. They used to  say the decision to lift the sanctions depends on Iraq's  implementation of those resolutions, which they admit to be  negative, illegitimate, and unjust. When Iraq declared that it  had fully complied with the UN Security Council resolutions and  that there is no justification for the continued blockade, they  started raising issues which in themselves are considered a  circumvention of those resolutions and their objectives.    To appease their masters in Washington, it is absolutely  clear that sometimes they play with words and sometimes they  play for time to prolong the blockade. Therefore, saying that  the blockade question depends on the UN Security Council  political plans exposes the last pretext in a series of pretexts  they have been using throughout the stages of the blockade.  This also proves that the matter has nothing to do with Iraq's  implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. As Ekeus  bluntly put it, the question needs a political decision.    Talk about a political decision is no surprise for Iraq. In  fact, it perhaps surprises some quarters which (?used to  believe) that Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council  resolutions means paving the way for lifting the blockade.  However, as proved by recent events, the matter is not like  that. As Ekeus says, the decision is political rather than  technical, as it should be.    At any rate, great Iraq has managed to expose all the faces  hiding behind false, glimmering slogans. Iraq is now capable of  exposing them completely to prove to the entire world that all  their words on legitimacy are false.</p>

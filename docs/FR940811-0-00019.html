This amendment requires the inclusion of additional airplanes to the candidate fleet. This amendment is prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group, Model 747 Structures Task Group. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective September 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

The action proposed to require that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program be revised to include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI). That action was prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group, Model 747 Structures Task Group (STG). The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the selection of airplanes in the candidate fleet be determined by the STG, which is comprised of representatives from various operators, the FAA, and Boeing. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that retired airplanes, hull losses, or parked airplanes that are in the current candidate fleet must be replaced with in-service airplanes to maintain the candidate fleet size of 117 in-service airplanes. In selecting replacement airplanes for the candidate fleet, the FAA evaluates, among other factors, age and service history of in-service airplanes. The FAA will continue to consider recommendations from the STG for replacement airplanes; however, the responsibility for determining the suitability of airplanes for the candidate fleet ultimately rests with the FAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questions the validity for including Boeing Model 747SR series airplanes in the Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) candidate fleet. This commenter states that the FAA's justification for including these airplanes was based upon the conversion of these airplanes from passenger operations to cargo operations, which the commenter alleges is incorrect. The commenter further states that the FAA needs to consider the inclusion of airplanes based upon maintenance requirements, especially airplanes that have been modified in accordance with supplemental type certificates (STC). The FAA does not concur. The FAA points out that it included certain Boeing Model 747SR series airplanes because these airplanes were no longer operated as Model 747SR series airplanes (at low gross weights and at reduced engine thrusts), not because they were converted from passenger operations to cargo operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since those airplanes are now operated similarly to other airplanes that are in the Boeing Model 747 SSID candidate fleet and that are operated as both freighter and passenger airplanes, the FAA has determined that they, too, should be included in the SSID candidate fleet. As noted above, the FAA considers many factors when selecting airplanes for inclusion into the candidate fleet, including age and service history of the airplane, which may be affected by modifications that were performed in accordance with STC's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since AD 86&hyph;19&hyph;01 requires structural inspections and repairs or replacements on certain Model 747&hyph;100SR series airplanes, a number of commenters request that AD 86&hyph;19&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;5395 (51 FR 29212, August 15, 1986), be revised to exclude Model 747SR series airplanes that are now included in this rulemaking action to avoid redundant requirements for inspection. One of these commenters requests that the requirement to inspect SSI's, required by AD 86&hyph;19&hyph;01, be exempt from the requirements of this AD. The FAA concurs. The FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD 86&hyph;19&hyph;01 to exclude Model 747&hyph;100SR series airplanes that have been included in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests an extension in the compliance time until such time that a review of the damage tolerance rating (DTR) check forms has been completed and a revised SSID has been issued. The FAA does not concur. To extend the compliance time for this action would be inappropriate, since the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists and that inspections must be conducted to ensure continued safety. Additional rulemaking may be considered, however, once the DTR check forms have been reviewed and incorporated into the revised SSID. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 128 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry and 8 U.S. operators will be affected by this AD. Incorporation of the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this AD, is estimated to necessitate 1,000 work hours (per operator) at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost to the 8 affected U.S. operators to incorporate the SSID program is estimated to be $440,000, or $55,000 per U.S. operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recurring inspections cost, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this AD, is estimated to be 1,275 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual recurring cost required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this AD, is estimated to be $6,100,875 for the affected U.S. fleet, or $70,125 per airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no new operators have been added by this AD, there will be no new costs associated with incorporating the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is now only the cost of the recurring inspections for these additional airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of required work hours for the recurring inspections in this AD, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' action. However, in actual practice, these actions, for the most part, will be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional work hours will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling will be minimal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

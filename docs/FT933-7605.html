			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Spare a thought for European non-smokers Dr M Singer should spare a thought for us European non-smokers who will not be returning to a country where smoking has been made almost unconstitutional (Letters, August 18 and 19). If a substantial majority of European residents are non-smokers, as statistics suggest, then the European tourist industry has a much bigger market to think about than Dr Singer suggests. Unfortunately, things move slowly and, while we are delighted to welcome Dr Singer back to our shores, US tourist dollars will probably not cause the changes required. The real changes to protect non-smokers will happen when that silent majority stands up and complains. Otherwise we will have to continue to rely on vocal US tourists and the one or two of us who are labelled as cranks. Far from being an American pleasure, as Dr R M Davis suggests, smoking can be described as the true Montezuma's revenge, given all the death and destruction it has caused. But come back to Europe soon, Dr Singer, European non-smokers need all the help we can get. Onesimo Alvarez-Moro, O'Donnell, 6, A-9-1, 28009 Madrid, Spain</p>

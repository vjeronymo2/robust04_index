			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Authorities offer no help as Nikkei falls below 20,000 Tokyo THE Nikkei average fell 3 per cent yesterday, closing below the critical 20,000 level for the first time since February 1987, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Small-lot profit-taking and arbitrage unwinding left the 225-issue average down 618.90 at 19,837.16, below the October 1990 low of 20,221.86. The index opened at the day's high of 20,442.53 and reached a low for the session of 19,790.16 in the afternoon. Volume dropped to 200m shares from Friday's 650m, the settlement day for March futures and options contracts. Declines led advances by 763 to 231, with 129 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated more slowly, but its fall of 19.14 to 1,444.86 left it at the lowest level since November 1986. The Topix has fallen for 10 consecutive trading days, the first time since March 1964. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased only 0.04 to 1,102.75. Small-lot selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment trust funds, which closed trading for the financial year yesterday, depressed share prices. Dealers said trading was not panicky and that share prices fell in an 'orderly fashion'. 'We weren't in a free fall,' said Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. However, Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said market conditions were 'very weak' as represented by the declines in the Topix index and other benchmark stock prices, pointing out that the fall in the Nikkei had lagged behind. Traders said sharp falls in illiquid component stocks in the Nikkei yesterday suggested that the index had been propped up by dealers in recent weeks. The authorities declined to support the market. On previous occasions of market weakness, the Ministry of Finance has tried to talk up the market, and the Bank of Japan has lowered short-term interest rates to add liquidity. Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said he was not considering steps to prop up the stock market, and Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, told a House of Councillors' committee that the economy was unlikely to slow much further, disappointing those who had expected a cut in the official discount rate. The top losers of the day included illiquid Nikkei components. Daito Woollen Spinning and Weaving fell Y210 to Y1,470 and Godo Shusei Y190 to Y1,740. Okamoto Industries, the condom maker which has been traded actively by short-term traders, retreated Y60 to Y1,270. The Tokyo Stock Exchange put the issue on its 'watch list' due to its volatility. Blue chips lost ground on selling by investment trusts. Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony fell by Y40 each, to Y1,240 and Y3,920 respectively. Banking shares were also weak, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to Y2,540 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y1,970. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 288.88 to 21,588.64 in volume of 160.8m shares. Roundup THE NIKKEI'S drop through 20,000 weighed on Pacific Rim markets. SEOUL was brought off the day's lows as the Market Stabilisation Fund spent Won30bn to support prices. The composite index lost 1.09 to 608.36. Turnover stood at Won171.3bn after Saturday's half-day Won146.1bn. The fund focused on heavily weighted issues such as Korea Electric Power and Pohang Iron &amp; Steel. HONG KONG lost ground on profit-taking following last week's gains. The Hang Seng index slipped 11.33 to 5,059.86 as turnover declined to HKDollars 2.53bn from HKDollars 3.56bn. HSBC and Cheung Kong dominated trade, with interest in Cheung Kong fuelled by expectations of good results being reported on March 26. NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a late rise in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index closed 6.80 higher at 1,458.18. Turnover fell to NZDollars 13.2m from NZDollars 16.1m. Telecom shares rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.36 and Fletcher Challenge 2 cents to NZDollars 3.45. Corporate Investments, a diversified trading company, declined 4 cents to 55 cents after reporting a loss of NZDollars 32.5m in its fiscal first half. TAIWAN finished lower in light trading on political uncertainty after the ruling Kuomintang failed to reach an agreement on how to choose the president. The weighted index relinquished 16.65 to 5,012.96 as turnover fell to TDollars 26.45bn from TDollars 34.03bn. AUSTRALIA surrendered early gains after the Japanese market dropped through 20,000. The All Ordinaries index ended a net 1.7 off at 1,586.7 after turnover of ADollars 143m (ADollars 161m). MANILA ended lower in uncertain trading as Philippine National Bank started an additional offer of 10.4m shares. The composite index dipped 16.02 to 1,106.61 as turnover shrank to 42m pesos from 336m. KUALA LUMPUR finished weaker in light trading. The composite index slipped 3.48 to 591.74 in turnover of MDollars 94.0m, after MDollars 92.0m. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index closed 1.1 per cent or 16.42 down at 1,449.66 in turnover of SDollars 83.1m, against SDollars 107.5m. NatSteel dropped 24 cents to SDollars 3.96 on heavy selling after announcing a 4 per cent cut in its steel bar prices. BANGKOK blamed uncertainty about Sunday's general election for a fall in the SET index of 13.30 to 792.29 in turnover of Bt4.98bn. Investors are uncertain whether reforms and policies adopted by the current government will be maintained after the election.</p>

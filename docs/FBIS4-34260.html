			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) --  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said he is very  optimistic about the way the peace talks in Oslo, between his  government and the guerrillas, are going. De Leon, who arrived  today in Cartagena de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit told EFE that "the discussion of the displaced persons is  being concluded." This issue was one of the biggest obstacles  in the past two months of talks in Mexico.    In Mexico, the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) discussed a solution for the  resettling of thousands of peasants who have fled the war torn  areas in northern Guatemala since 1960. The return of the  displaced persons was not agreed on during the talks in Mexico  because the government demanded a cease-fire in the area which  the rebels refused to accept if progress was not made in other  areas.    Ramiro de Leon, who was sworn in as president of Guatemala a  year ago following Jorge Serrano's foiled self-inflicted coup,  told EFE that he believes the talks in Norway are "positive" and  added that he is waiting for more news on the meeting.    The Oslo meeting was scheduled to discuss the creation of  the  Truth Commission which, as in the Salvadoran case, would  investigate crimes and human rights violations during the  conflict; however, the Guatemalan Government does not want to  advance on this issue until an agreement is reached on the  displaced persons.    The Guatemalan Government and the URNG began peace talks in  1991, but it was not until this year that they reached an  agreement regarding human rights and the drafting of a timetable  for negotiations that should end this year with the signing of a  peace agreement.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Bill to outlaw replacement of strikers fails A bill to outlaw the permanent replacement of striking workers was thrown out by the Senate yesterday, in a blow to US organised labour and the Clinton administration, Ken Warn reports from Washington. Backers of the bill failed by seven votes to muster sufficient support to overturn a Republican filibuster of the bill, meaning it is unlikely to be reintroduced this year. The legislation, a version of which was approved last year in the House, would have prevented companies from permanently replacing workers on strike for more pay. But employers would not have been prevented from using managers or temporary replacements to continue operations during a strike. The bill was opposed by US business. 'Senators understand this bill would have serious consequences for the economy and US competitiveness,' Mr Jeff Joseph, vice-president for domestic policy at the US Chamber of Commerce, said. Unions pushed for the change, and President Bill Clinton had promised to sign the bill if it passed Congress. Permanent replacement of strikers has been legal in the US since 1938. The issue became controversial in the 1980s.</p>

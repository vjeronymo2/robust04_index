			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> INSANITY PLEA IN STALKING ATTACK  </P> <P> A man who has acknowledged stalking a former Irvine high school classmate for  seven years, and then hitting her over the head with a baseball bat a year ago,  pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Friday to assault charges.  </P> <P> Steven Schumacher, 22, who was being treated at Patton State Hospital in San  Bernardino County until psychiatrists deemed him fit to stand trial a few  months ago, is to return to the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Myron S.  Brown on Oct. 3 for further legal hearings.  </P> <P> The defendant's lawyer said his client needs more help and counseling, not  imprisonment.  </P> <P> But 21-year-old Catherine Cline, who suffered a concussion and some hearing  loss when she was attacked by Schumacher while outside her Placentia home on  June, 19, 1989, wants him put away for the maximum term of seven years. She  said she worries he may still be obsessed with her.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, after hearing testimony about the case, Municipal Judge Margaret  R. Anderson concluded that Schumacher had a "fatal attraction" to Cline. The  judge ordered him to stand trial on the assault charges and refused to lower  his $150,000 bail. He remains in custody.  </P></p>

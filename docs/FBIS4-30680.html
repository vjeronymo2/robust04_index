			<p>BFN     [Text] In the first six months of this year, Vietnam's  economy has seen sound development. According to the Ministry  of Trade, in the multisectoral economy, state commerce remains a  key distributor of a number of essential items such as tin,  cement, and petrol. This has helped balance supply and demand.    In the period under review, Vietnam's export turnover was  1.6  billion U.S. dollar, an increase of 27 percent against the same  period last year, of which the turnover of rubber increased by  28 percent, coffee 29 percent, tea 21 percent, and coal 24  percent.    Meanwhile, Vietnam's import turnover in the last six months  was recorded at 1.7 billion U.S. dollar. The main imports were  those in service of production development and daily life such  as petrol and pesticide.    Thanks to the production development, Vietnam has exported  many items to foreign markets, including garment, crude oil,  rice, maritime products, and tea. By now, Vietnam's Ministry of  Trade has completed all necessary procedures to become an  observer of GATT. It has signed trade agreements with Laos,  Cambodia, and China and worked out plans for commercial  promotion inside and outside of Vietnam.</p>

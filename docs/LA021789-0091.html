			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WROLD  </P> <P> Lebanon's rival Christian militias agreed to halt fighting for the second time  in as many days. The militias issued separate statements in Beirut, saying they  had agreed to stop the battles and to meet today to discuss ways of healing  widening political rifts. This latest agreement, like the one the day before,  was mediated by the Maronite Christian church. At least six people were killed  and 20 wounded in the fresh fighting, security and hospital sources said, after  the two sides -- in defiance of that earlier truce -- began fighting with  artillery, mortars, rockets and machine guns in residential areas.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: ARTESIA;  </P> <P> CHURCH DENIED PERMIT TO BUILD ON RESIDENTIAL STREET  </P> <P> Citing concerns with traffic and noise, the City Council has denied a request  by the Danish Lutheran Church of Los Angeles to build a church in a residential  area of Artesia.  </P> <P> At its Monday meeting, the council voted 3 to 0 not to allow a  3,500-square-foot church and a 4,000-square-foot assembly hall to be  constructed at 11504 E. 178th St. Mayor Dennis Fellows was absent and  Councilman Ronald Oliver abstained from voting because his property is adjacent  to the site.  </P> <P> More than 100 people filled the council chamber during the meeting to hear  presentations by parishioners and residents.  </P> <P> The church wanted to relocate to escape rising gang violence and crime at its  current location in Los Angeles, according to documents filed with the city.  </P> <P> The new church was proposed on 1.4 acres donated by friends of the church, Andy  and June Andersen, who are longtime residents of Artesia.  </P></p>

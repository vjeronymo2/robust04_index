			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Increase in demand helps lift Japanese gas groups - Utilities Japan's leading gas companies lifted interim earnings, due to increased demand for hot water during an unusually cold summer, and the fall in fuel prices due to the appreciation of the yen. However, the companies are required to pass on the foreign exchange benefits to consumers during the second half, and are expecting lower annual profits. Tokyo Gas saw half-year non-consolidated pre-tax profits rise 211.2 per cent to Y14.4bn (Dollars 133m) on a 4.9 per cent rise in sales to Y367.9bn and an 82.8 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y7.5bn. Demand for gas rose 6.2 per cent to Y270.7bn. Household gas sales rose 6.2 per cent in volume, while industrial gas sales rose 21 per cent. Fuel costs fell 3.8 per cent to Y54.8bn, due to the rise in the yen from Y127.60 against the dollar to Y107.74. The company also saw a 3.8 per cent decline in administrative costs to Y40.6bn. For the full year to March, Tokyo Gas expects a 2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y35bn on a 3.3 per cent rise in sales to Y813bn. The company forecasts a Y1.7bn rise in its deficit of financial items, and plans annual capital spending of Y157.6bn against depreciation of Y100bn. Osaka Gas posted a 51.9 per cent rise in interim unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y10.9bn on a 3.1 per cent increase in sales to Y286.2bn. After-tax profits advanced 15.5 per cent to Y5.7bn. The company said a worsened balance of financial items limited the rise in pre-tax profits. Overall gas sales increased 7.3 per cent in volume. For the full year to March, the company expects a 1.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y35bn and a 1.7 per cent rise in sales to Y636bn. Capital spending for the year is expected to total Y111.9bn, down 4.2 per cent from the previous year.</p>

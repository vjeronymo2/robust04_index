			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE WANTS SCULLY TO BE VINDICATED  </P> <P> Dan York of Laguna Hills (Viewpoint, April 21) could not possibly be talking  about the Vin Scully I and many others grew up with.  </P> <P> Although he has been often honored, I think that many still take Scully for  granted.  </P> <P> It is not enough to say that he is the best baseball broadcaster who ever sat  behind the plate. Those of us who have lived with the company of Dodger radio  broadcasts, while doing homework, driving in rush-hour traffic or just  daydreaming at the beach, know how Vin Scully has touched our lives.  </P> <P> Please, Vin, don't ever stop describing that high drive to deep left field. I  still want to hear about Davis going back, awaaaay back, to the wall. And for  as long as you can, I want you to tell me it's gone.  </P> <P> GARY N. STERN  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

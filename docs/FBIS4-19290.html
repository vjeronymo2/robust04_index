			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Padraic Flanagan, PRESS ASSOCIATION news correspondent] </F>   [Text] Two British officers were feared to be among those  who died when U.S. jets shot down two UN helicopters above  northern Iraq, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today.    Mr Rifkind, who offered his condolences to the men's  relatives, told the Radio Four PM programme: "Clearly it is a  matter of great tragedy. Great sympathy is extended to them."    Mr Rifkind, speaking during an official visit to the United  States, said: "We know that these people have lost their lives  carrying out their duty in a very difficult situation. I  believe it's appropriate that we should all therefore wish to  pay tribute to them."    The Ministry of Defence [MoD] in London said it was still  seeking details about the British casualties. More than 20  people are believed to have been aboard the two helicopters.    The MoD was refusing to release the names of the dead  personnel until next of kin were informed. One report said the  Britons were a colonel and a major.    The servicemen were part of the British contingent making up  a defence coalition with the United States and France set up to  protect Kurds in northern Iraq. A MoD spokesman said: "We have  been in the area since the Gulf war. We're there with our  allies providing a degree of safety for the Kurdish people. The  no-fly zone was imposed to give the Kurds in the area practical  protection."    He declined to comment on the numbers of British forces  personnel serving in the area.</p>

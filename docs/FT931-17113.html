			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Living with the past AS THE western powers struggle to redefine their international roles in the post-cold war political climate, the markets confront an equally difficult, if less newsworthy, set of adjustments. The case for optimism, at the start of a year that will see no more than sickly economic growth in the developed world, is that some of the building blocks of a sounder economic and financial order are in place - not least a pattern of capital flows that begins to make global sense. In the 1980s the world's creditor countries recycled disproportionate sums to the United States, thereby diverting capital from potentially higher returns in the developing world. Today, in contrast, Latin America is once again emerging as a capital importer, after a decade in which its economies were throttled by debt and bad policy. Direct inward investment into China is contributing to such dramatic double-digit growth rates that there is a real, and awesome, possibility that China might become the world's largest economy within a matter of decades. Meanwhile the dragon economies of Asia are hosting some of the world's biggest infrastructure projects, as well as playing their traditional game of export-led growth. Policy mistakes The snag is that the markets of the developed world are still scarred by the policy mistakes and exchange rate disequilibria of an earlier period. Conventional wisdom has it that the United States will lead the world out of recession, but more slowly than in previous economic cycles. With the private sector constrained by debt, the banking system fragile and fiscal policy less expansionary than it looks because of the debt interest burden and the cost of bank bale-outs, it is hard to quarrel with that verdict. The US is in no position, this time, to act as a locomotive for the world. Nor is it easy to be optimistic about Europe, where German unification has resulted in a policy mix comparable with Reaganomics and an outcome that is arguably more damaging. The German combination of loose fiscal and tight monetary policy imparted a powerful deflationary impetus to the rest of Europe via the rigid framework of the ERM. Having voluntarily sacrificed their monetary sovereignty, the larger member countries of the ERM then felt obliged to follow Germany in relaxing fiscal policy. As a result, Europe is now a capital importer, which slightly mars the more attractive picture of capital flows painted earlier; and the fiscal legacy of the ERM period raises questions about the ability of equities to resist the gravitational pull of any rise in long bond yields, especially in those countries that have improved their prospects for recovery by leaving the ERM. Tide over For Britain, where the public sector borrowing requirement threatens to top Pounds 50bn, compared with an annual institutional cash flow of just under Pounds 40bn, the question is acute. Yet despite fears of funding crises ahead, long gilt yields have not risen since sterling left the ERM. This suggests, first, that the markets do not expect the one-off rise in import prices after devaluation to leave an early mark on wage settlements. Perhaps, too, that inflation is assumed to be moderating at such a pace that the gilt market offers sufficiently high real returns to persuade international capital to tide the government over until growth permits a significant reduction in the PSBR. Even so, UK equities are moving into more contentious territory. And there are still plenty of areas of instability around the globe. The currency markets have unfinished business in the ERM, where the French franc continues to be vulnerable. Japan, the only significant creditor country remaining, is in the throes of a banking crisis; its equity market persists in staying overvalued chiefly thanks to the manipulation of public sector pension funds. And there is a worryingly small flow of capital into the former communist bloc, which underlines the geopolitical, as well as the economic and financial risks, with which the markets must live. There are limits to what capital can achieve in the absence of political leadership. With Mr Clinton in the White House, leadership has another chance. Let us hope, in 1993, that the chance is grasped.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Group seeks consensus on bus plan Sir, Your article on London First and bus deregulation ('Business group attacks plan to deregulate London's buses', August 9) is misleading in that the paper to which it refers does not attack or, for that matter, support deregulation. As stated in the paper's introduction, its aim is to build a consensus around a number of practical proposals to ensure deregulation capitalises on the significant improvements achieved in recent years. We aim to work in partnership with others to achieve continuing improvements in London. Peter Foy, chairman, Transport Steering Group, London First, 5 Cleveland Place, London SW1Y 6JJ</p>

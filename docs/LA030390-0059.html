			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAN THE REAL EVAN COME OUT AND PLAY?  </P> <P> Who untied (Single Life Columnist) Evan Cummings?  </P> <P> Her columns are always interesting, but lately she is fantastic.  </P> <P> Her (Jan. 19) column about the book showing older men how to date younger women  was great, and now, this!  </P> <P> (Re: the Feb. 23 column) I was hysterical relating to seeing an old flame who  dumped me -- how many times I have fantasized he would call; he hasn't yet, but  someday he will. And then. . . .  </P> <P> Everybody at the office, men and women both loved it. Everybody read it and we  passed it along and put it on the bulletin board.  </P> <P> If this is the "real" Evan, please let her come out and "play" more often.  She's terrific!  </P> <P> Darlene Gillespie,  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

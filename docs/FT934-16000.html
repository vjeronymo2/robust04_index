			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / New classification for companies in FT-SE indices A COMPREHENSIVE review of the companies and sectors which make up the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices has been undertaken for the first time since 1970. As a result 303 companies have been reclassified and a number of new economic groups, industry sectors and sub-sectors created. The new system will take effect from January 4 next year, replacing two existing classification methods, the FT-Actuaries and Stock Exchange indices. Mr Nicholas Fitzpatrick, a partner of Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, who chaired the classification committee for the new model, said the system was universally accepted by fund managers. He said it was intended to provide a service to investors by grouping companies together in homogeneous industry sectors and sub-sectors. Companies were informed of their new classifications by letter yesterday. RTZ, Rank Organisation and Inchcape, three large companies thought to be unhappy about the new sectors to which they have been assigned, each said they were considering the implications of their moves. The review takes account of the decline in the UK's industrial base, the growth of service industries and the birth of a utilities group as a result of the government's privatisation programme. For the first time, the ground rules on which classification decisions are made have been published. Companies are placed within sub-sectors on the basis of the derivation of their published, audited profits. The rules say 'no changes in industry classification will be made on the basis of promises of action or assertions by directors'. Conglomerates have been defined as companies with at least three distinct activities, none accounting for more than 50 per cent of profits, and each contributing more than 10 per cent. Mr Fitzpatrick said the committee had 'at last found a way of getting BTR and Hanson in the same pot'. All 2,375 listed and USM-quoted companies have been pigeonholed. Companies have until October 31 to appeal if they feel mis-classified, and appeals will be heard in November. After that changes will be considered quarterly. Once the final list has been produced, histories of sector performance will be back-dated to 1985. The system has three tiers: Seven economic groups, which replace the six existing groups. Out goes 'capital goods', which had been shrinking as a proportion of the total. New groups include 'mineral extraction' and 'utilities'; 40 instead of 35 sectors. Health and household and oil and gas, which had become large sectors, are each divided into three. Others have been merged, some have disappeared, and some been created: to be reviewed annually; 76 rather than 77 sub-sectors, with 18 new sub-sectors and 38 renamed sub-sectors.

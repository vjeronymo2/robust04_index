			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 15 KILLED IN MEXICO BUS PLUNGE  </P> <P> Fifteen people were killed and 26 injured when a city bus overturned on a  winding stretch of road and plunged down a 60-foot cliff, authorities said  today.  </P> <P> The accident occurred Monday about four miles from downtown on a curved, steep  portion of road near the Valle Verde neighborhood on the outskirts of this Baja  California resort, Fire Department officials said. A spokesman for the  department said bus driver Enrique Hernandez de Jesus apparently lost control  of the vehicle while trying to negotiate the curve. One surviving passenger  told investigators that the bus driver said, "Hang on tight, I have no brakes,"  moments before the bus slid over the cliff.  </P></p>

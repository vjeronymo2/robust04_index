			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Opposition in Belorussia </F> [Belarus] Demands that Criminal Proceedings Be Instituted  against Prime Minister"]    [Text] Minsk -- Belorussian [Belarusian] officials are  continuing to keep your IZVESTIYA correspondent from performing  his professional duty. Vasiliy Vorobyev, chief of the  Belorussian Supreme Soviet Information Department, refused me  the right to attend a press conference given by the  parliamentary opposition.    The day before I had received an invitation from the press  conference organizers to attend this event. However, my name  did not appear on the list of journalists allowed entry to the  Supreme Soviet to take part in the press conference. Mr.  Vorobyev, who had signed this document, stated during a  telephone conversation that he would not allow me to attend the  meeting with representatives of the opposition. Clearly, the  chief of the Information Department had learned how to divide  journalists into "clean" and "unclean" back when he worked as an  instructor of the Minsk party city committee. But people's  deputies had a different opinion on this score: Thanks to them,  IZVESTIYA was represented at the press conference.    Its main theme was the signing by Prime Minister Vyachaslaw  Kebich of the agreement on the unification of the currency  systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]. Opposition deputies  managed to obtain the text of the agreement only via Moscow: On  various pretexts government officials here refused to provide  parliamentarians with the document. It turned out that by  signing his name to it Kebich had violated four articles of the  new Belorussian Constitution simultaneously (or at least, that  is what opposition members think). A group of deputies  belonging to the Belorussian People's Front prepared an appeal  to Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and Vasiliy  Sholodonov, the prosecutor general, demanding that the prime  minister be called to account under article 61 of the  Belorussian Criminal Code (treason against the state).  Opposition leader Zyanon Paznyak assessed this as a unique  situation in Belorussia's recent past when a government  surrenders its country's sovereignty in violation of the  constitution.    It was not hard to predict the opposition's viewpoint on  this  question. At the moment it is not entirely clear how  Belorussian Supreme Soviet will qualify the premier's actions.  To your IZVESTIYA correspondent's question of whether the  republic's Fundamental Law tallies with the agreement on the  unification of currency systems, Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of  the parliamentary legislation commission, replied laconically:  "Hardly." Mr. Bulakhov refrained from further comment since he  did not have the text of the documents signed in Moscow.  According to him, not one member of the Supreme Soviet  Presidium had the agreement in his hands on Friday.    At the press conference one of the articles of the agreement  was cited which says that on the day that the document goes into  force, the Central Bank of Russia will have the right and powers  of the sole money issuing center. According to Article 145 of  the Belorussian Constitution, the republic's National Bank has  the exclusive right of money emission. This discrepancy  automatically entails a violation of Article 8 of the  Fundamental Law, which bans the conclusion of international  treaties, which contravene the Constitution. Everyone is now  deciding for himself just how far Kebich observed Article 1 of  the Constitution, which says that the Republic of Belorussia  shall defend its independence and pursue its domestic and  foreign policy autonomously.    The prime minister has indirectly acknowledged his guilt in  public. At a press conference, Kebich, brandishing a copy of  IZVESTIYA containing Mikhail Berger's article "Belorussia Has  Exchanged Part of Its Sovereignty for the Russian Ruble,"  rejected the accusations of bartering away independence. But at  the same time he remarked that alterations to the Republic's  Constitution are needed in order to legalize the Moscow accords.  In turn, opposition deputies told journalists that they had  asked the prime minister this question: How could he sign an  agreement knowing that it did not correspond to the  Constitution? To which Vyachaslaw Frantsavich gave a highly  original reply: He told the oppositionists that he was unaware  of the existence of Article 8 of the Fundamental Law.    The irony of fate is that Kebich was one of the people most  interested in the very speedy adoption of that Constitution,  which was successfully steered through parliament with the help  of some dubious legal procedures. The prime minister is hardly  threatened with sanctions from law enforcement organs that are  under the full control of his own entourage. But there are two  far more serious problems here:    First, the legislature is showing an extreme degree of  restraint when giving political assessments of the Moscow  accords. Mechyslaw Hryb has stated that he does not support the  idea of making alterations to the recently adopted Constitution.  There is nothing surprising about that IZVESTIYA has already  written about the differences of opinion between Kebich and  Hryb, which began immediately after the election of the last  chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Now, when the prime minister  has embarked upon a fairly dangerous path, the speaker has been  given his only chance of competing with him in the presidential  elections. Whether Hryb will make use of that opportunity will  depend largely on the political alignment before the elections.    Moreover, the making alterations to the new Belorussian  Constitution is no easy process. For that to happen the Supreme  Soviet must twice discuss and approve the alterations over a  period of at least three months. But in the six months before  the deputies' powers lapse they do not have the right to revise  the Fundamental Law. It is hard to say how much longer this  Supreme Soviet has left since it has promised the voters early  parliamentary elections in March 1994. But even if it lasts the  full course (March 1995) there is only just enough time left.    But it has even less time left before the elections. Because  the prime minister's promises about universal prosperity  resulting from the unification of the currency systems have  begun to pall a little even on his admirers. Thus on the eve of  the extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet, scheduled to  begin on 27 April, ways of circumventing the constitution are  urgently being sought. Ivan Antonovich, a former secretary of  the Russian Communist Party Central Committee, proposed in a  speech on Belorussian television that instead of alterations  [izmeneniye] to the constitution an amendment [popravka] to it  should be adopted. The aim is clear -- to simplify as much as  possible the process of adjusting the Fundamental Law to meet  the needs of the government. But from the legal viewpoint,  Antonovich's idea is absurd: The Constitution allows  alterations to be made to it but there is no mention of the word  "amendment" at all.    The appearance on air of odious individuals such as Ivan  Antonovich -- people left on the margins of Russian politics but  who have been taken up by the Belorussian Government -- has  become a lamentable tradition on Belorussian state television  now. At first Antonovich was made rector of the Academy of  Administration under the Council of Ministers, then director of  a scientific research institute. If only matters had ended with  Antonovich and his ilk expressing their viewpoint on this event  or that.... But no, Russian democrats are regularly reviled on  state television and direct insults are hurled at the Russian  president and his team.</p>

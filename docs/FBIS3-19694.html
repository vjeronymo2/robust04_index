			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann </F> by Adelbert Reif; place and date not given: "Army of Skeptics"]    [Text] [Reif] According to the Bundestag's defense  commissioner, the Bundeswehr is in a desolate state.    [Naumann] First of all, the recent defense commissioner's  report is, as he has himself repeatedly emphasized, a report  that shows up deficiencies rather than a report on the state of  the Bundeswehr. If you asked any number of commanders of all  sections of the armed forces whether what the report of the  defense commissioner describes reflects the general state of the  Bundeswehr, then -- I dare predict -- they would all clearly  answer with no. The reportage on the report, but not the report  itself, has drawn up a picture that does not reflect the reality  of the armed forces and does not do justice to the efforts of  most soldiers who do a respectable job with a great sense of  responsibility albeit -- admittedly -- under difficult  conditions. By and large, the picture of the forces is more  differentiated than could be presented by a compilation of  deficiencies that are certainly indisputable.    [Reif] So it is all a misunderstanding?    [Naumann] We have to be grateful for the defense  commissioner's report to put the finger into a wound that has  been hurting us for a long time: It shows up the incongruity of  insufficient funds and a permanently widening range of tasks  with which we have to struggle. In the parliamentary debates on  the 1994 defense budget we warned of the danger of sustained  problems if we received insufficient funds for training,  exercises, and the use of ammunition. Therefore, the Bundestag  Budget Committee arrived at the conclusion that no further cuts  are tolerable at the level of the Bundeswehr. That our budget  was, nevertheless, cut by another 1.25 billion German marks will  make it even more difficult in 1994 to provide challenging  training conditions.    [Reif] Are you trying to say that the Bundeswehr's  assignment will be challenged by the dramatic cuts?    [Naumann] The whole range of assignments cannot be met on  the basis of the funds that we have been allocated. If one  wants a Bundeswehr with a peace strength of 370,000 men and  which has more than 150,000 civilian employees, that achieves a  limited operational capability with all sectors of the armed  forces, has modern equipment, and is stationed in a way that  maintains our alliance capability and covers our entire federal  territory, then it will be inevitable to increase the funds for  the Bundeswehr. If, however, in view of our country's current  financial situation it turns out to be impossible to implement  such an increase, then the politicians must permit us to judge  which of the above-mentioned parameters have to be regarded as  being of secondary importance against the background of the  Bundeswehr's assignment.    [Reif] The defense commissioner has described the Bundeswehr  as consisting of men all of whom are skeptical of themselves.    [Naumann] In my opinion it would be wrong to say that all  Bundeswehr members are skeptical of themselves. The Bundeswehr  is familiar with its assignment, and it has shown it, whether in  Somalia, in Cambodia, in the Adriatic, or elsewhere. There can  be no doubt that some soldiers have doubts about themselves. We  must not forget that for 35 years the Bundeswehr had a clearly  defined -- I would say one-dimensional -- assignment, namely the  defense of our country in border-near forward defense along with  our allies. This assignment was deeply anchored in the  awareness of our officers and noncommissioned officers, and we  were profoundly prepared for it. Regardless of the level of  command and control, everybody knew how successful defense had  to be carried out. Our way of thinking was determined by  defense planning that was consistent with the critical security  realities of the FRG. Today we no longer have such simple  quantities for orientation.    [Reif] There are plans for joint maneuvers by Germans,  French, and Poles still this year. German soldiers should even  participate in joint exercises in Poland. Is the time ripe for  it yet?    [Naumann] I am of the view that we have the chance to  continue the process of reconciliation with Poland more  intensively. After all, German-Polish history must not be  reduced to the 12 gloomy years in German history. It is more,  because the chain of conflicts between Germans and Poles dates  back to the early Dark Ages. If both peoples, who now live  within safe and mutually recognized borders, have the  opportunity to create a peaceful future together, then they have  to make use of this opportunity. The soldiers of both nations  should play a significant role in it. If, for example through  joint exercises, we indicate that we want to protect peace  together, then this can help to promote the process of  reconciliation through getting to know one another.    We will probably very soon enter into close relations of  partnership, and maybe even sponsorship with other, immediate  neighbors, such as the Czechs, but also with our neutral  neighbors, should they so wish. Only a few days ago we  discussed with the Russian defense minister the possibility of  German soldiers holding an exercise on Russian soil in 1995 and,  in return, Russian soldiers participating in joint exercises in  Germany in 1996. One objective of such exercises is the  preparation of joint missions within the framework of the United  Nations.</p>

The author of the article says:    His puppet regime is a more truculent, anti-democratic  fascist dictatorial one than any of the successive military  dictatorial regimes.    Though the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is wearing the  "civilian" veil, it is, in actuality, relentlessly challenging  the South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy and  reunification with its cruel fascist repressive rule as the  successive military dictators did.    It, first of all, has kept intact all the fascist legal and  institutional ruling systems of the preceding military fascist  dictatorial regimes, enhanced their function and drastically  reinforced them.    The "civilian" fascists are harshly suppressing the  patriotic  forces calling for independence and democracy in South Korea and  for national reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique ruthlessly cracked down with  a 100,000-strong police force on the struggle of the popular  masses urging the investigation into the Kwangju massacre,  punishment of the murderers and establishment of a genuine  democratic government, which was waged on the lapse of 13 years  since the Kwangju popular uprising.    The theaters of the students' struggle have been stained  with  blood and many core elements of the youth arrested, in South  Korea.    The fascist clique brutally suppressed the people's struggle  for vital rights by invoking the "government" power, calling it  "collective egoism." It set in motion even the notorious  "emergency arbitration power" invented in the period of the  "Yusin" dictatorship. It is now mobilizing all the puppet  police to check the struggle of the peasants and other people  against its treacherous opening of the domestic rice market.    It is the traitor Kim Yong-sam and his "civilian" regime  that  would not hesitate to slay all the South Korean people, if it is  for gratifying his greed for power and maintaining the fascist  regime, regarding all the forces obstructive to it as the target  of suppression.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime prolonging its days in  reliance on the fascist bayonets, estranged from the people,  must be removed in time.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Televisa joins bid for US TV network TELEVISA, Mexico's privately-owned television company, has joined up with a group of investors in a bid to buy Univision, the main Spanish-language television network in the US. The group, headed by California businessman Mr Jerrold Perenchio, hopes to acquire Univision Holdings for Dollars 550m from Hallmark Cards. Univision reported earnings of more than Dollars 200m last year. Miami-based Univision reaches almost 90 per cent of US Hispanic television households via cable and satellite broadcasts. The transaction includes nine full-power Spanish-language television stations. Televisa is expected to put up Dollars 50m to acquire a 12 per cent stake in Univision's television stations and 25 per cent of the network. This move is seen as an attempt to strengthen its presence in broadcasting north of the border. In 1986, the company was forced to sell its profitable Spanish language network of 12 television stations after the US Federal Communications Commission accused it of controlling the stations in violation of foreign ownership laws, which allow only a 20 per cent foreign interest in US stations. Televisa's television stations formed the basis of the Univision system, so if this new deal goes through, the company will recover ground lost after the 1986 sale. Venevision, a Venezuelan broadcasting company, is also part of the investment group bidding for Univision.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (12): Ambivalence rules in the UK  -The progress of business ethics ACROSS THE business schools of Britain, small lights illuminating the presence of classrooms teaching ethics are beginning to glimmer. Their beams so far remain very faint. Business ethics is beginning to appear in the curriculum. It has grown from a strong base in the US into a topic being taken seriously on campuses elsewhere around the world. There is now a European Business Ethics Network of academics and practitioners, and a fledgling journal, counterbalancing the much more substantial literature being generated in North America. Recent corporate scandals, not least the fracas between British Airways and Virgin, have served to highlight the need to take the subject seriously. But it is ironic that it is the business sector - which has been behaving in ways ethically questionable - which has begun to address the matter of how acceptable such behaviour is, and to make amends. Academia might have been expected to have taken a lead, launching courses and raising questions in the classroom. In fact, much of the impetus seems to have come from business. A growing number of companies' annual reports make references to corporate governance. An analysis by the Institute of Business Ethics last summer showed that nearly 30 per cent of large companies have a written ethical code, covering topics such as relations with employees and customers, and sexual harassment. Even in teaching, some companies have seized the initiative by launching their own internal sessions to consider the subject. For example, Mr John Drummond of Integrity Works, a London-based consultancy on ethical matters, has just completed work with National Westminster Bank to develop an ethical code and a series of associated procedures for the bank in consultation with its employees. But perhaps most significantly, the last few months have seen the creation of no fewer than three academic chairs in the subject, all at the instigation of companies. For example, in April 1992 Drake Beam Morin (DBM), the out-placement consultants, funded a chair in corporate governance at Leeds University, now occupied by Mr Thomas Clarke. Then the Co-Operative Bank announced the creation, with its support, of a chair of corporate responsibility at Manchester Business School, to which Mr Brian Harvey has been appointed. And Dixons, the electrical retailer, donated Pounds 1m last July to the London Business School, to establish a chair of business ethics and social responsibility. Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, says: 'You started wondering, as you watched the attitudes being formed in the 1980s, can this be right? There were too many two-dimensional, cardboard people, worried only about themselves and acquisitions. Intelligence said this can't be enough.' He sees the need for serious study of the topic. 'A lot of people reject the concept of ethics and talk instead about integrity. This is a philistine approach. I come from the integrity school. But I realised that was just using words. It's no good taking your own standards of integrity and assuming everyone in your organisation shares them.' In spite of these business gestures in the direction of change, the response from academia remains muted. There is no sign yet of an appointment to the London Business School post - which partly reflects the lack of suitable candidates for such a position in the UK. There is still considerable ambivalence about teaching the subject, let alone how it should be taught: as an integrated topic or a separate module. In fact, Mr Kalms says he first offered the money to the economics department at the London School of Economics - but it rejected the donation, arguing that such a subject properly belonged in the philosophy department. That attitude is strongly rejected by the small new breed of business school ethics faculty. 'It's very important to build the ethical dimensions into each subject and not isolate with some semi-cleric delivering sermons on the side,' says Mr Clarke from Leeds. He says the philosophy department is working with the business school to develop an MA course in business policy and ethics, designed for 'the cerebral, reflective manager.' But he concedes: 'You'd be hard put to find a business ethics course in the UK at the moment. It's a guest lecture thing. I feel it will move from an optional extra on MBA courses to part of a corporate responsibility core subject. We will begin slowly to emulate what's happening in the US.' He argues that during the 1980s, business schools over-enthusiastically threw out subjects such as sociology from their curricula. A contrary mood is only now developing. One example is at the Cranfield Institute of Technology. Mr Shai Vyakarnam, a lecturer, says his optional course on ethics in business decisions has attracted 21 of the school's 160 MBA students this year. Recognition of the current dearth of courses is widespread, matched only by a modest optimism for the future. 'Trickle is the right word,' says Mr Rob Gray, head of the accounting and business finance department at the University of Dundee. 'But it is the issue of the future.' Mr Harvey from Manchester Business School says: 'Everybody is nibbling away at it. My feeling is that they haven't got very far.' (That includes his own department which, he says, has yet to offer business ethics as an option.) But he sees demand growing for the topic, with particular interest from executives in 'how to manage to maintain a grip on the corporate ethos and brand when you have empowered managers focused on the bottom line.' Business has clearly thrown down the gauntlet in the courts of academia.</p>

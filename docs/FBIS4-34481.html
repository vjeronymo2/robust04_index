			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By PRENSA LATINA contributor Carlos Fazio: "Ten Years of </F> Baena Soares in the OAS"]    [Text] OAS Secretary General and Brazilian diplomat Joao  Baena Soares will leave his post next 20 June. Trinidadian  Christopher Thomas will temporarily replace him and pass it over  to Cesar Gaviria, the new official elected to this post, in  September, when Gaviria will conclude his term as Colombian  president.    Baena Soares headed the OAS -- known as the "ministry of  U.S.  colonies," at one time, due to its acceptance of  Washington-sponsored military dictatorships and condoning of  U.S. invasions in the region -- for 10 years.    A cursory assessment of his work as head of the OAS must  inevitably consider the international scope. In the period of  1984 to 1994, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the  disintegration of the Socialist bloc, and the death rattles of  the Cold War all led to a new international disorder, which  dealt pluralism a fatal blow and has kept the United Nations,  the highest international forum, mired in a crisis of  credibility.    Within that context, the virtual vanishing of the East-West  division (communism versus capitalism) under the ruins of the  Berlin Wall gave Washington the opportunity to revive its  ancestral crusade against "Soviet expansionism" in Latin America  and allowed the OAS the possibility to get rid of the  traditional U.S. hegemony while heading toward a genuine  ideological pluralism based on noninterference and  self-determination guided by the principles in its charter.    We can categorically say Baena Soares did not achieve that  goal, but, obviously, that is not his responsibility. The OAS  was facing a crisis of its own when Baena Soares came to the OAS  10 years ago. For instance, memories of the 1983 Falkland  Islands War were still fresh, and this war unveiled the U.S.  double game of proclaiming the defense of the Americas from  foreign aggressions and finally buried the Inter-American  Reciprocal Assistance Treaty [TIAR], because the United States  sided with Great Britain against Argentina. In addition, the  United States also invaded Grenada in 1983.    The Contadora Group (Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and  Venezuela)  was created in 1983 to seek a negotiated solution to the Central  American conflict due to the virtual standstill in the OAS  vis-a-vis a crisis in which the United States was directly  involved.    In addition to the backwardness of pluralistic diplomacy and  the powder keg of Central America (the covert CIA war against  Sandinism in Nicaragua, the transformation of Honduras into the  Pentagon's aircraft carrier on land, and Washington's direct  involvement in the Salvadoran civil war), we must mention  another key event of that period: the crisis triggered by the  Latin American foreign debt, which reached huge proportions.    To mark the moment in which Baena Soares assumed his post as  OAS secretary general, we must mention the transfer of over $132  billion in capital from Latin America to the industrialized  world during the period of 1981 to 1986. Paradoxically, the  region, as a net exporter of financial resources, directly  promoted the growth of certain industrialized economies.    All these circumstances, regulated by a search for genuine  solutions, distinctly Latin American, to deep-rooted problems,  marked the hegemonic crises of the State Department and the  Pentagon in the region.    Historically, the OAS and TIAR had been U.S. diplomatic  mechanisms in its ideological campaign against the Soviet Union,  "the evil empire." Washington made use of these two  organizations during the Cold War so that the Latin American  countries would legitimize the U.S. hegemonic endeavors.  Washington actually established a perverse relation based on a  bipolar structure. Inter-Americanism (the old Monroe Doctrine,  the basis of the prevailing Pan-Americanism during the latter  part of the 19th century) became the best defense of the bulwark  of the "free world" (America) against "Soviet communism."    That ideological scheme of domination came to an end during  the mid-1980's, and certain Latin American countries, including  Mexico, began to design new formulas for consensus and dialogue.  These formulas were alternatives to Washington's favorite  sophism, according to which force is the only mechanism to  resolve differences among countries.    The Contadora Group expanded in 1986 and became known as the  Group of Eight [G-8]. The G-8 started its discussions as the UN  Latin American Regional Group (GRULA). It began as a Latin  American commonwealth, but was reduced, by war, to a democratic  partnership of eight countries and the supporting nations due to  the Mexican theory that preached gradual change.    The Cartagena Consensus group and new integrationist ideals  began to surface at that same time. These groups all seemed to  converge, although there were differences, and strategically  directed their efforts toward the creation of a community of  Latin American nations.    The OAS appeared within this framework as a forum for  North-South hemispheric dialogue; that is, a forum for dialogue  between the United States and Latin America. In addition, Cuba,  to what was then outlined with great caution, could be included  again in the community of Latin American nations.    With the 1959 victory of the revolution, Cuba became a  problem of "national security" for the United States. The early  definition of the socialist character of the revolution led the  White House to label Cuba as a "totalitarian" regime at the  service of the USSR and, therefore, a "threat" to the  hemisphere. In addition, Cuba was accused of "exporting" the  revolution.    Under the OAS umbrella, Washington distanced Cuba from the  hemispheric scenario. Its expulsion from the OAS in 1962  prompted the joint, except for Mexico, breaking off of  diplomatic relations in 1964 in the name of democracy and was  based on the "incompatibility" of a Marxist-Leninist government  like Fidel Castro's. Thus, Cuba became isolated from the "big  Latin American family."    Nevertheless, 23 years later (1987) the United States  watched  with surprise and annoyance the "formal" resurgence of  revolutionary Cuba in the subhemisphere when a possible and  gradual reinsertion into the OAS was proposed at the G-8  presidents meeting in Acapulco. The initiative was presented  with calls for a "detailed revision" of the OAS. Until then,  the OAS was seen as a pluralist system, free of any ideological  discrimination and with reciprocal respect for the forms of  government each member nation had decided upon within its  exercise of self-determination.    Baena Soares' biggest merit, during this entire process of  change, was not to shun direct involvement as an organization.  In this manner, the OAS participated in the Second Esquipulas  Agreement, and Baena Soares personally, together with his UN  colleague, Javier Perez de Cuellar, integrated the International  Commission of Verification and Follow-up. Subsequently, he was  an honorary witness to the conversations between the Nicaraguan  Government and the contras in Sapoa.    Likewise, and since the first Ibero-American Summit in  Guadalajara (1991), Baena Soares has been integrated into this  Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese forum.    As [Spanish writer] Leopoldo Zea once said, under Baena  Soares's administration, the OAS experienced an era of "Latin  Americanization."    During this last period, one must mention the internal OAS  dispute regarding militarization of the organization, as  fostered by the Pentagon, in the name of "Hemispheric security,"  given the fall of the TIAR and the JID [Inter-American Defense  Board.]    The "new OAS" hailed today is a venue by which Washington  aims to legally test the controversial theory of "limited  sovereignty," "humanitarian intervention," and "preventive  democracy," although Somalia was a guinea pig. Because of this,  certain amendments have been made to the bylaws of the  organization.    Under the sponsorship of Argentina (as official spokesperson  of the White House) and with only the opposition of Mexico, a  reform to the 1993-approved bylaws in Managua permits the  "suspension" of any member nation that strays from the rules  considered democratic. This reform leaves a question mark on the  future validity of the principles of the peoples' right to  sovereignty and self-determination. That will be the package  left for Baena Soares' successor, Cesar Gaviria.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans has raised  the question in Hanoi of the return of 375 refugees from the  Netherlands who have been refused political asylum, but has yet  to conclude an agreement with the Vietnamese Government.    The refugees came from the former Czechoslovakia where they  were sent as guest workers, but were not granted residence  permits in the Netherlands as The Hague does not believe they  are in any danger if they return to their home country. The  Netherlands Parliament has asked the government for watertight  legal guarantees that the Vietnamese will not encounter problems  on their return, but the Foreign Ministry reports that  preparations for the signing of a treaty are taking longer in  order to obtain these guarantees. The IOM [International  Organization of Migration] is also seeking to achieve better  arrangements with the Vietnamese Government because the return  of the Vietnamese who have been in the Netherlands since 1991  could serve as a precedent. A further 10,000 refugees, mainly  from Asia, must also return to their home country.    If any mistakes are made in returning the refugees on this  occasion or if any uncertainties remain this could work against  the return of all those who are to follow. This is why the IOM  will only participate in the return and supervise the  resettlement once all the arrangements have been completed and  laid down in an agreement signed between the Netherlands and  Vietnam.    Most importantly, the Netherlands is seeking clarification  regarding the position of Vietnamese who do not want to return  to Vietnam. The Justice Ministry has made 1 million guilders  available for resettlement. During the meeting with his  Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam, Kooijmans reminded  Vietnam of its international obligations to accept returning  nationals as a member of the United Nations. He urged the  Vietnamese Government to come to a speedy agreement with the  Netherlands.    Kooijmans also raised the issue of human rights and freedom  of worship. The Netherlands Government considers that economic  progress in Vietnam must be coupled with greater political  freedoms and accelerated efforts to improve the position of a  large part of the population which remains socially  disadvantaged. A spokesman for Minister Kooijmans in Hanoi  described yesterday afternoon's talks as difficult. In their  talks with the Netherlands Government the Vietnamese denied that  there were any problems of freedom of worship. They stressed  that as members of a sovereign government they "indeed had the  right to ensure that order was not disturbed," the spokesman  reported.    Kooijmans has signed, however, an agreement on the  protection  of mutual investments. The Netherlands is the tenth largest  investor in Vietnam, and the third European investor after  France and the United Kingdom with total investments of 450  million guilders (Shell, Heineken, Organon, and investments by a  number of commercial firms). Since last December the  Netherlands once again had its own embassy in Hanoi, occupying  two rooms in the Dan Chu Hotel. [passage omitted]</p>

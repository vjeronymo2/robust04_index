Dee said the government peace panel is considering "other  options" if the talks with NDF Jose Maria Sison and Luis  Jalandoni failed.    "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first  quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to  the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said.    Dee made the statement two days after the Alex Boncayao  Brigade (ABB) released the names of some 345 persons marked for  liquidation for their alleged involvement in various crimes.    He said the threatened new wave of assassination by the ABB  hit squad will not affect the peace negotiations between the  government and the NDF.    Dee said the ABB's threat to liquidate corrupt officials in  the government, including police and military officials, will  not directly affect the stalled talks with the NDF. He noted  that the hit squad had already broken off from the mainstream  communist movement.</p>

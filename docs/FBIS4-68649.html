			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ewald Stein: "The Estonians Do Not Want To be </F> Sacrificed for a New Friendship"]    [Text] Juri Luik apologizes politely. He is almost 10  minutes late for the breakfast appointment. His program is  rushed, the night was a bit short.    Juri Luik has been foreign minister of Estonia since the  beginning of this year. Together with his colleagues from the  two other Baltic states, Latvia and Lithuania, he was recently  invited to Bonn by Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. That  this invitation was gladly accepted is obvious. A visit to  Germany is for Luik more than mere diplomatic routine, for he  believes that in the Bonn government he will find especially  committed support in the solution of the multifaceted political  problems of his still young independent country.    Luik's homeland needs intercessors above all vis-a-vis  Moscow. In Estonia, which became independent in 1991, now as  before Russian troops are stationed--the legacy of the Soviet  past. And in Tallinn people rightly fear that they will not have  been completely withdrawn by August 31 as originally agreed.    At any rate, this is at present the biggest political  problem  for Estonia's government. And thus for the young foreign  minister as well. Juri Luik is just 27 years old. At first  glance, his full beard can easily be deceptive in this regard.  He is among the guard of young politicians who today steer the  political destinies of the most northern of the three Baltic  states. His prime minister, Mart Laar, is just 34 years old, in  the entire government team no one is over 40 years old. Only  Lennart Meri, the state president enthroned above them, is among  the seniors. On March 29 he celebrated his 65th birthday.    In spite of his youthfulness, Luik, who was born on August  17, 1966, in Estonia's capital Tallinn, already has a notable  career to his credit. After studying journalism at the  University of Tartu, he worked beginning in 1989 initially as a  political editor at the cultural weekly VIKERKAAR, to change  from there as an expert for Anglo-Saxon studies at the renowned  Estonia Institute. As director of the political department of  the Foreign Ministry, Luik, who speaks splendid English and, of  course, Russian and Finnish as well, in 1991, the year of  independence, moved into the political career.    The stages were short: In September 1992, after the first  free elections, he was elected deputy of the coalition party  "Pro Patria" to parliament; a month later, as minister without  portfolio, he then directed the delegation of his country in the  delicate negotiations with Russia. In August 1993 he became  minister of defense, and since January of this year has held the  office of foreign minister.    This evolution makes it clear that he regards the withdrawal  of the Russian soldiers as the center and pivotal point of the  current foreign policy of his country. This is all the more so  because Moscow only at the beginning of March let it be known  that Russia no longer feels bound to the deadline of August 31  and will decide on the return as it sees fit. "This date, after  all, was proposed by the Russians themselves," the foreign  minister observes with irritation. Now one can only hope that  they will keep to this date, he added with anything but  confidence.    For Juri Luik there is no doubt that the Russian hesitation  tactic has its source exclusively in the will to demonstrate  power. In his view, you see, the danger for his homeland does  not emanate from a direct threat. "The Russians, after all,  today have no more than about 2,500 active soldiers stationed in  Estonia. Technically, they would, therefore, be in the position  to order the return of such a limited contingent any day." But:  "It is nothing but a political question. Russia wants to exert  permanent pressure on the Baltic states."    And in this delicate situation his country is betting on  Europe, in particular on Germany. No, it does not have to be  pressure that Bonn and the European Union [EU] should exert on  Russia, the diplomat believes. However, gentle, but constant  influence should be exerted. It should be made clear to the  Russians again and again, he said, that they must observe their  own obligations and bring their soldiers home by the agreed  deadline. This type of support, he indicated, is "very, very  important" for his country.    But the minister from Tallinn cannot or will not conceal his  scepticism completely. So he agrees completely with his  president, who not long ago complained about the German  appeasement policy towards Russia. "Yes," Luik says seriously,  "that is so, at any rate to a certain degree." But immediately a  slight correction follows: "If we are asked whether a  German-Russian axis means a danger for us, we say first of all  that we do not presume such an axis." Actually, he let it be  known, people in Tallinn welcome the friendship between Bonn and  Moscow. But, and now again unambiguously: "We do not want to be  sacrificed for this friendship."    The Estonians, too, if Luik had his way, would like to be  friends of the Russians. In his view it looks quite as though  the Russians themselves are interested in an integration in  Europe. But for this, he pointed out, there are clear criteria  after all. "In Europe there are certain rules of conduct, which  must be accepted by all countries, large and small. And these  norms also apply to the Russians." Of this they must be reminded  again and again, and specifically in their own interest: Such  admonitions, you see, would also mean a strengthening of the  democratic forces in Russia.    Luik, of course, knows the thesis that the political key to  this does not at all lie in Europe, but rather in the United  States, that there can indeed be an accord between Washington  and Moscow in staking out their own spheres of interest anew.    But in his view it should not terrify. He believes that  especially the strong European states, like Germany, have an  interest in there not being any new two-power policy: "Such a  policy, after all, would be a swindle. After all, there is no  longer a second superpower." But even if it would be so, he  pointed out, the Europeans are certainly politically and  economically strong enough to be able to prevent "a game over  their heads." In any case, he does not believe that "the  European Allies would allow Washington to do this."    For him, the thesis of new spheres of interest is ultimately  equivalent to the "sacrifice of border states." Moreover, for  the diplomat, this would only be the first step: "History has  taught us, after all, that a first sacrifice, as a rule, is  followed by others." For him, this would be a genuine policy,  for which he understandably sees "absolutely no reason."    Luik is firmly convinced that the Western community holds  all  the cards vis-a-vis Russia, politically, economically, and  psychologically. But: "It must only play its hand." That is to  say: In an energetic policy vis-a-vis Russia. And here he again  emphasizes the positive effect of such a policy for Russia: "We,  too, after all, want people like Boris Yeltsin to be supported."  At the latest here the inflammatory word Zhirinovsky must fall.  Luik: "In the West there must be no inclination of any kind  toward the view that (the right-wing radical) Zhirinovsky is  something like a good boy, with whom one can perhaps make  political deals." And: "Whoever appeases to that extent is a  fool!" According to Luik, this is the basic line that one has to  follow.    What does a young Balt think when he hears from Moscow that  all Russians must be protected, therefore also the Russian  minority in Estonia? Luik corrects: "After all, Yeltsin said in  a speech before the parliament that Russia will protect all  Russians, whether they live in the near or the more remote area  abroad."    For the Estonian, such words are, on the one hand, "quite  clear imperialist policy," but, on the other, he does not know  precisely what in the final analysis they are supposed to mean:  "Does Yeltsin mean by this also Russians who have emigrated to  Israel? Are they also his compatriots?" For Luik, the answer to  such questions is simply a test case for all of Western  democracy.    This is all the more so because Moscow links such claims  propagandistically with the aspects of human rights and minority  rights for the Russians in Estonia, who constitute close to a  third of the approximately 1.6 million inhabitants. The foreign  minister again takes up Yeltsin's speech before the parliament.  To be sure, he talked about Russian interests, but not about how  these interests could be pursued by democratic means, by the  means of consensus, including with smaller neighboring  countries. Luik: "This was completely missing in his speech."  Luik further: "Yeltsin says that Russia belongs to Europe, that  the Russians do not want to be guests." But for Luik, this, too,  is not the point: "No one wants to keep Russia out of Europe.  What we want is for Russia to follow the European norms." In  Luik's words, those who argue that people want the Russians in  Europe, even if its troops are still stationed in the Baltic  states, are making a mistake: They ignore, after all, "the rules  which those had in mind who formulated the fundamental values of  the Council of Europe."    That, in view of these grand political atmospherics, Estonia  and the other two Baltic countries want to see their future in  the EU and in NATO is an entirely logical consequence for Luik.  With a view to the EU, he is quite realistic. As he sees it, the  first priority here is to bring to completion the so-called  Europe Agreement for association by the end of this year. Quite  different, by contrast, his opinion about a close linkage to the  Western defense alliance. The joining of his country, too, in  the so-called "Partnership for Peace," which NATO at its summit  meeting in January offered to the East European states as  substitute for membership in the alliance, to be sure, he does  not wish to be understood as resignation, but "of course, we are  not satisfied with that, we want much more." Surely, he  suggested, this concept is a sign that NATO is not indifferent  to the security interests of the Balts. On the basis of the  missing security guarantees in the concept, however, it is not  known "what NATO will do if things become dangerous for us."  Joint maneuvers in the Baltic Sea, he observed, are after all no  guarantees.    "Perhaps," so Estonia's foreign minister consoles, "this is  even a helpful instability." For him it is certain in any case  that the "Partnership for Peace" is an empty cover, which was  accepted only because of its political significance.    "Totally disappointed" is Juri Luik by the fact "that there  is no awareness either in NATO or in other European  organizations that time is running." In his view, there have  already been excellent opportunities for the preparation of a  firm inclusion in NATO and for a reorganization in Europe: "When  Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fedorov governed in Russia, when Russia  still conducted itself like a democratic country, this all would  have been much simpler." Today it would have to be stated that  "we have lost a lot of time to change Europe."    The young minister from Tallinn evidently tries to ignore  the  question of why then especially the Americans in the matter of  NATO membership of the Baltic states, too, show so much  consideration for Moscow. "We have always told the Russians that  it would be useful for them if the Baltic states were members of  NATO." Then the mutual relations would be much more relaxed. If  we felt secure, both sides could also quite easily reach  compromises, including on border questions." But, in the words  of Estonia's chief diplomat: "We do not feel secure."</p>

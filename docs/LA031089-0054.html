			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> IRAN 'HIT SQUAD' SUSPECTED  </P> <P> A suspected Iranian hit squad passed through Spain recently on a mission to  kill British author Salman Rushdie, the Spanish news agency EFE said. The news  agency said seven Iranians met in Madrid about 10 days ago and that  investigations showed they planned to kill Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic  Verses" was deemed so blasphemous by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that he  ordered the novelist killed. The news agency said that information obtained  through telephone taps revealed the group was unable to purchase weapons in  Spain and that no arrests were made for lack of evidence. The report said the  commando team of five men and two women then split up and left the country.  Rushdie is in hiding in England.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Institutions unhappy with Sugar's offer DESPITE A marathon four-hour annual meeting Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder, appears to have failed to swing institution-al investors firmly behind his 30p-a-share buy-out proposal. Mr Sugar has a personal 35 per cent stake in Amstrad, but needs to muster three-quarters of the shares he does not own in order to proceed with his Pounds 113m plan to take Amstrad private again. The support of a group of institutional investors, each with less than a 3 per cent stake but which together control about a quarter of Amstrad's issued share capital, is therefore crucial, particularly given the hostility of some of the individual invest-ors. Mr Keith Gilham, associate director of Equity and Law, said yesterday that it had not finally decided what to do. However, he added, 'it's a very unsatisfactory offer and I don't want to prejudice our chances, but we feel it is unlikely that we can extract more than the 30p being offered. We are more or less resigned to accepting the offer.' Another institutional investor said, 'we don't find what's being proposed attractive.' Institutional investors said they remained uncomfortable that there was no independent valuation and no financial forecasts for Amstrad, and felt there was nothing except Mr Sugar's own word to go on. 'We're being taken out at the bottom of the cycle and I just don't know what the value is,' Mr Gilham said. However he, like other institutional investors, expressed the hope that the pressure on Mr Sugar might force him to make concessions. Although the institutions felt that the Amstrad chairman had won the first round, they noted that there were probably a few more rounds to come before the extraordinary meeting in two weeks time votes on Mr Sugar's proposals. If the pressure is kept up on Mr Sugar, 'it will be in our interest to join those who feel we can get more,' said Mr Gilham.</p>

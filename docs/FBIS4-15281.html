			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 1, RIA -- From April 1 considerable  changes will be made in the principles used in drawing up weekly  schedules of Russia Television programmes.    Due to financial difficulties the length of broadcasting  will  be cut back by 2.5 hours daily -- at the expense of repeating  feature films and political programmes in the daytime.    The children's "Holiday Every Day" evening fairy-tale is  moved from 19.45 to 18.40.    Theatre programmes that appeared on Saturdays at 18.15 are  to  be shown on Tuesdays at 21.25.</p>

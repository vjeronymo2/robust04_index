			<p>CSO     [Text] The National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and  aerospace manufacturers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,  Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. will begin drastic  design changes, aiming at commercializing the large domestically  produced H-2 rockets. The changes, including modification of the  main LE-7 engine, will be extensive. They are intended to reduce  production costs of 16 billion yen incurred during the first  successful launch by 30 percent within three years, and  eventually by as much as 50 percent. French Ariane Space has 60  percent of the global rocket market, including the launch of  communication satellites. These design changes will facilitate  Japan's entry into world wide commercial competition, and also  will promote other Japanese space developments, including the  Japanese ``HOPE'' space shuttle which will be launched by H-2  rocket.    Aerospace manufacturers and Rocket Systems, a rocket  procurement company, have presented a list of several hundred  modification plans, including:    1) reduction in the number of parts that make up the main  LE-7 engine;    2) change in a portion of the fairing materials;    3) revision of major components for the ``LE-5A'' second  stage engine.    Cost reductions should be achieved through improvements in  the production process and maximum utilization of mass  production.    MHI has proposed a new development plan for an advanced  LE-7,  the core of the H-2, which will reduce production costs by  several hundred million yen through some changes in the position  of parts without changing the main structure. IHI will reduce  the number of components in the turbopump which is the major  component of the LE-7 and LE-5A.    KHI has proposed material changes including substitution of  iron for titanium in parts of the tip of the rocket that doesn't  require such high quality. Nissan Motor, which is in charge of  production of the booster rocket, will work on improving the  production process. NASDA will make a final decision selection  of the proposals by mid-April.    Launching costs, including production and fuel, total  approximately 19 billion yen per rocket at present. That will  remain constant for the next two rockets scheduled for launch in  the near future. This &yen;19 billion is a far cry from the  Ariane rocket's launch cost of approximately &yen;10 billion,  and therefore NASDA has requested modifications in design from  the Japanese manufacturers.    The latest modification program which reduces production  costs by 30 percent will affect the 6th and 7th launches which  are scheduled for around 1997-1999. The 50-percent cost  reduction of &yen;8 billion is expected to be achieved during  the 12th rocket launch scheduled for some time after the year  2000. This will drop per-launch costs to around &yen;11 billion,  including fuels and inspection. Cooperation between government  and industry to promote mass production also is expected to  reduce the cost of the HOPE project.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Daily Telegraph listing proposed MR CONRAD Black, the Can-adian proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, yesterday announ-ced that he was considering a Stock Exchange listing for the UK newspaper group in June 'barring a market over-reaction' to the outcome of the UK election. At the same time he announced the sale of his 8.8 per cent stake in United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express, ending three years of speculation about his intentions. The proposed flotation would require the Hollinger Group, the international media group which is Mr Black's main holding company, to reduce its present holding from 83 per cent to 70 per cent. A minority of the shares is currently held by directors and former owners of the Telegraph newspapers. The Telegraph newspapers have just announced pre-tax profits for 1991 of Pounds 40.5m on turnover of Pounds 219m, compared to profits of Pounds 38.5m the year before, on turnover of Pounds 222m. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Daily Telegraph, said that the proposed flotation and the sale of the United Newspapers stake did not indicate that Hollinger was short of money: 'it is more in the way of building up a war chest'. Hollinger Group sold the 17.25m United Newspapers shares to brokers Smith New Court and Cazenove, who placed it with several dozen institutions at 350p a share, raising Pounds 60.4m. United Newspapers shares yesterday slipped by 13p to 360p. The average price paid by Hollinger in building the stake in July and August 1989 is believed to be about 458p, implying a loss on the shares' value of about Pounds 18.6m. This does not include either the cost of financing the investment or dividends received. Hollinger said yesterday that it still believed United Newspapers 'is a fundamentally un-dervalued stock but . . . there are more attractive investment possibilities . . . and the resources engaged in holding this investment can be more prudently applied to the reduction of outstanding loans.' The stake sale followed United Newspapers' 1991 final results last week, which exceeded City expectations. It also comes four months after Hollinger paid ADollars 1.4bn for Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group. The company's worldwide collection of titles includes the Jerusalem Post and over 80 newspapers in Canada and the US. Stock market speculation that Hollinger would bid for United Newspapers or try to buy its stable of regional newspapers or business magazines pushed the share price to a peak of 512p in late 1989, but speculation has been ebbing for some time. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which also publishes the Sunday Express and Daily Star, said 'we got on perfectly amicably while he was a shareholder and we'll get on amicably now he's not'. The Telegraph and Express newspaper groups will continue their joint venture of London printing facilities at West Ferry in Docklands.</p>

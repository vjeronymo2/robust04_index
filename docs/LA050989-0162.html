			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UNCERTAINTY PUTS PRESSURE ON MARKET; DOW DIPS 5.14  </P> <P> The stock market declined for the eighth straight day today in relatively low  volume, pressured by jitters in the bond market and by ongoing inflation  worries.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 5.14 points to end the day at  2,371.33.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 804 issues down, 612 up and 539 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 150.09 million shares, against 135.13 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell 0.46 to 170.80.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 0.76 to 345.09.  </P> <P> The market opened on an up-note, then drifted lower as economic uncertainty set  in.  </P> <P> Early in the day, many buyers withdrew from the market to await the start of  the Treasury's three-day auction of notes and bonds. Investors also were  reluctant to make commitments ahead of Friday's wholesale price data, market  observers said.  </P> <P> The bond market took a nose dive late in the day after the first round of the  government auction. Stocks followed, with program selling dominating the  action.  </P> <P> Analysts said that the bond market had anticipated a more enthusiastic response  from foreign investors to the Treasury's $9.75-billion sale of three-year  notes.  </P> <P> "Apparently the auction didn't go so well," said Michael Metz, vice president  of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Before the sale, observers had predicted that stock prices would follow the  bond market's reaction.  </P> <P> Analysts said the stock market also remained cautious in anticipation of  Friday's government report on producer prices, which will provide additional  information about the economy's growth.  </P> <P> The producer price index has particular significance for the market after last  week's unemployment report, which provided mixed signals, traders said.  </P> <P> "So the concern is shifting to stagflation," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice  president of the investment firm A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. Stagflation  refers to a condition of stagnant economic growth coupled with inflation.  </P></p>

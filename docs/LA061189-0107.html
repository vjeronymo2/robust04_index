			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD POLICE HUNT FOR RAPE-MURDER SUSPECT, 19  </P> <P> Inglewood police were still searching Saturday for a 19-year-old man described  as "armed and extremely dangerous" who they said is the suspect in the rape and  shooting one week ago of a 14-year-old girl, her mother and another woman, who  died two days after the attack.  </P> <P> The mother and daughter, who are still in a hospital, told police that their  attacker is a youth they had seen hanging out near their home on Doty Avenue.  </P> <P> Police identified the suspect as J. C. Metoyer, who goes by the nicknames "Man  Man" and "May May." The Inglewood Police Department asked for the public's  assistance in finding Metoyer, who they believe is still in the Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> The attack occurred June 3 in the neighborhood south of the Hollywood Park race  track in a home that the 33-year-old mother shared with her daughter, a  19-year-old woman and two younger children.  </P> <P> Metoyer, who has no permanent residence, often visited his grandmother, who  lived on Doty Avenue, said Inglewood police Sgt. Harold Moret.  </P> <P> About 1 a.m. on June 3, Metoyer approached the 19-year-old woman in front of  her home, pushed a small-caliber pistol into her back and ordered her inside  the house, Moret said.  </P> <P> Police said that once Metoyer was inside the house, he tied the hands of the  two women and a 14-year-old girl, raped all three and then shot each at least  once in the head. The suspect fled with a pillowcase filled with valuables.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old woman died Tuesday morning at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA  Medical Center from a wound behind one ear. The two other victims are expected  to survive, but the girl has lost the sight in her left eye after a bullet  struck her there.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Gangs  </P> <P> Police said Metoyer has been affiliated with several different gangs and bears  a scar on his stomach after being shot last year by a gang rival. Metoyer is  described as 6-foot-1 to 6-foot-3, 180 pounds with a shaved head.  </P> <P> He has lived in Compton and south Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Police say that Metoyer is also suspected of firing shots in late May at a  15-year-old who was riding a bicycle through the same Inglewood neighborhood.  </P> <P> "This is a fellow who is out of control," Moret said.  </P> <P> Several residents on Doty Avenue said they have not seen Metoyer recently, but  the fear in the neighborhood is palpable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Woman Frightened  </P> <P> On Friday, a woman told two maintenance men who appeared suddenly outside her  window that they had frightened her. "Don't you know these women were shot just  over here!" she said.  </P> <P> Neighbors fear reprisals if they talk about Metoyer, the woman said.  </P> <P> "People in this neighborhood are afraid," she said. "Why would they say  anything, even if they knew where he was."  </P> <P> Police said callers can give them information about Metoyer anonymously by  calling 412-5210 or 412-5246.  </P></p>

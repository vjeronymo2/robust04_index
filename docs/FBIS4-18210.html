			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Right Seeks Premier as Left Asks </F> What Went Wrong"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Forza Italia and the  Northern League made their first attempt to seek common ground  for a governing coalition, Wednesday [30 March], but conflict  over who will occupy the premier's office remains.    Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi reiterated today that  he  feels he is the best person for the job, saying that the leader  of the largest force in parliament should be given that  privilege. The League, on the other hand, is throwing its  weight behind its own Lower House whip Roberto Maroni.    While Left Democrat Secretariat member Franco Bassanini  repeated his party's line that TV and publishing tycoon  Berlusconi would have too many conflicts of interest were he to  enter government, the name of former President Francesco Cossiga  as a possible premier refused to lie down.    The controversial former head of state received a cold  reception from League Senate whip Francesco Speroni who said  "what an ugly name. Cossiga is really the oldest of the old,"  but in the neo-fascist National Alliance, the other major  element of the Forza Italia-League right-wing Freedom Pole, the  rejection was not quite so categorical. National Alliance chief  Gianfranco Fini reminded journalists that Cossiga, a life  senator, has decided to bow out of active politics, but "should  he decide to return to the field, he could not, of course, play  a minor role."    From outside the political world came what seemed to be  encouragement for Berlusconi, with Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli  saying that in older democracies "it is always the leader of the  party which took most seats who heads the government."    Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association  CONFINDUSTRIA [General Confederation of Italian Industry],  agreed: "These elections were one more step towards the  modernisation of the country's political system, and the line-up  which won on points has the right and duty to govern."    Some confusion has arisen, however, over just which party  did  take most seats: though Forza Italia and its close minor allies  the Christian Democrat Centre took a total of 186 seats in the  two houses, to the League's 176, by subtracting Christian  Democrat Centre votes, Forza Italia's share stands at 142.    Whoever ends up governing, however, the unions today  promised  that they would not take a back seat. According to CGIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor] assistant secretary  general Guglielmo Epifani, "we want to get the power of trade  union confederations back into the game," pushing such topics as  employment, pensions and the welfare state to the fore of the  government's agenda.    While the right haggled to find a government programme and  leader, the left tried to work out where the Progressive  Alliance went wrong, and began looking to the future.    Isolated voices, such as that of Socialist Party Senate whip  Fabrizio Cichitto, calling for the resignation of Left Democrat  Party chief Achille Occhetto were countered by Left Democrat  spokesman Claudio Petruccioli who said that "the issue of  Occhetto's resignation did not even arise" in a party  secretariat meeting today. Occhetto's Left Democrats were by  far the largest element in the Progressive alliance, which took  335 seats in the two houses.    Constitutional expert Augusto Barbera of the Left Democrats  suggested that Occhetto stay put until he had succeeded in  forging a Progressive Party, taking on board all the centre-left  forces which joined in the Progressive alliance in the March  27-28 vote, then step down to inject younger blood.    For Fausto Bertinotti, chief of the Communist Refoundation  Party, a Progressive Party would be going too far, but regular  consultations between the alliance members to decide on strategy  in parliament will be necessary. Bertinotti came down strongly  against a suggestion that the Progressive allies form a single  parliamentary group.    From Sicily, Palermo's Mayor Leoluca Orlando of the  anti-Mafia Network put the left's defeat down to a frantic but  pointless search for unity on programmes: "The right certainly  did not waste much time seeking unified proposals, and they took  a larger percentage of votes in all kinds of social areas."    Outside Italy, the elections prompted a furious reaction  from  one Socialist EuroMP who will be trying to have those Italian  Socialists who went with Berlusconi's Forza Italia thrown out of  Strasbourg's left caucus.    A comment by Greece's minister for European Union affairs  Theodhoros Pangalos, who talked in a TV interview of  "Berlusconi's rabble" seizing power through "media magic," got  diplomatic hackles up, and Italy's ambassador to Athens was  dispatched by the Rome foreign ministry to tick Pangalos off.    Having dealt all day with the thorny issue of who should  become premier, Silvio Berlusconi found himself faced with  another leadership problem this evening when he went to watch  the AC Milan soccer team, which he owns, play Anderlecht in a  European Cup bout in Milan.    Should conflicts arise between his political role and that  of  chairman of Milan, Berlusconi is prepared to set aside his  footballing hat, but in this case, finding an alternative will  not be difficult: "Whatever happens," he told journalists, "I  think I would hand the team over to someone from the family."</p>

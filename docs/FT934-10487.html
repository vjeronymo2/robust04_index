			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brussels agrees big trade concessions to Moscow THE European Commission yesterday agreed on significant trade concessions to Russia as part of its effort to get a new EC trade and political agreement with Moscow before the Russian general elections in December, writes David Gardner in Brussels. Brussels is proposing to treat Russia almost as though it were already a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and wants to set 1998 as the date when the Community and Russia will decide whether to establish a common free trade zone. The proposals are expected to be endorsed as a new Commission negotiating mandate when foreign and trade ministers of the 12 meet in Brussels on Monday. The Commission and the 12 had already agreed that the 'partnership' talks with Russia should hold out the eventual prospect of a fully fledged free trade zone. At the time there were fears that Mr Yeltsin might lose a popular referendum on Russia's reforms. The new insertion of a date is, however, regarded as a psychologically important demonstration of EC commitment to Russia. But of greater substance for Moscow is the Brussels proposal to treat Russia as 'an economy in transition' rather than a so-called 'state trading' country, such as China or North Korea. 'They want to be seen as capitalist rather than communist,' a Commission official said yesterday. Moscow had obdurately refused to be bracketed in 'state trading,' even though, for instance, its energy prices are artificially low because of state subsidies, Russian companies still have no market-based mechanisms for calculating their production costs, and Russia has still not been accepted into Gatt. If the EC were to insist on state trading treatment, it would make it far easier for the Europeans to take measures against imports from Russia than under Gatt rules. Under the Commission proposal, however, the EC would have to prove 'substantial' injury to European producers before imposing anti-dumping duties, and to consult Russia before imposing the levies.</p>

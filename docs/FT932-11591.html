			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sabena posts BFr975m loss SABENA, the parent company of the Belgian national airline, made a loss of BFr975m (Dollars 30m) in 1992, Reuter reports from Brussels. Comparative figures for 1991 were not available. The loss was due to a general depression in airline business, increased competition and lower revenue on cargo, the company said. The strength of the Belgian franc against other currencies also weighed on the company. Last month, the Sabena group announced a 1992 consolidated profit of BFr6m against a 1991 loss of BFr2.44bn.</p>

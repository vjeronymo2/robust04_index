			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News at 10:00"] </F>   [Text] The government will probably table a second  electoral bill in the Legislative Council [Legco] in March. No  decision has yet been taken on the form of the bill, although  this matter will be considered by British ministers when the  governor, Chris Patten, visits London later this month. Cliff  Bale has this report:    [Bale] The government tabled a partial electoral bill in the  Legislative Council last month. It's expected to be enacted by  the end of February. Government officials insist that a second  bill, focusing on the more controversial issues relating to the  1995 Legco elections, must be tabled shortly afterwards, which  means probably in March. What's undecided is the form of the  bill. There are several options: Mr. Patten's original  blueprint, revised proposals put to China last year, or possibly  some sort of compromise. This matter is set to be discussed  during a meeting of the British Government's Cabinet Committee  on Hong Kong, which according to British sources, will meet  during Mr. Patten's visit to London later this month.</p>

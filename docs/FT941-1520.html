			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: NFC sees viable recovery in UK Pre-tax profits for NFC, transport and logistics group, increased by 45 per cent to Pounds 28.3m in the 16 weeks to January 22, against Pounds 19.5m. Turnover improved to Pounds 598.6m, compared with Pounds 557.4m, including Pounds 9.2m from discontinued activities. However the company said the profit had been enhanced by a compensation payment of Pounds 3.5m for the cancellation of a property contract and a pension credit of Pounds 8.7m, up from Pounds 6.9m last time. Underlying growth in operating profits was 11 per cent. The group, which is seen as a good indicator of economic activity, said the UK economic recovery remained variable, while there were no signs yet of recovery in Europe. It added: 'The US offers better prospects. There are encouraging signs of increasing activity throughout the logistics sector where the company's sales pipelines are ahead of expectations.' UK transport and logistics revenue increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 264m, with operating profit increasing by 6 per cent to Pounds 16.5m. In the grocery sector, revenue and margins were broadly in line with last year. The industrial market remained difficult. By contrast, the consumer and the automotive and petroleum and chemicals sectors performed well. 'The integration of our UK logistics businesses is proceeding according to plan although only limited restructuring costs have been incurred so far with the bulk of the expenditure to be charged over the remainder of the year.' NFC said Lynx, its parcels operation, made further progress, reducing losses from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 2.6m in spite of a small decline in revenue . Revenue in Europe rose 12 per cent to Pounds 52.1m and the small loss in the first quarter was a slightly better result than last time. Earnings per share rose to 3.6p (2.6p). The first interim dividend is raised 7.7 per cent to 1.4p (1.3p).</p>

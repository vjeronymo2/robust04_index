			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Trade News: McDonnell Douglas in talks on engine McDonnell Douglas of the US is expected to select the joint aero-engine venture between the German car maker BMW and the UK aero-engine group Rolls-Royce to supply the power plant for its new MD-95 100-seater airliner. Mr Richard Turner, Rolls-Royce's group marketing director, yesterday said at a Financial Times Asia Aerospace Conference in Singapore that 'detailed discussions' with the US manufacturer were under way to supply a more powerful version of the BR-700 engine being developed by BMW Rolls-Royce for the new MA-95 twin-engine aircraft. The decision is a setback for Deutsche Aerospace, whose MTU engine subsidiary in partnership with General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and Snecma of France, are proposing to develop a rival engine to the BR-700. BMW Rolls-Royce is also proposing the BR-700 to re-engine older McDonnell Douglas DC-9 twin-engine airliners. It has already been chosen by Gulf Stream of the US to power its GV, the business jet, and by Canadair for its Global Express long-range corporate jet. But the proposed deals with McDonnell Douglas would enable the Anglo-German venture to break into the much bigger regional jet airliner market. Mr Turner said the first full BR-700 engine would start testing later this year, although the engine core had already run successfully. Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas Aircraft Company, said the US company would soon start marketing to potential airline customers the MD-95, a derivative of the company's 130-seat MD-90 and the larger MD-80. All these twin-engine airliners are derivatives of the older DC-9s. Aircraft makers expect the market for 100-seater regional jets to show strong growth in the next 15 years. Saudi Arabia's decision to award a Dollars 6bn contract for commercial jets to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas will cost the European aerospace industry up to 20,000 jobs, Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of the Airbus consortium, said in Singapore yesterday.</p>

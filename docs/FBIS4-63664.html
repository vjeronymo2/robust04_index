			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 22 May -- Leonid Hrach, first secretary  of the Crimean Communist Party Central Committee, secretary of  the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee and deputy to  the Crimean Supreme Council in a multiseat district, gave a news  conference. He informed journalists that the Crimean Communist  Party Central Committee issued a statement which calls renewal  of the Republic of Crimea's 6 May 1992 Constitution  "inappropriate to the present time and allows dishonorable  leaders in Ukraine, Crimea, and Russia to inflame interethnic  hostility and a bloody conflict."    Leonid Hrach noted at the news conference that the Crimean  Communist Party is ready to cooperate with any political forces  in order to unite efforts against inflaming conflicts and to  speak out in favor of civic peace and interethnic accord.  According to Leonid Hrach, the actions of Crimea's Supreme  Council in adopting the first version of the 6 May 1992  Constitution and suspending the Ukrainian Supreme Council's  resolution revoking the Republic of Crimea's resolution renewing  the constitutional basis of the Republic of Crimea's statehood,  are criminal.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Management: Nationality still matters - Christopher Lorenz concludes a three-part series on ownership by examining what makes some cross-border purchases easier to handle than others A few weeks before Renault's takeover of Volvo collapsed last December amid a Swedish furore over the deal, an equally sensitive cross-border acquisition sailed through almost unnoticed. Nobel, a Swedish chemicals company, was bought by Akzo of the Netherlands. At first sight, the contrast seemed to be one of national style. French buyers have gained a reputation for putting national interests first. Unlike Renault's French management, which had taken an arrogant line towards the Swedes, the Dutch took great pains to consider Swedish interests, in spite of the fact that Nobel was in a far worse financial state than Volvo. Akzo not only agreed to run the merged group's key coatings interests from Sweden, but also undertook to continue Swedish research and development. Akzo's chairman said he did not underestimate the difficulties of merging the two cultures, but added prophetically that there would probably be fewer difficulties between the Swedes and Dutch than between, say, Swedes and French. But nationality is not the only contrasting factor between the two cases. There are three other fundamental, but less obvious, differences. First, Akzo's operations were more complementary with Nobel's than Renault's were with Volvo's - there was much less overlap, and therefore less room for argument about what should be done in which country. In only one area of the merged chemical group's activities was it obvious that capacity needed to be rationalised. Second, Akzo has far more experience than Renault in handling takeovers. Third, the Dutch company has developed a more enlightened attitude to the geographic dispersal of highly skilled technical activities and managerial decision making. It is, in management jargon, closer to operating as a 'transnational'. Factors such as these are vital to the outcome of cross-border acquisitions such as BMW's controversial takeover of Britain's Rover car group, and the examples examined earlier in this series. But that is not to say that nationality and culture are irrelevant. Michael Heseltine, the UK's newly internationalist trade and industry secretary, was wrong when he reacted to the fuss in February over BMW's takeover of Rover with the declaration that 'ownership is unimportant'. In an ideal world, it would be, but the reality is that the nationality of a parent company frequently still influences its location of key technical operations, and of managerial decision making. The relative weight of these influences is disputed by experts in the field. Lando Zappei, the Munich-based head of Booz Allen Acquisition Services, says the two key factors in a cross-border takeover are the strategy behind it, and whether integration of the acquired company is handled well. Surprisingly, he argues that the latter is more important than the former. As Zappei argues, takeovers tend to be relatively easy to handle where the prime motive is the complementarity of the two businesses, and the scope for transferring skills between them. Nestle's acquisition of Rowntree, and the US-UK pharmaceuticals merger between SmithKline and Beecham, are two such examples. Far more problematic are those where the main logic is the rationalisation of overlapping businesses with excess capacity - which was, in part, the case with Renault-Volvo. It was even more true of two former British companies whose UK production is being closed this year and transferred abroad by their new foreign owners: Thorn EMI's lighting output (being transferred by American GE to Hungary); and Bryant and May's last match line, which is being shifted by Swedish Match to its home base. In view of the fact that many industries across Europe are in pressing need of rationalisation, such production shifts across borders will become even more common in the next few years. But this does not mean that they will always be to the detriment of the acquired company. Zappei argues that if capacity rationalisation is properly planned, it frequently turns out to be reasonably even-handed. Only if unexpected emergency measures have to be taken is there 'a strong tendency for acquirers to make cuts in the country with which they are least familiar' - in other words away from their home base. This tendency is particularly strong in countries such as France and Italy, where the home government exerts pressure to protect domestic interests. Germany also tends to be shielded by the problems encountered in closing plants and shedding staff. Philippe Haspeslagh, a Belgian-born acquisitions expert at Insead, the international business school near Paris, makes less of a distinction than Zappei between the impact of 'rationalisation acquisitions' and those where the motive is complementarity. To him, the key factors are the extent of the acquirer's prior takeover experience, and the company's overall degree of organisational sophistication. A decade ago Thomson, the French electronics group, had a blazing row with its newly acquired Telefunken subsidiary in Germany, but since then 'it has gained a lot of experience in how to handle foreign acquisitions', he says. This has stood it in good stead with the reasonably successful integration of RCA, its largest US acquisition. But it did not protect Thomson from allegations of national bias when - in a series of salami-like cuts - it gradually closed the UK research and production operations of Ferguson, the former TV offshoot of Thorn EMI. Haspeslagh also differs from Zappei in the importance he attributes to nationality. 'It's hard to disentangle inexperience from nationality bias,' he says. 'Certain cultures tend to be less enlightened than others.' He denies that French companies are especially bad in this respect: as he says, both Rhone-Poulenc, with a string of recent US chemicals and pharmaceutical takeovers, and the Lyon-based SEB Group, with its acquisition of Germany's Rowenta appliance company, have shown their readiness to retain highly skilled activities - and some managerial decision making - in the acquired company's country. By contrast, he argues that Finnish engineering companies, which have been involved in many cross-border takeovers, tend to want excessively centralised corporate structures which create tension with newly acquired foreign subsidiaries. As Haspeslagh stresses, it is relatively easy for a company to disperse R &amp; D and other skilled jobs around the world, but far harder to distribute significant decision-making power. Yet this needs to be done if companies are to become more responsive to market differences, and attract more top-class international managers. 'There's a limited benefit in having software engineers in India or designers in the English countryside if decisions are still made in Detroit,' he says. Companies are unlikely to disperse much divisional and corporate decision-making away from their home base until they internationalise the mentality of their top management. In the meantime, home country influence over decision-making - one aspect of the so-called 'head office effect' - remains overwhelmingly powerful in all but a handful of 'transnational' companies, notably Nestle and ABB. For the rest, including almost all US and Japanese multinationals and the majority of Europeans, nationality still matters very much indeed.

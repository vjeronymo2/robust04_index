			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / World News in Brief: Pollution blitz on rivers Special pollution patrols will target problem waters in a clean up blitz starting today. The task forces of wardens and pollution inspectors from the National Rivers Authority will concentrate on rivers - all in the West Country - with a history of below standard water quality. Because of production difficulties it has not been possible to publish the FT Top 500 survey with all editions today.</p>

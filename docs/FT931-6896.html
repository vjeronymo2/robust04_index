			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (3): A good bet if inflation remains low - Bonds BONDS ARE suddenly attracting the attention of British investors. The reason is simple: bond returns are now higher than those available on cash in building societies. In the jargon of finance, this is called a positive yield curve. A bond is just a tradable IOU with the issuer agreeing to pay interest and to repay the capital on maturity. In Europe and in the US, it is very common for private investors to own them. But in Britain, high inflation has in the past destroyed the value of bond holdings. Investors are hoping that the current conditions of low inflation and high real (after inflation) yields will make bond buying more profitable this time. The key thing to understand about bonds is the yield. The running yield is the relationship between the interest rate and the market price, calculated by dividing the former by the latter. A bond which has an interest rate of 10 per cent and a price of 80 has a running yield of 12.5 per cent. If the price rises to 125, then the running yield falls to 8 per cent. So as prices rise, yields fall and vice versa. What complicates the calculations is that bonds will eventually be repaid at face value (normally expressed at 100). So someone who buys a bond at 80 can look forward to a capital gain of 20 if he holds the bonds till maturity. The combination of capital gain or loss to maturity plus interest is called the gross yield to redemption. The redemption yields for government bonds (gilts) are shown every day in the FT. Bonds priced above face value have higher running yields than redemption yields; those priced below face value have higher redemption yields than running yields. As an example: on January 22, the Treasury 2000 issue, with an interest rate of 13 per cent, was priced at 126 1/2 . At that price, the running yield was 10.28 per cent and the redemption yield was 8.18 per cent. When investors buy bonds, they have a measure of certainty. They know the income they will receive each year, and the yield to redemption. But what they do not know is how the price will move between purchase and maturity. Nor do they know what inflation will do to the value of their capital while they hold the bond. The bond market is not a homogeneous mass, but divides into a number of categories: Conventional gilts. These bonds, issued by the UK government, have a fixed return and, short of revolution, the investor is absolutely certain of repayment. All capital gains are tax-free but income is taxable. The cheapest way of buying gilts is via the Post Office, through not all issues are available and you may not get the best price; you need to use a stockbroker if you want to buy more than Pounds 10,000. Index-linked gilts. Also issued by the government, but their repayment value and interest payments rise in line with inflation. As a consequence, much of the return comes in the form of (tax-free) capital gain. UK Corporate bonds. Comparatively rare. They will offer a higher yield than gilts, because they carry a higher risk; there is a chance, if the company gets into trouble, that the bonds will not be repaid in full, or at all. Overseas government bonds. The credit risk varies widely, depending on the country. But as well as price fluctuations due to interest-rate changes, the investor also faces an exchange-rate risk; if the foreign currency depreciates against the pound, the value of the bond will fall in sterling terms. Broadly speaking, if another government's bonds are yielding more than gilts, that is because the credit risk is significantly higher, or the foreign exchange markets expect the country's currency to decline. Costs of dealing in such bonds can be high, so they are best bought via a fund. Overseas corporate bonds. Have all the characteristics of overseas government bonds, with extra credit risk thrown in. Guaranteed income bonds. Not tradable like the bonds in all the above categories, but they do offer a fixed return over a fixed period. They are issued by insurance companies and interest is paid net of tax (and cannot be reclaimed); security is provided by the Policyholders' Protection Act, which guarantees 90 per cent of the investment, should the insurance company get into difficulty. Permanent insurance-bearing shares. Not strictly speaking, bonds at all, but have some of the same characteristics; that is, they pay a fixed rate of interest and are tradeable. They are issued by building societies. Two very important points, however: they will never be repaid, and so have no redemption value; and if the building society goes bust, they come a long way down in the list of creditors to be repaid. As usual, therefore, the higher returns they offer do involve higher risk. Bond funds. For those who do not want the headache of buying bonds directly, bond funds offer an alternative. Most are unit trusts, and by investing in a portfolio of bonds, aim to provide the investor with income and/or capital growth. Investors need to be aware that the higher the yield on offer, the greater the risk of capital loss. One disadvantage of a gilt fund is that profits are subject to capital gains tax - not the case if the investor had bought government securities directly. But a further point is that the investor must pay management fees. These have fallen over the past year or so, with some managers making no initial charge, but others still charge 5 per cent. Annual charges tend to be around 1 per cent. The task for the investor is to decide whether the manager's expertise more than makes up for the fees. The top performing domestic bond funds over the five years to January 1 were: Abbey Capital Reserve, Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt and Kleinwort Benson Gilt Yield; the average return for the sector over the five year period was 38.3 per cent (offer-to-bid with net income reinvested).</p>

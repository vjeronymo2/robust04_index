			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- A high-level European  Union [EU] team will travel to Algiers on May 30 to call for  respect for human rights and urge "national dialogue" between  the government and Islamic fundamentalists, a Belgian Foreign  Ministry spokesman said Wednesday [25 May].    Greek Deputy Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose  country currently chairs the 12-member EU, Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes, the former chairman and a senior German  official, representing the next country to chair the  organisation, were mandated to make the trip by the EU at a  meeting earlier this month.    The representatives will convey a "clear message calling for  respect for human rights" addressed to all factions in the  country, the Belgian spokesman said.    The EU will also express its satisfaction with a recent  agreement concluded by Algeria and the International Monetary  Fund on economic reforms.    The EU recently released a second 150 million ECUs (172  million dollars) of an aid programme frozen since 1991.</p>

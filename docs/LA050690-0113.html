			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: TAKING PLEASURE FROM THE PAST;  </P> <P> THE DRAGON'S ROBE BY DEBORAH NOURSE LATTIMORE (HARPER &amp; ROW: $14.95; 32  PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-06-023719-8);  </P> <P> THE LADY WITH THE SHIP ON HER HEAD BY DEBORAH NOURSE LATTIMORE (HARCOURT BRACE  JOVANOVICH; $14.95; 32 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-15-243525-5)  </P> <P> For the life of me I'll never understand why history is so often regarded as a  dull subject, an endurance test -- that teacher and student alike must trudge  through until the final date is memorized and the final grade given. If only we  could all capture the spark of excitement that has so ignited Deborah Nourse  Lattimore's love for it.  </P> <P> That love is richly displayed, in quite divergent ways, in her two new works,  "The Dragon's Robe" and "The Lady With The Ship On Her Head." Lattimore  expresses an affection that could only come from wandering mentally for  countless hours through historical material for the sheer joy of it. She  reveals herself most clearly to a fellow historiophile through her meticulous  attention to accuracy and detail.  </P> <P> "The Dragon's Robe" is an original tale that the author has extracted from  historical events in 13th-Century China. It concerns Hui Tsung, who was at once  artist, poet and emperor.  </P> <P> A young, orphaned weaver girl named Kwan Yin after the Chinese Goddess of Mercy  (a constantly recurring subject in Chinese art) leaves her village to seek work  at the imperial palace. In her travels she comes upon the aging and ailing  caretaker of a shrine to the dragon rain god. Taking pity on the old man, who  has offered her food and shelter, she decides to stay and care for him and his  beloved shrine.  </P> <P> They are visited in succession by two untrustworthy vassals of the emperor:  first, Lord Phoenix, overseer of the emperor's rice fields, and then Lord  Tiger, general of the emperor's army on the Great Wall. Through their greed and  irresponsibility they manage to incur the wrath of the dragon-god, and havoc  erupts.  </P> <P> With rice fields burning and Tatars rampaging, the little weaver desperately  sets to work to appease the dragon-god by weaving a magnificent imperial robe  and laying it before the shrine. Just as the great Khan, leader of the invading  Tatars, seizes the newly completed robe, the great dragon springs to life,  spewing forth torrents of rainwater -- nourishing to the rice fields, fatal to  the enemy and transformational to Kwan Yin and the old man. His true identity  is now revealed as the wiser, if wetter, emperor, who invites the good-hearted  girl to live in his palace.  </P> <P> Lattimore has wisely chosen the art of Chinese screen painting as her  inspirational source here. The style, to which this book is virtually one  extended homage, generously accommodates both text and illustration. Her  paintings are sumptuously rendered with a reverence for authenticity that  bespeaks the limitless time spent poring over the source material. Nothing else  could motivate such a skilled and sensitive adaptation. How I envy her hours of  research looking for the right tree or the right waterfall or the master of  this painted mountain or that painted face.  </P> <P> She has extended the feeling of this stylization quite effectively to the text  as well. Its clarity and formal simplicity evoke a wisdom-of-the-ages grace  while making it accessible for young readers.  </P> <P> From the sublime to the ridiculous is a tempting and almost unavoidable cliche  at this juncture, as "The Lady With the Ship on Her Head" comes into view.  Whereas "The Dragon's Robe" evokes the silken serenity of Eastern thought, "The  Lady With the Ship On Her Head" plays for the belly laughs. Despite the  dramatic mood swing, the common bond here is history and the pleasure of it.  </P> <P> I remember once as a child thumbing through an encyclopedia and stumbling upon  a survey that could have been titled "Hair Styles Through the Ages." There in  the 18th Century was a fancy French court lady with a ship on her head. What  wonderful, insane society could possibly have provoked this lady to such an  absurd extreme?, I wondered. My guess is that Lattimore asked herself the same  question, for she has come up with a delightfully absurd answer.  </P> <P> Madame Pompenstance is in a dither, for she hasn't figured out a "theme" yet  for the headdress she'll wear for tonight's fancy-dress ball. In desperation  she scours the beach for something marvelous, or at least adequate, to wear in  her hair. As she stoops for a particular shell, a miniature three-masted ship,  complete with crew and captain, sails into port and onto her head. Unaware that  her problem has solved itself, she notices the onset of a headache which she  attributes to her worry over the headdress. The subsequent events of her day  and evening are hilariously affected by this uninvited ornament. I still laugh  when I think of the sequence when her headache has grown unbearable due to the  crew dancing and singing sea chanteys on deck after reaping the benefits of a  glass of rum dumped on Madame Pompenstance's head by one of her jealous rivals.  </P> <P> Although Lattimore's painting style here lacks the finesse of "The Dragon's  Robe," it serves well for this send-up of the very notion of style itself. Any  era that would define elegance and sophistication by dressing its ladies as  birthday cakes is surely ripe for lampooning, and Lattimore doesn't spare the  ammunition. The vanity and social customs of a time only slightly more  exaggerated than ours are cheerfully skewered here by someone who truly  understands the importance of historical silliness. Of all human  characteristics, nothing is more lovable than the ability to laugh at  ourselves. And isn't it fun to think that our ancestors could have been just as  silly as we are?  </P> <P> History's magic happens when we're moved enough by what we see of ourselves in  those who've gone before that we begin to appreciate the heroism, wonder, and  (on occasion) the silliness in all of us. Lattimore's books are a loving nudge  in that direction.  </P></p>

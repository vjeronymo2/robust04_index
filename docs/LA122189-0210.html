			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TARZANA MAN ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF MAKING FALSE IDS FOR STUDENTS  </P> <P> A Tarzana man has been arrested for allegedly operating a small business that  supplied hundreds of phony identification cards to underage students from  across the country, the Los Angeles police reported this morning.  </P> <P> Alan Sturm, 52, was arrested at 10 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of forgery of  government seals. He was released on $1,000 bail this morning.  </P> <P> Sturm was arrested after two young-looking, rookie female police officers  posing as minors went to his tiny office in the corner of a Reseda shopping  strip and asked for fake IDs that would show them to be over 21 years old.  </P> <P> Sgt. Richard Ackerman of the West Valley vice squad said there were 10 other  underaged youths waiting in line for phony ID cards.  </P> <P> Sturm was arrested after providing each police officer with two cards, one for  a state and one for a university. Ackerman said the photo IDs, complete with  false birth dates, looked legitimate and even carried state seals on them.  </P> <P> Police seized records that indicated Sturm had made at least $60,000 this year  making phony identification cards, for which customers were charged $50 each,  Ackerman said.  </P> <P> The investigation was begun after Ventura police told local officers about  phony ID cards taken from students in that city.  </P></p>

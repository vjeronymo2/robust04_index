			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'WE'RE CLEARLY NOT THE ZENITH OF EVOLUTION.'  </P> <P> Eugene Fields and his wife, Marsha, run a business in Thousand Oaks that  changed its name and its clientele when Fields changed his philosophy. In  addition to hair styling, Eugene Champs Transformational Gallery now offers  books, crystals and New Age music. Fields and his wife live in Agoura.  </P> <P> When I was a kid, I was very aware of some kind of an energy that I felt came  from the sky. I thought I was an atheist even though I believed in some kind of  a power. I didn't want to call it God, because that's what organized religion  called it, and that wasn't what I felt.  </P> <P> I was a hippie when I was 16. I was anti-Establishment because I was upset with  the racism, the corruption, the whole emphasis on making money at any cost.  </P> <P> When we came out here from New York, we wanted to go into business for  ourselves. We thought we'd better fit in, so I joined the Rotary and the  Chamber of Commerce, and I was a diplomat. I had powerful friends talking about  me running for mayor. I was very much a system player where I never was before.  </P> <P> Then my mother sent me "Emmanuel's Book" because my middle name is Emmanuel. I  sat down and I read it, and it altered my life.  </P> <P> At first I was frightened of it because it was channeled. Channeling is getting  in touch with your higher wisdom or disembodied spirits if they exist. It's  like kind of weird, you know, and I didn't know if I could trust it because of  what it proclaimed to be. But I wanted to believe it was true because it was so  much of what I felt already. So I read it, and it really made things happen to  me.  </P> <P> For three days I had phenomena happening to me which were very strong. I tried  to take a drag of a cigarette, and I had a gag response. I loved Camel  cigarettes and I couldn't smoke the cigarette. I used to smoke quite a bit of  pot. That left. I used to eat quite a bit of meat. That left. For me not to be  able to do these things when I wanted to do them was a little disconcerting. I  didn't want to tell anyone about what was going on because I thought maybe  something terrible was happening to me. I was having visions. I was speaking to  spirits. I was quite frightened.  </P> <P> After a week I realized that these were all bad things that left and what came  forward was a person that was in touch with his God.  </P> <P> I was afraid to tell anyone about it because I was frightened at what this  could do to my business. I found myself not able to keep it in because I had a  vibration and a heat going up my back. It was like an electronic sound I could  hear.  </P> <P> The chair here was a place where I had people for an hour or two, and I could  tell them, and they couldn't leave. It was like forced indoctrination. I got to  feel like a broken record.  </P> <P> We lost most of our clients. There was an almost 80% turnover. I didn't even  realize it was happening. When I look at it, almost two years later, I can't  believe I told the collective to buzz off, we want to attract spiritual people  now.  </P> <P> We have nicer people here now. We don't have people that are complaining and  looking for something they can't have. We are very pleased.  </P> <P> If man could see he is part of a universe of life, he would lose this  egocentricity he has. When you've got thousands of crafts being spotted every  year by people all around the globe, coming from someplace else, we're clearly  not the zenith of evolution.  </P> <P> It would be wonderful if they would expose themselves now, but space people  don't want us afraid of them. When we can accept another reality, they will  appear. It may happen in our lifetime. I'm looking forward to it.  </P> <P> If UFOs are a phony thing, how do all these pictures get taken all over the  world? Why is there secrecy about it? Why is it that every President has to get  briefed two weeks before they take office and when they leave their hair is  white? What do they find out? I'm sure there are extraterrestrials present, and  that they're aware of it.  </P></p>

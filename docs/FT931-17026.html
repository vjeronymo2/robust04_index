			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Property: US development with a Scottish accent - A look at a group of holiday properties near Florida's Vero Beach that is attracting the attention of British investors AN ENCLAVE of 46 properties is being built above Vero Beach on the north east Florida coast - and the accents are more likely to be Scottish than American. For this is St Andrews Village, 12 acres of land between the coast and the inland waterway. The site was found by Len Sculthorp who, with his son Brian, is a partner in Edinburgh-based St Andrews Properties, which is developing the village. The Sculthorp family plans to keep a corner for its own holiday home and build houses and apartments for sale on the rest of the land. The first properties are just coming on the market and have been attracting the attention of Scots, although all buyers are welcome. Both Sculthorps are chartered accountants - the son has also become a qualified real estate agent in Florida. Until now the company has been converting and renting holiday properties in three complexes of farm buildings in Scotland. Drawing on this experience, it is developing its first overseas project and the first in which it will sell the holiday homes. The family's group of companies in Scotland, which includes a travel agency and a selling and rental agency, is able to assist buyers. The site, in Brevard county, is 90 minutes' drive from Orlando's international airport and has an attractive range of entertainment attractions, headed by Disney World. Vero Beach does not have an obvious tourist image. It is a waterside district of expensive homes screened from broad grass-verged roads by banks of shrubs and palms. Residents, in appropriate transport, cruise along the 55-mile limit roads or the waterways running parallel with the coast. You rarely see anyone walking. There are boutiques, hypermarkets and the Windsor polo club. The development company claims a year-round season, with European visitors in summer and north American visitors avoiding the harsh weather in winter. The village is to have a choice of property types. There will be a row of garden homes - pairs of single storey three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses, with multi-level roofs. They are designed so that each pair looks like a single detached house. Front doors are on different sides, so that no property overlooks the other's entrance. With construction going ahead, they are now being offered on the market. They have large living rooms with vaulted ceilings, sizeable kitchens behind breakfast bars. Florida's favourite room, the gauze-walled lanai, that keeps off insects and the strongest of the sun's rays, forms an extension of living areas. There are integral garages. Later, across the winding road running through the estate, there will be two-storey detached family houses. But before that the Carriage homes will be available. These are also an ingenious design by the Evans Group, an architectural practice whose ability to create interest through variations in ceiling heights and roof shapes has become a trademark. These properties are two, two-storey pitched-roof blocks, each with eight apartments. They have two or three bedrooms and two bathrooms, living room and lanai. Each has its own separate entrance and garage within the block. Each apartment looks on to the Indian river waterway, getting the full benefit of sunsets. In keeping with today's environment consciousness, the company uses aluminium studs in the construction, which it says saves timber. Some of the area available for development includes land used as a breeding ground by sea turtles. That part of the cabbage-palm and scrub-oak covered land is being left untouched. The estate will have a lake, communal swimming pool, boat dock and fishing pier. An adjoining larger development has a tennis club that St Andrews residents can join. There are golf courses within easy reach. The estate will be gated and have on-site management. St Andrews Properties will handle renting for owners if this is required. Property prices range from about Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 100,000, depending on the exchange rate. Related expenses will average about Pounds 300 a month. Foreigners cannot normally spend more than six months of a year in the US. The company suggests that this rule, where it applies to the retired, may be eased in four or five years, but other people are not quite as optimistic. Assuming a buyer took a 70 per cent mortgage, which should be possible, and allowing for costs including a furniture package, total funds required initially could be from Pounds 32,000, according to the company's estimates. It suggests other financing options, including shared or company ownership. St Andrews Properties is prepared to market rentals through its connections in Florida, Canada and estimates owners could break-even on finance and property costs from about 50 per cent rental occupancy.

A large choice of developments are offered as holiday home-cum-investment dealsin Florida and there is a lot you should know before you buy. Some areas have restrictions on short-term letting - although not Brevard county  -and the competition is intense. Lindsay Cameron, director of the trade and investment division of Florida Department of Commerce, in London, says Florida is not quite as aggressive as California in that respect. But people who take a Florida holiday and decide they want to buy and let, should not rush into anything. Certainly they should not plan to build themselves, without information about the zoning and planning laws. These aspects are becoming a lot tougher, says Cameron. It could prove very costly and time-consuming putting right a wrong choice. Too many people in holiday mood do not do the sort of checking they would if buying a property at home. Talk to knowledgeable people in the district, before you make a decision, advises Cameron. There are local chambers of commerce in all areas. They will recommend a responsible broker, or property lawyer, to guide you.</p>

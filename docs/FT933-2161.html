			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Flexibility sought on works councils THE European employers body, Unice, yesterday accepted the inevitability of European Community legislation on employee consultation and pressed for greater flexibility than contained in the existing works council directive. The works councils for employee consultation could be one of the first directives to be pushed through the social chapter mechanism of the Maastricht treaty which excludes the UK. The directive will require up to 1200 multinationals operating in the EC to convene works councils at least once a year. Yesterday Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of Unice, said the social partners - unions and employers - should work together with the EC Commission to find an acceptable alternative to the current draft directive. He said: 'The directive as it stands will not achieve its stated objective, which is to improve the information and consultation of workers. However Unice is ready to sit down with the Commission and European unions to develop a positive and constructive procedure that is acceptable to all parties.' Unice, including the Confederation of British Industry, is now ready to accept some legal underpinning to achieve the ends of European-wide employee consultation but insists on greater flexibility with regard to the means. At the same Brussels meeting the multi-national business forum launched a report, 'Thriving on diversity', which seeks to illustrate benefits of a range of consultation methods. The report argues there is little difference in the provision of strategic and financial data between countries such as Germany where there are extensive rights to employee information and countries such as the UK where there are no legal provisions.</p>

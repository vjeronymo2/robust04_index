			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- This morning, the Muslim  army resumed its heavy artillery and mortar attacks from the  center of Gorazde on the Serbian army positions on the right  bank of the Drina, the command of the Hercegovina corps of the  Serbian Army has announced. Strong Muslim forces are in  evidence near the town's bridges. Serbian military sources see  this as a likely indication that the Muslims are preparing to  destroy the bridges. Throughout yesterday afternoon NATO planes  frequently flew over Serbian army positions at an altitude of  over 3,000 meters. This provided the Muslims with an additional  motive to intensify their combat activities. Yesterday the  Muslims tried to use for propaganda purposes an incident in the  chemical plant in Vitkovici, four kilometers south of Gorazde,  to accuse the Serbs of using poison gases.    The Herzegovina corps command stresses that due to the low  level of technological process in the plant there is a danger of  a genuine ecological catastrophe throughout the Drina basin.  Over the past 24 hours two Serbian fighters have been wounded  on the Gorazde front.</p>

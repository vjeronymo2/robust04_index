This is called  creative practice, the highest level of human practice. It is  the most essential characteristic of the concept of Marxist  practice.    Experiments are the main form for promoting and deepening  reform and for creative practice.    There are risks in creative practice. Reform is a new thing,  as is creative practice, where there is no ready experience to  follow. There is no perfect policy, method, or scheme and  mistakes are unavoidable. Creative practice is bound to  encounter obstructions which may not be accepted by the public.  Creative practice, which means developing and exploring  practice, itself contains high efficiency.    Only with creative thinking can we have creative practice.  We should uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again  practice, and again knowledge; constantly carry out "ideological  reform and emancipation"; and always maintain ideological  vitality. This is the scientific course of creative thinking.  [end abstract]    Taking our own road, boldly breaking a new path, and  creating  through practice -- This is an important theme which runs  through the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping." In resolving any problem, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  stressed on numerous occasions that we should take our own road,  using new methods and new language, rather than stick to old  conventions, mechanically copying the models of our predecessors  or taking the beaten path. This is a very important conclusion  drawn after profoundly summing up the basic experience of  Chinese revolution and construction.  <H8>  I. </H8>   Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "The success of the Chinese  revolution is result of Comrade Mao Zedong integrating Marxism-  Leninism with China's reality and taking our own road. While  carrying out construction today, we should also integrate  Marxism- Leninism with China's reality and take our own road."  (p 95) He repeatedly emphasized: We should firmly stick to  this point which conforms to our reality. The experience of  other countries can only be taken as reference. The problems of  the world cannot be settled by applying one set model. The key  lies in learning through doing and making explorations in  practice. "If we stick to conventions or follow the beaten  path, without making any experiments or attempts, including  certain setbacks, we will definitely not be able to attain our  strategic objective." (p 318) Besides maintaining that a  country should creatively take its own road and start a new  undertaking in its revolution and construction, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping also urged all localities and fronts to have their own  creations. In "the gist of the talks made in Wuchang, Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, and Shanghai," he enthusiastically encouraged and spoke  highly of "the rich experience gained every day in building  Chinese- style socialism. There is a lot of experience. Viewed  from the newspapers and material from various provinces, they  have their own characteristics. This is good. We must have  creativity." He reminded us that reform and opening up face new  emerging things and experience can only be created by ourselves.  He was fond of listening to and using "new concepts." He  criticized the lengthy articles and speeches, which repeated the  contents and failed to use new terms. Obviously,  mechanically copying the experience of others, sticking to old  conventions, and repeating the words of others are tantamount to  repetitive practice and cyclic practice. But creative practice  means taking our own road, inheriting and developing Marxism  with new thinking and concepts, making explorations in practice,  and starting brand new undertakings, including some experiments  and attempts. Such creative practice, which is the highest  level of human practice, has the most essential characteristic  of the concept of Marxist practice. Only by constantly creating  can revolution and construction continuously develop. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping used succinct language to strictly distinguish  between creative practice and repetitive practice, which is of  great significance to reform and construction.  <H8>  II. </H8>   Experiment, an important means for promoting and  deepening reform, is the practice of creating and exploring. To  create, it is necessary to boldly and resolutely experiment.  Reform, as a creative practice, must have its own unique form.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping regarded experiment as reform and the  main form of creative practice. He said: "Reform and  opening up constitute a big experiment," "which cannot be found  in books." "In a sense, what we are doing now are all  experiments."    In other words, experiment is the basic and main form of  reform, which is the most realistic creative practice. This is  the case judged from both the macroscopic and microscopic  viewpoints. The specific problems encountered in reform should  all be resolved through experiments. For instance, there were  no securities or stock markets in traditional socialism. Can we  introduce such a thing? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's attitude is to  allow observance and resolutely carry out experiments. He said  that the comprehensive reform of China's economic structure has  just started. When we have the general orientation and  principles, it is necessary to further formulate specific rules  and regulations in the course of the experiments. If the  aforementioned exposition refers to a specific thing such as  reform and opening up, which is distinctive, the following two  expositions are of general and universal significance. The  first one is: "No matter what we do, there must be a person who  first makes an experiment and breaks a new path." In other  words, to create and blaze new trails in whatever we do,  it is necessary to experiment and there must be a person who  makes the first attempt. Experiment is the main form for  promoting and deepening reform and also for creative  practice. The other one is: "No quarreling, boldly  experiment, and break a new path." No quarreling is one of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's innovations. Instead of quarreling  worthlessly over a matter, the most important and fundamental  thing is to seize the opportunity to practice, create, and  experiment. While carrying out bold experiments, we should seek  unity of thinking and start a new undertaking. Hence, he  always encouraged us to boldly and resolutely experiment.  <H8>  III. </H8>   There are risks in creation which might lead to  mistakes and be unacceptable to the public. Nevertheless, facts  will eventually prove that creative practice will turn out  revolutionary effects. Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a penetrating  analysis in this regard, including three important expositions.  First, there are risks in creative practice. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out: "Reform is China's second revolution.  Despite the risks, it is a very important thing that we must  do." (p 113) "Urban reform is more complicated and risky than  rural reform." (p 117) There are risks because reform involves  the vital interests of the people and every step taken will  affect millions upon millions of people. Meanwhile,  reform is a new thing, as is creative practice, which has  no ready experience to follow. There is no perfect policy,  method, or scheme and mistakes are unavoidable. Second,  creative practice may encounter obstructions and not be accepted  by the public. This is mainly due to the influence of the old  system, pattern, and concepts and the obstruction of "leftist"  ideas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: In the past, we were  used to conventions and it was no easy job to change this. "It  was a difficult job to correct the `leftist' ideas which took  shape over the decades. Our main task is to oppose `leftism'  because it has become a force of habit." "The habitual practice  of yearning for the past easily crops up while formulating and  implementing specific policies." (p 228) As creative practice  means blazing new trails, which itself constitutes a revolution  and a negation of the old things, obstacles will be unavoidable.  Meanwhile, as creative practice is an experiment, which has no  ready facts to serve as grounds, it will take time to persuade  people to accept it. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "People could  not understand the policy of reform at the beginning. Reform  was universally accepted only when it was proved by facts." (p  155) Third, creative practice may take a long time to show  its effects, the results may be unexpected, and, what is more,  it could be a failure. The problems in these three points  raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping directly involved the appraisal  of the efficiency and effect of creative practice. Viewed from  the process of practice, creative practice is riskier than  repetitive practice. It may encounter great obstructions and is  likely to lead to mistakes and even failure. As a consequence,  its efficiency will be affected. However, from a  fundamental point of view, creative practice is a developing and  exploratory practice which involves doing innovative things.  This itself contains extremely high efficiency. Viewed  from the results of practice, the social effect and success of  creative practice will not be limited to a certain matter within  a period. It may bring about a breakthrough in a field or  sphere. Such progress may not even be expected by the persons  involved in the practice. This was the case in rural reform.  The line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee aroused the enthusiasm  of the peasants and invigorated the rural areas. In addition to  the development of agricultural production, township enterprises  suddenly came to the fore and scored unexpected results.  Similarly, the failure of creative practice is also of great  social significance because it proves the mistakes of the  thinking and methods never practiced before. This itself is a  discovery which offers a new basis for opening up a new path.  Successful experience, experience gained from mistakes, and  lessons drawn from failure are all valuable wealth. For this  reason, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always encouraged us to be  fearless and to advance boldly in spite of risks and  difficulties.    IV    Only by emancipating the mind, seeking truth from  facts, thinking independently, and applying creative thinking to  guide practice can we constantly make creations. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping encouraged us to creatively practice and think  because practice is the conscious activity of men with  intentions and objectives. Only with creative thinking can  there be creative practice. He said: "The basic spirit of the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee is to  emancipate the mind, think independently, and formulate policies  by proceeding from our reality." We cannot find the answer to  building Chinese-style socialism from the books of Marx or  Lenin. As the conditions and experience of each country differ  from the other, we can create new things only through  independent thinking. Unless we break with rigid ideas and  think creatively, there will be no hope for reform and  construction. He urged us to use our brains and be bold in  thinking and blazing new trails. He was against those lazy  people who repeated what others said and made empty talk instead  of using their own brains. He hoped that the leading bodies at  all levels could be a collective which thought independently,  could face reality, genuinely and carefully studied the new  circumstances, formed new trains of thought, offered new  methods, and used new language. From whence does creative  thinking come? Comrade Deng Xiaoping used many accurate remarks  to express it. To sum up, first, it is necessary to uphold the  ideological line of seeking truth from facts and integrate  Marxism-Leninism with the reality of Chinese revolution.  Marx could not give ready answers to problems cropping up  centuries after his death. Similarly, Lenin could not undertake  the task of offering ready answers to the problems emerging 50  to 100 years after his death. We should study Marxist theory  and also make theoretical creation in light of the new  circumstances and conditions of the contemporary world and  China. Second, it is necessary to rely on the creative  practice of the basic levels and the masses. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping said: "A lot of good things from rural reform were  created by the basic levels. These were then defined and  improved and taken as a guide for the whole country." While  examining the manuscripts from the 14th Party Congress he said  that many good things in reform and opening up were created by  the masses in practice. They are the wisdom of the masses and  the collective rather than something new thought up by any  individual through racking his brains. My contribution was  summarizing and advocating these new emerging things.  Third, it is necessary to constantly sum up new  experience; uphold the line of practice, knowledge, again  practice, and again knowledge; look back after every step taken  forward; continuously carry out "ideological reform and  emancipation"; and always maintain ideological vigor. This is  the scientific process for developing creative thinking.    China's economic structural reform has now entered a new  stage of establishing a socialist market economic system,  requiring us to creatively resolve many complicated matters. In  the reform practice we urgently need, more than any period in  the past, to carry forward the spirit of creative practice  vigorously advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and boldly make  creations and advance in the practice of the socialist  modernization program.</p>

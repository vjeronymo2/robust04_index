			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 31 March (AFP)--China launches Friday its  latest campaign to control prices and investments in an effort  to rein in galloping inflation, but experts doubt it will be  effective and consider the target of 10 percent set for this  year greatly underestimated. "The rise in prices has reached  alarming proportions," an Academy of Social Sciences study  warned, a viewpoint almost certainly shared by Chinese leaders.  Since the start of the year, official inflation has exceeded 20  percent, with the rate in major cities surpassing 25 percent.    Desperate to halt this threat to stability, the government  has cranked up the propaganda apparatus and, from Friday, will  dispatch squads of inspectors across the country in a  three-month operation to monitor prices and fixed capital  investments.    "The government has resorted to the classic tactic of  Communist countries but it will not be enough," a Western  diplomat, who is an economic expert, said.    Chinese and foreign analysts believe Beijing's hesitant  crusade -- cautious economic reforms and semi-austerity -- will  not be enough to slay the dangerous inflationary beast. "The  authorities have trouble coordinating their actions and have a  knee-jerk reaction," said one foreign banker in Beijing. "The  result is we're approaching hyperinflation, like that of 1988,  which only a real austerity drive can get rid of," he said.    Modest attempts last July to brake property investment when  inflation was hovering around 20 percent were dropped in  November after failing to yield results, and under pressure from  more liberal factions in the Communist Party.    "Control of fixed capital investment is already an austerity  measure but it remains to be seen whether it will lead to a  tightening of credit," the banker said.    Achieving a slowdown in investments, held largely  responsible  for last year's overheating and which have soared more than 70  percent in the first two months of 1994, is above all a problem  of political authority, observers agree. But it appears that  the government -- to avoid stoking social problems -- is not  ready to cut the lifeline to heavily-indebted state enterprises,  which continue to invest and import materials. Beijing's  authority is also being increasingly challenged by the provinces.    Again the authorities appear to be heading for an  ineffective  strategy in the long-term -- slowing liberalisation and delaying  reforms such as listing of state companies and turning banks  into commercial entities. This conservative orientation  prompted Zhu Rongji, vice-minister in charge of the economy and  an architect of openness, to defend market liberalism, declaring  "the reforms are not responsible for inflation."    But with perceived economic incoherence and political  friction, most analysts believe inflation will continue to rise.  They cite three reasons: Higher agricultural prices due to  falling production and speculation, strong consumer demand in  the cities, and the irrational behavior of state-owned  enteprises as far as investment is concerned.    Few people in China believe the cost of living will rise by  less than 10 percent, in spite of Prime Minister Li Peng's  recent insistence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Senate President Edgardo Angara, Speaker Jose de  Venecia Jr., House Majority Leader Ronaldo Zamora, and all  Cabinet members except Health Secretary Juan Flavier are now  being tried by the people's court of the armed group Alex  Boncayao Brigade (ABB).    Sergio Ramirez, spokesman of the ABB which claimed the  Saturday gunslaying of Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal yesterday  said Angara and De Venecia are being tried for their alleged  involvement in the acquisition of behest loans and for  "enriching themselves at the expense of the masses."    Without giving details, Ramirez said the Cabinet men, except  Flavier who is pro-people, are being tried for "sins against the  masses."    The other day, Filemon Lagman aka Carlos Forte, chairman of  the breakaway group Manila-Rizal Committee, said his group is  targeting De Venecia, Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, Presidential  Legal Adviser Antonio Carpio, and Senior Supt. [Superintendent]  Romeo B. Maganto, WPDC [Western Police District Command] deputy  director for administration.    He said Pring was also targeted but he proved to be a  "slippery target."    He also said the ABB is pursuing a public relations campaign  by ridding the metropolis of criminals, a task the government  has failed to accomplish.    Reacting to Ramirez' statements, Angara said: "I welcome the  investigation. Wala naman tayong ginawa na masama sa  taongbayan. Sana'y tapusin lang nila kaagad [I have not done  anything wrong to the people. Hopefully, they'll conclude it as  soon as possible.]"    He expressed confidence that an inquiry, if it will be on  allegations that he benefited from the grant of behest loans to  the Batong Buhay [Live Stone] Gold Mines, will finally clear him  of the charges. He reiterated that as nominal director of the  firm, he did not participate in decision-making in the company.    De Venecia Jr. refused to believe he was in the ABB hit  list.    He quoted Carpio as saying his (De Venecia's) name was  included in the supposed ABB hit list by "political enemies."  He refused to identify the "enemies."    "This is just black propaganda. They're making it legitimate  through you guys," De Venecia told reporters.    Maganto belittled the threat saying, "Matagal na `yan. Di na  `ko nagre-react diyan [It has been there for so long. I don't  react to it anymore]," he said.    President Ramos said police reports dispute the ABB's claim.    "The police progress reports indicate that it is not  necessarily that the ABB did the killing. That is not the  conclusion on the part of the police. They are looking at other  angles," the president said in his weekly conference.    He also belittled the ABB's continuing threat to kill  officials.    "This is not new. They have been making all kinds of threats  in the past and they have always wanted to disrupt our society  and the well-being and peace of mind of our people."    Senior Supt. Hermogenes E. Ebdane Jr., director of the  Western Police District Command, said probers are not "buying  hook, line, and sinker" the ABB claim.    "We are pursuing all angles in our ongoing investigation. We  will come out with a statement after we have gathered sufficient  evidence," he said.    Ebdane also said the WPDC will honor Zarcal during his  burial  next week. Despite Zarcal's dismissal from the police force,  the WPDC still considers him a policeman, Ebdane said. Zarcal  is an organic member of WPDC.    The Western Police District Command released cartographic  sketches of two of six suspects in the Zarcal murder.    One of them is 24 to 26 years old, 5'6" to 5'7" tall, of  medium build, and dark complexion. He hit Zarcal in the left  temple.    The second is 25 to 30 years old, 5'4" to 5'5" tall, of  medium build, and brown complexion. He monitored Zarcal's  movements prior to the attack.    Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon appealed to the ABB to  stop  summary execution of government officials allegedly involved in  corrupt and nefarious activities. While there are defects in  the country's justice system, Drilon said, no group should take  the law into its hands.    Steps are being taken by government to correct defects in  the  criminal system and strengthen the rule of law," Drilon added.</p>

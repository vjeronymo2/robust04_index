			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Salinas reshuffles cabinet President Carlos Salinas has reshuffled his cabinet in the wake of the nomination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio as his party's presidential candidate for next year. Mr Manuel Camacho, the powerful mayor of Mexico City and rival to Mr Colosio, was appointed minister of foreign relations, a post that takes him away from the centre of the political stage in the run-up to the election. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, who resigned as education minister to become Mr Colosio's campaign manager, was replaced by the foreign relations minister, Mr Fernando Solana. Mr Zedillo, a former budget minister and central bank official, in effect, becomes Mr Colosio's closest aide. His presence may reassure investors concerned about Mr Colosio's experience in economic policy. Mexico's ruling party has claimed victory in the gubernatorial election in the state of Yucatan, although official results are not expected until today. The centre-right opposition has accused the party of fraud, and is preparing to protest against alleged vote-rigging in rural parts of the state.</p>

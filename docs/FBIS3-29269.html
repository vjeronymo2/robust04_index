At present, the  route between Korea and Russia is open only to Far Eastern  Shipping Corp. (FESCO) of Russia and Hyundai Merchant Marine  Corp. of Korea. FESCO operates one ship on the route and  Hyundai runs two vessels. The route between Korea and China is  open only to joint-venture shipping companies between the two  countries.    MAPA has barred other shipping companies from using the  routes because Russian and Chinese shipping companies collect  far lower charges than Korean lines. With the decision,  shipping companies from any country that meet certain  qualifications will be permitted to operate between Korea and  China and between Korea and Russia next year. They will also be  allowed to transport cargo or containers from Russia or China to  the United States or Europe via Korea.    Charges are expected to drop considerably as many shipping  companies start plying the routes, and transportation of cargo  will become easier. The move is aimed at activating sea  transportation in Northeast Asia, a MAPA official said.</p>

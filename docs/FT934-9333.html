			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Regions report patchy recovery FURTHER evidence that the UK is experiencing a patchy and uneven recovery emerged yesterday in the latest survey of regional industrial trends. The survey, produced by the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional economic consultancy, showed that differences in demand have produced mixed fortunes for manufacturing across different regions. Overall, UK manufacturing orders and output changed little in the four months to October. But orders for companies in the west Midlands and Scotland increased sharply while in Northern Ireland and the south-west they fell. A mixed demand pattern is forecast for the four months from October, with strong order growth expected in the north-west and Wales against forecasts of falling orders in the east Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. Although Scottish industry expects to increase staff slightly in the coming months, manufacturing employment is expected to fall in all regions in the present quarter compared with a year ago. Recession in continental Europe has dampened confidence, especially about export prospects. Just four regions - Scotland, Northern Ireland, the west Midlands and East Anglia - recorded substantial increases in business confidence. Only in Scotland and Wales were manufacturers more optimistic about export prospects over the coming year than they had been in the last CBI-BSL survey in July. Most UK regions reported falling export optimism with declines especially pronounced in the south-west, the north and the east Midlands. Export orders declined during the past four months in all regions except Wales and Scotland. The survey, carried out in the first half of last month, shows that output rose appreciably in six UK regions, with especially strong growth in the west Midlands, Wales and East Anglia. All regions except Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and Humberside expect increased production in the four months from October, with the west Midlands expecting the most robust growth. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economic director, said the buoyancy in the west Midlands could reflect increased demand for motor components and the effect on output and orders of the temporary acceleration of investment allowances that expired last month. Scotland is also performing well. According to Mr Charles Burton, BSL joint managing director, Scotland could be benefiting from increased demand for electronic products and relatively low levels of household and corporate debt. The rundown in the coal industry and recession on the Continent have probably contributed to less favourable trends in Yorkshire and Humberside. The outlook for investment is mixed although the east Midlands, west Midlands and Scotland plan higher spending on plant and machinery. CBI/BSL Regional Trends Survey.

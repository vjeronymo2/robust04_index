			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Claremont buys Magellan Inds - New group to supply 11% of Marks and Spencer's clothing Claremont Garments, the clothing manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 43.3m takeover of Magellan Industries, the lingerie and swimwear company. The takeover, bringing together two of Marks and Spencer's leading suppliers, follows production problems at Magellan, which yesterday reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.26m in the 12 months to December 31, compared with Pounds 511,000. Mr Chris Ryder, Magellan chief executive, said the acquisition by Claremont was an attractive option after a year in which it failed to recruit enough workers or ensure adequate raw material supplies to complete orders for Marks and Spencer. Under the all-paper offer, Claremont is issuing up to 12.8m new shares, some 23.9 per cent of the enlarged group, which are being offered to Magellan shareholders on a 0.4816-for-1 basis. The offer has already been accepted by Magellan directors and family trusts associated with Mr Oliver Prenn, the chairman, which together control 36.1 per cent of the company. Schroder Investment Management, Magellan's largest institutional shareholder, has also agreed to procure acceptances on behalf of investors holding a further 14.8 per cent. Welcoming the undertakings, Mr Peter Wiegand, Claremont chairman, said: 'The acquisition will strengthen our product range and our relationship with Marks and Spencer.' He claimed the group would supply up to 11 per cent of the retailer's total clothing stock, which in turn would account for 95 per cent of its business. Marks and Spencer welcomed the takeover and said it was happy with the terms. Claremont, meanwhile, announced a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 8.5m) in the 12 months to December 25. The improvement was spurred by full year contributions from two earlier acquisitions - J&amp;J Fashions and Alexander Milnes - which helped operating profits increase by 32 per cent to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9m). Turnover increased to Pounds 114.4m (Pounds 81.5m), while earnings per share came out at 19.1p (16.4p) or 18.2p (16.2p) on a fully diluted basis. By comparison, turnover at Magellan in 1993 was flat at Pounds 36.9m (Pounds 35.5m). Losses per share of were 4.7p (2p) or 2.7p (0.2p) excluding exceptional items. The group's results were hit not only by supply and staffing problems but also by a Pounds 496,000 exceptional charge following the collapse last August of Dunkeld, the shirt manufacturer. The charge arose out of losses on Dunkeld shares which Magellan received in part payment for Slix, its swimwear brand, sold in 1992 for Pounds 1.07m. It plans an unchanged final dividend of 1.4p; while Claremont announced a proposed final pay-out of 4.5p (3.95p), making 8.1p for the year (7.25p). Claremont is also acquiring Bellrise Fashions, the Next supplier for Pounds 1.9m cash, funded from bank reserves of Pounds 6.6m. Its shares rose 5p to 358p. Magellan's closed down 1p at 172p.</p>

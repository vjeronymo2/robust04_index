			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Stillhalter opens with deficit Stillhalter Vision, the option-based investment company set up by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group on April 8, has got off to a poor start, reporting a SFr228.6m (Dollars 178.50m) loss for the period ended August 31. The loss arose entirely from unrealised losses on the market value of its investments. The company raised SFr3bn in April, mainly from institutional investors transferring their holdings in Swiss blue chip shares to it.</p>

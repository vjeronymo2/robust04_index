			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL CAPSULES;  </P> <P> FRONTIER LEAGUE  </P> <P> Santa Clara  </P> <P> COACH: Lou Cvijanovich, 32nd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 28-0; 1st in league, 10-0  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Shon Tarver is gone to UCLA, but Santa Clara should again be  the class of the league. Two starters on last year's state championship team  are back, led by junior Chris Cole (6-foot-4), a swingman who plays "all over  the place," according to Cvijanovich. Also returning is senior forward Anthony  Maestas (6-2). Cvijanovich has at his disposal a wealth of talented juniors,  including scheduled starting point guard Art Barone (5-11) and forward Steve  Amar (6-4). Two other players vying for starting time include junior Isaiah  Mustafa (6-2) and Evan Swanger (6-2). Yet another junior, post player Pat  Lampson (6-5) rounds out the rotation for Cvijanovich. Most of the juniors come  to the varsity from a championship junior-varsity team.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Santa Clara has not lost a league game since 1985 and has won every  league title since then. On paper, this year does not seem much different. "I  think it's a helluva league, from what I've seen," Cvijanovich said. But he  likes the Saints' chances. "As the season progresses, this will be one fine  ballclub."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nordhoff  </P> <P> COACH: Dick Sebek, 16th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 15-9; 2nd in league, 7-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Father will coach son again at the Ojai school, where the  Rangers' star player is junior Tim Sebek (6-3), a guard-forward who averaged 16  points and 10 rebounds last year. Sebek was selected All-Ventura County as a  sophomore. The other returning starter for Nordhoff is junior point guard Kevin  Cochran (6-0). From there, Sebek will look to new names for starters. Senior  Craig Bolton (6-0) is a forward who is "real quick and a good athlete",  according to Sebek. He is also the only senior who will start. From the  football team comes junior guard Nacho Vega (5-10), who likes to shoot the  ball. Junior Josh Bridge, a 6-4 transfer from Boston, "fits in real well,"  according to Sebek. Also vying for playing time is freshman Mark Sebek (6-0),  the coach's son.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Nordhoff was the last team to win a Frontier League title before Santa  Clara's dominance of the late '80s. Sebek said the teams have had a great  rivalry and that 1990-91 should be no exception. From rival Cvijanovich:  "Nordhoff has a real good bunch coming back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Santa Paula  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Donahue, 1st season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 2-19; 5th in league, 2-8  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Donahue inherits a program filled with winning juniors.  Leading the way is footballer Joey Ramirez (6-0), a junior guard who can shoot  well and is a good ballhandler. Joining him in the backcourt is George Aldanese  (6-1), a left-handed transfer from Santa Barbara who, like Ramirez, is a  "pretty good shooter." In the middle is 6-8 junior Terry Bell. "He has good  hands and a nice touch," Donahue said. "His only problem is that he's a little  slow afoot." Defensive standout Anthony Hernandez (6-2), a senior forward,  should start. Then, the onslaught of juniors who have won together ever since  arriving at Santa Paula: forward Charles Hyde (6-3), forward Patrick Villa  (6-3), point guard Art Marcelo (5-8) and swingman Kevin Crossley (5-11).  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Donahue downplays this year's team, but the league's coaches seem to  like the Cardinals -- they voted them as preseason favorites to finish second  to Santa Clara. In truth, they should battle Nordhoff for that honor. Donahue  likes the idea of turning the program around, citing experience in that vein  from his coaching days in Pennsylvania. Said Donahue: "I think that's one of my  fortes in life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fillmore  </P> <P> COACH: John Wilber, 1st season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 11-11; 3rd in Tri-Valley League, 4-6  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Four starters return for Fillmore's jump to the Frontier  League. Leading the way is returning all-league guard Richard Aguilera (5-10),  a senior who scored 16.7 points a game last year. He is joined in the backcourt  by senior Pokey Sanchez (5-10), an outstanding athlete who is the one of the  team's best defenders. From the football team comes quarterback Art Sosa (5-9),  a third guard who will push the ball up the court. In the middle there is size  -- senior center Mike Richardson (6-6) is back after leading the team in  rebounding last year. Two juniors who will be counted on to contribute are  forward Rudy Alcantar (6-3), a good jumper who runs the floor and forward Danny  Ocegueda (6-2), a solid inside player. Also from the football team is  linebacker-turned-guard Jason Rangel (5-11), who will be counted on to do some  running off the bench.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: In Wilber's first season, he is looking to field a running team.  "We're going to try to push it up," he said. "We want to take advantage of our  speed." By Wilber's calculations, Fillmore's first year in the league will be  marked by a battle with Santa Paula and Nordhoff for second or third place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calabasas  </P> <P> COACH: Bill Bellatty, 1st season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 10-13; 4th in Frontier League, 4-6  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Calabasas will only carry eight players -- a manpower problem  that also afflicted the football team. But one of the eight is a prize --  senior center Greg Waugh (6-8), who is being recruited by small East Coast  schools and possesses a "nice touch," according to Bellatty. Senior guard Tom  Hoover (6-3) will shoot the jump shot for the Coyotes and senior point guard  Jason Young (5-11) will run the three-guard offense. Another senior, 6-foot  Chuck Sergis, will play the post and will be counted on to help Waugh rebound.  Joining him in that duty will be senior Nick Carpol (6-0). Junior shooting  guard Brian Bruskurd (5-11) and point guard Jeff Marin (5-10) will come off the  bench.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Calabasas need not worry about the relative strength of its league  competition entirely: "It's always one of my goals to reach the playoffs," said  Bellatty, who is returning to the head coaching post after a two-year layoff.  "And we've reached that already." Bellatty was referring to the new Southern  Section rule allowing all teams to make the playoffs. But he feels his Coyotes  have another goal -- to improve on last year's record. "This year we're going  to pick it up," he said. "We're going to try and run a little bit."  </P></p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Seeboard 9% ahead at Pounds 36m Seeboard, the electricity distributor for the south-east of England outside London, yesterday warmed the market with news of a 1-for-1 scrip issue and a 16 per cent increase in the interim dividend. Pre-tax profits for the half year to end-September were 9 per cent higher at Pounds 36.3m, up from a restated Pounds 33.2m, and earnings per share were 20.3p, 10 per cent ahead from 18.4p. However, Mr John Quin, finance director, said that underlying growth, after stripping out the effects of restructuring costs, was about 16 per cent both in profitability and earnings. Unlike some regional companies, which have already reported dividend rises of up to 20 per cent, Seeboard did not attempt to rebalance dividend payments between the two halves of the year. Sir Keith Suart, chairman, said the 16 per cent rise was based on performance and ability to pay. Analysts interpreted this as meaning 16 per cent was possible for the full year too. The interim dividend of 3.3p (2.85p) is being paid on the increased capital. Seeboard is the first regional electricity company to announce a scrip. Sir Keith said it would improve marketability, particularly for small shareholders. 'There are 200,000 small shareholders and we take them very seriously,' he said. In the opening six months turnover rose 2 per cent to Pounds 534m. The distribution business saw a 0.6 per cent growth in units and increased profits from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 39.3m. Supply losses were slightly less at Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.8m). Retailing broke even on turnover of Pounds 27.1m whereas in the comparable period of last year it lost Pounds 300,000. The company has Pounds 48m in the bank, compared with Pounds 6.1m in 1992 first half. Seeboard said that as a result of tight controls it would pay a rebate of about Pounds 8 to all domestic and quarterly billed business customers during the quarter beginning next April. COMMENT Seeboard bore gifts yesterday for both shareholders and customers. The rebate to customers will on average match almost exactly the value added tax the government is imposing on domestic fuel bills from April. For shareholders the present is the scrip which is likely to increase the total value of holdings, if only marginally, and provides the company with a first among recs. Both moves are typical of a company which has always marketed itself effectively. But there is more than just show to Seeboard as a 6.4 per cent real reduction in controllable costs in the half under review demonstrates. Contracting, which reported an operating loss of Pounds 200,000 was disappointing but the brake on outperformance for the shares is that they are already highly priced. If Seeboard pays out 23.4p for the full year the prospective yield is about 4.1 per cent, lower than most and possibly all other recs.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Brief respite in store for investors - New York Wall Street is entering a relatively quiet period, which should allow investors to regain their balance after last week's roller-coaster ride. But analysts expect any respite to be brief, given the uncertainty that is gripping the Treasury market. With no fresh first-tier economic news due during the next five sessions, share prices are likely to continue a consolidation which began on Friday, when troubling readings on industrial production and capacity utilisation sent bonds reeling and stocks back-tracking. However, it is reasonable to expect less volatility this morning. During the 'triple witching' session which closed last week, the monthly expiration of stocks options and futures contracts introduced an extra element of stomach-churning unpredictability to a market already suffering from over-stimulation. The Dow Jones industrial index wobbled to the finish, showing a 20-point decline. If bonds are setting the direction, stocks have established their own pace. Equity investors were more inclined than their fixed-rate counterparts to turn the other cheek when confronted by the two indications of higher inflation which book-ended the seven-day period ending on Friday. During the middle of the week, when the data painted a rosier picture, stocks reaped a more generous reward than bonds. On Thursday, the bellwether blue-chip index jumped almost 60 points to close within striking distance of its all-time best, set the week before the Federal Reserve began its shift to a policy of tighter credit. Alas, last week ended with evidence that the central bank still may not have done enough to harness the engines of growth. Bond traders were particularly upset to learn that America's factories and mines last month were using more of their total capacity than at any time since April 1989. With the likelihood of production bottlenecks developing, the threat of higher producer prices loomed larger. However, stocks again proved their relative resilience. When the dust settled after the triple-witching reinvestment scurry, the Dow Jones index had landed on its feet, ending the week with a 59 point net gain. If the outlook for corporate earnings remains optimistic, stocks may hold out a little longer against the tide which is pushing bond prices lower and yields higher. Nevertheless, Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago, says that blue chips are unlikely to gain a firm foothold in uncharted territory, even if the volatility which he is expecting allows the index to cross the line. 'Hitting a new high is going to be very difficult to achieve if we get many more episodes on bonds such as on Friday,' he says.</p>

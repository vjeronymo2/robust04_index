			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Dusan Radovanovic] </F>   [Text] Paris, March 4 (TANJUG) -- French authorities on  Thursday [3 March] ran true to form in their anti-Serb  discrimination policy and clamped their third ban on Serbs'  peaceful demonstrations in under a month.    France banned the Serbs' Europe-wide peaceful protest from  being staged in Strasbourg on February 6 and their more recent  rally, organized by the Paris Union of Yugoslav Clubs. This  discriminatory practice culminated on Thursday in the  information to the president of the Serbian community in France,  Ivan Jankovic, of the Paris police decision to ban the latest  demonstration in Paris, planned for March 6.    The demonstration was to take the form of a march from the  Place de la Republique to the Bastille, to end in a rally for an  equitable peaceful settlement for war-shattered  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the lifting of anti-Serb sanctions and the  condemnation of the media demonisation of the Serbs.    As the reason for the ban, French authorities again offered  the well-worn cliche that a Serb rally would "jeopardise public  law and order."    In his protest against the decision, Serbian community  President Jankovic dismissed the offered pretext as thin and  groundless, and pointed out that Serb protests in France to date  had never produced a single incident.    Considering the fact that Moslems are allowed to organise  militantly-intoned demonstrations in France in which they  clamour for retaliation and military intervention against the  Serbs, it is obvious that the explanation that a Serb protest  would be "jeopardising public law and order" is nothing but an  effort to prevent the Serbs from raising their voice against the  West's shameful policy towards Serbia, of which Paris is a  foremost champion.    After being denied all access to the French media, which  continue to foment hatred of Serbia and the Serbs, the Serbs in  France are now being denied one of the basic democratic rights,  viz. the right to public and peaceful demonstration.    France, which takes every opportunity to boast of its being  in the forefront of the struggle for human rights, is violating  in the case of the Serbs some of the basic provisions of the  human rights declaration, initiated in its soil.    The question remains why French authorities have done  nothing  to prevent frequent attacks on Yugoslav diplomatic and other  representations in France. Last month, the Yugoslav Embassy and  cultural center in Paris were attacked in full view of an  indifferent police. Shortly before, the Yugoslav consulate in  Lyon was attacked.    No blame has officially been apportioned for the assaults,  although French authorities have made promises of quick and  efficient investigation.</p>

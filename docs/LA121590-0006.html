			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL FUNDING  </P> <P> I read with great interest the Nov. 26 article "Gaps Between Rich, Poor Schools  Ignite Legal Fights," which surveyed discrepancies in the funding of schools  across the nation. I must disagree vehemently, however, with the contention  that California has achieved virtual equalization in base school funding.  </P> <P> While the state Supreme Court's Serrano decision went a long way toward  achieving equal education funding for every child, it is an unfortunate fact  that distressingly large discrepancies continue to exist.  </P> <P> For example, in San Joaquin County, Lammersville and Jefferson school districts  are next to each other and both feed into Tracy Union High School District.  Yet, Jefferson annually receives $400 more per pupil, or $12,000 for a class of  30. This situation is not unique.  </P> <P> As a constitutional right, and simply as matter of fairness, every public  school student should have access to a quality education, and where a child  happens to live should make no difference.  </P> <P> This year I carried SB-622, which sought to reduce differences in school  funding between districts. The measure, supported by virtually all of the  state's major educational organizations and a large number of school districts,  received not one negative vote in the Legislature. Unfortunately, the governor  vetoed the bill.  </P> <P> I and other supporters of equalization plan to continue our efforts -- both  through legislation and possibly through legal action -- to ensure that no  child is denied the opportunity for quality education.  </P> <P> SEN. DAN McCORQUODALE, D-San Jose  </P></p>

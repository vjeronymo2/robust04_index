			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Jobs: How to escape from the snake pit - Harvard professor identifies the mechanisms underlying world-wide organisational disease ONCE upon a time there were seven would-be high-fliers employed by seven different companies who went to bed each night feeling utterly miserable. The reason was that although the outfits they worked for were called management consultancies, they were in fact snake pits of organisational politics. So the seven decided to get together and create the consultancy they had dreamed of in their business school days. First and foremost, it would be free from any political writhings to stop expert professionals from spreading their wings. Soon new clients were flocking to join those they had brought with them, and the business was expanding fast. Soon, too, the seven owner-directors were going to bed each night feeling utterly miserable. The reason was that the consultancy of their dreams had somehow turned into a snake pit as venomous as any of those they had quit. Their internal tanglings were hampering their efforts to serve their respective clients, and their subordinate teams were caught up in the coils. So much so that, despite the directors' practical experience of management as well as their masters' degrees in business administration, the very survival of their company was coming under threat. Then the founder who'd become the chief executive, and another of the seven he presumably still trusted, heard that a Harvard professor named Chris Argyris had studied predicaments like theirs. They therefore took him to lunch, explained the problem as they saw it, and asked what they were so mis-handling as to land their whole organisation in such a pit. His reply, after closer inquiries, was that the root cause wasn't anything they'd done badly, but something they were doing supremely well. It wasn't surprising they were good at same, he said, because they along with most of the rest of us began learning to do it before they could walk. Nor was their outfit, which happens to be in America, alone in its pickle. His studies show the same sickness afflicts managements not only throughout the sadly imperfect world, but even in Japan. Since the directors seemed honest in their search for a cure, he added, he might be able to help although it would take some time. They agreed, on strict condition that neither they nor their company were named. That was in 1986, and the seven and their staff are still at it. True, there is less writhing - the internal threat to the firm's survival, for example, has gone - but they aren't yet completely cured. Meanwhile Harvard University's 69-year-old professor of education and organizational behaviour has described the exercise to date in a book* which sheds more light on the realities of management than any the Jobs column has read before. In the process, it has produced an addition to the Laws of Organisational Stupidity which I've discussed on occasion recently, the last time being four weeks ago. What Chris Argyris views as causing the universal sickness, and which he maintains we start practising as we leave the cradle, is a particular response to a certain class of problems: the sort we feel are personally threatening. Our response, which we make with increasing skill, is first to find a way of by-passing the problem, then cover up the by-pass, then cover up the cover-up . . . and so on. The pattern is always the same, the professor says, even though it appears under under different guises he terms 'defensive routines'. Their result is that, instead of being cleared up, the original flaw not only goes on festering, but its very existence becomes taboo - undiscussable, and so irremediable. *Knowledge for Action. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco (ISBN 1-55542-519-4) Dollars 29.85. Hence the new law of organisational stupidity called Argyris's Archetype which, in its prototype form at least, rules: The more threatening a problem to those responsible for solving it, the deeper it will be ingrained under ramifying layers of camouflage. It is more than just an addition to the laws which, as enduring readers may recall, describe patterns of events that tend to bedevil organisations of all types everywhere. For the Archetype explains several of the laws previously codified, and whose baneful effects were demonstrated by the consultancy's owner-directors. A prime example is the Abilene Paradox, stating: People in groups agree on decisions which, as individuals, they know are stupid. Early on, the chief executive and the other founders separately complained to the professor that their board meetings spent hours on minor matters, quite regardless of the issues which all of them could see were endangering the company. The explanation is surely that the crucial issues, being personally threatening to at least one of the seven, had become undiscussable. So they occupied themselves in collectively agreeing on trivialities, which everyone present knew was a waste of time. That is not to say such issues went undiscussed outside the boardroom. Elsewhere, when one director was seen as responsible for a problem, others tended not only to blame him behind his back, but to gang up against him. The shifting coalitions that ensued called into play another law called Winkler's Wrecker, which ordains: Division courts disruption. Nor did the board-level writhings go un-noticed by subordinate staff. Noting their chiefs' individual sensitivities, they adopted the law named Mangham's Muffler, stating: When communicating to superiors, new news is bad news. The cover-ups on high were thus reinforced by the drying up of any unexpectedly relevant information from below. And while those are not the only laws that follow from Argyris's Archetype, they are enough to explain the existence of snake pits all over the globe. So how can we climb out of them? Well, the remedy prescribed by the Harvard professor is notoriously hard to digest. The only cure, he says, is for organisations to start learning from the top down - and he doesn't mean simply by sending their chiefs to business schools and the like. In fact, he believes that formal educational processes tend to make the underlying self-protective sickness not better, but still worse. In his view, our childhood experience endows us with mentally stored 'master programs', one of which prompts us to defend ourselves when we feel under threat. Typically, our later learning - including the sort we do with a view to passing exams - results in our being able to execute the programs more and more skilfully, but without changing their content at all. So when we feel personally endangered by a problem at work, we go straight into the by-pass and cover-up routine without bothering to consider the likely effects on the organisation, no matter how evident and damaging they become. To break out of the vicious circle, Chris Argyris says, we have to open up our master programs to alterations in the light of experience, by rigorously following certain rules of learning he sets out in the book. One, for instance, is never to attribute responsibility for anything to anyone, without testing the truth of that attribution by asking other people, including the person concerned. He readily admits that the task isn't easy. The seven owner-directors toiled at it for 12 months or more without being able to change their behaviour one whit. But they're doing famously a mere seven years later, he adds, and sleeping much more securely as a result.</p>

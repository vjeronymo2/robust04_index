			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Mining &amp; Allied reduces loss to Pounds 20,550 Losses at Mining &amp; Allied Supplies, a distributor of precision bearings and power transmission products, were cut from Pounds 189,413 to Pounds 20,550 pre-tax over the 12 months ended September 30. The deficit took account of a Pounds 663,812 provision for discontinued activities to conform with FRS 3 and a Pounds 69,577 rise in interest charges to Pounds 572,185. The latter mainly reflected additional funding for the purchase of Richard Hough Bearings in June. Turnover of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 18.7m) included an acquisition contribution of Pounds 1.17m. Operating expenses accounted for Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 4.58m). The dividend for the year is being stepped up from 0.5p to 0.75p as a measure of confidence and group prospects. Losses per share widened from 0.3p to 0.5p. The directors are proposing a name change to Bearing Power International.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Los Angeles awaits verdict Korean shopkeepers were putting up razorwire in Los Angeles yesterday, as the city waited for a verdict in the federal trial of four white policemen accused of a 1991 beating of black motorist Rodney King. Hopes that a decision had been reached were raised briefly when the judge recalled lawyers to the court late yesterday. However, he announced that one of the jurors had become ill and had asked to see a doctor. The jury was expected to reassemble this morning for a sixth day of deliberations.</p>

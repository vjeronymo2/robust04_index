			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: House prices still too high Sir, While I agree with Barry Riley (The Long View, October 17) that 'house prices are not low,' Mr Riley does not go far enough. In 1979, before Lady Thatcher's first general election victory, a typical mortgage of under Pounds 20,000 was well within the Pounds 25,000 ceiling for mortgage interest tax relief. With higher basic rates of income tax in those far-off days, the interest on a typical mortgage received a 33 per cent tax subsidy. In 1992, only 60 per cent of a typical Pounds 50,000 mortgage is eligible for tax relief at a rate of 25 per cent. Mortgage interest nowadays, therefore, typically receives a tax subsidy of around 15 per cent. I contend that the changed tax regime means that the house price:earnings ratio needs to fall to somewhere in the range 2.5-3.0 to be comparable to the historic average of 3.0-3.5. House prices are still too high, by a factor of about 20 per cent. Jonathan Lewis, 86 Slade Road, Portishead, Bristol BS20 9BB</p>

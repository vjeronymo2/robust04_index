			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (vii) Is needed elsewhere in the national security interest of the United States, as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. This authority may not be redelegated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Personal property to be transferred to the local redevelopment authority in support of its redevelopment plan is not subject to sections 202 and 203 of Public Law 81&hyph;152, ``Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended'' of June 30, 1949, 40 U.S.C. 483&hyph;484. If the real property is transferred without consideration, the personal property shall also be transferred without consideration. If the real property is transferred at or near estimated fair market value, the value of the personal property shall be included in the estimated fair market value of the real property. If the property is conveyed separately from the real property, the value of the personal property shall be that at which it is carried on the installation's property account or estimated fair market value as agreed to between the parties at the time of transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) In addition to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section, the Military Department or Defense Agency is authorized to substitute an item similar to one requested by the redevelopment authority. The substitute items may be drawn from another installation or from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service. It is the responsibility of the Military Department or Defense Agency that owns the property to find a similar item that may be suitable as a substitute. In this context, ``similar'' means the original and the proposed substitute item are designed and constructed for the same specific purpose. However, before substituting another item for the one being requested, the base commander shall consult with the redevelopment authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Personal property that is not needed by a major command (or its subordinates), a Federal Agency, or a local redevelopment authority (or a State or local jurisdiction in lieu of a local redevelopment authority) shall be transferred to a Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office for processing in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 483 et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Minimum level of maintenance and repair to support nonmilitary purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section provides procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The level of maintenance will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2902 states that the Secretary may not reduce the level of maintenance and repair of facilities or equipment at the installation below the minimum levels required to support the use of such facilities or equipment for nonmilitary purposes, except when the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines that such reduction is in the National Security interest of the United States. This requirement remains in effect until one of the time periods in paragraph (h)(4) of this section has expired. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

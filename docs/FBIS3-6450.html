			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, March 17 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At the  opening of the spring session of the Mongolian Parliament, the  prime minister of the country, P. Jasray, made a speech about  the course of realization of the government programme for 1994.  In his speech, he outlined in few words the socioeconomic  situation in the country. As he said, wintering and breeding of  cattle are going on relatively well, and if such a state of  things remains further, so in the current year in the country  8.2 million heads of young cattle can be raised. At the same  time, there are difficulties in carrying out the spring field  works in consequence of the fact that agricultural technical  fleet is not ready for sowing, and financial situation in  agricultural units remains complicated.    In industry the volume of production of goods has dropped by  1.6 percent, compared with the same period of the last year.  Increased is production of 16 kinds of goods out of 60 main  kinds of goods, including production of concentrated copper has  increased by 75 percent, concentrated copper has increased by 75  percent, concentrated molybdenum by 2 times, lime and fluorspar  by 11-28 percent, leather and knitted wear by 66-70 percent, and  carpets and cashmere articles by 5-5.6 percent. The main  problems producers are facing now, as the prime minister said,  are lack of financial means, absence of a market for sale of  finished articles, misfirings in electric energy supply, and the  fact that reconstructions are not finished.    As the prime minister said, cases of breakdown and damages  at  electric power stations, misfirings in electric energy supply,  which have become frequent, are connected with irresponsibility  of definite persons. In connection with this, the prime  minister announced that officials who are guilty of creation of  such a situation should bear the responsibility for this.    External trade turnover in the first two months of the  current year, said P. Jasray, has reached 52.2 million U.S.  dollars, having a positive balance worth 24 million U.S. dollars.    In the same period the state budget incomes have constituted  8.9 billion tugriks, when expenses constituted 11.9 billion  tugriks. Thus, the budget expense volume turned out to be by 2  billion tugriks lower than the planned level. But, said the  prime minister, because of the lack of means we failed to  realize financing worth 3.7 billion tugriks.    The centralized state budget losses constituted 1.5 billion  tugriks.    According to the data of Mongol Bank, by 1 March, the volume  of outbank money turnover constituted 8.5 billion tugriks.    In the last months, said the prime minister, a tendency for  reduction of increase of prices and inflation for their  stabilization is to be observed.    Market is being provided with goods normally.    As the prime minister said, since the beginning of the  current year a tendency for reduction of the national currency  rate is appearing. But this fluctuation should be considered as  a normal thing for a market economy.    Mongol Bank has sufficient currency reserves for carrying  out  intervention to market in case of need.    Summing up this part of his speech, the government head  appraised the present economic situation as positive. In his  view, market relations are extending, relative stability on the  main macro- showings is being marked. [sentence as received]    In the second part of his speech, the Mongolian premier  spoke  about the main directions of socioeconomic policy of the  government for the current year. The government, he said,  considers as its basic task strengthening of positive starts in  economy, restoration and revival of industrial potential.    In connection with this, he defined six priority  orientations  of the government activity.    Among them there are restoration of national industrial  potential with assistance of mechanisms of the state market  regulation, priority development of infrastructure, light and  oil industries, private sector of economy, and food supply of  the population.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / TUC condemns plans for redundancy selection An unexpected provision in the government's de-regulation bill that will allow companies to select employees for redundancy even if it contravenes 'customary arrangements' or 'agreed procedures' was condemned last night by the trades union congress. The proposed change in the law will end the hallowed industrial relations principle of 'last in, first out'. Mr Brendan Barber, the TUC's deputy general secretary, said: 'plans to make it possible for employers to override agreements and to select who they wish for redundancy is just another kick in the teeth for good industrial relations.' At present under the employment protection (consolidation act) 1978 any employer who selects workers for redundancy could face a charge of 'unfair dismissal' before an industrial tribunal. the government believes the existing law is 'unnecessarily restrictive' and believes 'employers ought to have flexibility to adapt to current circumstances'. The government argues: 'employees' interests would still be protected because in the event of a claim of unfair dismissal an industrial tribunal would consider whether an employer had acted fairly in the circumstances.' 'The government's proposal The bill will also enable the repeal of outdated health and safety legislation subject to consultation with the health and safety commission. A report on the benefits and costs of health and safety regulations by the commission will be submitted to mr david hunt, the employment secretary, in april. Mr Frank Davies, the commission's chairman, said yesterday: 'I cannot conceive the commission will recommend anything which will lower health and safety standards overall nor could I believe the government would accept it if we did.' The bill also proposes that employment agencies will no longer have to be licensed before starting up.</p>

"We have no information on the concerned letters and we only  found out about them just from reading newspapers," H. Fournier,  chief ICRC representative in Indonesia, told THE JAKARTA POST.    Xanana, who is serving a 20-year jail term at the Cipinang  Correctional Institution, reportedly wrote letters to Portugal  and the International Court of Justice pleading for their  intervention and demanding a new trial by the world court.    The letters, whose existence was first disclosed by the  Portuguese press, have been the subject of an investigation by  the Indonesian authorities.    Director General for Correctional Institutions Baharuddin  Lopa said the letters were believed to have been sent by Xanana  through his mother and an ICRC official who visited him at  Cipinang last month.    Fournier said he had received no letters from Xanana's  mother  and other family members on a visit to the prison between  December 8 and December 11, 1993.    "The family visit was under supervision of concerned  authorities at the prison and several officials of the  Indonesian Red Cross," he said.    He said it was true that the ICRC had jointly organized the  visit to East Timorese detainees at the prison with the local  Red Cross office, but that it knew nothing about the letters.    He said he had also clarified the matter with the Indonesian  authorities to their entire satisfaction.    Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung said last week  that he believed the letters to be genuine, but did not rule out  the possibility that they had been written by someone other than  Xanana.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives met this morning in an  ordinary session chaired by brother Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih,  a member of the office of the Speaker of the House of  Representatives. After reviewing and ratifying the minutes of  the previous session, the House conducted a lengthy and  responsible discussion of conditions in our country. The House  issued the following statements:    Thanks be to God, whose blessing we beseech in calamity, and  who says in the Holy Koran: All believers are brothers; and who  also says: There is the type of man whose speech about this  world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness about  what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies.  When he turns his back his aim everywhere is to spread mischief  throughout the Earth and destroy crops and cattle, but God  loveth not mischief. [Koranic verse]    In its Wednesday, 11 May 1994 session, the House of  Representatives discussed the ugly crime committed by Socialist  Party outlaws who used long-range missiles to strike civilian  targets, murdering and terrorizing women, children, the elderly,  and the disabled who were asleep in their homes. These  missiles, paid for with the food and sweat of our people, struck  them and tore apart their bodies. They had committed no crime,  except for their love of unity and their support of  Constitutional legitimacy and political pluralism, yet they were  murdered.    In the light of this, the House decided the following:    1. To strongly condemn this crime committed by Socialist  Party outlaws and to hold the perpetrators completely  responsibile. The crime reveals the extent of the hatred  harbored by these criminals and the scope of their terrorist  acts against the Yemeni people. They want to achieve their  selfish interests by killing the innocent and destroying the  people's structures and achievements in unity, democracy, and  peace.    2. The House considers these crimes to violate Islamic  values and teachings, as well as international and humanitarian  norms that forbid the murder of the elderly, women, children,  and the disabled. These savage acts are ugly war crimes and high  treason directed against God and the homeland. Its perpetrators  deserve the severest punishment.    3. The House urges all members and segments of society, its  political forces and its popular organizations to denounce and  condemn these ugly crimes and to defend unity, democracy,  pluralism, and Constitutional legitimacy, which guarantee the  security and stability of Yemen and its people. The House urges  the Arab, Muslim, and world public opinion and all international  organizations and honorable forces concerned with the defense of  human rights to denounce and condemn these crimes.    4. The executive power must take all necessary legal and  Constitutional steps to deter these murderers and bring them to  justice and to apply the necessary legal, and deterrent  punishment against them.    5. The House urges the government to take the steps  necessary to provide full care for the families of the victims  of the Scud missiles and to consider these victims martyrs of  unity, democracy, and legitimacy.    The House stresses that Yemen and its unity, which was  built by the blood and sweat of its people, is invulnerable to  enemies and will remain an illuminating torch protecting  national, pan-Arab, and Islamic security. It stresses that  victory will, God willing, be for unity and unionists.    The House urges unionists in the Socialist Party, both the  civilian and military, to support Constitutional legitimacy and  reject these criminal acts.    The mercy of God be upon our pure martyr. God spare our  country any evil. From God we seek support.    The Republic of Yemen's House of Representatives noted the  responsible and sincere positions taken by some Arab parliaments  that support Yemeni unity, which was achieved thanks to God  almighty and the Yemeni people's long struggle, and which is  considered a candle lighting the path of Arab and Muslim unity.    The House highly praises the position of the House of  Representatives in fraternal Jordan, as well as the other Arab  parliaments, and the sincere statements they issued in support  of Yemeni unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which the  advocates of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party's  leadership tried to violate in an attempt to push the country  into the furnace of a destructive and all-out war on all levels.    Since the start of the crisis fabricated by that gang, who  are violating Constitutional legitimacy, the House has been  stressing the need to preserve the achievements of unity and  democracy in Yemen. It considers them achievements of the Arab  and Muslim nations. The House, therefore, urges Arab  parliaments and regional and international organizations to  denounce and condemn the use by the secessionist gang of the  Socialist Party of weapons of mass destruction against civilians  in certain Yemeni cities, including the capital of Yemeni unity,  Sanaa, and Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah.    The House appeals to fraternal and friendly parliaments and  regional and international organizations to motivate their  governments and media to adjust the way they view the events in  the Yemeni arena. This must be seen as an internal affair  between Constitutional legitimacy and the rebellious gang, and  not a war between north and south, as some people, intentionally  or unintentionally, are saying.    We beseech God to protect our country from any evil and  protect all of our Arab and Muslim countries from any harm. We  beseech him to grant peace and stability to the entire world.  From God we seek success.</p>

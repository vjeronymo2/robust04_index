			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: DFC NZ pays NZDollars 600m debt to big creditors DFC NZ, the troubled investment bank, yesterday made a NZDollars 600m (USDollars 353m) payment to large creditors, meaning that NZDollars 1.7bn of the former government-owned bank's debt of NZDollars 2.2bn has been settled, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. DFC's statutory manager, Mr Sandy Maier, said the NZDollars 600m principal and interest payment was on schedule. He said the level of remaining payments depended on recoveries from DFC's loan portfolio. Asset realisations were on target and creditors were being given the highest anticipated level of principal repayment, said Mr Maier. He added that 77 per cent of DFC's debt and 91 per cent of money owing to its creditors had been settled. DFC was placed in statutory management in October 1989. Holders of retail debt were paid off last August, and remaining creditors were split into holders of first, second and third-tier debt. Mr Maier said 300 creditors were still to be paid. The repayment funds are coming from property asset sales.</p>

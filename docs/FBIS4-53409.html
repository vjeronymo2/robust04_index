			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Anti-U.S. Joint Meeting of Students in North and South </F> Korea To Mark 14th Anniversary of Heroic Kwangju Popular  Uprising" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- An anti-U.S. joint  meeting of Kim Chaek University of Technology in the North and  Chonnam National University in South Korea took place here today  to mark the 14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular  uprising.    The joint meeting was due to be held in Pyongyang and  Kwangju  of South Korea at the same time today on the patriotic  initiative of the General Student Council of Chonnam National  University to realize the noble aspirations of the participants  in the uprising.    Speaking at the meeting here, Pak Chang-kwang, vice-chairman  of the Student Committee Kim Chaek University of Technology, and  others said although the Kwangju popular uprising which started  because of the frantic repressive offensive by the U.S.  imperialists and their stooges, the remnants of "Yusin", failed  due to brutal armed suppression by the oppressors, it was a just  patriotic resistance which recorded a most brilliant chapter in  the South Korean students and people's history of anti-U.S.,  anti-fascist struggle and the biggest massive uprising  unprecedented in the modern history of national liberation  struggle.    They pointed out that the noble desire of the participants  in  the Kwangju popular uprising for independence, democracy and  reunification has not been realized although 14 years have  passed since the uprising and the rancour of thousands of  Kwangju citizens who were murdered in cold blood has not been  wreaked.    Noting that the U.S. imperialists were pushing the situation  on the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go phase of nuclear war  on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK,  they said the South Korean students and people should wage a  more unremitting anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to  get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and their nuclear  weapons withdrawn from South Korea and smash their nuclear war  provocation moves.    They stressed that the entire students of the university  would join hands firmly with the fellow students of Chonnam  National University in South Korea and wage a vigorous struggle  to achieve national unity and make a breakthrough in the  reunification of the country, upholding the "10-point programme  of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of  the country" advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song.    A declaration on the establishment of sisterly relations and  a resolution on the joint struggle against the U.S. imperialists  and for the resignation of Kim Yong-sam were read at the  meeting.    The resolution says they, as students responsible for the  future of the country and the nation, cannot remain a mere  onlooker to the aggressive and treacherous acts of the United  States and its stooges. It indicates common fighting goals of  the students of Kim Chaek University of Technology and Chonnam  National University to decisively counter them.    The declaration says the students in the North and the South  would develop independent exchange and contribute to achieving  the great unity of the whole nation, assume their looks as  students of the generation of reunification and contribute to  the reunification of the country in '95.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dun &amp; Bradstreet to sell Datastream operation DUN &amp; Bradstreet, the US business information group, is selling its Datastream International operation to Primark, a Virginia-based holding company, for Dollars 191m. Datastream, based in London, provides on-line investment information, research and portfolio accounting services on securities internationally. Its revenues in the year to end-November were Dollars 94.5m, and it employs around 640 people worldwide. Dun &amp; Bradstreet acquired Datastream in 1984 for Dollars 102m. The New York-based company tried to sell the operation - with its Interactive Data subsidiary - in 1990, but called off the auction in November that year. Yesterday, Primark said it had been a 'very interested' buyer then. When D&amp;B received renewed inquiries about Datastream this spring, discussions with Primark restarted. Until recently, Primark was a utility-based conglomerate. However, under the chairmanship of Mr Joseph Kasputys, a former acquisitions chief at McGraw-Hill, it is steadily being transformed in an information services group. Primark has already made two recent purchases in this area: Wellmark, an electronic clinical and financial information system for medical centres and insurance carriers and The Analytic Sciences Corporation (TASC). Yesterday, Mr Kasputys said Primark planned to market Datastream more aggressively in the US, and hoped to expand the information services. He cited data on 'emerging' stock markets, in the merger and acquisition field, and added portfolio valuation services as potential growth areas. He also suggested co-operation between TASC and Datastream could bring technological improvements. Under the deal, Primark will pay D&amp;B Dollars 145m in cash, and approximately Dollars 46m in zero-coupon notes (on an original issue discount basis). Mellon Bank and Barclays Bank have provided a commitment letter for Dollars 80m of loan finance. D&amp;B said yesterday that it had no plans to open another auction for its Interactive Data subsidiary.</p>

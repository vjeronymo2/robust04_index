			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Waigel warns of DM10bn fall in total tax revenues OVERALL tax revenues in Germany next year will be DM10bn (Dollars 6.5bn) less than forecast, because of the downturn in the economy, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, reported yesterday. The fall in income for the central government budget amounts to DM6.7bn, according to the figures published by the finance ministry. The sum will now have to be added to the net borrowing requirement. Instead of a budget deficit of DM38bn, it is now forecast at DM44bn, with the DM700m gap to be met by increased income from other sources, including privatisation. The government seeks savings in next year's budget. The ruling coalition parties yesterday proposed a one per cent cut in all public service personnel, as part of the 'solidarity pact' between central government, the 16 federal states, local government, trade unions and industry.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Signals point in opposite directions Friday's announcement from Mr Alan Greenspan that the Federal Reserve was tightening US monetary policy came at the end of a week which had seen sharp rises in world equity markets. South Africa led the way as the political outlook improved and foreign investors began to return. In Asia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan put in impressive performances, as did Finland and Italy in Europe. Developments in Washington during last week had left strategists in little doubt that US rates were about to rise. But there were striking differences in their views on the likely consequences and on the game plans that investors should adopt. On Thursday, Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson wrote: 'In the US, Alan Greenspan could not have been clearer. He regards 3 per cent as an excessively low interest rate which has served its purpose to eliminate the banking crisis and alleviate the credit crunch. The Fed does not care what headline inflation is, rates are heading higher soon.' Mr Edwards' response was to repeat the message he has been sending since November 4: 'Hold cash.' But at Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani thought it unlikely that the global bull run would end when US rates began to rise: 'Evidence suggests that individual investors are slow to react to changes in interest rates. Looking at the last three troughs in rates, individual ownership of equities continued to rise even after interest rates had started to rise . . . Historically, individuals typically will only have made 10 per cent of the total eventual adjustment to a given change in interest rates after six months.' Mr Wadhwani argued that individual investors had still not fully adjusted their portfolios to the decline in interest rates that had already occurred. Consequently, even if rates began to rise, it was likely that ownership of equities would continue to increase over the next year. He added that even if individual investors did not sell equities when interest rates began to rise, share prices might, nevertheless, fall because other investors mistakenly believed that individuals were about to sell. 'We would view such price weakness as a buying opportunity,' he wrote, a view he was reiterating yesterday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change              % change in local currency*          sterling* in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week   4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of  Start of   Start of                                              1993      1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.12     +3.15    +43.64    +46.90    +38.45     +36.42 Belgium       +0.39     +0.77    +26.27    +35.74    +28.05     +26.17 Denmark       +0.70     +5.81    +37.82    +56.28    +47.67     +45.50 Finland       +5.21    +14.25   +126.95   +137.91   +128.47    +125.14 France        +0.73     +1.92    +31.66    +32.99    +26.56     +24.70 Germany       +0.40     -2.69    +32.04    +37.75    +30.44     +28.52 Ireland       +0.09     +0.08    +53.53    +68.59    +51.32     +49.09 Italy         +4.11    +14.12    +39.67    +58.89    +41.28     +39.20 Netherlands   +1.03     +1.63    +39.93    +45.66    +38.32     +36.29 Norway        +1.74     +7.70    +56.01    +59.98    +50.67     +48.46 Spain         +1.05     +8.52    +44.56    +62.92    +34.73     +32.76 Sweden        +1.43     +5.53    +58.51    +54.14    +41.01     +38.93 Switzerland   +0.78     +4.13    +50.69    +54.12    +58.57     +56.23 UK            +0.85     +1.24    +22.79    +24.84    +24.84     +23.01 EUROPE        +0.98     +2.23    +32.35    +36.62    +32.11     +30.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +3.61     +6.58    +47.72    +44.89    +52.88     +50.64 Hong Kong     +5.58     +8.16   +113.65   +122.01   +125.83    +122.52 Japan         +5.51     +8.38    +23.92    +23.43    +44.70     +42.58 Malaysia      +6.74     -3.66   +105.23   +111.22   +102.66     +99.69 New Zealand   +3.77     +8.50    +61.75    +60.44    +81.00     +78.34 Singapore     +3.93     -1.04    +56.08    +62.96    +70.84     +68.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.90     +0.01    +25.60    +25.40    +21.77     +19.98 USA           -1.86     -0.02     +4.02     +7.31     +8.91      +7.31 Mexico        +4.48     +5.73    +70.57    +56.95    +60.05     +57.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +7.05     -1.67    +53.35    +63.76    +83.48     +80.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.43     +3.11    +20.07    +22.62    +28.26     +26.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on February 4th 1994.

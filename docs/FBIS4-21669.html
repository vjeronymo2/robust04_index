			<p>BFN     [Text] The press center of the Russian missile force has  disclosed that during the recent incident at a strategic  military unit in Siberia there was no threat to the population  whatsoever.    As has been reported, on 10 March a soldier on duty suddenly  opened fire and killed his commanding officer and wounded  several other fellow servicemen. The soldiers guarding the  military facility refrained from returning fire for fear of  hitting the fuel tanks of missiles with nuclear warheads.    According to the statement from the press center of the  missile force, the system of the duty roster in such units  guarantees nuclear security in ordinary as well as in emergency  situations. Information carried by the daily IZVESTIYA about a  supposed threat of a nuclear missile conflict is groundless, the  statement says.</p>

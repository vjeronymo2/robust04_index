			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> SHELL TO PAY $2.1 MILLION  </P> <P> Shell Oil Co. has agreed to pay the city $2.1 million to settle an eight-year  legal dispute over franchise fees for an underground crude oil pipeline that  runs through the city.  </P> <P> The settlement clears the way for a new franchise agreement. City Atty. Robert  M. Myers is recommending an annual fee of $12,000 for a new 20-year franchise  for the 3.9-mile-long pipeline. The City Council is scheduled to hold a public  hearing on the proposed franchise Aug. 22.  </P> <P> The legal squabble began in 1981 when Shell's 40-year franchise expired. City  officials recommended a new annual fee of $237,000, based on the market value  of the land that the pipeline traveled through.  </P> <P> Shell sued, contending that the fee was excessive and interfered with federal  commerce. But the courts upheld the fee, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to  review the case.  </P> <P> Last year, Shell paid the city $1.7 million in back fees based on the new rate,  but then filed a new suit to acquire an easement on the land the pipeline ran  through and sought a trial to establish the value of the land. The city  countersued for breach of contract.  </P> <P> The settlement agreement calls for both sides to drop all legal action.  </P></p>

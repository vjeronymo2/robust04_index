			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Dye and Pigment Industries Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The dye and pigment industries are comprised of three separate industries,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented by three different trade associations. The Color Pigment Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (CPMA) represents pigment manufacturers, the Ecological and Toxicological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) represents dye manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the International Association of Color Manufacturers (IACM) represents food, drug, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cosmetic (FD&amp;C) colorants manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dyes are intensely colored or fluorescent organic substances that impart color to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substrate by selective absorption of light. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  When a dye is applied, it penetrates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substrate in a soluble form, after which it may or may not become insoluble. Dyes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained in the substrate by physical absorption, salt or metal-complex formation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solution, mechanical retention, or by the formation of ionic or covalent chemical bonds. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Pigments_A Primer,'' reprinted from American Ink Maker, June 1989, Color Pigment Manufacturers Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology_Volume 8, ``Dyes and Dye Intermediates.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dyes are used to color fabrics, leather, paper, ink, lacquers, varnishes, plastics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cosmetics, and some food items. Dye manufacture in the U.S. includes more than 2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual dyes, the majority of which are produced in quantities of less than 50,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds. In 1990, total U.S. dye production was 258 million pounds. In 1991, there were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 33 manufacturing plants operated by 20 companies that produce either azo,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire Data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pigments possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from dyes and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorants. Pigments are colored, black, white, or fluorescent particulate organic or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inorganic solids, usually insoluble in, and essentially physically and chemically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unaffected by, the vehicle or substrate in which they are incorporated. The primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between pigments and dyes is that during the application process, pigments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insoluble in the substrate. Pigments also retain a crystalline or particulate structure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and impart color by selective absorption or by scattering of light. With dyes, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure is temporarily altered during the application process, and imparts color only by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selective absorption. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Pigments_A Primer,'' reprinted from American Ink Maker, June 1989, Color Pigment Manufacturers Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pigments are used in a variety of applications; the primary use is in printing inks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are fewer pigments produced than dyes, though pigment batches are generally larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in size. The U.S. total 1990 pigment production volume of approximately 415 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds is composed of 300 million pounds of inorganic pigments and 115 million pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic pigments. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In 1991, there were approximately 27 domestic manufacturing plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated by 20 companies <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  producing organic pigments subject to the settlement agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CPMA meeting presentation, August, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire Data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FD&amp;C colorants are dyes and pigments that have been approved by the Food and Drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (FDA) for use in food items, drugs, and/or cosmetics. Typically, FD&amp;C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorants are azo or triarylmethane dyes and are similar or identical to larger-volume dye  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products not used in food, drugs, and cosmetics. Manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to that for the corresponding dye or pigment, except that the colorant undergoes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional purification. Each FD&amp;C colorant batch is tested and certified by the FDA. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991, there were approximately 7 domestic manufacturing plants operated by 5 companies <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  producing FD&amp;C colorants subject to the EDF settlement agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire Data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal addresses the three chemical classes of organic dyes and pigments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the settlement agreement: azos, anthraquinones, and triarylmethanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Azos are the largest and most versatile chemical class. The various azo chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structures are readily synthesized, typical product application methods are not complex,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a broad range of colors can be produced with excellent fastness properties. Azo  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorants are used in essentially all organic dye applications, including textiles, paper,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inks, coatings, plastics, and leather.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pyrazolones are a subset of azo dyes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments, named for the substituted pyrazolones that are used as coupling agents. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pyrazolone subclass is comprised mainly of yellow, orange, and red azo dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pyrazolone dyes and pigments are used primarily in textiles and plastics, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite high costs, anthraquinones are an important group of dyes due to superior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fastness. They have applications on cotton, cellulose, and synthetic fibers. They have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good affinity for the substrate, level dyeing power, and excellent fastness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anthraquinone pigments are chemically identical to the corresponding dyestuffs and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhibit high fastness properties. They are used primarily in automotive paints. There  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are many more anthraquinone dyes than pigments. Most anthraquinone dyes have not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed into pigments due to technical constraints, as well as competition from less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expensive substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Perylene pigments, a subset of the anthraquinone chemical class, provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economical alternative to heavy metal-containing red pigments. Their excellent thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stability and fastness properties meet the standards for automotive finishes and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-quality coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Triarylmethanes are characterized by their brilliancy of hue, intensity of color, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low fastness properties. Triarylmethane dyes typically are used in the textile industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in the production of pigments. Pigments typically are used in the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> printing and duplicating inks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes at record high for sixth day running Wall Street US stock markets, continuing the remarkable rally of the past two weeks, surged strongly upwards again yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving for the first time through the 3,200 barrier in afternoon trading to close at a record high for the sixth consecutive day, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The Dow ended the day at 3,201.48, up 29.07. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with some 222m shares changing hands, and advancing shares outnumbered declining ones by 1,074 to 651. The broader Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index closed at 419.34, up 2.08, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks finished at 592.65, up 6.20. The government bond market saw a continuation of Thursday's sell-off, but this was attributed mainly to profit-taking rather than a change in the market's generally bullish mood of the past few weeks. A 0.6 per cent rise in factory orders in November was brushed aside. The market was more interested in the release of weekly money supply data, expected later in the afternoon. The benchmark long bond was quoted near the close at 106 1/8 , down 1/4 to yield 7.48, while the 10-year note was quoted at 104 21/32 , down  15/32 , to yield 6.83. On the New York Stock Exchange, stocks dipped at the opening, turned higher, and retreated again before moving more firmly higher in late morning, with buyers moving in on each sign of weakness. Traders said the late afternoon surge through 3,200 was due in part to program trading and short covering, but was supported by firm institutional buying throughout the day. The three big US car manufacturers were strong performers, apparently thanks to a rating upgrade from an analyst at brokers Dean Witter Reynolds. General Motors, which is rationalising, closed up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 32 1/2 , Chrysler was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 13 3/8 , while Ford was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 30 3/8 . The rise came in spite of Thursday's announcement that mid-December car sales slumped to the lowest level in an already poor year. However, some informal reports from dealers suggest that the Federal Reserve's sharp December 20 cut in interest rates - the driving force behind the current stock market rally - may have given a fillip to late December car sales. IBM closed at Dollars 90 3/8 , up Dollars  1/8 , while General Electric was at Dollars 76 1/4 , down Dollars  3/8 . American Telephone and Telegraph closed at Dollars 39 5/8 , up Dollars  3/8 . Many leading US retailers produced sales figures for the crucial December period yesterday and Wal-Mart, the fast-expanding Southern group, which reported a 5 per cent rise on a same-store basis, was one of the day's most heavily traded stocks. It closed at Dollars 57 3/4 , down Dollars 1 3/8 . Gap, the fashion clothes retailer, was up Dollars 3 at Dollars 58 3/4 after reporting a 14 per cent rise in same store sales. Sears dropped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 after reporting a 1.8 per cent drop in same-store sales. Canada TORONTO stocks climbed in light trading. The composite index gained 23.81 points, or 0.68 per cent, to 3,517.47, as winning issues topped losers 348 to 204. The index was up 75.56 points or 2.2 per cent on the week. Volume grew to 18.664m shares from 11.595m, and trading value was CDollars 222.7m against CDollars 124.4m. International Petroleum Corp. reported 'encouraging' oil shows from a well in Libya in which it has an interest. The stock gained  3/4 to 6 3/4 .</p>

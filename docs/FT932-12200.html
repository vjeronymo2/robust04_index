			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / BTP agrees to pay Pounds 100m for MTM assets BTP, the fine chemical company, is to pay Pounds 100m for most of the assets of MTM, the fine chemical company under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and operating under the sufferance of its banks. The deal has given BTP a substantial chemicals manufacturing base in the US, where MTM's most profitable factory is based, and what the company calls a 'chemistry kit' of substantially under-utilised plant. Funded by a two-for-five rights issue at 185p, the deal increases BTP's equity by 40 per cent but doubles its net assets. MTM's banks, led by Chase Manhattan, will write off Pounds 30m of the Pounds 120m debt they are owed and make available Pounds 10m of new money to MTM. In return they will take a 29.9 per cent stake in this rump company, which is left with an agro-chemical business breaking even on sales of Pounds 20m. Before BTP approached them, the banks had been considering a Pounds 40m debt write-off in return for 80 per cent equity in MTM. That deal would have left them with an uncertain and painfully slow work-out and heavily diluted existing shareholders. Under the new deal the banks receive Pounds 90m almost immediately. The MTM operating companies have a chance to escape from 12 months of management turmoil and the debilitating effect of having to find sufficient cash to meet Pounds 8m of professional fees connected with the rescue. Some MTM shareholders were yesterday grateful that Mr Ken Schofield, MTM chairman, had retrieved something for them. MTM's assets are understood to have been valued at about Pounds 80m in a liquidation. However, some shareholders  - who stumped up 140p a share in MTM's last rights issue in 1990 - are expected to ask why BTP only bought the assets. BTP said yesterday it would have made a full bid but the SFO inquiries into MTM's profits would have made a rights issue underwriting very difficult. BTP is buying Pounds 82m of assets. These include profitable plants at Hardwicke, South Carolina, and Leek and John Ross in the UK. In addition there are loss-making plants at Rock Hill in the US and Kirkby and Teesport, which BTP says are under-utilised but 'well suited to BTP's expansion requirements'. Mr Frank Buckley, BTP chairman, said the acquisitions would be an excellent bridgehead into the US and that the group had sufficient business to put into the Teesport and Kirkby plant. BTP will raise Pounds 72.2m through the rights issue. The balance will come from debt - which increases to Pounds 30m and leaves the company with gearing of about 26 per cent. BTP's share price rose 11p to 250p while MTM fell 1p to close at 10.5p. Lex, Page 26 Observer, Page 25</p>

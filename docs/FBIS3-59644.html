			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As part of the performance tests of the prototype  Monju FBR (rated output, 28 kW; located in in Tsuruga-shi, Fukui  Prefecture), the initial criticality of which is scheduled for  April 1994, the PNC loaded neutron source fuel assemblies into  reactor core and began criticality tests on 12 October. The task  of loading the reactor core fuel assemblies (198 assemblies) is  to begin today, 13 October.    The objectives of the criticality tests are to load the fuel  and achieve initial criticality, and then to perform the initial  core configuration. The tests will continue until next June,  then the PNC plans to shift into core physical tests, in which  the reactivity values of the control rods (which regulate the  reactor's output) will be measured.</p>

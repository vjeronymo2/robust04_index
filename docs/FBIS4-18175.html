			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anthos Likavyis] </F>   [Excerpt] The Greek Cypriot side considers the increasing  Turkish claims regarding the supposed presence and training of  Kurdish and Armenian fighters in Cyprus as an obvious and  outright attempt to step up pretenses.    An official source described these claims as unfounded and  dangerous. Political circles note:    First: The Turks give details regarding the supposed  presence of such foreigners in Cyprus to create more convincing  impressions for third parties.    Second: There is an effort to involve other countries, such  as Armenia and Azerbaijan, and cause wider concern.    The goal is to divert attention from impressions of the  murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis [chairman of the Committee for  Solidarity With Kurdistan] by the Turkish Secret Service and to  justify its activities in the free areas of Cyprus with the  usual pretenses.    According to Foreign Ministry officials' statements, these  pretenses are systematically cultivated in the Turkish press and  are reproduced in the Turkish Cypriot newspapers to convey them  later, through propaganda bulletins, to other quarters.    These claims were brought back to light by [the Turkish  Cypriot newspaper] YENI DEMOKRAT, which published the  "information" regarding facilities offered by the Cypriot  Government to "Kurdish and Armenian terrorists."

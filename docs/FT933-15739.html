			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Northwest agrees deal with pilots NORTHWEST AIRLINES, the debt-burdened US carrier which is integrating its operations with those of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, yesterday staved off a bankruptcy filing by reaching an agreement with its pilots' union. The agreement, covering new contract terms and cost reductions, is a breakthrough for the carrier. In order for Northwest to remain viable outside the protection of the bankruptcy court, it needs significant labour concessions. Although the airline did not spell out details of its agreement yesterday, the deal is believed to include savings of about Dollars 365m from the pilots' group. This is in keeping with Northwest's plan, announced last year, to cut labour costs by Dollars 886m over three years. The airline's earlier offer to give employees a 30 per cent stake in the airline and three of its 15 board seats in exchange for pay concessions may have changed. The pact was approved overwhelmingly by leaders of Northwest's Air Line Pilots Association (Alpa) and no further vote is necessary by the union. The carrier still needs to reach revised agreements with its two other main unions - the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing flight attendants, and the International Association of Machinists. In May, Northwest reached agreements in principle with both groups, but the Teamsters halted a vote on their pact after members of the machinists' union voted against the deal. The airline had some success in rescheduling its loan repayments, reducing payments falling due in the next few years. Last week, the airline's banks approved a plan to defer most of the payments on a Dollars 1.29bn loan until 1997. Northwest is struggling under the burden of debt acquired when the airline was taken private in a Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989. Dire industry conditions have added to the carrier's woes. Northwest hopes to reach a voluntary restructuring agreement rather than reorganising while operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Since 1990, five big US carriers have entered Chapter 11. The Alpa agreement revived hopes that Northwest would soon reach an agreement with its other unions. The Teamsters Union said yesterday that a preliminary review of the main features of the Alpa agreement indicated that it seemed to fulfil their requirements for protecting members' interests while adding some options that the pilots' union had requested. The pilots' agreement, for example, apparently adds an option under which employees could forego the guarantee of repayment in exchange for a larger share of stock in the company. 'We are hopeful that the variation negotiated by the pilots will meet our members' needs,' said Ms Mary Don Erskin, Teamster Local 2000 president. 'If so, we expect to recommend ratification to our members.'</p>

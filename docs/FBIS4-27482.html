			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister recently issued Directive  No.235/TTG, dated 11 May, on the need to step up all-out debt  liquidation and debt solvency efforts in the second phase. The  directive points out: The total amount of debts to be collected  nationwide during the second phase will include 6,000 billion  dong, over 200 million U.S. dollars, and nearly 10 billion  (Japanese) yen. So far, over 70 percent of it has been listed,  determined, and confirmed and over 500 billion dong in debt have  been paid off. A number of localities and sectors have analyzed  the reasons for indebtedness, dealt with a number of cases of  breaches of stipulations on financial management and debt  repayment by various state enterprises and other economic  organizations.    However, the plan for all-out debt liquidation efforts in  the  second phase has been carried out very slowly. We have only  been able to list, determine, and confirm the amount of debts.  Up to 30 percent of of the debts listed so far have still not  been determined and confirmed, while the majority of those that  are have not been liquidated or dealt with. Because of a lack  of close guidance, a number of ministries, sectors, and  localities have adopted a wait- and-see attitude, have been  evasive, and have not been decisive when it comes to debt  settlement.    To step up debt liquidation and debt solvency and to  conclude  the second phase of debt liquidation within 1994 so as to  reestablish financial order and bring back normal work  conditions for enterprises, the prime minister hereby decides:    Debtor units must make full use of their existing sources of  capital, including cash, assets, goods, real estate, equipment,  and other valuables in their efforts to liquidate all their  confirmed debts. These cover those owed to domestic  enterprises, foreign debt, bank debts, and budget debts. As for  state enterprises that are still active, their management organs  must make them pay their debts within a set period. For  enterprises that have already been dissolved, deactivated, or  integrated into other enterprises, responsible organs must work  out specific measures in accordance with the stipulations now in  force to ensure that every enterprise concerned repays its debt.    From 1 July 1994 onward, the resolution of debts for  insolvent firms must be carried out in accordance with the law  on enterprise bankruptcy.    All cases of intentional delay or evasion of debt repayment  will be liable to administrative penalties and disciplinary  measures taken by relevant party organizations, if the debtors  are party members. In serious cases, violators will be  subjected to criminal liability as stipulated by the law  regardless of their position.    Debt liquidation and debt solvency must be carried out in  accordance with guidance memoranda already promulgated,  resolutely and urgently in the following ways:    a. Debts already listed and confirmed among state  enterprises that are still active must be settled immediately.  The standing board of the Central Steering Committee for Debt  Liquidation must guide debt liquidation and debt  solvency-related activities in accordance with procedures  applied in the first phase.    b. For debtor state enterprises already dissolved,  deactivated, or merged with other firms, the relevant debt  liquidation committees established to determine the property of  these enterprises are responsible for the debt liquidation task.  In the event the debt liquidation committees no longer exist,  the management organ and the one who endorsed the decision to  establish the debtor units are responsible for resolving the  debt liquidation issue. All property and capital of debtor  units that have already been mustered, transfered, or used for  other purposes must be recovered for debt repayment.    As for debts already guaranteed by paper, in the event  debtor  units become insolvent, the guarantor units or individuals must  shoulder the debt on behalf of the debtor units.    For enterprise management cadres who, out of their  irresponsiblity, cause a loss of capital and property or who  have been tempted to corruption and malfeasance while in office,  resolute measures should be taken to force them to pay  compensation. Depending on the severity of their offenses, they  must be subject to criminal liability and have their assets  seized. The debt liquidation committee of the managerial  echelon to which a debtor state enterprise belongs must take  measures to list the property of the debtor unit concerned for  sale to recover money for debt liquidation purposes. The debt  liguidation committee concerned is also authorized to confiscate  the assets of debtor enterprises which have been dissolved,  deactivated, or merged with other enterprises for debt  liquidation purposes.    For debtor enterprises that have been dissolved,  deactivated,  or merged with other enterprises, in addition to inspections of  their property and the full recovery of everything available for  debt liquidation, we must clearly specify the collective and  individual responsibilities of those organs that have ordered  the founding, dissolution, or merger of these enterprises.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> APPLE TO BUY BACK MORE STOCK  </P> <P> Apple Computer Inc. said today its board of directors has approved the  repurchase of up to 2.5 million additional shares of common stock.  </P> <P> The ongoing open-market purchases are part of a program announced last August  when Apple's board first authorized the purchase of 2.5 million shares.  </P> <P> John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the purchase  "represents good long-term value to our shareholders."  </P> <P> Last month, Apple projected a decline in earnings in the first quarter of  fiscal 1990 and said sales will grow more slowly than previously predicted.  </P> <P> That announcement surprised industry watchers, coming just two weeks after a  top executive of the personal computer maker told security analysts in New York  that it expected worldwide sales growth of more than 20%.  </P></p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Sterling bullish again THERE WAS much better sentiment about another UK base rate cut in the sterling money markets yesterday, following newspaper reports that building societies were threatening to raise their mortgage rates because of the government's National Savings policy, writes James Blitz. Several of Britain's biggest building societies were reported to be angry at the government's issue of a new First Option bond, and at new regulations increasing the amount that could be invested in national savings. The building societies have threatened to raise rates to try and staunch the flow of funds into the government's hands. This has prompted speculation that the UK authorities might respond to the situation by lowering base rates again. Easier conditions in the day-to-day cash market also helped to ease period rates. The Bank of England forecast a very small shortage of Pounds 50m at the start of the day, later revised up to Pounds 350m. The overnight cost of borrowing sterling in the interbank market was as low as 5 per cent for most of the day. In these conditions, three-month sterling cash fell to a close of around 5 15/16 per cent, having been above 6 per cent for most of the last two weeks. One-year money ended down at 5 13/16 per cent from a previous 5 15/16 per cent on Friday night. Short-dated futures climbed sharply, with some dealers suggesting that the contracts had been heavily oversold last week. The March contract finished 10 basis points ahead at 94.26 and the September contract up 12 basis points at 94.43. At this level, the market is coming close to pricing another 50 basis points off base rates by the autumn. In the German money market, futures prices were mostly unchanged as many dealers awaited the outcome of this week's operations by the Bundesbank. However, call money, which measures the overnight cost of borrowing D-Marks, continued to move sharply lower, following the reduction in three-day Treasury Bill interest rates last week. Liquidity levels in the market remained comfortable as the end of the month approached, pushing call money down to around 8.16 per cent, from 8.31 per cent on Friday. According to one London-based dealer, the fall in call money should bring down the rate in the Bundesbank's repo this week.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Major about to honour Thatcher A RUSH on stocks of scarlet and ermine robes looks certain next week as the prime minister gives final approval to a dissolution honours list, Ivo Dawnay writes. It will be heavy with the familiar names of departed cabinet ministers. Top billing on the list, due to be published on Friday, will be for Mrs Margaret Thatcher. As a former prime minister she is entitled to an earldom, but is said to have opted to go to the upper house with a simple life peerage, possibly as Baroness Thatcher of Finchley. To the surprise of some, Dr David Owen, the former SDP leader, is expected to be named a life peer on the recommendation of the prime minister. Other former cabinet ministers in line for the Lords include many big names of the Thatcher years - Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr Nigel Lawson, Mr Cecil Parkinson, Mr Nicholas Ridley, Mr Norman Tebbit, and Mr Peter Walker. But the glut of ex-cabinet ministers - by convention all are entitled to a life peerage on leaving the Commons - means some may be postponed. It is thought that Mr George Younger, who is due to inherit the title Viscount Younger of Leckie on the death of his father, may have offered to waive his claim for the time being to help the prime minister slim his list. For Labour, Mr Neil Kinnock will have prepared a list with guidance from Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, the party's leader in the Lords, who is known to favour promoting only those who will act as working peers. None the less, a peerage is thought certain for Mr Denis Healey, a former cabinet minister and the party's deputy leader from 1980 to 1983.</p>

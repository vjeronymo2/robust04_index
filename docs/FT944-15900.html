			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Popular Purcell - The Wigmore is getting in early on tercentenary celebrations It was the Mozart bicentenary that started the problem. There were countless new opera productions, complete cycles of the symphonies and concertos, in New York even the complete everything: so much Mozart was on offer that audiences were sated by the middle of the year. In the eyes of concert promoters the answer is to get in early. So keen were they to mark the centenary of Tchaikovsky's death that almost everything was over before the anniversary year arrived. For Purcell's tercentenary - official date 1995 - there is no need to wait. Sundry interesting events have already happened, such as a full stage production of The Indian Queen (don't worry - there are others to come) and the autumn looks as if it will be resounding to Purcell all round the country. The Wigmore Hall's tercentenary festival began on Thursday. William Lyne, the hall's director, had been doubtful as to whether nine evenings of Purcell might be too much for a Wigmore audience nourished on a steady diet of Schubert songs and Beethoven quartets, but he need not have worried. The seats quickly sold out, showing that strong marketing plus a smattering of well-known artists (Barbara Bonney and Anne Sofie von Otter among them) can be enough to draw the Wigmore regulars. The festival is under the directorship of Robert King, who has virtually turned Purcell into a one-man business. Listen to the concert, read his notes in the programme, then on the way out buy the book and recordings. It was shameful how much of Purcell's output was still waiting to be recorded even ten years ago and credit is due to King and the record company Hyperion for spotting such an important and worthwhile opportunity. For the last couple of years they have been engaged on the major undertaking of recording all Purcell's anthems and services, together with a short series of the secular solo songs. Before that, they had recorded the odes and welcome songs, two of which were featured on Thursday. The ode called 'Celebrate this festival' must have chosen itself, not just for the title, but also for the quality of its music. The penultimate stanza is pure Purcell: a high tenor urges an end to thoughts of war, accompanied by two plaintive recorders, but within minutes the mood has changed and the choir is wittily tossing back and forth the words 'repeat Maria's name', like an echo bouncing from one wall to another. It is a young man's music, quick with ideas, full of restless imagination. The pity is that a young man's music is all we have from Purcell, who died at the age of 36. The King's Consort has never sounded better than it did here at the Wigmore Hall, which suits King's brand of relaxed, warm music-making. There was some good singing, notably from Susan Gritton and the pair of counter-tenors, James Bowman and Robin Blaze, who drew the celebrated duet 'Sound the trumpet' in place of the high tenors that some scholars now regard as more authentic. If the Wigmore is wishing it had booked up more Purcell, there is still all of 1995 to go. Sponsored by The Friends of the Wigmore Hall</p>

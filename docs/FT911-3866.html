			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Management (The Growing Business): Clubbing together in a local network Local authorities should be required to assess the economic impact on small and medium-sized businesses of all policy proposals they make. This is one of the recommendations made in a study* of local support networks carried out by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Business in the Community. Councillors and local government officers should be encouraged to think through the impact of their programmes on local firms with the aim of reducing the burden on business. The models for this suggestion are the economic impact assessments required by the European Commission and the UK government on draft legislation. A first step to building a healthy local business environment is to identify key players in the community, the study says. These would include the local council, businesses, the Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), enterprise agencies, chamber of commerce and higher education. These organisations should agree the outline of the future economic development of the area and identify their role in achieving it. Enterprise agencies should be best placed to counsel small businesses; the chamber could provide information on continental European markets; while the local authority economic development unit might have details of sites available. The availability of information about local business support also needs to be improved, the report says. Businesses requiring assistance should be able to get help by making not more than two telephone calls. Many organisations advocate the grouping of different help organisations under one roof but the development of information technology makes this less necessary, the study argues. However, the use of information technology between providers of business support is patchy and compares unfavourably with the systems in use in continental Europe. The study urges better publicity about business support groups through the publication of directories and free magazines. The local authority also has an important role to fulfil in promoting a positive image of the area. As a next step Business in the Community has set up a target team to investigate good practice in other European countries which could be applied in the UK. *Local support for enterprise.

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers falls to Pounds 167,000 Stoddard Sekers International, the Renfrewshire-based carpet and furnishing fabric group, suffered a further sharp decline in profits in the six months to September 30. The shares fell 6p to 39p. Although turnover improved some 8 per cent to Pounds 27.4m - reflecting the inclusion of BMK for the full half year against just four months last time - the pre-tax line tumbled to Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 432,000). Mr Hugh Laughland, chairman, described the economic environment as in a 'fragile and patchy recovery mode'. Demand in the carpet industry remained flat and any volume gains were only being achieved 'in the face of extreme price pressure'. However, he said that order books in the carpet companies were ahead of the same stage of 1992. The interim is held at 0.75p.</p>

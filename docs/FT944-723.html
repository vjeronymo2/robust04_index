Mr Lodewijk Eggermont was named temporary chief executive officer and a final choice will be made by the second half of January. Mr John Goossens, chief executive of Alcatel Bell, is one of several candidates for the post.

The new board is made up of six private sector representatives including employers federation president Mr Georges Jacobs, three university professors and four executives of public companies.

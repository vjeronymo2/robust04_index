			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 04, BNS -- Russia must return all KGB  archives that were taken out of Lithuania after the August coup  in 1991, says Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the Lithuanian  Security Department.    The Russian ambassador to Lithuania earlier said that Russia  sees no legal basis for talks on the return of KGB archives.  But in Jurgelis' view, "the law is not necessary to return what  was stolen."    In an interview with Lithuania's top daily LIETUVOS RYTAS,  Jurgelis said Russia took out part of KGB files when Lithuania  restored its independence and became a sovereign state. Russia  also refuses to return any of the pre-war archives of Lithuanian  security services.    Jurgelis confirmed that around "11 or 12 sacks" of  information were stolen from the foreign intelligence department  of the KGB when the KGB building in Vilnius was taken over by  Lithuanian authorities soon after the 1991 coup. "There is no  doubt that the KGB files are in private hands," but the case was  closed due to lack of evidence, as well as because witnesses  changed their testimonies. Jurgelis confirmed that KGB  documents were used for blackmail in several cases.    The official said his department has information about  activities of foreign secret services in Lithuania but declined  to mention any details.</p>

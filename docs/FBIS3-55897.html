According to the minister the current call-up to active  military service is going successfully. At the same time, he  noted that the army should be run along professional lines and  stressed the importance of further improving the reserve system.    With respect to relations with the national guard, which was  set up during recent events in western Georgia, Karkarashvili  said those events had justified its existence at that time.  However, the guards status has still not been clarified. At  this point the minister stressed that his main aim is to create  a unified, disciplined, mobile and well armed army as a symbol  of the independent state.    Turning to the development of relations with Russia,  Georgia's minister of defense stated that they should be defined  on the basis of a treaty [Russian: na dogovornoy osnove]. As  for maintaining public order, mercenaries may come into the  picture but not units from the Russian Federation's ministry of  defense, as they do not have the appropriate status.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 27 Apr (INA) -- An official Yemeni source has  denied reports that Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni minister  of planning and development, has submitted his resignation.    In a statement to an INA correspondent, the official Yemeni  source dismissed such reports as completely baseless.    In its latest issue, the opposition Yemeni paper AL-WAHDAWI  said Dr. al-Irayni had resigned his ministerial post. The paper  said the resignation was kept quiet to allow time to convince  him to withdraw it.</p>

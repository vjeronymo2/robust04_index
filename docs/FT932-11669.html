			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Long View: Wheels within cycles CHOOSE YOUR stock market cliche: buy the rumour, sell the fact; sell on a strike (of oil, that is); to travel hopefully is better than to arrive. The cyclical behaviour of asset markets is well documented and analysed, yet can still seem perverse. The latest instance came this week in the UK equity market when the FT-SE 100 index slipped below 2,800, even though the latest GDP figures at last showed unequivocal evidence of economic recovery. On the Continent, the Bundesbank continued to cut German interest rates, only to trigger falls in stock and bond prices. Like TV news editors, are investors no longer interested in good news? Such reactions seem dramatically at variance with the mood of the markets early in the year when indications of recovering output and falling interest rates were seized on eagerly to justify rises in securities prices. To explain this shift, we tend to be fed implausible rationalisations, one being that falling German interest rates show just how dire the state of the German economy must be. In fact, securities markets are driven primarily by underlying flows of money. When that is plentiful, the markets go up - something that, typically, happens in recessions when most people are cautious, cut their spending and reduce their borrowings. Financial assets are the beneficiaries of this process. At some point in the recovery, however, confidence recovers and the financial flows begin to reverse. People and companies raise their spending on goods and services again. The tone of the markets changes. In the classical pattern there is a clear sequence to this. The bond markets peak first, fearing that interest rates will stop falling and will soon begin to rise. Indeed, when bond prices fall, it is precisely the same thing as saying that long-term interest rates are rising. The US long Treasury bond yield has climbed back above 6.9 per cent, having twice been down to 6.7 per cent earlier in the year. In the UK, five-year gilt yields, in the wake of this week's slightly disappointing auction of Pounds 3bn of Treasury 7 1/4 per cent 1998, have climbed by more than half a percentage point since the middle of March. The next stage - reached perhaps six months or a year later - is that the stock market peaks out, too. It has been buoyed up in the meantime by improving expectations for profits and dividends but, in the end, is overtaken by rising interest rates. Elsewhere, the property market is still at this point rising strongly, being driven mainly by rents or incomes that depend directly on the economic cycle, which is still in an upward phase. Property does not lead in the way that securities markets do. You might think that real estate values would be sensitive to interest rates, but property - both commercial and residential  -is illiquid, and there can be long lags before buyers and sellers respond to changing conditions. In bad times, sellers may refuse to deal rather than accept low prices, so the market could stagnate for extended periods; securities markets, however, are liquid and are run by market-makers who adjust almost instantaneously in order to find a new level at which there is two-way business. Finally there are the alternative markets which perform late in the cycle, perhaps because they are fuelled by the cash of entrepreneurs who have realised their stock market gains. By this time, investors also are looking for protection from inflation, a reason why gold could start to display a late-cycle turn of speed, although it has performed dismally since 1979. The particular feature of the present cycle appears to be that the markets have become even more international and liquidity-driven. Some of the time lags have, therefore, disappeared. In the UK, the All-Share index hit its 1993 high (so far) on March 8, the same day the long gilt market hit its high (and the US long bond hit one of its twin peaks). Because the steam has gone out of the main securities markets, investors are casting around for alternatives which have been lagging in the meanwhile, such as Japanese equities or gold. Although the speculators have been making a lot of noise, in neither case do the fundamentals look very exciting. True, different countries are at very different stages of the cycle: the US is well into an upturn (although the first quarter GNP figures were sluggish) and the UK clearly is recovering, too, but Germany and France are still heading into recession. However, the global nature of investment flows is tending to impose a common pattern on the markets (although the Tokyo stock market, as always, ploughs its own furrow). The particularly threatening feature of this economic cycle is the unusually large element of structural fiscal deficit in countries such as the US, the UK and Germany. Borrowing programmes that can be financed easily in a recession may prove very difficult in a more buoyant phase for the economy. Governments will have a responsibility to reduce their financial demands quickly, by cutting spending or raising taxes, in response to economic strength. Otherwise, there will be some kind of crunch, possibly a sudden one. The worry is that governments, in fact, respond very slowly. Already, Norman Lamont's spend-now, tax-later Budget is looking very out of date, and the complacent UK policy was roundly criticised by the IMF this week. In the US, also, there is a lack of urgency. Meanwhile, Germany could be approaching a very tricky phase as a weakening currency forces a reassessment by foreigners who now hold vast amounts of D-Mark paper. Essentially, long-term interest rates will have to edge up if all the government bonds are to be sold. It must then be asked if the deficit-prone governments are actually beginning to impede economic growth rather than encourage it. So, we are seeing a subtle change of mood. As the market men say, sell into strength.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Private View: The accountant who plays in the big league - Rick Parry, Premier League supremo, has created scoring chances. But will he get to kick the ball? EVERYTHING is run by accountants these days, even English football. Was that really appropriate, I asked Rick Parry, chief executive of the Premier League, as its first season dribbles to a close. 'What can I say but 'Yes'?', he replied, adding hastily: 'I don't really see myself as an accountant so much as somebody who is making use of the training.' With his big briefcase, little moustache and gently receding hairline Rick Parry, not yet 40, might pass for a successful computer salesman from Slough. His manner is brisk but bland. He employs the language of Briefcase Man ('at the end of the day' is a favourite phrase) but, to be fair, not once in two hours did he refer to The Bottom Line. You call football 'the product', I observed. 'I slip into it from time to time. I actually don't see it as a product because that's a gross oversimplification. To describe fans as customers is certainly unduly patronising. 'Nevertheless, there are certain basic lessons which need to be learned. Considering football has, or should have, a much more special relationship with its fans than any other business has with its customers it's remarkable how little football bothers to talk to its customers - far less than Sainsbury's or Marks &amp; Spencer would, for example.' Isn't it odd to use an industry or product model for what is after all a game? Don't you represent the ultimate commercialisation of the sport? 'Not at all. I'm a fan at heart.' He might have added that he was a good enough goalkeeper in his youth to be auditioned by Liverpool and Everton. 'Of course it's a sport, but that's too facile. At the end of the day it's a sport which pays participants huge wages. Clubs have to be run as businesses. They have to find about Pounds 250m to upgrade their stadia to comply with the Taylor Report (on ground safety). It's much more than just a game - always was ever since it became professional. Two Premier League clubs are quoted companies.' (At mid-week Manchester United stock went above 450p, a year's high; Tottenham Hotspur stood at 92p, near its low.) 'I'm a football fan through and through. I happen to have gained hopefully useful and relevant business experience. I'm not seen as a football person by insiders still, but I don't see myself as sort of grey businessman being brought in to become the sort of unacceptable face of football.' Nobody seems to know much about Rick Parry. Even his secretary could not think what to buy him for Christmas. He would be the first to admit he does not stand out in a crowd and, in a game of big mouths, is accused of having risen without trace. Yet the boy has come good; he's made the space, created the chances - a record Pounds 304m TV deal with BSkyB and BBC, a record Pounds 12m sponsorship from Bass - and he has dodged some heavy tackles from the hard men among the 22 club chairmen who make up the Premier League board. The chief executive sat on a bar stool drinking Coke and shovelling peanuts into his mouth. He nodded to Graham Taylor, the England manager, as he passed through the hotel lobby. He took a call from the Premier League's non-executive chairman, Sir John Quinton, former chairman of Barclays Bank. What interests you apart from football, I asked him. 'Nothing at the moment.' People say you are a closed book. 'Who says?' The phrase is mine, I replied, but it's the impression you give. Yet you seem approachable enough. 'I am, if anyone bothers to approach me. The thing that gets up my nose with certain members of your profession is that I get patronising comments about what I'm attempting to do from people who've never met me. 'I don't go shouting from the rooftops. I'm not flamboyant, I'm not looking to make a name for myself. That's not my style. But I wouldn't say I was a closed book.' You don't go rock-climbing or potholing or breed Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs? What about stamp-collecting - or train-spotting? I added unkindly. Parry did not flinch. 'I don't really have a lot of time to climb mountains. I used to do a lot of windsurfing. I used to sail. I used to play a lot of football. I like going to the theatre when we get the chance. I'm very family-centred really.' He lives near Chester with his wife Kate, who has no interest in football, and their sons James (10) and Tom (8), both keen players, on a salary of Pounds 120,000 plus car. They are buying a new house about 300 yards from their present one. A change of scenery is always nice, I said. Parry ignored this too, and looked serious. He had endured a lot of hostile publicity last May, he said, when ITV was thwarted in its bid to screen the Premier League. The family felt the pressure and he was determined to preserve a stable home life. Influenced by Brian Hall, a Liverpool player, who had studied science, Parry took two maths and physics at A level and read maths at Liverpool University. His father, the physical education instructor at Chester College, advised him to get a professional qualification. He joined the local branch of Arthur Young (now Ernst &amp; Young), qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1979. He went to work for Hoseasons, the canal and cottage holiday company in East Anglia, returning to Arthur Young as a sporting and leisure consultant. Through the firm's involvement with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and a series of connections and coincidences Parry was asked to co-ordinate Manchester's successive bids to host the Games. In between he was asked to advise the Football League on its managerial efficiency. In 1991, the Football Association, soccer's parent body, asked him to draw up a blueprint for the breakaway Premier League (the old first division). What is your relationship with the club chairmen? 'It's good. It's fine. We've had hiccups, we've had problems, but no illusions. It ain't ever going to be easy with those 22. I've not come across such passions, such extremes, in any other form of working life.' What are they about these passions? Parry sighed. 'I mean, you name it. I mean, it's the nature of the game. They're competing against each other every Saturday. There are big clubs, there are small clubs, northern clubs, southern clubs. There's a lot of self-interest, but trying to do things for the greater good.' Do they make you feel a bit small, a bit too youthful? He laughed ruefully. 'No, they're OK actually. If you recognise that you've been given two ears and one mouth and you use them them in that sort of ratio it's quite helpful.' You're the tactful type? 'We try to be. Doing the groundwork is the best technique. It's very difficult in a room of 22 to run things off the cuff. Hugely difficult. We've managed it on occasions because there was so much to lose . . .' We? 'Obviously the chairman plays an important role keeping order at the meetings.' Parry became chief executive almost by accident. He was still a consultant when he was asked to chair his first meeting. 'I didn't duck fast enough', he said. The clubs were going to decide whether or not to leave the League until someone pointed out that the meeting would become a shambles without a chairman. Parry's management training and Olympic committee experience came to his rescue. He took the trouble to visit all the clubs beforehand and listen to their gripes. 'You have to work on the principle that nothing goes to the general meetings for a vote unless you know it's going to win. You don't put it on the agenda if you don't have a two-thirds majority.' There was a walk-out last year over the Bass sponsorship deal. Parry blamed time pressure. 'At the last meeting the identical offer went through without having to be put to a vote. That's a mark of how things have settled,' he said. 'I've never tried to give the impression that I know the answers. What I've tried to suggest is that perhaps I know the right questions. There are plenty of people in the game who can provide the right answers. What I've done a lot of in management consulting is to be a facilitator.' A referee? 'Not quite. It's more than being a referee because you have to draw them towards common conclusions rather than simply arbitrate. Facilitator is a better word. I've had a lot of training.' Group encounter training? 'Yes. The Arthur Young training technique.' So your ability to read a balance sheet is . . . 'About 0.5 per cent of what I do. I mean the accountancy side is nothing, frankly. It's the level of Week One of accountancy training. People pick on the fact that I happened to train as an accountant as a useful label to criticise me with.' Could you ever be accepted as the real leader of the Premier League? 'It may evolve. But one of the things I'm happiest about is that in the last six months I've largely managed to avoid the headlines.' You don't want to be known as Mr Football? 'I've no pretentions or desires in that direction. I will get my satisfaction from the thing being done properly. I've no desire to be seen as the one who did it.' Parry said it so simply, it was hard not to believe him. We talked about the inflation that would follow the League's huge TV contract. Parry said clubs were being forced not only to invest in their grounds but to dissuade players from accepting the 'crazy money' offered by Italian clubs. It was a European market now. 'Over there they are only allowed to use a certain number of foreign players but they buy players, they stockpile them to corner the market. That's terrifying. 'But at the end of the day this is back to what you said earlier. It isn't just a business. It's a sport and it's a sport which is all about winning and there is only one winner every year. So you'll never stop people playing for high stakes, and investing in excessive wages and transfer fees in order to win.' So you won't turn be able to turn a bear garden into a gentleman's club? 'It's too competitive. We'd lose part of the essence of the game if we did.'</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Pound rises on rate cut doubts THE pound rose against the D-Mark and dollar as an element of doubt emerged over an early cut in UK interest rates and other currencies settled following the volatility of last week, writes Peter John. But most of yesterday's moves reflected adjustment of trading positions rather than heavy shifts of money, and economists were wary of giving them too much importance. Economic data on Friday had suggested that the UK economic recovery was still on track. This prompted coverage in the weekend press arguing that a UK rate cut was less necessary than previously thought. The comment gave an additional lift to a pound already helped by selling of the D-Mark and the dollar. The German currency was weaker in the aftermath of the Bundesbank's surprise rate reduction last Thursday. Many investors feel that the Bundesbank might have signalled a shift in monetary policy and be more prepared to ease rates again. That view was slightly jolted when the west German state of Baden-Wurttemberg announced a 0.3 per cent increase in the cost of living in the month to mid-October, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.1 per cent. Most economists had hoped for a lower figure. Nevertheless, short-term investors had built up large holdings of D-Marks during the recent speculative selling of the French and Belgian francs and the movement of those holdings is likely to take some time. By the close of European dealing, sterling was up two pfennigs at DM2.4880. The dollar saw some correction after its six-pfennig rise against the D-Mark last week and was sold down a pfennig after the release of the Baden-Wurttemburg figures. It rallied later to finish at DM1.6735, down from Friday's DM1.6750. Against the pound it dipped to Dollars 1.4860 from Dollars 1.4730. In New York the dollar advanced to close at DM1.6865. US home sales climbed in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91m, the highest level this year, but economists are waiting for Thursday's GDP figures. The data are forecast to show a rise of around 2.4 per cent in the third quarter after a 1.9 per cent increase in the second. The French franc lost some of the gains achieved after key rates were cut on Friday. The currency slipped to FFr3.50 to the D-Mark at one stage yesterday, but rallied to end at FFr3.49, against a previous FFr3.493. The Belgian currency was weaker during the day in reaction to the breakdown of talks on the government's social pact. It fell to BFr21.80 per D-Mark, but closed steady at BFr21.68. Economists said the impasse could store up trouble for the currency if it appeared that strikes were looming. The Canadian dollar fell half a cent against its US counterpart to CDollars 1.31 as the country went to the polls. Surveys have shown the Liberals holding a strong lead over the governing Conservatives.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck sinks to Dollars 3.9bn loss SEARS, Roebuck, the troubled US retail group, yesterday reported a plunge into net losses of Dollars 3.93bn for 1992 from profits of Dollars 1.3bn the year before. This is one of the biggest reversals in US corporate history and rivals International Business Machines' recently-reported record loss of Dollars 4.96bn for the year. However, the result had been expected by Wall Street, as Sears had previously disclosed it would take a Dollars 1.72bn charge for restructuring its merchandising operations and a Dollars 206.7m write-down on its Homart Development property business. Sears also took a Dollars 1.65bn after-tax charge for losses incurred by its Allstate Insurance subsidiary from catastrophe claims relating to hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. Analysts had expected a Dollars 1.25bn charge. The group also recorded a Dollars 1.87bn charge for required accounting changes, and a gain of Dollars 86.6m on the sale of minority interests in two companies. For the fourth quarter, Sears' net losses came to Dollars 1.80bn, compared with profits of Dollars 513.1m. On Wall Street, Sears stock rose Dollars  1/8 on the news, to close at Dollars 49 1/2 . Income at the group's merchandise group's sagged. Excluding unusual items, the retail operation recorded profits of Dollars 264.9m, down from Dollars 486.3m in 1991. Sears said disappointing automotive operations and low overall margins cut profits. The losses at Sears' catalogue operations deepened to Dollars 159.8m, from Dollars 144.7m. Last month, Sears announced it would streamline its merchandising operations by closing unprofitable stores, shutting its venerable but loss-making catalogue business, and eliminating about 16,000 full-time and 34,000 part-time staff. These cuts followed Sears' decision in October to spin off its Dean Witter Financial Services and Coldwell Banker property broking businesses to concentrate on retailing and insurance. Sears yesterday reported Dean Witter's and Coldwell Banker's results as discontinued operations, with a combined contribution to profits of Dollars 506.9m, up from Dollars 363.3m in 1991. Allstate Insurance reported profits of Dollars 1.17bn - excluding the impact of hurricane Andrew and the accounting charges - up from Dollars 722.5m in 1991. Allstate's life insurance profits were down, at Dollars 89.9m compared with Dollars 165.6m in 1991, but its property liability underwriting expanded profitably, to Dollars 1.01bn from Dollars 557m. Dean Witter Financial Services reported a 19.4 per cent rise in profits to Dollars 411.4m, up from Dollars 344.6m. Profits at Dean Witter's credit operations, including its Discover card, rose 21 per cent to Dollars 209.3m before extraordinary items from Dollars 173.6m. Coldwell Banker benefited from gains in home sales and increased mortgage writing, increasing profits to Dollars 75m, up from Dollars 26.4m.</p>

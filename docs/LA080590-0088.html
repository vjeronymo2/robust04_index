			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITERARY HIT MEN  </P> <P> Re book critics almost as reliable as the people who write the blurbs for film  ads:  </P> <P> Larry Ceplair's comments about Michael Herr's "Walter Winchell: A Novel" (May  27) are a model of the nit-picking critique which makes so many of us  (unfairly, perhaps) classify critics as literary "hit men" who dote on cutesy  negativism. They too often get caught up in the cleverness of their put-downs  and lose any sense of objectivity.  </P> <P> I was asked by a local bookseller to read a pre-publication copy of "Walter  Winchell" and advise her as to its worth. I read it . . . and found it  interesting and great fun: not "great literature" but certainly entertaining  reading. The unique format added to the enjoyment.  </P> <P> WALT HOPMANS  </P> <P> Director, Santa Barbara Writers' Consortium  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA  </P></p>

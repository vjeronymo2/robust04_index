			<p>BFN     [Text] The delegations of the Angolan Government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] met  alone today to discuss the issue of specific principles  governing the second round of presidential elections. There are  reports that the UNITA team has demanded that the Electoral Law  be reviewed. Alves Antonio, our correspondent in the Zambian  capital, reports:    [Begin Antonio recording] Good evening. At the Lusaka peace  talks UNITA has defended the need to review the Electoral Law.  The specific principles contained in the point on the  conclusion of the presidential elections has continued to  dominate the talks. The two teams again met alone today in a  bid to find ways and methods to overcome the stalemate. Though  the practical results of the meeting are not known yet, official  sources believe that the government and UNITA teams are about to  strike an understanding.    Meanwhile, Radio Angola learned earlier this evening that  UNITA is now pushing for a review of some chapters in the  Electoral Law. The United Nations has rejected that request.  The United Nations believes that respect must be shown for  Angolan sovereignty and for this country's democratic  institutions. In view of that, the Electoral Law review now  requested by UNITA will be entirely up to the Angolan Parliament  where, incidentally, 60 seats are reserved for UNITA. Official  sources close to the talks have said that UNITA's request has  been set aside.    Other reliable sources have told Radio Angola that this  country's Electoral Law is a perfect [as heard] document that is  superior to similar laws in many other countries. In view of  that, those sources regard the review of that document as  inopportune. They also noted that UNITA itself had helped draw  up the Electoral Law.    Meanwhile, the United Nations has already expressed an  interest in providing material and financial assistance to the  process of the second round of presidential elections. Such  assistance would include participation by observer, security,  control, and verification personnel.    There is the belief that the Lusaka peace talks may  experience new developments within the next few days. It is a  matter of waiting and seeing. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "PM Newswrap" program] </F>   [Text] The results of an internal Eskom [Electricity Supply  Commission] investigation into an aborted arms deal to kwaZulu  was revealed today, while the Goldstone Commission of inquiry  into the same deal also got under way in Johannesburg. Ferial  Haffejee reports:    [Begin recording] [Haffejee] The commissioner of police,  General Johan van der Merwe, approved the export permit  necessary to sell 1,000 rifles from Eskom to kwaZulu. This was  one of the findings of an Eskom internal investigation into the  aborted sale. The findings were released at a press conference  this afternoon. The electricity company's chief executive, Allan  Morgan:    [Morgan] This was confirmed later on by the South African  Police [SAP], that they did receive the application and that  they also issued a permit on that application on the Friday  morning, the 25th. This application was dealt with at the  highest echelons of the SAP. It was also approved at that  level. The permit was signed by a Major Le Roux on behalf of  the commissioner of police.    [Haffejee] The arms drama started when Eskom Executive Dr.  George Lindeque found two unlicensed trucks being loaded with  guns on 25 March by employee Johan van der Walt. Van der Walt  manages arms at Eskom. Lindeque investigated immediately, and  the arms deal was canceled. The internal probe has found that  Eskom procedures for weapons sales had not been followed by the  staff involved. But the company also found that no Eskom  employees knew the arms were bound for kwaZulu. Instead, Eskom  is laying the blame at the door of the three arms dealers  involved in the plan. The company claims that one of the  dealers, J. Garb and Company, repeatedly denied that the guns  were for the kwaZulu Police.    [Morgan] On the 25th, when the negotiations started with  Eskom in all seriousness, the Garb brothers were in fact in the  office of Mr. Bonthuis. Mr. Bonthuis -- and this has been  confirmed by other witnesses -- then asked them whether these  weapons will not be destined for either the far-right or for  kwaZulu Police. They did not comment on this, but indicated  that the firearms will be exported out of the country.    [Haffejee] Meanwhile, the Goldstone investigation into the  aborted sale of guns got under way this morning. The commission  heard that Philip Powell of the kwaZulu government first  approached arms dealers Gintans Security for weapons. He  claimed that the arms were for northern Natal farmers. Powell  is in charge of training kwaZulu's self-protection units.  Lawyers for the kwaZulu government told the commission that  kwaZulu was finding it difficult to procure arms. It needed  weapons for the 1,000 special constables who are currently being  recruited. KwaZulu is expecting trouble in the run-up to the  election, they said. [end recording]</p>

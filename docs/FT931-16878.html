			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Europe's compulsion to unify mystifies the Japanese EUROPEAN integration is hardly a burning issue in Japan. That is not surprising considering the country's diet of political intrigue, its gathering recession and the fact that the youngest sumo star is marrying a popular young model. Yet the last few months of currency turmoil and political confusion in Europe have brought to the surface the ambivalence in Japan's attitude towards the EC. The Japanese prefer to see the EC in purely economic terms. Japanese companies are attracted by the commercial opportunities of the single market but concerned that Europe could become an inward-looking, regional trading fortress. The more the European project veers away from economics towards grand designs for political integration the more uncomfortable the Japanese become. Japanese complain that it is often difficult to establish who has the power to make decisions within the Brussels bureaucracy and how power is distributed between Brussels and the national governments. They are mystified by the theory of pooling sovereignty and sceptical about whether the goal can be achieved given cultural differences. To the Japanese it seems that European integration rests upon the premise that ideas of nation, culture and race can be moulded by public policy. Yet for the Japanese, national consciousness is rarely debated since it is the deeply rooted foundation for much of the country's social and economic organisation. The autumn turmoil in European currency markets, combined with potential delays to the process of political integration has been met with a quiet sense of relief in Tokyo. Mr Hajime Ohta, head of international economics at Keidanren, the employers' organisation, said: 'Japanese companies' attitudes towards the single market have not been affected by events this autumn. Most manufacturing investment has been done. There is no sign of a change of strategy. People believe the single market will happen.' However, there are concerns about how the market will work. The most immediate anxiety is the outlook for growth. Mr Jack Schmuckly, president of Sony Europe, explained: 'Our approach will not change, Europe should be treated as a single market. Clearly the European monetary system may not hold the promise it did of paving the way for a single currency, so that may force us to reconsider some of the ways we do business. But our main concern is about the economic condition of Europe which is rapidly turning for the worse.' Most Japanese analysts believe European policy makers are facing the inevitable need to rethink the role of monetary union. A senior finance ministry adviser remarked: 'The Europeans have found out they cannot have fixed exchange rates, free capital movements and a single monetary authority all at the same time. A deceleration of monetary union is probably no bad thing.' Even if integration proceeds, many Japanese companies believe their approach to Europe will be heavily influenced by remaining differences between national economies. Mr Hisao Kobayashi, in charge of international operations at DKB, one of Japan's largest banks, said: 'We are still considering how best to organise ourselves within the single market. We may be headquartered in Luxembourg, Frankfurt may be the most powerful financial market but London will be the most profitable to do our business in.' Economic questions are manageable for Japan. Political complexities of dealing with the EC, less so. The Hague declaration last year was meant to underpin the relationship between Japan and the EC based on the democratic principles they share. According to Mr Toshio Tanaka, professor of European studies at Tokyo's Kieo University, the declaration is largely hollow. He said: 'No one knows how to use it. Meetings between Japanese and EC ministers are always on the fringes of other international gatherings, they have no substance of their own.' That stands in stark contrast to the intensity of Japan's relationship with the US. Indeed the EC's importance to Japan in part depends upon the US approach to Europe. Japanese politicians took quiet pleasure as bystanders watching the agricultural trade friction this autumn between the US and the EC. The converse is also true: any sign that the EC is forming a more co-operative closer relationship with the US creates concern in Tokyo that Japan may face a western alliance. Mr Tanaka said: 'Two against one - that is what we fear.' The other relationship which could be increasingly exposed by European integration is Japan's complex attitude towards Germany. Mr Kazuo Chiba, former envoy to Britain and now at Mitsui, the trading company, explained: 'We have strong historic relationships with Britain, politically and economically, and France, through its cultural influence upon Japan. 'But there is an unease about Germany. There is an aura about German strength but also a worry about what Germany will do with its power.'</p>

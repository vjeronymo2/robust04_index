			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL HEADQUARTERS WORKERS MAD, GLOOMY;  </P> <P> SECURITIES: AS ONE EMPLOYEE PUT IT, 'THERE ARE A LOT OF LONG FACES UP THERE, A  LOT OF NERVOUS PEOPLE.'  </P> <P> The mood was glum and even angry Tuesday at the New York headquarters of the  investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, as workers prepared resumes and  waited for their employer to file for bankruptcy protection.  </P> <P> "It looks like it's over for us," said one of Drexel's 5,300 employees. "We  were told yesterday (Monday): 'Look for a job.' "  </P> <P> The brokerage firm, which virtually invented the junk bond market, said Tuesday  morning that a cash shortage affecting its holding company, Drexel Burnham  Lambert Group, had resulted in defaults on about $100 million in loans.  </P> <P> Drexel's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., announced late Tuesday that  it would seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal  bankruptcy code. On Monday, Drexel put itself up for sale in an effort to avoid  a financial collapse.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of long faces up there, a lot of nervous people," said Drexel  worker Brian Lynskey. "A lot of people are getting their resumes together --  just in case."  </P> <P> "The death knell has sounded for the large, unmanageable, unwieldly  multiservice investment banking firms," said Steven Seiden of Seiden  Associates, an executive search firm. He said he expects to see the emergence  of more small investment banking partnerships of 20 to 30 people.  </P> <P> "I hope I find a new job," said one Drexel equities analyst. "As far as I can  tell, Drexel is on its way out of business, and this is a tough market to find  work in. I assume most of us will be out of work a long time."  </P> <P> Disappointment and anger also were evident.  </P> <P> "A lot of people stayed with the firm through thick and thin," said one former  Drexel official. "They were extremely loyal and their management never came  clean. Now they're going to get screwed. It's like the old saying, 'If you want  a friend on Wall Street, buy yourself a dog.' "  </P> <P> Police officers prevented unauthorized entry to Drexel's headquarters at 60  Broad St., and most people leaving the building in the Wall Street financial  district deflected questions fired from a phalanx of reporters and television  cameramen lining the sidewalk.  </P> <P> While several brokerage house officials declined to comment on Drexel's woes,  some lower-echelon Wall Streeters offered little sympathy.  </P> <P> "Drexel didn't make any friends on the way up, so there aren't too many tears  on the way down," said one trader. "They were such an arrogant firm. They did  their own thing and they made their own money. They just took care of their own  and didn't let anybody into their deals."  </P></p>

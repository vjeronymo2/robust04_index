			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Construction stocks weaken in Frankfurt BOURSES were mostly uncertain yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose overall, the DAX index closing 5.32 higher at 1,625.21, but sentiment was susceptible to bearish news at the level of sectors and individual companies. Turnover rose from DM3.5bn to DM3.7bn. Construction stocks weakened following Tuesday's bearish note on the sector from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Bilfinger &amp; Berger dropping DM9 to DM945, Hochtief DM19 to DM1,090, and Philipp Holzmann by DM15 to DM960 after setting its rights issue price at DM650 a share a day earlier. Mannesmann, which fell on Tuesday after a slide in 1992 earnings and a dividend cut, lost another DM3.20 to DM247.80 as news focused on the forecast of a loss for the first half of the current year. The day's exception was the trading, metals and engineering group Metallgesellschaft, which announced a 39 per cent drop in first half profits but gained DM10.50 to DM302.50 because, said brokers, expectations had been even worse. MILAN was unnerved by the discovery of a car bomb near the parliament building which came soon after the arrest of another Mafia leader. Some analysts commented that although this bomb had been defused, the fact that it had been planted, in spite of increased security following last week's explosion in Florence, could deter the inflow of foreign investment. The Comit index lost 3.41 to 541.80. The market was also depressed overall by a 6 per cent fall in Fiat, down L350 to L5,590 on the kerb, having fixed at L5,810. There were rumours that some Fiat shareholders, including US investment funds, might be considering legally contesting the group's annual accounts. Support for the market came from Stet and Montedison, which saw respective gains of L60 and L32 to L3,250 and L1,182. However, on the kerb both retreated to L3,185 and L1,157. PARIS moved in a narrow range with activity reported to have been moderate throughout the session. The CAC-40 index slipped 3.04 to 1,875.84, after a day's high of 1,881 and a low of 1,863. Turnover was estimated at a low FFr1.9bn. Peugeot slipped just FFr1 to FFr530 on provisional reports of a 24 per cent fall in sales in May and forecasts of a 13 per cent fall in new car sales in France this year. Total advanced FFr1.70 to FFr266.30 after the group forecast steady first half operating profit. Bouygues was another strong performer, up FFr8 at FFr678, as the group said that it was confident about the outlook and announced the award of a FFr500m contract in Hong Kong. Elf Sanofi put on FFr12 to FFr924 as investors continued to react to Tuesday's news that it was to co-operate with two US groups in the development of new drugs. ZURICH ended mixed to slightly higher, the SMI index rising 6.0 to 2,258.9 in thin volume. BBC Brown Boveri, which placed 126,147 bearer shares on the bourse at just below market price, fell SFr12 to SFr818 although analysts said that the dilutive effect of the new shares was minimal. BRUSSELS saw falls in senior blue chips as the Bel-20 index fell 10.13 to 1,182.66. Societe Generale de Belgique lost BFr65 to BFr2,105 and Petrofina BFr170 to BFr8,000 as the bourse reacted to bearish economic news. STOCKHOLM was pressured by a decline in the forestry sector, partly as a result of the weaker dollar. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 13.6 or 1.3 per cent to 1,068.9 in turnover up to SKr957m from SKr752m. Stora, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, dropped SKr15 to SKr314 in the A's and SKr8 to SKr321 in the B's. HELSINKI fell sharply on profit-taking for the second successive day, the Hex index losing 31.9, or 2.7 per cent to 1,155.0, 9 per cent down from its May 21 peak. OSLO fell on the weaker dollar and higher money market rates, the all-share index losing 4.35 to 470.11. TEL AVIV fell again, the Mishtanim blue chip index losing 3.14 to 200.19 on sales by speculators and small portfolio managers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 2                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1156.30    1154.68    1153.04    1153.20 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1220.25    1217.27    1215.45    1215.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1153.60    1153.91    1154.86    1155.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1215.87    1215.68    1214.25    1215.58  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        June 1    May 28    May 27    May 26    May 25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1153.22   1161.58   1165.01   1162.51   1164.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.43   1224.85   1231.31   1226.76   1224.18  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1156.30; 200 - 1220.25 Low/day: 100 - 1152.23  200 - 1212.91.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 5 (ATA) -- Some 13 witnesses testified  yesterday in the trial against the ten former high communist  functionaries. Witness Qazim Zelko, former secret police  employee in the Sarande Secret Police sentenced in 1994 for  abuse of office, testified on the kinds of operation ways by the  secret police, especially in controlling the correspondence.  Asked by prosecutor Fana if they used to control only the  correspondence of the persons against whom had already  investigations, witness Qazim Zelko said the former secret  police controlled even before the penal case had started.  Witness Sirjan Caci, former Army officer in the border, former  instructor in the Spaci camp, and former commissar in the  educating camp in Sarande, testified also on the control of the  correspondence.    Witness Mihallaq Ziqishti testified on the initiators of the  anti-religion campaign. Zeqishti, former functionary of the  Ministry of Interior Affairs and first secretary of the former  Communist Party in Korce and Durres, has been condemned by death  sentence during the Second World War and charged with anti-  revolutionary activity and sentenced with 25 years imprisonment  together with the group of Mehmet Shehu, former communist prime  minister accused of espionage activity. Witness Ziqishti said  that "Rita Marko could take this initiative (anti-religion one)  even without approval of the `most important.'" The witness  also said that Enver Hoxha had ordered to open a museum in which  they would keep all the icons and religious relics. The  initiative was of the party, Ziqishti said, and the party was a  state one.    Agron Tafa, former interior minister during the 1975-1984  period, testified on the revolt of the Qafa e Barit camp. Asked  by prosecutor Fana if there were special police forces for  pressing the revolts, Tafa said "yes," but he added that those  forces were in the competence of Deputy Interior Minister  Zylyftar Ramizi.    Ded Miri, former political prisoner in the Qafa e Barit  camp,  testified on the incident in this camp, the circumstances and  the conditions which brought about the revolt, and the  consequences of the intervention of the special police forces.  On behalf of those who suffered in the prisons, he said, the  persons who committed the crime should be punished. "We do not  seek to take revenge but we ask for justice," witness Miri said.    Witness Ismail Skeja, former director for the borders in the  Interior Ministry, said the most difficult period for the  borders have been the first seven months of the 1990.    For health reasons, defendants Manush Myftiu and Adil  Carcani  were not present at yesterday's seance. Their defence was made  by their attorneys. The next seance resumes today at 1200.</p>

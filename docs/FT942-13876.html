			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Liberty enfranchisement of non-voting shares to proceed Liberty, the retailing and fabric group, is fulfilling its promise to enfranchise its non-voting shares following a long campaign by dissident investor Mr Brian Myerson. The move will reduce the votes controlled by the founding families from just over 50 per cent to about 40 per cent. Mr Patrick Austen, who joined as chief executive from BTR a year ago, described enfranchisement as 'a really ticklish problem'. Six months ago the company said that it had decided in principle to make the change but that trading conditions were then too difficult. The group is proposing to compensate the voting shares, which account for 70 per cent of the total, with a 1-for-2 scrip issue, which would increase the cost of a maintained dividend by 25 per cent. Following an upturn in its retailing business, Mr Austen said the group could now commit itself to holding the dividend on the enlarged equity this year though he added 'it is too early to say the extent to which it will be covered' by earnings. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 3.2m in 1993, with earnings per share slipping from 9.05p to 8.02p. The dividend, however, is maintained at 7.2p through a final of 5.35p. Turnover edged up to Pounds 82.9m (Pounds 82.4m) but stocks were cut by Pounds 2m to Pounds 16.5m. However, the figures disguised a strong recovery in the retailing operation and signs of improved demand in some of its overseas markets. Mr Austen said the current period will also see the full benefits of last year's initiatives, including the opening of its Heathrow outlet. Launched just before Christmas this was soon outselling all the group's other branches in the UK. Retailing profits recovered to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 331,000) on turnover of Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 54.8m), led by strong growth in fashion. But all overseas operations struggled, with sales in France, Japan and North America sharply down. US losses mounted to Pounds 248,000 (Pounds 68,000) and Mr Austen admitted the group's one store in Manhattan 'just doesn't work'. Liberty is to launch a new range of branded products which Mr Austen said represented 'the area of greatest long-term potential' for the group.</p>

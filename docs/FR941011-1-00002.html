The previous list of exempt systems published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 54 FR 39517, September 27, 1989, was omitted inadvertently from 7 CFR 1.22. The list of exempt systems contained in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  notice at 54 FR 39517 is proposed to be amended by this notice. In addition, this proposed rule would amend 7 CFR 1.123 by changing the list of Office of Inspector General (OIG) systems of records covered under those sections to reflect changes in the names of two of the systems of records, to add a third system which is being split-off from one of the other systems, and to include the investigative records portion of a fourth system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed amendments are being made in conjunction with the notice of proposed amendments to the USA/OIG systems of records which is published elsewhere in today's issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be submitted on or before December 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons may submit comments to Paula F.

Hayes, Assistant Inspector General for Policy Development and Resources Management, Office of Inspector General, USDA, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;2310 (202&hyph;720&hyph;6979). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> For the system listed as USDA/OIG&hyph;2, ``Intelligence Records,'' OIG proposes to change the name to ``Informant and Undercover Agent Records'' which represents a more descriptive title for the records contained in the system. For the system listed as USDA/OIG&hyph;3, ``Investigative Files and Subject/Title Index,'' OIG proposes to change the name to ``Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System'' to reflect computerization of part of the system. OIG also proposes to add systems USDA/OIG&hyph;4, ``OIG Hotline Complaint Records,'' and USDA/OIG&hyph;5, ``Consolidated Assignments, Personnel Tracking, and Administrative Information Network (CAPTAIN),'' to the exemption lists in 7 CFR 1.122 and 1.123. It is proposed that the hotline records no longer be considered part of the ``Investigative Files'' system (USDA/OIG&hyph;3), but be set up as a separate system of records because the heavy volume of activity in this area necessitates a separate control. It is also proposed that the investigative records portion of system USDA/OIG&hyph;5, which is a computerized data base system, be considered exempt similar to other investigative records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These amendments are not considered substantive because the basic OIG records covered by the exemptions in 7 CFR 1.122 and 1.123 remain the same as before. The justifications for these exemptions were published with the proposed rule at 54 FR 11204, March 17, 1989, and were further explained when the final rule was published at 54 FR 39517, September 27, 1989. Although two new systems of records are proposed to be added to the exemption lists, the exemptions for those records are not new because the records were previously considered exempted as part of the ``Investigative Files'' system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1 and Executive Order No. 12866 and has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, it has been determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Privacy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

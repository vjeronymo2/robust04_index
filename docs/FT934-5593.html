			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (12): Finding out where Welsh water flows - Utility application / For Dwr Cymru, Welsh Water, the geographical information system is at the centre of its efforts to document its assets Underground pipes and overground cables pose some of the thorniest problems when taking stock of assets. Dwr Cymru, Welsh Water, is the water and sewerage authority for Wales, and like many utilities, is taking a long-term view of its assets and investments, writes Claire Gooding. Welsh Water's Integrated Business Information System (Ibis) is part of its Pounds 1.9bn investment programme, a set of integrated applications which will provide a complete record of every aspect of Welsh Water's operations. 'The first thing was, that as a company, we needed a good asset base,' explains Peter Lindsay, network asset manager. 'We had a multitude of systems holding data of various states of quality and completeness, scattered over the 21,000 sq km in which we operate. 'We realised we needed manageable systems, and, by the regulations which brought about privatisation in 1989, we are required to keep accurate records of underground assets.' Consultants Coopers and Lybrand assisted in the search for a geographical product, which started in 1989. It included test runs and bench marks of products from SIA, IBM, and Intergraph. But it was Intergraph that impressed Welsh Water most when it came to meeting the long-term objectives, and its 'co-operative attitude' secured a contract worth about Pounds 3.5m on software, hardware and services. The negotiations for new water contracts were the driver for early completion. 'We accelerated the seven-year programme to a two-year programme to be able to capitalise on the benefits of sound, reliable data on our underground assets,' says Mr Lindsay. The Assets Information System built using the Intergraph system went live in April. The largest of the 24 IBIS modules, it is a database which contains all the maps and precise graphic, locational and descriptive details of all under and above-ground assets. It is integrated with the business reporting systems such as customer accounts, leakage reports and electricity usage. 'The next step is to get operational benefits, support services, efficient record keeping, and to be able to access all data on surveys. On-line real-time information could be valuable for such things as tracing burst water mains,' says Lindsay. He is now looking at expanding the use of the system into other departments, such as estates, legal, and planning. The aim is to populate the database with OPCS census data, and with geographical information for a 'land terrier' (asset register) and estates system, showing boundaries such as ancient monuments - 'there is company-wide enthusiasm, and groups of users steering its development,' he says.</p>

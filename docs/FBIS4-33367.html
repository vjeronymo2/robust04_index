			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Canon and Fernando Ramos from the "Midday </F> Television Newscast"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and Defense Minister  Rafael Pardo announced a big offensive abroad to counter  Colombia's bad human rights image. Colombia will open its doors  to all organizations that oversee human rights and display all  acts of violence, facing up to reality without issuing  unilateral, incomplete, or generalized information. The  strategy, according to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio, is  the defense and promotion of a search to end impunity.    [Begin recording] [Sanin] We admit there are human rights  problems in Colombia. What we cannot accept is the assertion by  London's Amnesty International that the Colombian Government is  involved in these violations. We encourage and defend human  rights as a government. We do not accept the generalization  made on violations of human rights by the Armed Forces either.    [Pardo] This should also be seen in the context of  Colombia's  crime and violence. It is not the same to have human rights  violated in a perfect state, a state where everything is  absolutely controlled, and where justice works like clockwork,  rather than a state where there are constant reforms, a state  that is developing new mechanisms and has overcome huge problems  in its integration and judicial system. [end recording]    In today's meeting with the Colombian ambassadors to the  European Union, the defense minister broached the topic of  police reforms, which is one of the bases for the resolve to  change. To reaffirm this will to change, the government would  be willing to invite an Amnesty International commission to  verify the situation on site.    All these arguments have become even more heated with the  report by the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  released a few days ago. Colombia does not get high marks from  this report either. This document adds to Amnesty  International's report and is what has the argument running red  hot regarding the country's situation and reality.    [Begin OAS representative Raul Valladares recording] Due to  the complexity of the Colombian situation, even greater efforts  are called for, and this is basically what the report calls for.  [end recording]    The argument is based on whether the human rights studies in  Colombia are objective. For the Colombian Government, the lack  of credibility of human rights reports, such as Amnesty  International's, lies in the source of the data. The president,  however, is not clear either on what investigative methodology  is used.    [Begin presidential human rights adviser Carlos de Roux  recording] The problem, nevertheless, is that one cannot say  that most political homicides in Colombia are committed by  public force members or criminal public force members. The  public force is not responsible for most of these murders, and  this is where Amnesty International's report is not truthful.  [end recording]    A summit meeting will be held this afternoon between  representatives of human rights organizations and the government  to discuss criteria and face up to the problem. Human Rights  Ombudsman Jaime Cordoba Trivino said that, although the human  rights violations reports are exaggerated, the truth is that  Colombia is also responsible. He added fuel to the argument by  saying that Colombia is treating the matter mildly.    [Begin Cordoba recording] Human rights in Colombia is far  more than a problem of international image. More than the  solicitous actions of our ambassadors to the EC and the United  States, what is really required is urgent government action,  which should be fully committed to the Constitution and fully  open and which should set out from the unquestionable basis of  admitting that the truth of the matter is that it is very  serious. [end recording]    Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper believes that an  intermediate position should be sought in order to neutralize  the serious economic effects that this argument could have at  the international level.    [Begin Samper recording] Colombia should not attempt to hide  the fact that human rights are violated. When these are proved  we should accept this responsibility, but likewise, we expect  international organizations to accept that Colombia is making  efforts to control human rights violations.

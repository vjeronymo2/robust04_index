			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour and City capitalise on compromise - The constructive dialogue taking place between old adversaries LABOUR'S spokeswoman on the Square Mile, Ms Marjorie 'Mo' Mowlam, claims: 'Up until now there has been a natural antagonism between the City and Labour. That has now passed. 'As the European single market develops, Labour is now seen as user-friendly  -our aim is to make the City user-friendly to the consumer throughout Europe.' If Ms Mowlam's upbeat reading of her party's relationship with the City owes a little to wishful thinking, the fact that it publicly wishes to be user-friendly to the manipulators of capital is evidence of how much the party has changed. Few dispute a sea-change in Labour's approach to its old enemy, nor its desirability. With the single European market looming, Ms Mowlam and her colleagues are aware that, in government, they will bear responsibility for championing the interests of British financial services. In consequence, both sides have replaced the old confrontational rhetoric and insult swapping for something approaching a constructive dialogue. No discussion of Labour's plans for regulating the self-regulators or tackling insider dealing is now complete without Ms Mowlam volunteering unsolicited praise for Sir David Walker at the Securities and Investment Board or Mr Peter Rawlins of the Stock Exchange. Both institutions are deemed to be 'moving in the right direction'. Elsewhere, Labour now puts heavy emphasis on a two-way street of consultation before legislation with the accent on the need for flexibility, simplicity and transparency. This applies to the City's dealings with its clients and, indeed, to a Labour government's approach to the financial services industry. Above all, Labour's message is that its intentions to improve consumer protection and counter City fraud dovetail with everyone's objective of ensuring London stays the EC's financial services capital. 'We have got to think strategically about what we want in Europe,' Ms Mowlam says. 'At the moment we are in the lead, but, without strategic thinking, in five or 10 years time Frankfurt will be snapping at our heels.' One consequence of such an exercise is to recognise the small 'c' conservatism of European consumers and act accordingly. Labour insists that it supports the goal of wider share ownership. But on City regulation, takeovers and SIB, it is determined to act. Most vigorously, it argues that the 1986 Financial Services Act must be reformed. The profusion of regulatory bodies - the Stock Exchange, the Department of Trade and Industry and the self-regulating organisations (SROs) - confuses Britons and foreigners alike and must be simplified. Turning SIB into an 'executive agency' accountable to the trade and industry secretary would allow SIB to absorb many of the DTI's investigative powers, Ms Mowlam says. The insider dealing team based at the stock exchange would be relocated at SIB. In turn, the reformed SIB would also have responsibility for a product monitoring group to ensure financial products meet their marketing claims. It would enforce a greater degree of disclosure - of agents' commissions or tie-ins between insurers and banks, for example - at point of sale. Tighter investor protection such as legislative powers to oversee company prospectuses and share issues are also under consideration. Labour would agree that the new functions taken over from the DTI should be funded by central government. The heavy costs of fraud investigations and investor compensation for victims would be born, where feasible, by guilty parties. But already hard-pressed SRO affiliates will continue to cover the financing of existing responsibilities. Those financial pressures would only hasten Ms Mowlam's other goal of slimming down the present four SROs to two - one for wholesale and one for retail services. If they did not, SIB could simply 'unrecognise' its errant offspring. This, together with simplified rules and, possibly, graduated protection requirements distinguishing between the small investor and institutions would reduce costs, Labour believes. The new SIB would appoint a chief executive from outside the civil service and maintain its own salary structure. Government would outline policy, determine tasks and establish an advisory board. 'I want a degree of efficiency and accountability that is missing now,' Ms Mowlam says. Ms Mowlam claims that the so-called Tebbit Doctrine - that competition issues alone are the only basis to halt a takeover - has already died at the hands of Mr Peter Lilley, the present secretary of state at the DTI. But she would go much further, giving the Takeover Panel statutory backing, requiring the Office of Fair Trading to make a 'public interest' recommendation and creating rights of consultation and information for employees. Criteria to be examined would cover everything from the effect on employment, the local region, research and development and even the balance of payments. The stake level at which bids would be required is likely to drop from the current 29.9 per cent to as little as 15 per cent. Formal notification to the OFT would be necessary before bids go ahead. Ms Mowlam justifies the changes as essential to level the playing field for British companies, historically equity financed, with the complex security that cross-shareholdings and bank support make prevalent among companies on the Continent. Industry is 'pig sick' of its vulnerability to predators, she says. 'I am not opposed to takeovers, but I want them to be for the right not the wrong reasons.' Nonetheless, she goes on to insist that the Takeover Panel will be given a high degree of flexibility. 'I accept the argument that it is not in anybody's interest to create litigation battles,' she adds. With the threat of European takeovers in mind, Ms Mowlam says Labour will review the 40 per cent limit on building societies' borrowings from the wholesale markets, which could make them vulnerable to continental predators. Taken together, Labour believes these measures combine a recognition of the realities of the coming single European market. By bolstering industry's defences and spring-cleaning the City's less salubrious corners, it claims it can protect British interests and better champion them abroad. In the meantime, Ms Mowlam is caustic about inflexibility in the Tories' handling of the EC's investment services directive - now under negotiation - and its 'do nothing' response to the local government 'swaps' cases and their damaging effect on the attitude towards London of foreign banks. With Europe the 'headline issue' in the City, the Conservatives approach to Brussels is to attempt to dictate their terms. Labour, she insists, will negotiate. If Labour wins the coming general election, the City can only hope that this spirit of constructive compromise will be as equally generously dispensed at home as it will be abroad.</p>

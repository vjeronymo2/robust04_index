			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hugo Pedersen report: "First Oil Find in Barents Sea"] </F>   [Excerpt] Statoil has made a small oil find in the Barents  Sea. It is the first time that such a find has been made in the  area.    The oil was found northeast of the North Cape only 40 km  from  land, in completely new geological formations. Next week  Statoil will test the find to see whether oil production is  possible.    According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, the field contains  only 4 to 5 million tonnes of oil. However, development in the  Barents Sea needs a field containing 50 to 500 million tonnes of  oil. But the fact that for the first time oil that can be  exploited has been found in the region is very positive for the  Barents Sea's future.    "The drilling rig, Ross Rig, has found oil in block 7128/4  off the coast of Finnmark and we will now test this find to find  out whether it is profitable. If the oil can be exploited, we  are talking about a relatively small find," Statoil information  chief Wenche Skorge said.    "The most interesting thing is that the find is the first in  the region, and the first that has been made using this search  model. The presence of hydrocarbons has been demonstrated in a  stratum of porous flint which is around 250 million years old.  This is approximately 100 years [as published] older than rocks  of the the Jurassic period in which oil has generally been found  on Norway's continental shelf," she said. The oil find has been  made in a well which will be drilled to a depth of 2,500 meters.    Oil Directorate information chief Jan Hagland confirmed to  AFTENPOSTEN that traces of oil have been found, but that it is  thought to be marginal find.    The find was made at the last minute, and in the very last  drilling operation on this part of the Norwegian continental  shelf. Most oil companies have abandoned their expensive  exploratory operations in the Barents Sea, after decades of  drilling without result. A total of over 50 exploratory wells  have been drilled in the region, and hitherto only gas has been  found. The Statoil find could therefore have major  repercussions, particularly since the authorities are now in the  process of completely changing the rules for drilling in the  Barents Sea.    "If there does turn out to be oil in the find, it comes at  the absolutely right time. It tells us that we should not  abandon the Barents Sea. There is still a lot of work to do in  the region -- for example, several new exploration models must  be tested," he said. Hagland stressed that this, together with  the signals contained in the new Oil Report, could trigger great  optimism about the Barents Sea, although we should continue to  be prepared for disappointments. The Barents Sea is a very  complicated area in which to search for oil. [passage omitted]</p>

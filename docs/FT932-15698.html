			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Breweries deal hinted SPECULATION that Bass and Allied-Lyons are discussing a merger of their off-licence businesses added spice to a quiet drinks sector. Allied owns Victoria Wine, which has 960 outlets, and Bass the Augustus Barnett chain of 583 shops. Together they would have a turnover of around Pounds 120m, according to analysts. However, Allied said on Thursday that although it was interested in the Bass business and preliminary talks had taken place, there were no other imminent developments. Analysts said that while the move would make commercial sense, the arithmetic could be against a deal being struck. Bass was said to have put Augustus Barnett in play 18 months ago with an asking price of around Pounds 60m. However, drinks specialists said a more realistic price might be nearer Pounds 45m. Whether Allied buys or merges with Augustus Barnett, it would create a business to rival Whitbread's Thresher that has more than 1,600 outlets. Barnett is thought to break even, while Victoria Wine is said to be only marginally profitable. Both have been under growing pressure from the expansion of the take-home trade at supermarkets. Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said such a move would make 'commercial sense' and both companies would benefit from the economies of scale and continuing supply of their own products. Bass slipped a penny to 547p and Allied-Lyons 6 to 552p, while Whitbread gained a penny at 457p.</p>
